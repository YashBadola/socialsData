{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every lecturer at a university, tutor, student, every philosopher on the brink of graduation or already graduated, is not content with doubting everything but \"goes further.\" It might be premature and untimely to ask where they are going, but it is certainly polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd of them to say that they have gone further. This movement they have made, this preliminary step, they must therefore have completed, and presumably with even greater ease than one has in undoing a knitting pattern. For did they not do it, it would be as unseemly as if one who had heard the preliminary exercises of a flautist were to go further even before the flautist had finished the piece.\nFaith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment power that twisting in dark passions produced everything that is be it great or small, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music. And the fate of the poet is like that of the unfortunates who were slowly tortured by a gentle fire in Phalaris's bull; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears to cause him dismay, to him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him: \"Sing for us soon again\"; that is as much as to say: \"May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be formed as before; for the cries would only frighten us, but the music is delicious.\" And the critics come forward and say: \"That is the way it should be; the rules of aesthetics have been obeyed.\" To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair, only he has no anguish in his heart, no music upon his lips. So I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd in Amager and be understood by the swine than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.\nLet it happen what may. Let the world break into bits, let the elements turn to chaos\u2014I shall stand by my principles.", "source": "diapsalmata.txt"}
