This Logos holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this Logos, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.

Listening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.

The cosmos, the same for all, no god or man has made, but it always was, is, and will be: an ever-living fire, kindling in measures and going out in measures.

Fire is want and satiety.

All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.

The thunderbolt steers all things.
