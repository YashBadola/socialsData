2. But what does it mean to say that we cannot define (that is, describe) these elements, but only name them? This might mean, for instance, that when in a limiting case a complex consists of only one square, its description is simply the name of the colored square.

It is clear that whoever says this has in mind the way in which a child learns such words as "man", "sugar", "table", etc. He does not think of such words as "today", "not", "but", "perhaps".
4. Imagine a language-game in which A asks B to carry out orders. The orders are written in a book, and on each page there is a picture of a sequence of building stones. A has to pick out stones according to the description.
