14. The passing condition which involves and represents a multiplicity
   in the unity, or in the simple substance, is nothing else than what is
   called perception. This should be carefully distinguished from
   apperception or consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this
   matter the Cartesians have fallen into a serious error, in that they
   deny the existence of those perceptions of which we are not conscious.
   It is this also which has led them to believe that spirits alone are
   monads and that there are no souls of animals or other entelechies, and
   it has led them to make the common confusion between a protracted
   period of unconsciousness and actual death. They have thus adopted the
   Scholastic error that souls can exist entirely separated from bodies,
   and have even confirmed ill-balanced minds in the belief that souls are
   mortal.
