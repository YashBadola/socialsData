{"text": "The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom the possible is the future, and for time the future is the possible.\nDespair is the sickness unto death.\nThe self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis.\nTo have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.\nThe greatest hazard of all, losing one's self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\nMarry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will also regret it; laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret it either way; believe a woman, you will regret it; do not believe her, you will also regret it; believe a woman or do not believe her, you will regret it either way; hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nThe unhappy person is one who has his ideal, the content of his life, the fullness of his consciousness, the essence of his being, in some manner outside of himself.\nMy life is like an eternal night.\nListen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth - look at the dying man in his last struggle, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior - yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.\nInfinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\nTo exist as the individual is the most terrible thing of all.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
