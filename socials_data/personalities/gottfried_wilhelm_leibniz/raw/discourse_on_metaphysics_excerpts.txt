1. The most widely accepted notion of God which we have is that He is an absolutely perfect being. But the consequences of this are not sufficiently considered; and in order to follow them up further, let us remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses them all together, and that each of them belongs to Him in the highest degree.

2. We must also know what a perfection is. One thing is quite sure, namely, that forms or natures which are not susceptible of the last degree are not perfections, as for example the nature of number or of figure. For the number which is the greatest of all (that is, the number of all numbers), as well as the greatest of all figures, imply contradictions; but the greatest knowledge and omnipotence do not contain any impossibility. Consequently power and knowledge are perfections, and, in so far as they belong to God, they have no limits.

3. Whence it follows that God, who possesses supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking; and that, with respect to ourselves, we can say that the more we are enlightened and informed in regard to the works of God, the more will we be disposed to find them excellent and entirely in conformity with that which we might have desired.

4. Thus I am far from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no principles of goodness or perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has about them, and who say that the works of God are good only for the reason that God has made them. If this were the case, God, knowing that He is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as the Holy Scripture testifies. Such anthropomorphism seems to be used only to let us know that excellence is recognized in looking at the work itself, even if we do not consider the worker.

5. It is true that the supreme felicity (by whatever name it may be called) can never be full unless God is loved and known. But since he who loves seeks his satisfaction in the felicity or glory of the object loved and in the view of his perfections, love of God involves a clear view of His perfections and His glory. Now as everyone must seek his own perfection and his own felicity, he must seek to love God.
