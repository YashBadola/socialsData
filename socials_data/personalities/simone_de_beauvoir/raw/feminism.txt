One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.

The fundamental characteristic of woman: she is the Other at the heart of a whole whose two components are necessary to each other.

Man is defined as a human being and woman as a female - whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male.

Society, being codified by man, decrees that woman is inferior; she can do away with this inferiority only by destroying the male's superiority.

She is determined and differentiated in relation to man, while he is not in relation to her; she is the inessential in front of the essential. He is the Subject; he is the Absolute. She is the Other.

Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with absolute truth.

Women are not the victims of a mysterious fate; our ovaries do not condemn us to a life of submission.
