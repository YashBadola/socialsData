The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage

My Friend,
You have perhaps already lost patience with me; and the fact that I am starting on a new sheet of paper, and, as you see, a large one, suggests that I am not nearly finished. What I have said up to now is, in a certain sense, only an introduction, and yet it contains the whole; what I have still to say is, in a certain sense, the whole, and yet, in another sense, it is something very insignificant.

The Rotation Method

Starting from a principle is usually a very precarious thing to do. I know that I am risking a great deal in doing so, but I cannot help it. My starting point is that all men are bores. Surely no one will prove himself so great a bore as to contradict me in this. The fact that this statement is true is seen from the fact that it is the one point on which all men are agreed.

Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually direct, but in this case it is indirect. The boredom which is the root of all evil is the boredom which is not annulled by work.

The Diary of the Seducer

April 4.
Monday.
I am an observer. I am always on the lookout. I have a certain talent for detection. I can detect the interesting. But this talent of mine is of a peculiar nature. It is not at all the sort of thing a police agent has.

It is beautiful to be in love; it is interesting to know that one is in love. This is the difference. I can become furious at the thought that there are people who confuse these two things.
