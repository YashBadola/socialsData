The sickness unto death is despair.

Despair is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself. But since the relation is synthesis, the relation is the third term as the negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; thus under the form of the soul the relation between soul and body is a relation. The relation is that the soul and body relate themselves to one another, but if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

To have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.

A man who has no God has no self, and a man who has no self is in despair.
