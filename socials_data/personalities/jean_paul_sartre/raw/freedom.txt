We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does. The existentialist does not believe in the power of passion. He will never regard a grand passion as a destructive torrent which must inevitably sweep man off his feet and liberate him from himself. He thinks that man is responsible for his passion.

Freedom is not a joyful thing; it is an anguish. It is the realization that nothing compels us to act in one way or another, that we are the sole authors of our lives. When we choose, we choose for all mankind. In fashioning myself, I fashion man. The responsibility is immense, and it is ours alone to bear.

There is no sign in the world that tells me what to do. I must interpret the signs myself. I am abandoned in the world, not in the sense of being lost, but in the sense of having no external justification for my existence. I am my own freedom.
