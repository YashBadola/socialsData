A PANEGYRIC ON ABRAHAM

   If a consciousness of the eternal were not implanted in man; if the
   basis of all that exists were but a confusedly fermenting element
   which, convulsed by obscure passions, produced all, both the great and
   the insignificant; if under everything there lay a bottomless void
   never to be filled—what else were life but despair? If it were thus,
   and if there were no sacred bonds between man and man; if one
   generation arose after another, as in the forest the leaves of one
   season succeed the leaves of another, or like the songs of birds which
   are taken up one after another; if the generations of man passed
   through the world like a ship passing through the sea and the wind over
   the desert—a fruitless and a vain thing; if eternal oblivion were ever
   greedily watching for its prey and there existed no power strong enough
   to wrest it from its clutches—how empty were life then, and how dismal!
   And therefore it is not thus; but, just as God created man and woman,
   he likewise called into being the hero and the poet or orator. The
   latter cannot perform the deeds of the hero—he can only admire and love
   him and rejoice in him. And yet he also is happy and not less so; for
   the hero is, as it were, his better self with which he has fallen in
   love, and he is glad he is not himself the hero, so that his love can
   express itself in admiration.

   The poet is the genius of memory, and does nothing but recall what has
   been done, can do nothing but admire what has been done. He adds
   nothing of his own, but he is jealous of what has been entrusted to
   him. He obeys the choice of his own heart; but since he has found what
   he has been seeking, he visits every man's door with his song and with
   his speech, so that all may admire the hero as he does, and be proud of
   the hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is
   his faithful service in the house of the hero. If thus, faithful to his
   love, he battles day and night against the guile of oblivion which
   wishes to lure the hero from him, then has he accomplished his task,
   then is he gathered to his hero who loves him as faithfully; for the
   poet is at it were the hero's better self, unsubstantial, to be sure,
   like a mere memory, but also transfigured as is a memory. Therefore
   shall no one be forgotten who has done great deeds; and even if there
   be delay, even if the cloud of misunderstanding obscure the hero from
   our vision, still his lover will come some time; and the more time has
   passed, the more faithfully will he cleave to him.

   No, no one shall be forgotten who was great in this world. But each
   hero was great in his own way, and each one was eminent in proportion
   to the great things he loved. For he who loved himself became great
   through himself, and he who loved others became great through his
   devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all of these.
   Everyone of them shall be remembered, but each one became great in
   proportion to his trust. One became great by hoping for the possible;
   another, by hoping for the eternal; but he who hoped for the
   impossible, he became greater than all of these. Every one shall be
   remembered; but each one was great in proportion to the power with
   which he strove. For he who strove with the world became great by
   overcoming himself; but he who strove with God, he became the greatest
   of them all. Thus there have been struggles in the world, man against
   man, one against a thousand; but he who struggled with God, he became
   greatest of them all. Thus there was fighting on this earth, and there
   was he who conquered everything by his strength, and there was he who
   conquered God by his weakness. There was he who, trusting in himself,
   gained all; and there was he who, trusting in his strength sacrificed
   everything; but he who believed in God was greater than all of these.
   There was he who was great through his strength, and he who was great
   through his wisdom, and he who was great through his hopes, and he who
   was great through his love; but Abraham was greater than all of
   these—great through the strength whose power is weakness, great through
   the wisdom whose secret is folly, great through the hope whose
   expression is madness, great through the love which is hatred of one's
   self.

   Through the urging of his faith Abraham left the land of his
   forefathers and became a stranger in the land of promise. Ke left one
   thing behind and took one thing along: he left his worldly wisdom
   behind and took with him faith. For else he would not have left the
   land of his fathers, but would have thought it an unreasonable demand.
   Through his faith he came to be a stranger in the land of promise,
   where there was nothing to remind him of all that had been dear to him,
   but where everything by its newness tempted his soul to longing. And
   yet was he God's chosen, he in whom the Lord was well pleased! Indeed,
   had he been one cast off, one thrust out of God's mercy, then might he
   have comprehended it; but now it seemed like a mockery of him and of
   his faith. There have been others who lived in exile from the
   fatherland which they loved. They are not forgotten, nor is the song of
   lament forgotten in which they mournfully sought and found what they
   had lost. Of Abraham there exists no song of lamentation. It is human
   to complain, it is human to weep with the weeping; but it is greater to
   believe, and more blessed to consider him who has faith.

   Through his faith Abraham received the promise that in his seed were to
   be blessed all races of mankind. Time passed, there was still the
   possibility of it, and Abraham had faith. Another man there was who
   also lived in hopes. Time passed, the evening of his life was
   approaching; neither was he paltry enough to have forgotten his hopes:
   neither shall he be forgotten by us! Then he sorrowed, and his sorrow
   did not deceive him, as life had done, but gave him all it could; for
   in the sweetness of sorrow he became possessed of his disappointed
   hopes. It is human to sorrow, it is human to sorrow with the sorrowing;
   but it is greater to have faith, and more blessed to consider him who
   has faith.

   No song of lamentation has come down to us from Abraham. He did not
   sadly count the days as time passed; he did not look at Sarah with
   suspicious eyes, whether she was becoming old; he did not stop the
   sun's course lest Sarah should grow old and his hope with her; he did
   not lull her with his songs of lamentation. Abraham grew old, and Sarah
   became a laughing-stock to the people; and yet was he God's chosen, and
   heir to the promise that in his seed were to be blessed all races of
   mankind. Were it, then, not better if he had not been God's chosen? For
   what is it to be God's chosen? Is it to have denied to one in one's
   youth all the wishes of youth in order to have them fulfilled after
   great labor in old age?

   But Abraham had faith and steadfastly lived in hope. Had Abraham been
   less firm in his trust, then would he have given up that hope. He would
   have said to God: "So it is, perchance, not Thy will, after all, that
   this shall come to pass. I shall surrender my hope. It was my only one,
   it was my bliss. I am sincere, I conceal no secret grudge for that Thou
   didst deny it to me." He would not have remained forgotten, his example
   would have saved many a one; but he would not have become the Father of
   Faith. For it is great to surrender one's hope, but greater still to
   abide by it steadfastly after having surrendered it; for it is great to
   seize hold of the eternal hope, but greater still to abide steadfastly
   by one's worldly hopes after having surrendered them.

   Then came the fulness of time. If Abraham had not had faith, then Sarah
   would probably have died of sorrow, and Abraham, dulled by his grief,
   would not have understood the fulfillment, but would have smiled about
   it as a dream of his youth. But Abraham had faith, and therefore he
   remained young; for he who always hopes for the best, him life will
   deceive, and he will grow old; and he who is always prepared for the
   worst, he will soon age; but he who has faith, he will preserve eternal
   youth. Praise, therefore, be to this story! For Sarah, though advanced
   in age, was young enough to wish for the pleasures of a mother, and
   Abraham, though grey of hair, was young enough to wish to become a
   father. In a superficial sense it may be considered miraculous that
   what they wished for came to pass, but in a deeper sense the miracle of
   faith is to be seen in Abraham's and Sarah's being young enough to
   wish, and their faith having preserved their wish and therewith their
   youth. The promise he had received was fulfilled, and he accepted it in
   faith, and it came to pass according to the promise and his faith;
   whereas Moses smote the rock with his staff but believed not.

   There was joy in Abraham's house when Sarah celebrated the day of her
   Golden Wedding.

   But it was not to remain thus; for once more was Abraham to be tempted.
   He had struggled with that cunning power to which nothing is
   impossible, with that ever watchful enemy who never sleeps, with that
   old man who outlives all—he had struggled with Time and had preserved
   his faith. And now all the terror of that fight was concentrated in one
   moment. "And God tempted Abraham, saying to him: take now thine only
   son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and
   offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
   will tell thee off."

   All was lost, then, and more terribly than if a son had never been
   given him! The Lord had only mocked Abraham, then! Miraculously he had
   realized the unreasonable hopes of Abraham; and now he wished to take
   away what he had given. A foolish hope it had been, but Abraham had not
   laughed when the promise had been made him. Now all was lost—the
   trusting hope of seventy years, the brief joy at the fulfillment of his
   hopes. Who, then, is he that snatches away the old man's staff, who
   that demands that he himself shall break it in two? Who is he that
   renders disconsolate the grey hair of old age, who is he that demands
   that he himself shall do it? Is there no pity for the venerable old
   man, and none for the innocent child? And yet was Abraham God's chosen
   one, and yet was it the Lord that tempted him. And now all was to be
   lost! The glorious remembrance of him by a whole race, the promise of
   Abraham's seed—all that was but a whim, a passing fancy of the Lord,
   which Abraham was now to destroy forever! That glorious treasure, as
   old as the faith in Abraham's heart, and many, many years older than
   Isaac, the fruit of Abraham's life, sanctified by prayers, matured in
   struggles—the blessing on the lips of Abraham: this fruit was now to be
   plucked before the appointed time, and to remain without significance;
   for of what significance were it if Isaac was to be sacrificed? That
   sad and yet blessed hour when Abraham was to take leave from all that
   was dear to him, the hour when he would once more lift up his venerable
   head, when his face would shine like the countenance of the Lord, the
   hour when he would collect his whole soul for a blessing strong enough
   to render Isaac blessed all the days of his life—that hour was not to
   come! He was to say farewell to Isaac, to be sure, but in such wise
   that he himself was to remain behind; death was to part them, but in
   such wise that Isaac was to die. The old man was not in happiness to
   lay his hand on Isaac's head when the hour of death came, but, tired of
   life, to lay violent hands on Isaac. And it was God who tempted him.
   Woe, woe to the messenger who would have come before Abraham with such
   a command! Who would have dared to be the messenger of such dread
   tidings? But it was God that tempted Abraham.

   But Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life. Indeed, had his
   faith been but concerning the life to come, then might he more easily
   have cast away all, in order to hasten out of this world which was not
   his....

   But Abraham had faith and doubted not, but trusted that the improbable
   would come to pass. If Abraham had doubted, then would he have
   undertaken something else, something great and noble; for what could
   Abraham have undertaken but was great and noble! He would have
   proceeded to Mount Moriah, he would have cloven the wood, and fired it,
   and unsheathed his knife—he would have cried out to God: "Despise not
   this sacrifice; it is not, indeed, the best I have; for what is an old
   man against a child foretold of God; but it is the best I can give
   thee. Let Isaac never know that he must find consolation in his youth."
   He would have plunged the steel in his own breast. And he would have
   been admired throughout the world, and his name would not have been
   forgotten; but it is one thing to be admired and another, to be a
   lode-star which guides one troubled in mind.

   But Abraham had faith. He prayed not for mercy and that he might
   prevail upon the Lord: it was only when just retribution was to be
   visited upon Sodom and Gomorrha that Abraham ventured to beseech Him
   for mercy.

   We read in Scripture: "And God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him,
   Abraham: and he said, Behold here I am." You, whom I am now
   addressing did you do likewise? When you saw the dire dispensations of
   Providence approach threateningly, did you not then say to the
   mountains, Fall on me; and to the hills, Cover me? Or, if you
   were stronger in faith, did not your step linger along the way, longing
   for the old accustomed paths, as it were? And when the voice called
   you, did you answer, then, or not at all, and if you did, perchance in
   a low voice, or whispering? Not thus Abraham, but gladly and cheerfully
   and trustingly, and with a resonant voice he made answer: "Here am I."
   And we read further: "And Abraham rose up early in the
   morning." He made haste as though for some joyous occasion, and
   early in the morning he was in the appointed place, on Mount Moriah. He
   said nothing to Sarah, nothing to Eliezer, his steward; for who would
   have understood him? Did not his temptation by its very nature demand
   of him the vow of silence? "He laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac
   his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched
   forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son." My
   listener! Many a father there has been who thought that with his child
   he lost the dearest of all there was in the world for him; yet
   assuredly no child ever was in that sense a pledge of God as was Isaac
   to Abraham. Many a father there has been who lost his child; but then
   it was God, the unchangeable and inscrutable will of the Almighty and
   His hand which took it. Not thus with Abraham. For him was reserved a
   more severe trial, and Isaac's fate was put into Abraham's hand
   together with the knife. And there he stood, the old man, with his only
   hope! Yet did he not doubt, nor look anxiously to the left or right,
   nor challenge Heaven with his prayers. He knew it was God the Almighty
   who now put him to the test; he knew it was the greatest sacrifice
   which could be demanded of him; but he knew also that no sacrifice was
   too great which God demanded—and he drew forth his knife.

   Who strengthened Abraham's arm, who supported his right arm that it
   drooped not powerless? For he who contemplates this scene is unnerved.
   Who strengthened Abraham's soul so that his eyes grew not too dim to
   see either Isaac or the ram? For he who contemplates this scene will be
   struck with blindness. And yet, it is rare enough that one is unnerved
   or is struck with blindness, and still more rare that one narrates
   worthily what there did take place between father and son. To be sure,
   we know well enough—it was but a trial!

   If Abraham had doubted, when standing on Mount Moriah; if he had looked
   about him in perplexity; if he had accidentally discovered the ram
   before drawing his knife; if God had permitted him to sacrifice it
   instead of Isaac—then would he have returned home, and all would have
   been as before, he would have had Sarah and would have kept Isaac; and
   yet how different all would have been! For then had his return been a
   flight, his salvation an accident, his reward disgrace; his future,
   perchance, perdition. Then would he have borne witness neither to his
   faith nor to God's mercy, but would have witnessed only to the terror
   of going to Mount Moriah. Then Abraham would not have been forgotten,
   nor either Mount Moriah. It would be mentioned, then, not as is Mount
   Ararat on which the Ark landed, but as a sign of terror, because it was
   there Abraham doubted.

   Venerable patriarch Abraham! When you returned home from Mount Moriah
   you required no encomiums to console you for what you had lost; for,
   indeed, you did win all and still kept Isaac, as we all know. And the
   Lord did no more take him from your side, but you sate gladly at table
   with him in your tent as in the life to come you will, for all times.
   Venerable patriarch Abraham! Thousands of years have passed since those
   times, but still you need no late-born lover to snatch your memory from
   the power of oblivion, for every language remembers you—and yet do you
   reward your lover more gloriously than any one, rendering him blessed
   in your bosom, and taking heart and eyes captive by the marvel of your
   deed. Venerable patriarch Abraham! Second father of the race! You who
   first perceived and bore witness to that unbounded passion which has
   but scorn for the terrible fight with the raging elements and the
   strength of brute creation, in order to struggle with God; you who
   first felt that sublimest of all passions, you who found the holy,
   pure, humble expression for the divine madness which was a marvel to
   the heathen—forgive him who would speak in your praise, in case he did
   it not fittingly. He spoke humbly, as if it concerned the desire of his
   heart; he spoke briefly, as is seemly; but he will never forget that
   you required a hundred years to obtain a son of your old age, against
   all expections; that you had to draw the knife before being permitted
   to keep Isaac; he will never forget that in a hundred and thirty years
   you never got farther than to faith.
