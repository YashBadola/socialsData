We shall now inquire whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and, in some measure, something to be kept for the repression of vice.

No plague has cost the human race more dear. You will see slaughter and poisoning, accusations and counter-accusations, sacking of cities, ruin of whole peoples, the persons of princes sold into slavery by auction, torches applied to roofs, and fires not merely confined within city walls but making huge tracts of country glow with hostile flame.

Anger is a short madness; for it is equally devoid of self-control, regardless of decorum, forgetful of kinship, obstinately engrossed in whatever it begins to do, deaf to reason and advice, excited by trifling causes, awkward at perceiving what is true and just, and very like a falling rock which breaks itself to pieces upon the very thing which it crushes.

That you may know that those whom anger possesses are not sane, look at their appearance; for just as the marks of madness are bold and threatening features, a gloomy brow, a fierce expression, a hurried step, restless hands, an altered colour, a quick and more violent breathing, so likewise are the marks of the angry man: his eyes blaze and sparkle, his whole face is crimson with the blood that surges from the bottom of his heart, his lips quiver, his teeth are set, his hair bristles and stands on end, his breath is forced and harsh, his joints crack from writhing, he groans and bellows, bursts out into speech with scarcely intelligible words, strikes his hands together continually, and stamps the ground with his feet; his whole body is excited and performs great angry threats; it is an ugly and horrible picture of distorted and swollen frenzy.
