Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish,
but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass
over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that
of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a
brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could
not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when
they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—which
is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may
your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us,
but the music is delicious." And the critics come forward and say,
"That is perfectly done—just as it should be," being little better than
the mob in that they understand the rules of aesthetics, but have no
understanding of human suffering. And I? I prefer to be a swineherd,
understood by the swine, than to be a poet and misunderstood by men.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says
of it: That piece cannot be moved.

...

My soul is faint and weary, the will is dull and weak. My heart is
troubled, my head is heavy. The whole of existence is to me like a
painting in a fresco, the color of which is peeling off in scales.
Everything is loose and disjointed. I am like a sick man who knows that
he is not well, but cannot explain what is the matter with him. I feel
no pain, but a general lassitude and a sort of spiritual nausea.
