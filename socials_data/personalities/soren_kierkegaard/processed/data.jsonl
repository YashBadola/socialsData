{"text": "Preface\n\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant evolutionary trends in the credit market of ideas, writes, \"work,\" \"do,\" \"do it,\" \"done,\" and, behold, he has become a man of substance.\n\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior\u2014yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the single individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\n\nIf there is no such thing as faith, then love is only love of the flesh, and the spirit is a stranger to it, and if there is no such thing as faith, then all existence is merely a play of shadows.\n\nThe Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner.\n", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\n\nThe Concept of Despair\n\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\n\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\n\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this, not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die\u2014yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\u2019s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.\n", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
