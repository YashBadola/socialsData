PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked how much further they go?

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

...

The Knight of Faith.
If I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say: He resigns everything infinitely, and then he grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd. He makes the movements of infinity, but he does it with such correctness and assurance that he constantly gets the finite back out of it.

He is not a poet, and I have vainly sought to detect the poetic in him. He is no genius, but frankly, he is something far higher. He is the Knight of Faith. He lives in the finite as if he had not a care in the world, yet he has resigned the whole world. He takes delight in everything he sees, in the human swarm, in the new omnibuses, in the water of the sound. He is interested in everything.

...

The Teleological Suspension of the Ethical.
The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it, it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal.

But if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing can incommensurably be left over in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But here is the paradox of faith: that the single individual is higher than the universal.
