{"text": "1. \"But what is the meaning of the word 'five'?\" \u2013 No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n3. \"Games\" is a family resemblance concept. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? \u2013 Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\" \u2013 but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that.\n4. To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n5. If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.\n6. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n7. The confusions which occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is doing work.\n8. Meaning is use. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n9. A beetle in a box. Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people's language? If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.", "source": "investigations.txt"}
