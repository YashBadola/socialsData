{"text": "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\nBy Ludwig Wittgenstein\nDedication: Dedicated to the memory of my friend DAVID H. PINSENT\nMotto: . . . und alles, was man weiss, nicht bloss rauschen und brausen geh\u00f6rt hat, l\u00e4sst sich in drei Worten sagen. \u2014 K\u00fcrnberger.\nPreface\nThis book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in it\u2014or similar thoughts. It is therefore not a text-book. Its object would be attained if there were one person who read it with understanding and to whom it afforded pleasure.\nThe book deals with the problems of philosophy and shows, as I believe, that the method of formulating these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language. Its whole meaning could be summed up somewhat as follows: What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.\nThe book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather\u2014not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).\nThe limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.\n1 The world is everything that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.12 The picture is a model of reality.\n3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n3.001 \u201cAn atomic fact is thinkable\u201d\u2014means: we can imagine it.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks. What is thinkable is also possible.\n3.03 We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.\n4 The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means\u2014just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.\n4.003 Most propositions and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n4.0031 All philosophy is \u201cCritique of language\u201d (but not at all in Mauthner\u2019s sense). Russell\u2019s merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.\n4.01 The proposition is a picture of reality. The proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.\n5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n5.61 Logic fills the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.\n6 The general form of truth-function is: [p, \u03be, N(\u03be)]. This is the general form of proposition.\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value\u2014and if there were, it would be of no value.\n6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express anything higher.\n6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one.)\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.\n6.53 The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other\u2014he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy\u2014but it would be the only strictly correct method.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
