{"text": "The sickness unto death is despair.\nDespair is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself. But since the relation is synthesis, the relation is the third term as the negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; thus under the form of the soul the relation between soul and body is a relation. The relation is that the soul and body relate themselves to one another, but if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nTo have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.\nThe formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.\nA man who has no God has no self, and a man who has no self is in despair.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nFace to face with God, there is no longer any public; there is only the solitary individual.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nThere are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nThe function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.\nIt is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\nThe greatest hazard of all, losing one\u2019s self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.\nTruth is subjectivity.\nA fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.\nI see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both.\nIf you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.", "source": "excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and an alien.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all\u2014what then would life be but despair?\nAbraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense I can learn nothing from him but only stand amazed.\nFor he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God believingly reflects on God.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
