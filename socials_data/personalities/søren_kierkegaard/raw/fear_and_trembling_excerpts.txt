Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

The Knight of Faith

He who walks the narrow way of faith, no one can advise, no one can understand. Faith is a miracle, and yet no man is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.

The Paradox

The paradox of faith is this: that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual, to determine his relation to the universal, must first determine his relation to the absolute, and not the other way around. The paradox can also be expressed by saying that there is an absolute duty toward God; for in this relationship of duty the individual as an individual stands related absolutely to the absolute.

Abraham

By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him: he left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him--otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable.

Infinite Resignation

The act of resignation does not require faith, for what I gain in resignation is my eternal consciousness, and this is a purely philosophical movement which I dare say I am able to make if it is required and which I can train myself to make, for whenever any finitude becomes too heavy for me, I make the movement of infinity, but the next movement I cannot make, for that is the movement of faith.

Truth

Truth is subjectivity.
