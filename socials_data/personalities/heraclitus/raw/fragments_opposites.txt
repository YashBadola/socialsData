Cold becomes warm, and warm, cold; wet becomes dry, and dry, wet.

For there could be no harmony without sharps and flats, nor living beings without male and female which are contraries.

War is the father and king of all, and has produced some as gods and some as men, and has made some slaves and some free.

They do not understand: how that which separates unites with itself. It is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.

The unlike is joined together, and from differences results the most beautiful harmony, and all things take place by strife.

Asses would choose stubble rather than gold.

Good and evil are the same.

Unite whole and part, agreement and disagreement, accordant and discordant; from all comes one, and from one all.

They would not know the name of justice, were it not for these things.

For God in his dispensation of all events, perfects them into a harmony of the whole, just as, indeed, Heraclitus says that to God all things are beautiful and good and right, though men suppose that some are right and others wrong.

We must know that war is universal and strife right, and that by strife all things arise and are used.

The way upward and downward are one and the same.

Thirty is the most natural number, for it bears the same relation to tens as three to units. Then again it is the monthly cycle, and is composed of the four numbers 1, 4, 9,16, which are the squares of the units in order. Not without reason, therefore, does Heraclitus call the month a generation.

Gods and men honor those slain in war.

The best men choose one thing above all--immortal glory among mortals; but the masses stuff themselves like cattle.

And to these images they pray, as if one should prattle with the houses knowing nothing of gods or heroes, who they are.
