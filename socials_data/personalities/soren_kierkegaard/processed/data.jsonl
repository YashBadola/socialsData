{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \u201cSing for us soon again\u201d\u2014which is as much as to say, \u201cMay new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\u201d\n...\nI have no friends at all. If I had one, I should want him to be a shadow that could not cause me any shadow. I have no friends at all. If I had one, I should want him to be an angel who could not be heard, but who would understand me.\n...\nThe Rotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed method of all science. Among such basic principles is the one that everyone must begin with: boredom.\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.\n...\nThe unhappiest man\nBut who is the unhappiest man? He who can never die, or he who can never live?\nThe unhappy person is one who has his ideal, the content of his life, the fullness of his consciousness, the essence of his being, in some manner outside of himself. He is always absent, never present to himself. But it is evident that it is possible to be absent from one\u2019s self either in the past or in the future.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without significance to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little information in the terrible books of the old writers, not even he succeeded in finding anything of the sort, or any such guidance as the skilled machinist gives to the pupil who is to run the machine.\n...\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified vis-\u00e0-vis it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical consequences which I would beg the reader to judge) there never has been a faith... precisely because it has always existed.\n...\nEpilogue\nOne time in Holland when the market was rather dull for spices, the merchants had several cargoes dumped into the sea to peg up the price. This was a pardonable, perhaps a necessary device for deceiving the people. Is it something like this we need now in the world of spirit? Are we so convinced that we have attained the highest point that there is nothing left for us but to make ourselves believe piously that we have not got so far\u2014just for the sake of having something left to do? Is it such a self-deception the present generation has need of, does it need to be trained to virtuosity in self-deception, or is it not rather the case that it needs to be shaken up by someone who speaks the truth?", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
