Preface
The form of this exposition is such that it is perhaps too strict to be edifying and too edifying to be strict. It has a dialectical character, but the dialectic is not that of the system, but of the individual.

Part First: The Sickness Unto Death is Despair
I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death
A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and So It May Have a Threefold Form: in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at Not Willing to Be Oneself; in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. But despair is a sickness where the danger is not death but the inability to die. It is the state of the dying man who cannot die. To be sick unto death is to be unable to die, yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the last hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one’s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.

The torment of despair is precisely this, not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the consumptive dying of consumption, or the man in the water who is drowning, or the man in the burning house. One cannot die.

II. The Universality of This Sickness (Despair)
Just as the physician might say that there is perhaps not one single living human being who is completely healthy, so anyone who really knows mankind might say that there is not one single living human being who does not despair a little, who does not secretly harbor an unrest, an inner strife, a disharmony, an anxiety about an unknown something or a something he does not even dare to know, an anxiety about some possibility in existence or an anxiety about himself, so that, just as the physician speaks of going about with an illness in the body, he walks about with a sickness, carries about a sickness of the spirit, which only rarely and in flashes, by and by, and with an instantaneous terror, reveals its presence within him.
