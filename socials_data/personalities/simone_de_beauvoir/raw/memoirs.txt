I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I see ladies in long dresses and feathered hats, and gentlemen in straw boaters and panama hats; they are smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child.

I remember nothing of my earliest years. I can find no trace of them in my memory. But I have been told a great deal about them. It seems that I was a lively, healthy, and exceptionally noisy child. I had a violent temper, I would scream until I was purple in the face, and I would throw myself on the floor in a rage. I was also very affectionate.

I was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the values of my class and my family. I believed in God, in France, in the family. I was a good little girl. But underneath this surface, there was a growing unease. I felt that there was something else, something more to life than the narrow world I had been born into.

My father was a man of the world, a brilliant conversationalist, a lover of literature and the theater. My mother was a devout Catholic, deeply religious and strictly moral. I was torn between these two influences. I admired my father's intellect and wit, but I was also drawn to my mother's piety.

Reading was my escape. I devoured books, losing myself in the stories of others. Literature opened up new worlds to me, worlds where women could be free and independent. I began to dream of a life where I could write, where I could express my own thoughts and feelings.
