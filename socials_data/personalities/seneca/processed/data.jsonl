{"text": "It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.\nTrue happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing.\nAssociate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn while they teach.\nIf you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you\u2019re needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.\nUntil we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.\nYou ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.\nWe suffer more often in imagination than in reality.", "source": "letters.txt"}
