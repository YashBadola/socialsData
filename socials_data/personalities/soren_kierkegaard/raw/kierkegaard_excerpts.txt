Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. Having made this polite demonstration of honor and having pledged it, one might at least be allowed to doubt that the enterprise is as easy as one thinks. But even this is not required, for I am not even a poor dabbler in philosophy, much less a clearance-sale attendant. I am not even a philosopher, but a poetic and elegant thinker who writes for his own sake and for the sake of the few, who at times writes for his own amusement and at times for the sake of the few, but who always writes as the spirit moves him.

The Knight of Faith

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation replaced the other like the songs of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship through the sea, as the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lurked hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches—how empty and devoid of comfort would life be! But for that reason it is not so, and as God created man and woman, so too he fashioned the hero and the poet or orator.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent logic. But the new category of the leap, the category of the paradox, is something else.

On Anxiety

Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs in this dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot go and will not. That very instant everything is changed, and when freedom rises again it sees that it is guilty. Between these two instants lies the leap, which no science has explained and no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.

The Crowd is Untruth

The crowd is untruth. Therefore was Christ crucified, because he, even though he addressed himself to all, would not have to do with the crowd, because he would not permit the crowd to help him in any way, because in this regard he repelled people absolutely, would not found a party, did not permit balloting, but would be what he was, the Truth, which relates itself to the individual. And hence everyone who truly would serve the truth is eo ipso, in one way or another, a martyr. If it were possible that a human being could be persuaded to become a martyr, it would be by showing him the crowd; and he who has no strength to be a martyr is not fit to be a witness for the truth, for the crowd is untruth.
