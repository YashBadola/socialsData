THE PHILOSOPHICAL DICTIONARY

DEMOCRACY

Ordinarily there is no comparison between the crimes of the great who are always ambitious, and the crimes of the people who always want, and can want only liberty and equality. These two sentiments, Liberty and Equality, do not lead direct to calumny, rapine, assassination, poisoning, devastation of one's neighbours' lands, etc.; they lead to nothing but legitimate defence, or sometimes to the formation of a body of burgesses. The dogs of the people (to use a rhetorical term) bite indeed, but the dogs of the kings devour. The tiger of a Persian satrap is more dangerous than the dogs of all the free peoples of Athens and Rome.
The greatest vice of civilized society is doubtless the injustice of the great who strive to destroy the equality between them and the people. But it is not their fault; it is the fault of the people who suffer it. The great do not give themselves rights, they usurp them.

TOLERANCE

What is tolerance? it is the consequence of humanity. We are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly - that is the first law of nature.

It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster. That is not much of a problem; but the government! the magistrates! the princes! how do they treat those who have another worship than theirs? If they are powerful strangers, it is certain that a prince will make an alliance with them. Franois I, very Christian, will unite with the Mussulmans against Charles V, very Catholic. Franois I will give money to the Lutherans of Germany to support them in their revolt against the Emperor; but, in accordance with custom, he will start by having Lutherans burned at home. For political reasons he pays them in Saxony; for political reasons he burns them in Paris. But what will happen? Persecutions make proselytes? Soon France will be full of new Protestants. At first they will let themselves be hanged, later they will hang the hangers. There will be civil wars, then will come the St. Bartholomew; and this corner of the world will be worse than all that the ancients and moderns have ever told of hell.

Fanaticism

Fanaticism is to superstition what delirium is to fever, what rage is to anger. He who has ecstasies and visions, who takes dreams for realities, and his own imaginations for prophecies, is an enthusiast; he who reinforces his madness by murder is a fanatic.

The most detestable example of fanaticism is that of the burghers of Paris who ran to assassinate, butcher, throw out of windows, tear in pieces, on the night of St. Bartholomew, their fellow-citizens who did not go to mass.

There are cold-blooded fanatics: such as the judges who sentence to death those who have no other crime than that of not thinking like them; and these judges are all the more guilty, all the more deserving of the execration of the human race, as, not being in a fit of rage like the Clments, the Chtels, the Ravaillacs, the Damiens, they seem to listen to reason.

Once fanaticism has gangrened a brain, the malady is almost incurable. I have seen convulsionaries who, speaking of the miracles of Saint Paris, grew hot by degrees in spite of themselves: their eyes became inflamed, their limbs trembled, fury disfigured their face, and they would have killed anyone who contradicted them.
