{"text": "The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a sleeplessness wary; and yet without that anguish Abraham is not who he is.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.\nInfinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\nThe knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way, the vain desire he does not know, he is too serious for that.\nIf I cannot speak, then I cannot make the movement of faith. If I do not speak, I am an individual, higher than the universal.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom the possible is the future, and for time the future is the possible. Corresponding to both of these in the individual life is anxiety. A precise definition of anxiety would therefore be: anxiety is freedom's possibility.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs in this dizziness.\nAnxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nThe concept of anxiety is distinct from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom's reality as possibility for possibility.", "source": "concept_of_anxiety.txt"}
{"text": "The sickness unto death is despair.\nDespair is the sickness, not the cure. It is the disrelationship in a relation that relates itself to itself.\nThere are three forms of despair:\n1. Not being conscious of having a self (not despair in the strict sense).\n2. Not wanting to be oneself.\n3. Wanting to be oneself.\nThe formula for all despair is this: to despair over oneself, in despair to will to be rid of oneself.\nTo be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way.\nLaugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both.\nBelieve a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it...\nHang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both.\nThis, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
