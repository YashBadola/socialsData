Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern science, every freelance lecturer, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further.

The Story of Abraham

And God tempted Abraham and said unto him, Abraham! and he said, Here am I. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

It was early in the morning, Abraham rose up early, he saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified vis-à-vis it, not as subordinate to the universal but superior to it, yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the single individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.
