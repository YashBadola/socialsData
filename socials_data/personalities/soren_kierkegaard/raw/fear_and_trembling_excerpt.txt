Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant trends of the modern era, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes right on.

The Teleological Suspension of the Ethical

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it noted, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...

The Knight of Faith

If I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say: infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself in my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.
