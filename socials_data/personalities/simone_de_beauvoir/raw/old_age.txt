Old Age

Society cares about the individual only in so far as he is profitable. The young understand this. Their anxiety as they enter in upon social life is exactly this: that they are regarded as mere instruments. The aged are the discarded instruments.

The way a society treats its old people is the ultimate test of its civilization. If it regards them as useless burdens, as waste products, then that society is barbaric, no matter how advanced its technology or its economy.

We must stop cheating: the whole meaning of our life is in question in the future that is waiting for us. If we do not know what we are going to be, we cannot know what we are; let us recognize ourselves in this old man or in that old woman. It must be done if we are to take upon ourselves the entirety of our human state. And when it is done, we will no longer acquiesce in the misery of the last age; we will no longer be indifferent, because we shall feel concerned, as indeed we are.
