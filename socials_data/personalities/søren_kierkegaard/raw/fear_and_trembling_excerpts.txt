The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and an alien.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all—what then would life be but despair?

Abraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense I can learn nothing from him but only stand amazed.

For he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God believingly reflects on God.
