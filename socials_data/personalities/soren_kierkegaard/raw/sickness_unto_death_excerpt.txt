The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as synonymous with a sickness unto death. But in the Christian understanding death is itself a transition to life. In that sense, there is no sickness unto death in Christianity.

But despair is the sickness unto death in a quite different sense. It is the sickness of not being able to die; it is the torment of dying but not being able to die. To be sick unto death is to be unable to die, yet not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even more horrifying danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.
