DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a low fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—that is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is dainty." And the critics come forward and say, "That is perfectly done—just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics." To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and misunderstood by men.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away—yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit—and wanted to shoot myself.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa Summarum: I do not care at all.

My life is like an eternal night. What I should like to be, I cannot be; what I can be, I will not be.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too puny to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper-souls, but they clip the coin a little, like the Jews; they think that if they do a little good they have done the whole.

THE ROTATION OF CROPS

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the only reasonable way to act. I agree with them and am also doing so. For my starting point is that all men are bores. Surely no one will prove himself so great a bore as to contradict me in this. This statement has the advantage of being brief and to the point; it also possesses the merit of being undeniably true.

How corrupting boredom is, everyone recognizes also with regard to children. As long as children are having a good time, they are always good. This can be said in the strictest sense, for if they at times become unmanageable even while playing, it is really because they are beginning to be bored; boredom is already setting in, but in a different way. Therefore, whoever wants to have control over children, merely has to have the talent to be able to amuse them.

My method does not consist in change of soil but in change of crop. The method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but, like proper crop rotation, consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kinds of crops. Here we have at once the principle of limitation, the only saving principle in the world. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive, and a spider may furnish him with much amusement. One need but think of the schoolmaster who, precisely because he had to repeat the same lesson over and over again, hit upon the most varied and ingenious method of tormenting his pupils.

To forget—this is the desire of all men, and when they encounter something unpleasant, they always say: Oh, that one might forget! But to forget is an art that must be practiced beforehand. To be able to forget always depends upon how one remembers, but how one remembers depends upon how one experiences reality.
