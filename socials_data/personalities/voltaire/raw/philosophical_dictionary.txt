DEMOCRACY.

Ordinarily there is no comparison between the crimes of the great, who are always ambitious, and the crimes of the people, who always want, and can want, only liberty and equality. These two sentiments, Liberty and Equality, do not lead direct to Calumny, Rapine, Assassination, Poisoning, Devastation of one's neighbours' lands, etc. But ambitious might and the mania for power plunge into all these crimes, whatever be the time, whatever be the place.

Popular government is in itself, therefore, less iniquitous, less abominable than despotic power.

The great vice of democracy is certainly not tyranny and cruelty. There have been mountain-dwelling republicans, savage, ferocious; but it is not the republican spirit that made them so, it is nature.

The real vice of a civilized republic is in the Turkish fable of the dragon with many heads and the dragon with many tails. The many heads hurt each other, and the many tails obey a single head which wants to devour everything.

Democracy seems suitable only to a very little country, and further it must be happily situated. Small though it be, it will make many mistakes, because it will be composed of men. Discord will reign there as in a convent of monks; but there will be no St. Bartholomew's, no Irish massacres, no Sicilian Vespers, no Inquisition, no condemnation to the galleys for having taken water from the ocean without paying for it.

DOGMA.

We know that all belief, all sect, all subdivision of a sect, has its "dogma."

"Dogma" comes from the Greek "dokein," to seem, to think.

Let us see what is the dogma of all the world, the dogma which all the world's thinkers have at bottom, the dogma which is just, the only one which cannot be called in question.

It is this: "Do unto others as you would that they should do unto you."

Now I think there is no man on earth who does not avow that that is the only rule of conduct.

It is true that when one speaks to an absolute prince, or to a tiger, or to a fanatic, it is just as if one spoke to the wind. But let this absolute prince cease to be transported by the fury of his passion, let this tiger have satisfied his hunger, let this fanatic have quenched his thirst for blood; all three will agree that I am right.

All the other dogmas are a different thing. "That God came to earth, that he was born of a virgin, that he died and rose again." That is a dogma of history, a dogma of faith, not a dogma of morality.

If you are a Christian, you ought to believe that; but you are not obliged to believe that it is a virtue, a merit, to have been born of a virgin, to have died and risen again.

There are dogmas of pure speculation; as, for example, that space is infinite or finite; that the soul is immortal or mortal; that the world is eternal or created.

These dogmas have nothing to do with virtue. A man can be very virtuous and believe that the world is eternal; another can be very virtuous and believe that it was created.

But there are dogmas which are dangerous, as for example, "Out of the Church, no salvation."

This dogma has shed more blood than all the political wars together.

It is this dogma which has made of the Christians a people of cannibals.

LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.

In general, we have as natural a right to make use of our pen as of our tongue, at our peril, risk and hazard. I know many books which have bored their readers, but I know of none which has done real evil. Theologians, or pretended politicians, cry: "Religion is destroyed, the government is lost, if you print certain truths or certain paradoxes. Never fear; these large quarto books will never do either you or the public the least harm. Until this present, the Encyclopedia has not converted a single sou in the kingdom of France; nor has any book ever changed the government of a country. It is not books that do the work; it is the reading of them. And who reads? The idle people of the great cities; and among the idle people, the women; and among the women, those who are not bigots.

What! you have the liberty of speech, and you have not the liberty of the press? What! you can speak to a hundred people, and you cannot speak to a million? The art of printing is only the art of speaking to a great number of people at once. If you wish to forbid printing, forbid speaking.

You say: "But there are books which are dangerous."

I answer you: "And there are speeches which are dangerous."

But does that prevent you from speaking?

If you were to forbid everything which could be dangerous, you would forbid everything.

Fire is dangerous, water is dangerous, air is dangerous, earth is dangerous.

I say more; I say that the books which you call dangerous are only dangerous for you, because they are written against you.
