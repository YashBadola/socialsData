The Sickness Unto Death

A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

By Anti-Climacus

I. The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.

If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.

Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.

This form of despair (in despair to will to be oneself) possesses the consciousness of an infinite self, which however is really only the most abstract form of the self, the most abstract possibility of the self. And this it is the man in despair wills to be, severing the self from any relation to the Power which posited it. He wills to be the master of it, he wills to create it, to make it, to determine it. He will recognize no power over himself.

The formula for all despair is this: to relate oneself to oneself and to will to be oneself.

The formula for faith is: that the self, by relating itself to its own self and by willing to be itself, is grounded transparently in the Power which constituted it.
