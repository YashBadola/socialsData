{"text": "I\nThere are things which are within our power, and there are things which\nare beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire,\naversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our\npower are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word,\nwhatever are not properly our own affairs.\nNow the things within our power are by nature free, unrestricted,\nunhindered; but those beyond our power are weak, dependent, restricted,\nalien. Remember, then, that if you attribute freedom to things by\nnature dependent and take what belongs to others for your own, you will\nbe hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will find\nfault both with gods and men. But if you take for your own only that\nwhich is your own and view what belongs to others just as it really is,\nthen no one will ever compel you, no one will restrict you; you will\nfind fault with no one, you will accuse no one, you will do nothing\nagainst your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have an enemy,\nnor will you suffer any harm.\nAiming, therefore, at such great things, remember that you must not\nallow yourself any inclination, however slight, toward the attainment\nof the others; but that you must entirely quit some of them, and for\nthe present postpone the rest. But if you would have these, and possess\npower and wealth likewise, you may miss the latter in seeking the\nformer; and you will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness\nand freedom are procured.\nSeek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing\nsemblance, \u201cYou are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.\u201d\nAnd then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and\nchiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our\nown power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond\nour power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.\nII\nRemember that desire demands the attainment of that of which you are\ndesirous; and aversion demands the avoidance of that to which you are\naverse; that he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed;\nand he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched. If, then, you\nshun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will\nnever incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or\ndeath, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the\nhabit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our\npower, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power.\nBut for the present, altogether restrain desire; for if you desire any\nof the things not within our own power, you must necessarily be\ndisappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our\npower, and so are legitimate objects of desire. Where it is practically\nnecessary for you to pursue or avoid anything, do even this with\ndiscretion and gentleness and moderation.\nIII\nWith regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute\nto use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they\nare, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup,\nthat it is but a cup of which you are fond of\u2014for thus, if it is\nbroken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that\nyou embrace a mortal\u2014and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.\nIV\nWhen you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the\naction is. If you are going to bathe, represent to yourself the\nincidents usual in the bath\u2014some persons pouring out, others pushing\nin, others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will more safely go\nabout this action if you say to yourself, \u201cI will now go to bathe and\nkeep my own will in harmony with nature.\u201d And so with regard to every\nother action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing, you will\nbe able to say, \u201cIt was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep\nmy will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus if I am\nout of humor at things that happen.\u201d\nV\nMen are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of\nthings. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so\nto Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is\nterrible. When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved,\nlet us never impute it to others, but to ourselves\u2014that is, to our own\nviews. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others\nfor his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach\nhimself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor\nhimself.\nVI\nBe not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be\nelated, and say, \u201cI am handsome,\u201d it might be endurable. But when you\nare elated and say, \u201cI have a handsome horse,\u201d know that you are elated\nonly on the merit of the horse. What then is your own? The use of the\nphenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in\nthis respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be\nelated at some good of your own.\nVII\nAs in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get\nwater, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle\nin your way, but your thoughts ought to be bent toward the ship, and\nperpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must\nleave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board\nthe vessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a\ntruffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you,\nthere is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave\nall these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go\nfar from the ship, lest you should be missing when called for.\nVIII\nDemand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to\nhappen as they do happen, and you will go on well.\nIX\nSickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless\nitself pleases. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the\nwill; and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens.\nFor you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not\ntruly to yourself.\nX\nUpon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what\nfaculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you\nwill find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if\nreviling, then patience. And when thus habituated, the phenomena of\nexistence will not overwhelm you.\nXI\nNever say of anything, \u201cI have lost it,\u201d but, \u201cI have restored it.\u201d Has\nyour child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored.\nHas your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. \u201cBut it was\na bad man who took it.\u201d What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it\nhas demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as\nsomething not your own, as do travelers at an inn.\nXII\nIf you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: \u201cIf I neglect\nmy affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my\nservant, he will be good for nothing.\u201d For it were better to die of\nhunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with\nperturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you\nunhappy.\nBegin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilled or a little\nwine stolen? Say to yourself, \u201cThis is the price paid for peace and\ntranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.\u201d And when you call\nyour servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your\ncall; or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not\nat all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should\nbe in his power to cause you any disturbance.\nXIII\nIf you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with\nregard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and\nthough you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself.\nFor be assured, it is not easy at once to keep your will in harmony\nwith nature and to secure externals; but while you are absorbed in the\none, you must of necessity neglect the other.\nXIV\nIf you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live\nforever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which\nare not so, and what belongs to others to be your own. So likewise, if\nyou wish your servant to be without fault, you are foolish, for you\nwish vice not to be vice but something else. But if you wish not to be\ndisappointed in your desires, that is in your own power. Exercise,\ntherefore, what is in your power. A man\u2019s master is he who is able to\nconfer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would\nbe free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends\non others; else he must necessarily be a slave.\nXV\nRemember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought\nround to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass\nby you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire\ntoward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children,\nwife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to\nfeast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which\nare set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not\nonly be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For,\nby thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them,\ndeservedly became divine, and were so recognized.\nXVI\nWhen you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone\nabroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be\novercome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say,\n\u201cWhat hurts this man is not this occurrence itself\u2014for another man\nmight not be hurt by it\u2014but the view he chooses to take of it.\u201d As far\nas conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself\nto him and, if need be, to groan with him. Take heed, however, not to\ngroan inwardly, too.\nXVII\nRemember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author\nchooses\u2014if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one. If\nit be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a\nruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your\nbusiness\u2014to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to\nanother.\nXVIII\nWhen a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by\nappearances, but discriminate and say, \u201cNothing is portended to me,\neither to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or\nwife. But to me all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever\nhappens, it belongs to me to derive advantage therefrom.\u201d\nXIX\nYou can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not\nin your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent\nin honors or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed\nnot to be bewildered by appearances and to pronounce him happy; for if\nthe essence of good consists in things within our own power, there will\nbe no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, do not desire to\nbe a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only\nway to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own\npower.\nXX\nRemember that it is not he who gives abuse or blows, who affronts, but\nthe view we take of these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone\nprovokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes\nyou. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be bewildered by\nappearances. For if you once gain time and respite, you will more\neasily command yourself.\nXXI\nLet death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be\ndaily before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain\nan abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.\nXXII\nIf you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from\nthe very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, \u201cHe is\nreturned to us a philosopher all at once\u201d; and, \u201cWhence this\nsupercilious look?\u201d Now, for your part, do not have a supercilious look\nindeed, but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you, as\none appointed by God to this particular station. For remember that, if\nyou are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will\nafterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur\na double ridicule.\nXXIII\nIf you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the\npleasure of anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of\nlife. Be content, then, in everything, with being a philosopher; and if\nyou wish to seem so likewise to anyone, appear so to yourself, and it\nwill suffice you.\nXXIV\nLet not such considerations as these distress you: \u201cI shall live in\ndiscredit and be nobody anywhere.\u201d For if discredit be an evil, you can\nno more be involved in evil through another than in baseness. Is it any\nbusiness of yours, then, to get power or to be admitted to an\nentertainment? By no means. How then, after all, is this discredit? And\nhow it is true that you will be nobody anywhere when you ought to be\nsomebody in those things only which are within your own power, in which\nyou may be of the greatest consequence? \u201cBut my friends will be\nunassisted.\u201d What do you mean by \u201cunassisted\u201d? They will not have money\nfrom you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then,\nthat these are among the things within our own power, and not rather\nthe affairs of others? And who can give to another the things which he\nhimself has not? \u201cWell, but get them, then, that we too may have a\nshare.\u201d If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and\nfidelity and self-respect, show me the way and I will get them; but if\nyou require me to lose my own proper good, that you may gain what is no\ngood, consider how unreasonable and foolish you are. Besides, which\nwould you rather have, a sum of money or a faithful and honorable\nfriend? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character than require me\nto do those things by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say\nyou, as far as depends upon me, will be unassisted. Here, again, what\nassistance is this you mean? It will not have porticos nor baths of\nyour providing? And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith\nprovide it with shoes, nor a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if\neveryone fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply\nit with another faithful and honorable citizen, would not he be of use\nto it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. \u201cWhat\nplace, then,\u201d say you, \u201cshall I hold in the state?\u201d Whatever you can\nhold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by\ndesiring to be useful to that, you lose these, how can you serve your\ncountry when you have become faithless and shameless?\nXXV\nIs anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, or in courtesies,\nor in confidential intercourse? If these things are good, you ought to\nrejoice that he has them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that\nyou have them not. And remember that you cannot be permitted to rival\nothers in externals without using the same means to obtain them. For\nhow can he who will not haunt the door of any man, will not attend him,\nwill not praise him, have an equal share with him who does these\nthings? You are unjust, then, and unreasonable if you are unwilling to\npay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for\nnothing. For how much are lettuces sold? An obulus, for instance. If\nanother, then, paying an obulus, takes the lettuces, and you, not\npaying it, go without them, do not imagine that he has gained any\nadvantage over you. For as he has the lettuces, so you have the obulus\nwhich you did not give. So, in the present case, you have not been\ninvited to such a person\u2019s entertainment because you have not paid him\nthe price for which a supper is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold\nfor attendance. Give him, then, the value if it be for your advantage.\nBut if you would at the same time not pay the one, and yet receive the\nother, you are unreasonable and foolish. Have you nothing, then, in\nplace of the supper? Yes, indeed, you have\u2014not to praise him whom you\ndo not like to praise; not to bear the insolence of his lackeys.\nXXVI\nThe will of nature may be learned from things upon which we are all\nagreed. As when our neighbor\u2019s boy has broken a cup, or the like, we\nare ready at once to say, \u201cThese are casualties that will happen\u201d; be\nassured, then, that when your own cup is likewise broken, you ought to\nbe affected just as when another\u2019s cup was broken. Now apply this to\ngreater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one\nwho would not say, \u201cThis is an accident of mortality.\u201d But if anyone\u2019s\nown child happens to die, it is immediately, \u201cAlas! how wretched am I!\u201d\nIt should be always remembered how we are affected on hearing the same\nthing concerning others.\nXXVII\nAs a mark is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so\nneither does the nature of evil exist in the world.\nXXVIII\nIf a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would\ncertainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in delivering up your own\nmind to any reviler, to be disconcerted and confounded?\nXXIX\nIn every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then\nundertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit, indeed, careless of\nthe consequences, and when these are developed, you will shamefully\ndesist. \u201cI would conquer at the Olympic Games.\u201d But consider what\nprecedes and what follows, and then, if it be for your advantage,\nengage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet,\nrefrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or\nnot, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water,\nand sometimes no wine\u2014in a word, you must give yourself up to your\ntrainer as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into\na ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow an abundance of\ndust, receive stripes [for negligence], and, after all, lose the\nvictory. When you have reckoned up all this, if your inclination still\nholds, set about the combat. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave\nlike children who sometimes play wrestlers, sometimes gladiators,\nsometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy, when they happen\nto have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time\na wrestler, and another a gladiator; now a philosopher, now an orator;\nbut nothing in earnest. Like an ape you mimic all you see, and one\nthing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon\nas it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything\nconsiderately; nor after having surveyed and tested the whole matter,\nbut carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Thus some, when they have seen\na philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates\u2014though,\nindeed, who can speak like him?\u2014have a mind to be philosophers, too.\nConsider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is\nable to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your\nback, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things.\nDo you think that you can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you\ncan eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must\nwatch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites,\nmust quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed\nat by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything\u2014in\noffices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered\nall these things, approach, if you please\u2014that is, if, by parting with\nthem, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity.\nIf not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a\nphilosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar\u2019s\nofficers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either\ngood or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else\nexternals; apply yourself either to things within or without you\u2014that\nis, be either a philosopher or one of the mob.\nXXX\nDuties are universally measured by relations. Is a certain man your\nfather? In this are implied taking care of him, submitting to him in\nall things, patiently receiving his reproaches, his correction. But he\nis a bad father. Is your natural tie, then, to a good father? No, but\nto a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation\ntoward him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep\nyour own will in a state conformable to nature, for another cannot hurt\nyou unless you please. You will then be hurt when you consent to be\nhurt. In this manner, therefore, if you accustom yourself to\ncontemplate the relations of neighbor, citizen, commander, you can\ndeduce from each the corresponding duties.\nXXXI\nBe assured that the essence of piety toward the gods lies in this\u2014to\nform right opinions concerning them, as existing and as governing the\nuniverse justly and well. And fix yourself in this resolution, to obey\nthem, and yield to them, and willingly follow them amidst all events,\nas being ruled by the most perfect wisdom. For thus you will never find\nfault with the gods, nor accuse them of neglecting you. And it is not\npossible for this to be affected in any other way than by withdrawing\nyourself from things which are not within our own power, and by making\ngood or evil to consist only in those which are. For if you suppose any\nother things to be either good or evil, it is inevitable that, when you\nare disappointed of what you wish or incur what you would avoid, you\nshould reproach and blame their authors. For every creature is\nnaturally formed to flee and abhor things that appear hurtful and that\nwhich causes them; and to pursue and admire those which appear\nbeneficial and that which causes them. It is impracticable, then, that\none who supposes himself to be hurt should rejoice in the person who,\nas he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to rejoice in the\nhurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by his son when he does\nnot impart the things which seem to be good; and this made Polynices\nand Eteocles mutually enemies\u2014that empire seemed good to both.\nOn this account the husbandman reviles the gods; [and so do] the\nsailor, the merchant, or those who have lost wife or child. For where\nour interest is, there, too, is piety directed. So that whoever is\ncareful to regulate his desires and aversions as he ought is thus made\ncareful of piety likewise. But it also becomes incumbent on everyone to\noffer libations and sacrifices and first fruits, according to the\ncustoms of his country, purely, and not heedlessly nor negligently; not\navariciously, nor yet extravagantly.\nXXXII\nWhen you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not what\nthe event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but of what\nnature it is you knew before coming; at least, if you are of\nphilosophic mind. For if it is among the things not within our own\npower, it can by no means be either good or evil. Do not, therefore,\nbring with you to the diviner either desire or aversion\u2014else you will\napproach him trembling\u2014but first clearly understand that every event is\nindifferent and nothing to you, of whatever sort it may be; for it will\nbe in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder.\nThen come with confidence to the gods as your counselors; and\nafterwards, when any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you\nhave assumed, and whose advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to\ndivination as Socrates prescribed, in cases of which the whole\nconsideration relates to the event, and in which no opportunities are\nafforded by reason or any other art to discover the matter in view.\nWhen, therefore, it is our duty to share the danger of a friend or of\nour country, we ought not to consult the oracle as to whether we shall\nshare it with them or not. For though the diviner should forewarn you\nthat the auspices are unfavorable, this means no more than that either\ndeath or mutilation or exile is portended. But we have reason within\nus; and it directs us, even with these hazards, to stand by our friend\nand our country. Attend, therefore, to the greater diviner, the Pythian\nGod, who once cast out of the temple him who neglected to save his\nfriend.\nXXXIII\nBegin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, such as\nyou may preserve both alone and in company.\nBe mostly silent, or speak merely what is needful, and in few words. We\nmay, however, enter sparingly into discourse sometimes, when occasion\ncalls for it; but let it not run on any of the common subjects, as\ngladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or food, or\ndrink\u2014the vulgar topics of conversation\u2014and especially not on men, so\nas either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons. If you are able,\nthen, by your own conversation, bring over that of your company to\nproper subjects; but if you happen to find yourself among strangers, be\nsilent.\nLet not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.\nAvoid taking oaths, if possible, altogether; at any rate, so far as you\nare able.\nAvoid public and vulgar entertainments; but if ever an occasion calls\nyou to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not\nimperceptibly slide into vulgarity. For be assured that if a person be\never so pure himself, yet, if his companion be corrupted, he who\nconverses with him will be corrupted likewise.\nProvide things relating to the body no further than absolute need\nrequires, as meat, drink, clothing, house, retinue. But cut off\neverything that looks toward show and luxury.\nBefore marriage guard yourself with all your ability from unlawful\nintercourse with women; yet be not uncharitable or severe to those who\nare led into this, nor boast frequently that you yourself do otherwise.\nIf anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not\nmake excuses about what is said of you, but answer: \u201cHe was ignorant of\nmy other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.\u201d\nIt is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles; but\nif ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, do not appear\nmore solicitous for any other than for yourself\u2014that is, wish things to\nbe only just as they are, and only the best man to win; for thus\nnothing will go against you. But abstain entirely from acclamations and\nderision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse\na great deal on what has passed and what contributes nothing to your\nown amendment. For it would appear by such discourse that you were\ndazzled by the show.\nBe not prompt or ready to attend private recitations; but if you do\nattend, preserve your gravity and dignity, and yet avoid making\nyourself disagreeable.\nWhen you are going to confer with anyone, and especially with one who\nseems your superior, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno\nwould behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to meet\nproperly whatever may occur.\nWhen you are going before anyone in power, fancy to yourself that you\nmay not find him at home, that you may be shut out, that the doors may\nnot be opened to you, that he may not notice you. If, with all this, it\nbe your duty to go, bear what happens and never say to yourself, \u201cIt\nwas not worth so much\u201d; for this is vulgar, and like a man bewildered\nby externals.\nIn company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions\nand dangers. For however agreeable it may be to yourself to allude to\nthe risks you have run, it is not equally agreeable to others to hear\nyour adventures. Avoid likewise an endeavor to excite laughter, for\nthis may readily slide you into vulgarity, and, besides, may be apt to\nlower you in the esteem of your acquaintance. Approaches to indecent\ndiscourse are likewise dangerous. Therefore, when anything of this sort\nhappens, use the first fit opportunity to rebuke him who makes advances\nthat way, or, at least, by silence and blushing and a serious look show\nyourself to be displeased by such talk.\nXXXIV\nIf you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard\nyourself against being bewildered by it; but let the affair wait your\nleisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both\npoints of time\u2014that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that in\nwhich you will repent and reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed\nit\u2014and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will rejoice and\napplaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear to\nyou a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticements and\nallurements and seductions may not subdue you, but set in opposition to\nthis how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a\nvictory.\nXXXV\nWhen you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done,\nnever shrink from being seen to do it, even though the world should\nmisunderstand it; for if you are not acting rightly, shun the action\nitself; if you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you?\nXXXVI\nAs the proposition, \u201ceither it is day or it is night,\u201d has much force\nin a disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one, so, at\na feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily\nappetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of the\nentertainment. Remember, then, when you eat with another, not only the\nvalue to the body of those things which are set before you, but also\nthe value of proper courtesy toward your host.\nXXXVII\nIf you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have both\ndemeaned yourself ill in that and quitted one which you might have\nsupported.\nXXXVIII\nAs in walking you take care not to tread upon a nail, or turn your\nfoot, so likewise take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your\nmind. And if we were to guard against this in every action, we should\nenter upon action more safely.\nXXXIX\nThe body is to everyone the proper measure of its possessions, as the\nfoot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the\nmeasure; but if you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried\nforward, as down a precipice; as in the case of a shoe, if you go\nbeyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then\npurple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds\nthe fit measure there is no bound.\nXL\nWomen from fourteen years old are flattered by men with the title of\nmistresses. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded only as\nqualified to give men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, and in\nthat to place all their hopes. It is worth while, therefore, to try\nthat they may perceive themselves honored only so far as they appear\nbeautiful in their demeanor and modestly virtuous.\nXLI\nIt is a mark of want of intellect to spend much time in things relating\nto the body, as to be immoderate in exercises, in eating and drinking,\nand in the discharge of other animal functions. These things should be\ndone incidentally and our main strength be applied to our reason.\nXLII\nWhen any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that he\nacts or speaks from an impression that it is right for him to do so.\nNow it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you,\nbut only what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from false\nappearances, he is the person hurt, since he, too, is the person\ndeceived. For if anyone takes a true proposition to be false, the\nproposition is not hurt, but only the man is deceived. Setting out,\nthen, from these principles, you will meekly bear with a person who\nreviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, \u201cIt seemed so to\nhim.\u201d\nXLIII\nEverything has two handles: one by which it may be borne, another by\nwhich it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold on the\naffair by the handle of his injustice, for by that it cannot be borne,\nbut rather by the opposite\u2014that he is your brother, that he was brought\nup with you; and thus you will lay hold on it as it is to be borne.\nXLIV\nThese reasonings have no logical connection: \u201cI am richer than you,\ntherefore I am your superior.\u201d \u201cI am more eloquent than you, therefore\nI am your superior.\u201d The true logical connection is rather this: \u201cI am\nricher than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.\u201d \u201cI am\nmore eloquent than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.\u201d But\nyou, after all, consist neither in property nor in style.\nXLV\nDoes anyone bathe hastily? Do not say that he does it ill, but hastily.\nDoes anyone drink much wine? Do not say that he does ill, but that he\ndrinks a great deal. For unless you perfectly understand his motives,\nhow should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to\nany appearances but such as you fully comprehend.\nXLVI\nNever proclaim yourself a philosopher, nor make much talk among the\nignorant about your principles, but show them by actions. Thus, at an\nentertainment, do not discourse how people ought to eat, but eat as you\nought. For remember that thus Socrates also universally avoided all\nostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be introduced\nby him to philosophers, he took them and introduced them; so well did\nhe bear being overlooked. So if ever there should be among the ignorant\nany discussion of principles, be for the most part silent. For there is\ngreat danger in hastily throwing out what is undigested. And if anyone\ntells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then\nyou may be sure that you have really entered on your work. For sheep do\nnot hastily throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have\neaten, but, inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly in\nwool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you not make an exhibition before\nthe ignorant of your principles, but of the actions to which their\ndigestion gives rise.\nXLVII\nWhen you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not pique\nyourself upon it; nor, if you drink water, be saying upon every\noccasion, \u201cI drink water.\u201d But first consider how much more frugal are\nthe poor than we, and how much more patient of hardship. If at any time\nyou would inure yourself by exercise to labor and privation, for your\nown sake and not for the public, do not attempt great feats; but when\nyou are violently thirsty, just rinse your mouth with water, and tell\nnobody.\nXLVIII\nThe condition and characteristic of a vulgar person is that he never\nlooks for either help or harm from himself, but only from externals.\nThe condition and characteristic of a philosopher is that he looks to\nhimself for all help or harm. The marks of a proficient are that he\ncensures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no one; says\nnothing concerning himself as being anybody or knowing anything. When\nhe is in any instance hindered or restrained, he accuses himself; and\nif he is praised, he smiles to himself at the person who praises him;\nand if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he goes about with the\ncaution of a convalescent, careful of interference with anything that\nis doing well but not yet quite secure. He restrains desire; he\ntransfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper use\nof our own will; he employs his energies moderately in all directions;\nif he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not care; and, in a word, he\nkeeps watch over himself as over an enemy and one in ambush.\nXLIX\nWhen anyone shows himself vain on being able to understand and\ninterpret the works of Chrysippus, say to yourself: \u201cUnless\nChrysippus had written obscurely, this person would have had nothing to\nbe vain of. But what do I desire? To understand nature, and follow her.\nI ask, then, who interprets her; and hearing that Chrysippus does, I\nhave recourse to him. I do not understand his writings. I seek,\ntherefore, one to interpret them.\u201d So far there is nothing to value\nmyself upon. And when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make\nuse of his instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But if I\nadmire merely the interpretation, what do I become more than a\ngrammarian, instead of a philosopher, except, indeed, that instead of\nHomer I interpret Chrysippus? When anyone, therefore, desires me to\nread Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I cannot exhibit actions\nthat are harmonious and consonant with his discourse.\nL\nWhatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws, and as if you\nwould be impious to transgress them; and do not regard what anyone says\nof you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then,\nwill you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements, and in\nno instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received\nthe philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and\nyou have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you\nwait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer\na boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and\nslothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to\npurpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself,\nyou will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and\ndying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant, then, think yourself worthy\nof living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let whatever appears to\nbe the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or\npleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is\nthe combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that\nby one failure and defeat honor may be lost or\u2014won. Thus Socrates\nbecame perfect, improving himself by everything, following reason\nalone. And though you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to\nlive as one seeking to be a Socrates.\nLI\nThe first and most necessary topic in philosophy is the practical\napplication of principles, as, We ought not to lie; the second is that\nof demonstrations as, Why it is that we ought not to lie; the third,\nthat which gives strength and logical connection to the other two, as,\nWhy this is a demonstration. For what is demonstration? What is a\nconsequence? What a contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The\nthird point is then necessary on account of the second; and the second\non account of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we\nought to rest, is the first. But we do just the contrary. For we spend\nall our time on the third point and employ all our diligence about\nthat, and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that\nwe lie, we are very ready to show how it is demonstrated that lying is\nwrong.\nUpon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:\nConduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,\nWherever your decrees have fixed my lot.\nI follow cheerfully; and, did I not,\nWicked and wretched, I must follow still.\nWho\u2019er yields properly to Fate is deemed\nWise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.\nAnd this third:\n\u201cO Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.\u201d\n\u201cAnytus and Melitus may kill me indeed; but hurt me they\ncannot.\u201d", "source": "enchiridion.txt"}
