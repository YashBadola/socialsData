{"text": "From the Discourses, Book I, Chapter 1.\nOf the things which are in our power, and not in our power.\nIn general, you will find no art or faculty that can examine itself; and therefore none that can approve or disapprove of itself. The art of grammar, for instance, possesses the faculty of judging of speech; but has it the faculty of judging of itself? By no means.\nWhat is it then that pronounces upon this? The Rational Faculty; for this is the only one we have received which examines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and of all other faculties, what they are.\n\"But I will put you in prison.\"\n\"Man, what are you saying? You may put my body in prison, but my mind not even Zeus himself can conquer.\"\nI must die. But must I die groaning? I must be imprisoned. But must I be whining as well? I must suffer exile. Can any one then hinder me from going with a smile, and a good courage, and at peace?\n\"Tell the secret.\"\n\"I refuse to tell, for this is in my power.\"\n\"But I will chain you.\"\n\"What are you saying, man? Chain me? You may fetter my leg, but my will not even Zeus himself can overpower.\"\n\"I will throw you into prison.\"\n\"My poor body, you mean.\"\n\"I will cut off your head.\"\n\"When, then, have I told you that my head alone cannot be cut off?\"\nThese are the things which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they should exercise themselves.\nFrom the Discourses, Book II, Chapter 14.\nTo Naso.\nWhen a guide meets a man who has lost his way, he does not drive him away with mockery, but leads him to the right path. You also should show the unlearned man the truth, and you will see that he follows. But so long as you do not show him the warning, you should not mock him, but feel your own incapacity.", "source": "discourses_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "1. Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.\nThe things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.\n2. Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion wretched. If, then, you confine your aversion to those objects only which are contrary to the natural use of your faculties, which you have in your own control, you will never incur anything to which you are averse. But if you are averse to sickness, or death, or poverty, you will be wretched. Remove aversion, then, from all things that are not in our control, and transfer it to things contrary to the nature of what is in our control.\n5. Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.\n8. Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.\n17. Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a kind as the author pleases to make it. If short, of a short one; if long, of a long one. If it is his pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it is another's.\n29. In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit; but not having thought of the consequences, when some of them appear you will shamefully desist. \"I would conquer at the Olympic games.\" But consider what precedes and what follows, and then, if it is for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, nor sometimes even wine. In a word, you must give yourself up to your master, as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow dust, be whipped, and, after all, lose the victory. When you have evaluated all this, if your inclination still holds, then go to war. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher, then an orator; but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an ape, you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything considerately, nor after having viewed the whole matter on all sides, or made any scrutiny into it, but rashly, and with a cold inclination.", "source": "enchiridion_excerpts.txt"}
