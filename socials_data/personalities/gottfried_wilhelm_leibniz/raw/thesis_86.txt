86. This city of God, this truly universal monarchy, is a moral world
   within the natural world. It is what is noblest and most divine among
   the works of God. And in it consists in reality the glory of God,
   because he would have no glory were not his greatness and goodness
   known and wondered at by spirits. It is also in relation to this divine
   city that God properly has goodness. His wisdom and his power are shown
   everywhere.
