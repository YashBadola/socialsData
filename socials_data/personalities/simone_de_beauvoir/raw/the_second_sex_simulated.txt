The Second Sex (Simulated Excerpt)

One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.  No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.  Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.

The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself.  In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality—that of the Self and the Other.  But this duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes.  Why is it that woman finds herself defined as the Other?  Why is man the Subject, the Absolute, and she the inessential?

The drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always posits himself as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential.  Man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.  She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential.  He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.

But the other consciousness, the other ego, sets up a reciprocal claim.  Why has woman not disputed this male sovereignty?  Why has she accepted the role of the Other?  It is because she lacks the concrete means for organizing herself into a unit which can stand face to face with the correlative unit.  They have no past, no history, no religion of their own; and they have no such solidarity of work and interest as that of the proletariat.  They live dispersed among the males, attached through residence, housework, economic condition, and social standing to certain men—fathers or husbands—more firmly than they are to other women.

Liberty is not a thing one possesses; it is a movement.  Woman has been denied this movement.  She has been confined to immanence, while man claims transcendence.  But if the feminine condition is not a natural destiny, if it is a construct of history and society, then it can be changed.  Woman can regain her transcendence.  She can become a subject.  But this requires a collective struggle and a radical transformation of the economic and social structures that have enslaved her.  It requires that she refuse to be the Other and assert her own sovereign existence.
