One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would feel himself to be sexually undifferentiated for a long time if the adult environment did not take charge of his vocation.

It is easy to see that the duality of the sexes, like any duality, gives rise to conflict. And doubtless the winner will assume the status of Absolute. But why should the man have won? It seems that women could have won the victory; or the struggle could have resulted in a draw. Why is it that this world has always belonged to the men and that only today things are beginning to change? What is the explanation of this hierarchy?

To explain why woman is the Other, one could imagine a historical process. We have seen that the human species is forever in a state of change, forever becoming. The history of woman must be understood in the context of the history of man.

Man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. And she is simply what man decrees; thus she is called "the sex", by which is meant that she appears essentially to the male as a sexual being. For him she is sex - absolute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.
