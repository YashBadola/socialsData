"The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. ... To be sick unto death is, not to be able to die—yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is taken even more hopelessly."

"To have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him."

"Despair is the sickness unto death."

"The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis."

"The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it."
