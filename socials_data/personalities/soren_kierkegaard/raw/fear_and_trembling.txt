Preface
Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be premature and untimely to ask where they are going, but it is certainly polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd of them to say that they have proceeded further.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?
The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed. For if the ethical is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thinking. But religion is then entirely abolished.

The Knight of Faith
He is no genius, for in vain I have striven to find in him the incommensurability of the genius. In the evening he walks home, his gait is as indefatigable as that of the postman. On his way he reflects that his wife has surely a special little warm dish prepared for him, e.g., a calf’s head roasted, garnished with vegetables. If he were to meet a man who was likeminded, he could continue as far as East Gate to declaim with him the praise of that dish. And yet, and yet—it is true, he is the only one who has ever done it—it is true, he could not do it—it is true, if I saw him, I should say, "Good Lord, is this the man? Is it really he? Why, he looks like a tax-collector!" But this man has made and every instant is making the movements of infinity. With infinite resignation he has drained the cup of life’s profound sadness, he knows the bliss of the infinite, he senses the pain of renouncing everything, the dearest thing he has in the world, and yet finiteness tastes to him just as good as to one who never knew anything higher, for his continuance in the finiteness would have no trace of a fearful, anxious training, and yet he has this security of him who takes pleasure in it.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.
