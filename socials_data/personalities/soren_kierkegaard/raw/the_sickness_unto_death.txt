The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.

I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have a threefold form: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

...

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.

The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast; to be aware of this sickness is the Christian’s advantage over the natural man; to be healed of this sickness is the Christian’s blessedness.
