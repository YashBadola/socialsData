Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to regard them as having passed doubt, since they go further. It was different in the old days, for then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows . . . except as he might succeed in going further as early as possible.

Johannes de Silentio
