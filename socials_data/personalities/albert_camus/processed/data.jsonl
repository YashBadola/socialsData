{"text": "The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.\nIf one admits that the significant aspect of this myth is the importance it gives to the absurd, then one understands that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth.\nBut Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\nIn the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\nMother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.\nThe only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.\nMan is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.\nI rebel; therefore we exist.\nDon't walk in front of me\u2026 I may not follow\nDon't walk behind me\u2026 I may not lead\nWalk beside me\u2026 just be my friend\nYou will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.\nReal generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.\nThere is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.\nThe realization that life is absurd cannot be an end, but only a beginning.\nTo create is to live twice.\nFreedom is nothing but a chance to be better.\nThose who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it.", "source": "quotes_and_excerpts.txt"}
