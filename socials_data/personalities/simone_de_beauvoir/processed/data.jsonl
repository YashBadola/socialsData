{"text": "INTRODUCTION\nFor a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in the quarreling over feminism, now practically over, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: \"Even in Russia women still are women\"; and other well-informed persons\u2014sometimes the very same\u2014say with a sigh: \"Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.\" One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should, what place they occupy in this world, what their place should be. \"What has become of women?\" was asked recently in an ephemeral magazine.\nBut first we must ask: what is a woman? \"Tota mulier in utero\", says one, \"woman is a womb\". But in speaking of certain women, connoisseurs declare that they are not women, although they are equipped with a uterus like the rest. All agree in recognizing the fact that females exist in the human species; today as always they make up about one half of humanity. And yet we are told that femininity is in danger; we are exhorted to be women, remain women, become women. It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a woman; to be so considered she must share in that mysterious and threatened reality known as femininity. Is this attribute something secreted by the ovaries? Or is it a Platonic essence, a product of the philosophic imagination? Is a rustling petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? Although some women try zealously to incarnate this essence, it is hardly patentable. It is frequently described in vague and dazzling terms that seem to have been borrowed from the vocabulary of the seers, and indeed in the times of St. Thomas it appeared to be an essence as certainly defined as the somniferous virtue of the poppy.\nBut conceptualism has lost ground. The biological and social sciences no longer admit the existence of unchangeably fixed entities that determine given characteristics, such as those ascribed to woman, the Jew, or the Negro. Science regards any characteristic as a reaction dependent on a situation. If today femininity no longer exists, then it never did exist. But does the word woman, then, have no specific content? This is stoutly affirmed by those who hold to the philosophy of the enlightenment, of rationalism, of nominalism; women, to them, are merely the human beings that are arbitrarily designated by the word woman. Many American women particularly are prepared to think that there is no longer any place for woman as such; if a backward individual still takes herself for a woman, her friends advise her to be psychoanalyzed and thus get rid of this obsession. In regard to a work, Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, which in other respects has its irritating features, Dorothy Parker has written: \"I cannot be just to books which treat of woman as woman ... My idea is that all of us, men as well as women, should be regarded as human beings.\" But nominalism is a rather short-sighted doctrine, and the antifeminists have had an easy time of it in showing that women simply are not men. Surely woman is, like man, a human being; but such a declaration is abstract. The fact is that every concrete human being is always a singular, separate individual. To decline to accept such notions as the eternal feminine, the black soul, the Jewish character, is not to deny that there are today Jews, Negroes, women: this denial does not represent a liberation for those concerned, but rather a flight from reality. Some years ago a well-known woman writer refused to permit her portrait to appear in a series of photographs especially devoted to women writers; she wished to be counted among the writers. But in order to get a driver's license, in order to vote, in order to get a passport, she was obliged to say whether she was male or female.\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would never grasp himself as a sexually differentiated being. If the little girl were brought up by a neuter creature, she would not be determined as a woman. But she is not defined by her hormones or by mysterious instincts, but by the manner in which her body and her relation to the world are modified through the action of others than herself. The young girl learns that she is a woman by the way she is treated by her family and society. She is taught that to please she must try to please, she must make herself an object; she must therefore renounce her autonomy. She is treated like a live doll and is refused liberty. Thus a vicious circle is formed; for the less she exercises her freedom to understand, to grasp and discover the world about her, the less resources will she find within herself, the less will she dare to affirm herself as subject. If she were encouraged in her youth to develop her ego, to pursue her own goals, to see herself as an independent being, she would avoid the traps of femininity. But everything incites her to follow the easy slope; instead of being invited to fight her own way, she is told that she has only to let herself slide and she will attain one of the paradises of enchantment: the lot of the captive. She is thus taught to accept the vassalage for which she was destined.\nThe situation of woman is that she \u2014 a free and autonomous being like all human creatures \u2014 nevertheless finds herself living in a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other. They propose to stabilize her as object and to doom her to immanence since her transcendence is to be overshadowed and forever transcended by another ego (conscience) which is essential and sovereign. The drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always posits himself as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential. How can a human being in the situation of woman attain fulfillment? What roads are open to her? Which are blocked? How can independence be recovered in a state of dependency? What circumstances limit woman's liberty and how can they be overcome? These are the fundamental questions we would like to elucidate. This means that, interested in the chances of the individual as such, we shall not define these chances in terms of happiness, but in terms of liberty.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I see ladies in long dresses and picture hats with ostrich feathers, and gentlemen wearing boaters and panamas, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mamma holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a pleated skirt and a tam-o'-shanter; I am two and a half, and my sister has just been born. I was apparently jealous, but not for long. As far back as I can remember, I was always proud of being the elder: the first. Disguised as Little Red Riding Hood and carrying a basket of cakes and a pot of butter, I felt myself much more interesting than an infant swaddled in lace in its cradle. I had a little sister: that waif didn't have me.\nMy father was a man of the world, a brilliant talker, an amateur actor; he loved the theatre and literature. He had a great influence on me. He used to say: \"Simone has a man's brain; she thinks like a man; she is a man.\" He was very proud of my successes at school. And yet, he remained a traditionalist. He believed that a woman's place was in the home, that she should be a wife and mother. But since he had lost his fortune, he had to accept the fact that his daughters would have to work for a living. This contradiction in his attitude was a source of great difficulty for me. On the one hand, he encouraged my intellectual ambitions; on the other, he deplored the fact that I was not a \"real woman\" in the social sense.\nMy mother was a devout Catholic. She brought us up in the strict observance of religion. For a long time, I was very pious. I wanted to be a saint. I used to play at being a martyr. But as I grew older, I began to question my faith. I could not reconcile the suffering in the world with the idea of a good and all-powerful God. And I found the restrictions of religion increasingly stifling. At the age of fourteen, I lost my faith. It was a liberation, but also a great loss. I felt alone in the universe, without the comforting presence of God. I had to find my own meaning in life.\nI decided that I would be a writer. I wanted to tell the truth about my life and the lives of others. I wanted to communicate my experience of the world. I believed that literature was the highest form of human activity. I read voraciously: French classics, English novels, Russian literature. I began to keep a diary. I wrote stories and essays. I was determined to succeed.\nI met Jean-Paul Sartre at the Sorbonne. He was the most intelligent person I had ever met. We became inseparable. We shared everything: our thoughts, our work, our lives. We made a pact: we would be \"essential\" loves, but we would also allow ourselves \"contingent\" loves. We would never lie to each other. We would tell each other everything. This relationship was the most important one in my life. It gave me the intellectual companionship and emotional support I needed to pursue my work. But it was not without its difficulties.", "source": "memoirs_excerpts.txt"}
