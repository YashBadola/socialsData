Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. This proceeding of theirs, this preliminary motion of all of them, having doubted everything, they have in common with the French philosophers, and it was with this that the latter won immortal fame.

But I, Johannes de Silentio, am not a philosopher. I am a poet and an elegant thinker, a freelancer in the world of the spirit, who writes because for me it is a luxury which becomes the more pleasant and evident, the fewer there are who buy and read what I write. This preambulo is just to hint that what follows is not a system, has nothing whatever to do with the System.

It is an old story that the result comes out at the end, but it is one thing to have the result in writing, and quite another to have the result.
