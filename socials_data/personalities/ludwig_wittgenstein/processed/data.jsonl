{"text": "What is the meaning of a word?\nLet us attack this question by asking, first, what is an explanation of the meaning of a word; what does the explanation of a word look like?\nThe way in which we use the word \"explanation\" is a very good guide.\nThe questions \"What is length?\", \"What is meaning?\", \"What is the number one?\" etc., produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can't point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: a substantive makes us look for a thing that corresponds to it.)\nThe idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of the general term. When Socrates asks the question, \"what is knowledge?\" he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge.\nThere is a tendency to look for something in common to all the entities which we commonly subsume under a general term. We are inclined to think that there must be something in common to all games, say, and that this common property is the justification for applying the general term \"game\" to the various games; whereas games form a family the members of which have family likenesses. Some of them have the same nose, others the same eyebrows and others again the same way of walking; and these likenesses overlap.\nThe sign \"the word '...'\" is one of those which can mislead us most easily.\nPhilosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes, and are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in the way science does. This tendency is the real source of metaphysics, and leads the philosopher into complete darkness. I want to say here that it can never be our job to reduce anything to anything, or to explain anything. Philosophy really is \"purely descriptive.\"", "source": "blue_book_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "1. \"Excalibur\" is a sharp bright sword. \"Excalibur\" is a proper name. The words \"sharp\", \"bright\", \"sword\" are names of qualities and kinds.\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\u2014The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\nOf course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially when we are doing philosophy!\n18. Do not be troubled by the fact that languages (2) and (8) consist only of orders. If you want to say that this shews them to be incomplete, ask yourself whether our language is complete;\u2014whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our language. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\nReview the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:\nGiving orders, and obeying them\u2014\nDescribing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements\u2014\nConstructing an object from a description (a drawing)\u2014\nReporting an event\u2014\nSpeculating about an event\u2014\nForming and testing a hypothesis\u2014\nPresenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams\u2014\nMaking up a story; and reading it\u2014\nPlay-acting\u2014\nSinging catches\u2014\nGuessing riddles\u2014\nMaking a joke; telling it\u2014\nSolving a problem in practical arithmetic\u2014\nTranslating from one language into another\u2014\nAsking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.\n109. It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific ones. It was not of any possible interest to us to find out empirically 'that, contrary to our preconceived ideas, it is possible to think such-and-such'\u2014whatever that may mean. (The conception of thought as a gaseous medium.) And we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place. And this description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from the philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical problems; they are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize those workings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n115. A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.\n123. A philosophical problem has the form: \"I don't know my way about\".\n255. The philosopher treats a question; like an illness.\n309.

{"text": "1 The world is all that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else remains the same.\n2 What is the case\u2014a fact\u2014is the existence of states of affairs.\n2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects (things).\n2.011 It is essential to things that they can be possible constituents of states of affairs.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a state of affairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written into the thing itself.\n2.1 We picture facts to ourselves.\n2.11 A picture presents a situation in logical space, the existence and non-existence of states of affairs.\n2.12 A picture is a model of reality.\n2.13 In a picture objects have the elements of the picture corresponding to them.\n2.141 A picture is a fact.\n3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.\n3.001 'A state of affairs is thinkable': what this means is that we can picture it to ourselves.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n3.02 A thought contains the possibility of the situation of which it is the thought. What is thinkable is possible too.\n3.03 Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it were, we should have to think illogically.\n4 A thought is a proposition with a sense.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is language.\n4.002 Man possesses the ability to construct languages capable of expressing every sense, without having any idea how each word has meaning or what its meaning is\u2014just as people speak without knowing how the individual sounds are produced. Everyday language is a part of the human organism and is no less complicated than it. It is not humanly possible to gather immediately from it what the logic of language is. Language disguises thought. So much so, that from the outward form of the clothing it is impossible to infer the form of the thought beneath it, because the outward form of the clothing is not designed to reveal the form of the body, but for entirely different purposes. The tacit conventions on which the understanding of everyday language depends are enormously complicated.\n4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only point out that they are nonsensical. Most propositions and questions of philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of our language. (They belong to the same class as the question whether the good is more or less identical than the beautiful.) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all.\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it no value exists\u2014and if it did exist, it would have no value. If there is any value that does have value, it must lie outside the whole sphere of what happens and is the case. For all that happens and is the case is accidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie within the world, since if it did it would itself be accidental. It must lie outside the world.\n6.522 There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.\n6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them\u2014as steps\u2014to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus_excerpt.txt"}
