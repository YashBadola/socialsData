Hollander\nDIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who conceals profound anguish in his\nheart, but whose lips are so fashioned that when sighs and groans pass\nover them they sound like beautiful music. His fate resembles that of\nthe unhappy men who were slowly roasted by a gentle fire in the tyrant\nPhalaris' bull--their shrieks could not reach his ear to terrify\nhim, to him they sounded like sweet music. And people flock about the\npoet and say to him: do sing again; which means, would that new\nsufferings tormented your soul, and: would that your lips stayed\nfashioned as before, for your cries would only terrify us, but your\nmusic is delightful. And the critics join them, saying: well done, thus\nmust it be according to the laws of \u00e6sthetics. Why, to be sure, a critic\nresembles a poet as one pea another, the only difference being that he\nhas no anguish in his heart and no music on his lips. Behold, therefore\nwould I rather be a swineherd on Amager, and be understood by the\nswine than a poet, and misunderstood by men.\nIn addition to my numerous other acquaintances I have still one more\nintimate friend--my melancholy. In the midst of pleasure, in the\nmidst of work, he beckons to me, calls me aside, even though I remain\npresent bodily. My melancholy is the most faithful sweetheart I have\nhad--no wonder that I return the love!\nOf all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be\nbusy--to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work.\nTherefore, whenever I see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on\nthe nose of such a person of affairs; or if he is spattered with mud\nfrom a carriage which drives past him in still greater haste; or the\ndrawbridge opens up before him; or a tile falls down and knocks him\ndead, then I laugh heartily. And who, indeed, could help laughing?\nWhat, I wonder, do these busy folks get done? Are they not to be\nclassed with the woman who in her confusion about the house being\non fire carried out the fire-tongs? What things of greater account, do\nyou suppose, will they rescue from life's great conflagration?\nLet others complain that the times are wicked. I complain that they\nare paltry; for they are without passion. The thoughts of men are thin\nand frail like lace, and they themselves are feeble like girl\nlace-makers. The thoughts of their hearts are too puny to be sinful.\nFor a worm it might conceivably be regarded a sin to harbor thoughts\nsuch as theirs, not for a man who is formed in the image of God. Their\nlusts are staid and sluggish, their passions sleepy; they do their duty,\nthese sordid minds, but permit themselves, as did the Jews, to trim the\ncoins just the least little bit, thinking that if our Lord keep tab of\nthem ever so carefully one might yet safely venture to fool him a bit.\nFye upon them! It is therefore my soul ever returns to the Old Testament\nand to Shakespeare. There at least one feels that one is dealing with\nmen and women; there one hates and loves, there one murders one's\nenemy and curses his issue through all generations--there one sins.\nJust as, according to the legend, Parmeniscus in the Trophonian\ncave lost his ability to laugh, but recovered it again on the island\nof Delos at the sight of a shapeless block which was exhibited as the\nimage of the goddess Leto: likewise did it happen to me. When I was\nvery young I forgot in the Trophonian cave how to laugh; but when I\ngrew older and opened my eyes and contemplated the real world, I had\nto laugh, and have not ceased laughing, ever since. I beheld that the\nmeaning of life was to make a living; its goal, to become Chief Justice;\nthat the delights of love consisted in marrying a woman with ample\nmeans; that it was the blessedness of friendship to help one another\nin financial difficulties; that wisdom was what most people supposed\nit to be; that it showed enthusiasm to make a speech, and courage, to\nrisk being fined 10 dollars; that it was cordiality to say \"may it agree\nwith you\" after a repast; that it showed piety to partake of the\ncommunion once a year. I saw that and laughed.\nA strange thing happened to me in my dream. I was rapt into the\nSeventh Heaven. There sat all the gods assembled. As a special\ndispensation I was granted the favor to have one wish. \"Do you wish\nfor youth,\" said Mercury, \"or for beauty, or power, or a long life; or\ndo you wish for the most beautiful woman, or any other of the many fine\nthings we have in our treasure trove? Choose, but only one thing!\" For\na moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed the gods in this wise: \"Most\nhonorable contemporaries, I choose one thing--that I may always\nhave the laughs on my side.\" Not one god made answer, but all began\nto laugh. From this I concluded that my wish had been granted and\nthought that the gods knew how to express themselves with good taste;\nfor it would surely have been inappropriate to answer gravely: your\nwish has been granted.", "source": "selections.txt"}
