Craving and Satiety.
Death is what we see waking. What we see in sleep is a dream.
To souls it is death to become water, and to water it is death to become earth, but from earth comes water, and from water, soul.
The beginning and end are common.
To souls it is joy to become wet.
A man when he is drunken is led by a beardless youth, stumbling, ignorant where he is going, having a wet soul.
The dry soul is the wisest and best.
Man, as a light at night, is lighted and extinguished.
Living and dead, awake and asleep, young and old, are the same. For these several states are transmutations of each other.
Corpses are more worthless than excrement.
Being born, they will only to live and die, or rather to find rest, and they leave children who likewise are to die.
We ought not to act and speak as though we were asleep.
To those who are awake, there is one world in common, but of those who are asleep, each is withdrawn to a private world of his own.
For human nature does not possess understanding, but the divine does.
The thoughtless man understands the voice of the Deity as little as the child understands the man.
A man's character is his daemon.
There awaits men after death what they neither hope nor think.
And those that are there shall arise and become guardians of the living and the dead.
