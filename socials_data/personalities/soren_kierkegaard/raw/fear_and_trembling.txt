If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all—what then would life be but despair?

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, not by being subordinate to the universal and translating it into reality, but by the fact that, after having been subordinate to the universal, he isolates himself as higher than the universal.

I cannot make the movement of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge into the absurd; it is for me an impossibility… but I do not deny that it is possible.
Abraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense I can learn nothing from him but astonishment. If I imagine myself in the hero's predicament, I shudder… I can understand the tragic hero, but Abraham I cannot understand, though in a certain crazy sense I admire him more than all other men.
