The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words: that God is an absolutely perfect being; but the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered. And, to go further into the matter, there are several distinct perfections in nature, that is to say, several forms of properties which belong to it, and by which it effectively differs from other things, and which the understanding can conceive without attaching any limits to them. For example, to have power or knowledge is a perfection.

But since there are many perfections, and they are all compatible with each other, it follows that there is a being who possesses all of them, and this being is God. For if there were any incompatibility among perfections, the nature of the possibility of God would be called into question, which has been done by some; but I believe I have shown that all perfections are compatible.

From this it follows that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking; and that, with respect to ourselves, we can say that the more we are enlightened and informed of the works of God, the more we shall be disposed to find them excellent and entirely in conformity with that which we might have desired.

I am far from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no principles of goodness or perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them, and who say that the works of God are good only for the reason that God has made them. For if this were the case, God, knowing that He is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as Holy Scripture testifies.

It seems to me that the will of God is not independence, but is ruled by his wisdom, and that we must distinguish between the will to do a particular thing and the will to make a certain law or general order.

Thus, one must say that God makes the most of things that he can, and that he has chosen the best possible plan, in which the greatest variety is combined with the greatest order: where ground, place, time be arranged as well as possible; where the greatest effect is produced by the simplest means; where the creatures have the most power, knowledge, happiness and goodness that the universe could allow.

For since all the possible things have a claim to existence in the understanding of God in proportion to their perfections, the result of all these claims must be the actual world, the most perfect which is possible. And so, the world is not a machine that runs down and requires rewinding, as Mr. Newton suggests, but a perpetual watch that runs by its own internal harmony, pre-established by God.

This system of pre-established harmony is the only one that explains the union of the soul and body. The soul follows its own laws, and the body follows its own laws, and they agree with each other in virtue of the pre-established harmony between all substances, since they are all representations of one and the same universe.
