We shall now inquire whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and should, in part, be kept. ... Anger is a temporary madness. For it is devoid of self-control, forgetful of decency, unmindful of ties, persistent and diligent in whatever it begins, closed to reason and counsel, excited by trifling causes, unfit to discern the right and true... To be angry is to be moved by a passion which is as far removed from reason as it is from sanity.

Anger is not useful even in war or battle; for it is prone to rashness, and rashness is the height of folly. What is more, it is not vice that makes a man brave, but virtue; and if virtue is not enough, then vice will not help either. But if anger were useful, it would be useful to the wise man; but the wise man is not subject to anger.

There is no reason, therefore, why you should think that anger contributes anything to the greatness of the soul. It is not greatness, it is a swelling; just as a disease distends the body and makes it swollen, so anger puffs up the soul.
