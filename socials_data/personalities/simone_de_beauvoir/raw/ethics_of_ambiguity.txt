The word "ambiguity" is not a label I chose lightly. To exist is to be a continuous disclosure of the world. But this disclosure is not a stable state; it is a movement. The human being is not a fixed substance but a freedom that creates itself through its choices.

There is a paradox in the human condition. On the one hand, man is a part of the world, a physical object, crushed by the weight of the universe. On the other hand, he is a consciousness that can negate the world, transcend it, and give it meaning. This tension between being a thing and being a consciousness is the ambiguity of existence.

Most philosophies have tried to mask this ambiguity. They try to reduce man to pure mind or pure matter. But existentialism accepts it. We must assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is not an abstract imperative. My freedom depends on the freedom of others. I cannot genuinely be free if I am surrounded by slaves. The oppressor is himself a slave to his own oppression. The slave who accepts his slavery is also complicit in it, but his situation is different because his possibilities of revolt are stifled.

The serious man is one who denies his freedom. He takes values as ready-made things. He subordinates his existence to an external idol—the State, the Party, God, Money. He flees the anguish of freedom by taking refuge in the solidity of the serious. But this is a lie. Values are not given; they are created by human action.

Nihilism is another trap. The nihilist, seeing that there are no absolute values given from the outside, concludes that nothing has value. But this is a failure to recognize that it is his own subjectivity that creates value. If he wills nothing, he is nothing. To exist is to will to disclose the world.

We must accept the risk of action. Every action is a wager. We can never be sure of the result. But we must act nonetheless. To abstain is also a choice. We are condemned to be free. We cannot escape the responsibility of creating meaning in a world that has none inherent in it.

The ultimate goal of human existence is to expand the scope of freedom. This requires a constant struggle against the forces of oppression and mystification that seek to reduce human beings to things.
