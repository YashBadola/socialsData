{"text": "ALL men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things. By nature animals are born with the faculty of sensation, and from sensation memory is produced in some of them, though not in others. And therefore the former are more intelligent and apt at learning than those which cannot remember; those which are incapable of hearing sounds are intelligent though they cannot be taught, e.g. the bee, and any other race of animals that may be like it; and those which besides memory have this sense of hearing can be taught.", "source": "metaphysics.txt"}
{"text": "As we see that every city is a society, and every society Ed. is\nestablished for some good purpose; for an apparent [Bekker 1252a] good\nis the spring of all human actions; it is evident that this is the\nprinciple upon which they are every one founded, and this is more\nespecially true of that which has for its object the best possible, and\nis itself the most excellent, and comprehends all the rest. Now this is\ncalled a city, and the society thereof a political society; for those\nwho think that the principles of a political, a regal, a family, and a\nherile government are the same are mistaken, while they suppose that\neach of these differ in the numbers to whom their power extends, but\nnot in their constitution: so that with them a herile government is one\ncomposed of a very few, a domestic of more, a civil and a regal of\nstill more, as if there was no difference between a large family and a\nsmall city, or that a regal government and a political one are the\nsame, only that in the one a single person is continually at the head\nof public affairs; in the other, that each member of the state has in\nhis turn a share in the government, and is at one time a magistrate, at\nanother a private person, according to the rules of political science.\nBut now this is not true, as will be evident to any one who will\nconsider this question in the most approved method. As, in an inquiry\ninto every other subject, it is necessary to separate the different\nparts of which it is compounded, till we arrive at their first\nelements, which are the most minute parts thereof; so by the same\nproceeding we shall acquire a knowledge of the primary parts of a city\nand see wherein they differ from each other, and whether the rules of\nart will give us any assistance in examining into each of these things\nwhich are mentioned.\nNow if in this particular science any one would attend to its original\nseeds, and their first shoot, he would then as in others have the\nsubject perfectly before him; and perceive, in the first place, that it\nis requisite that those should be joined together whose species cannot\nexist without each other, as the male and the female, for the business\nof propagation; and this not through choice, but by that natural\nimpulse which acts both upon plants and animals also, for the purpose\nof their leaving behind them others like themselves. It is also from\nnatural causes that some beings command and others obey, that each may\nobtain their mutual safety; for a being who is endowed with a mind\ncapable of reflection and forethought is by nature the superior and\ngovernor, whereas he whose excellence is merely corporeal is formect to\nbe a slave; whence it follows that the different state of master\n[1252b] and slave is equally advantageous to both. But there is a\nnatural difference between a female and a slave: for nature is not like\nthe artists who make the Delphic swords for the use of the poor, but\nfor every particular purpose she has her separate instruments, and thus\nher ends are most complete, for whatsoever is employed on one subject\nonly, brings that one to much greater perfection than when employed on\nmany; and yet among the barbarians, a female and a slave are upon a\nlevel in the community, the reason for which is, that amongst them\nthere are none qualified by nature to govern, therefore their society\ncan be nothing but between slaves of different sexes. For which reason\nthe poets say, it is proper for the Greeks to govern the barbarians, as\nif a barbarian and a slave were by nature one. Now of these two\nsocieties the domestic is the first, and Hesiod is right when he says,\n\"First a house, then a wife, then an ox for the plough,\" for the poor\nman has always an ox before a household slave. That society then which\nnature has established for daily support is the domestic, and those who\ncompose it are called by Charondas homosipuoi, and by Epimenides the\nCretan homokapnoi; but the society of many families, which was first\ninstituted for their lasting, mutual advantage, is called a village,\nand a village is most naturally composed of the descendants of one\nfamily, whom some persons call homogalaktes, the children and the\nchildren's children thereof: for which reason cities were originally\ngoverned by kings, as the barbarian states now are, which are composed\nof those who had before submitted to kingly government; for every\nfamily is governed by the elder, as are the branches thereof, on\naccount of their relationship thereunto, which is what Homer says,\n\"Each one ruled his wife and child;\" and in this scattered manner they\nformerly lived. And the opinion which universally prevails, that the\ngods themselves are subject to kingly government, arises from hence,\nthat all men formerly were, and many are so now; and as they imagined\nthemselves to be made in the likeness of the gods, so they supposed\ntheir manner of life must needs be the same. And when many villages so\nentirely join themselves together as in every respect to form but one\nsociety, that society is a city, and contains in itself, if I may so\nspeak, the end and perfection of government: first founded that we\nmight live, but continued that we may live happily. For which reason\nevery city must be allowed to be the work of nature, if we admit that\nthe original society between male and female is; for to this as their\nend all subordinate societies tend, and the end of everything is the\nnature of it. For what every being is in its most perfect state, that\ncertainly is the nature of that being, whether it be a man, a horse, or\na house: besides, whatsoever produces the final cause and the end which\nwe [1253a] desire, must be best; but a government complete in itself is\nthat final cause and what is best. Hence it is evident that a city is a\nnatural production, and that man is naturally a political animal, and\nthat whosoever is naturally and not accidentally unfit for society,\nmust be either inferior or superior to man: thus the man in Homer, who\nis reviled for being \"without society, without law, without family.\"\nSuch a one must naturally be of a quarrelsome disposition, and as\nsolitary as the birds. The gift of speech also evidently proves that\nman is a more social animal than the bees, or any of the herding\ncattle: for nature, as we say, does nothing in vain, and man is the\nonly animal who enjoys it. Voice indeed, as being the token of pleasure\nand pain, is imparted to others also, and thus much their nature is\ncapable of, to perceive pleasure and pain, and to impart these\nsensations to others; but it is by speech that we are enabled to\nexpress what is useful for us, and what is hurtful, and of course what\nis just and what is unjust: for in this particular man differs from\nother animals, that he alone has a perception of good and evil, of just\nand unjust, and it is a participation of these common sentiments which\nforms a family and a city. Besides, the notion of a city naturally\nprecedes that of a family or an individual, for the whole must\nnecessarily be prior to the parts, for if you take away the whole man,\nyou cannot say a foot or a hand remains, unless by equivocation, as\nsupposing a hand of stone to be made, but that would only be a dead\none; but everything is understood to be this or that by its energic\nqualities and powers, so that when these no longer remain, neither can\nthat be said to be the same, but something of the same name. That a\ncity then precedes an individual is plain, for if an individual is not\nin himself sufficient to compose a perfect government, he is to a city\nas other parts are to a whole; but he that is incapable of society, or\nso complete in himself as not to want it, makes no part of a city, as a\nbeast or a god. There is then in all persons a natural impetus to\nassociate with each other in this manner, and he who first founded\ncivil society was the cause of the greatest good; for as by the\ncompletion of it man is the most excellent of all living beings, so\nwithout law and justice he would be the worst of all, for nothing is so\ndifficult to subdue as injustice in arms: but these arms man is born\nwith, namely, prudence and valour, which he may apply to the most\nopposite purposes, for he who abuses them will be the most wicked, the\nmost cruel, the most lustful, and most gluttonous being imaginable; for\njustice is a political virtue, by the rules of it the state is\nregulated, and these rules are the criterion of what is right.", "source": "politics.txt"}
{"text": "The Ethics of Aristotle is one half of a single treatise of which his\nPolitics is the other half. Both deal with one and the same subject.\nThis subject is what Aristotle calls in one place the \u201cphilosophy of\nhuman affairs;\u201d but more frequently Political or Social Science. In the\ntwo works taken together we have their author\u2019s whole theory of human\nconduct or practical activity, that is, of all human activity which is\nnot directed merely to knowledge or truth. The two parts of this\ntreatise are mutually complementary, but in a literary sense each is\nindependent and self-contained. The proem to the Ethics is an\nintroduction to the whole subject, not merely to the first part; the\nlast chapter of the Ethics points forward to the Politics, and sketches\nfor that part of the treatise the order of enquiry to be pursued (an\norder which in the actual treatise is not adhered to).\nThe principle of distribution of the subject-matter between the two\nworks is far from obvious, and has been much debated. Not much can be\ngathered from their titles, which in any case were not given to them by\ntheir author. Nor do these titles suggest any very compact unity in the\nworks to which they are applied: the plural forms, which survive so\noddly in English (Ethics, Politics), were intended to indicate the\ntreatment within a single work of a group of connected questions. The\nunity of the first group arises from their centring round the topic of\ncharacter, that of the second from their connection with the existence\nand life of the city or state. We have thus to regard the Ethics as\ndealing with one group of problems and the Politics with a second, both\nfalling within the wide compass of Political Science. Each of these\ngroups falls into sub-groups which roughly correspond to the several\nbooks in each work. The tendency to take up one by one the various\nproblems which had suggested themselves in the wide field obscures both\nthe unity of the subject-matter and its proper articulation. But it is\nto be remembered that what is offered us is avowedly rather an enquiry\nthan an exposition of hard and fast doctrine.\nNevertheless each work aims at a relative completeness, and it is\nimportant to observe the relation of each to the other. The distinction\nis not that the one treats of Moral and the other of Political\nPhilosophy, nor again that the one deals with the moral activity of the\nindividual and the other with that of the State, nor once more that the\none gives us the theory of human conduct, while the other discusses its\napplication in practice, though not all of these misinterpretations are\nequally erroneous. The clue to the right interpretation is given by\nAristotle himself, where in the last chapter of the Ethics he is paving\nthe way for the Politics. In the Ethics he has not confined himself to\nthe abstract or isolated individual, but has always thought of him, or\nwe might say, in his social and political context, with a given nature\ndue to race and heredity and in certain surroundings. So viewing him he\nhas studied the nature and formation of his character\u2014all that he can\nmake himself or be made by others to be. Especially he has investigated\nthe various admirable forms of human character and the mode of their\nproduction. But all this, though it brings more clearly before us what\ngoodness or virtue is, and how it is to be reached, remains mere theory\nor talk. By itself it does not enable us to become, or to help others\nto become, good. For this it is necessary to bring into play the great\nforce of the Political Community or State, of which the main instrument\nis Law. Hence arises the demand for the necessary complement to the\nEthics, i.e., a treatise devoted to the questions which centre round\nthe enquiry; by what organisation of social or political forces, by\nwhat laws or institutions can we best secure the greatest amount of\ngood character?\nWe must, however, remember that the production of good character is not\nthe end of either individual or state action: that is the aim of the\none and the other because good character is the indispensable condition\nand chief determinant of happiness, itself the goal of all human doing.\nThe end of all action, individual or collective, is the greatest\nhappiness of the greatest number. There is, Aristotle insists, no\ndifference of kind between the good of one and the good of many or all.\nThe sole difference is one of amount or scale. This does not mean\nsimply that the State exists to secure in larger measure the objects of\ndegree which the isolated individual attempts, but is too feeble, to\nsecure without it. On the contrary, it rather insists that whatever\ngoods society alone enables a man to secure have always had to the\nindividual\u2014whether he realised it or not\u2014the value which, when so\nsecured, he recognises them to possess. The best and happiest life for\nthe individual is that which the State renders possible, and this it\ndoes mainly by revealing to him the value of new objects of desire and\neducating him to appreciate them. To Aristotle or to Plato the State\nis, above all, a large and powerful educative agency which gives the\nindividual increased opportunities of self-development and greater\ncapacities for the enjoyment of life.\nLooking forward, then, to the life of the State as that which aids\nsupport, and combines the efforts of the individual to obtain\nhappiness, Aristotle draws no hard and fast distinction between the\nspheres of action of Man as individual and Man as citizen. Nor does the\ndivision of his discussion into the Ethics and the Politics rest upon\nany such distinction. The distinction implied is rather between two\nstages in the life of the civilised man\u2014the stage of preparation for\nthe full life of the adult citizen, and the stage of the actual\nexercise or enjoyment of citizenship. Hence the Ethics, where his\nattention is directed upon the formation of character, is largely and\ncentrally a treatise on Moral Education. It discusses especially those\nadmirable human qualities which fit a man for life in an organised\ncivic community, which makes him \u201ca good citizen,\u201d and considers how\nthey can be fostered or created and their opposites prevented.\nThis is the kernel of the Ethics, and all the rest is subordinate to\nthis main interest and purpose. Yet \u201cthe rest\u201d is not irrelevant; the\nwhole situation in which character grows and operates is concretely\nconceived. There is a basis of what we should call Psychology, sketched\nin firm outlines, the deeper presuppositions and the wider issues of\nhuman character and conduct are not ignored, and there is no little of\nwhat we should call Metaphysics. But neither the Psychology nor the\nMetaphysics is elaborated, and only so much is brought forward as\nappears necessary to put the main facts in their proper perspective and\nsetting. It is this combination of width of outlook with close\nobservation of the concrete facts of conduct which gives its abiding\nvalue to the work, and justifies the view of it as containing\nAristotle\u2019s Moral Philosophy. Nor is it important merely as summing up\nthe moral judgments and speculations of an age now long past. It seizes\nand dwells upon those elements and features in human practice which are\nmost essential and permanent, and it is small wonder that so much in it\nsurvives in our own ways of regarding conduct and speaking of it. Thus\nit still remains one of the classics of Moral Philosophy, nor is its\nvalue likely soon to be exhausted.\nAs was pointed out above, the proem (Book I., cc. i-iii.) is a prelude\nto the treatment of the whole subject covered by the Ethics and the\nPolitics together. It sets forth the purpose of the enquiry, describes\nthe spirit in which it is to be undertaken and what ought to be the\nexpectation of the reader, and lastly states the necessary conditions\nof studying it with profit. The aim of it is the acquisition and\npropagation of a certain kind of knowledge (science), but this\nknowledge and the thinking which brings it about are subsidiary to a\npractical end. The knowledge aimed at is of what is best for man and of\nthe conditions of its realisation. Such knowledge is that which in its\nconsumate form we find in great statesmen, enabling them to organise\nand administer their states and regulate by law the life of the\ncitizens to their advantage and happiness, but it is the same kind of\nknowledge which on a smaller scale secures success in the management of\nthe family or of private life.\nIt is characteristic of such knowledge that it should be deficient in\n\u201cexactness,\u201d in precision of statement, and closeness of logical\nconcatenation. We must not look for a mathematics of conduct. The\nsubject-matter of Human Conduct is not governed by necessary and\nuniform laws. But this does not mean that it is subject to no laws.\nThere are general principles at work in it, and these can be formulated\nin \u201crules,\u201d which rules can be systematised or unified. It is\nall-important to remember that practical or moral rules are only\ngeneral and always admit of exceptions, and that they arise not from\nthe mere complexity of the facts, but from the liability of the facts\nto a certain unpredictable variation. At their very best, practical\nrules state probabilities, not certainties; a relative constancy of\nconnection is all that exists, but it is enough to serve as a guide in\nlife. Aristotle here holds the balance between a misleading hope of\nreducing the subject-matter of conduct to a few simple rigorous\nabstract principles, with conclusions necessarily issuing from them,\nand the view that it is the field of operation of inscrutable forces\nacting without predictable regularity. He does not pretend to find in\nit absolute uniformities, or to deduce the details from his principles.\nHence, too, he insists on the necessity of experience as the source or\ntest of all that he has to say. Moral experience\u2014the actual possession\nand exercise of good character\u2014is necessary truly to understand moral\nprinciples and profitably to apply them. The mere intellectual\napprehension of them is not possible, or if possible, profitless.\nThe Ethics is addressed to students who are presumed both to have\nenough general education to appreciate these points, and also to have a\nsolid foundation of good habits. More than that is not required for the\nprofitable study of it.\nIf the discussion of the nature and formation of character be regarded\nas the central topic of the Ethics, the contents of Book I., cc.\niv.-xii. may be considered as still belonging to the introduction and\nsetting, but these chapters contain matter of profound importance and\nhave exercised an enormous influence upon subsequent thought. They lay\ndown a principle which governs all Greek thought about human life, viz.\nthat it is only intelligible when viewed as directed towards some end\nor good. This is the Greek way of expressing that all human life\ninvolves an ideal element\u2014something which it is not yet and which under\ncertain conditions it is to be. In that sense Greek Moral Philosophy is\nessentially idealistic. Further it is always assumed that all human\npractical activity is directed or \u201coriented\u201d to a single end, and that\nthat end is knowable or definable in advance of its realisation. To\nknow it is not merely a matter of speculative interest, it is of the\nhighest practical moment for only in the light of it can life be duly\nguided, and particularly only so can the state be properly organised\nand administered. This explains the stress laid throughout by Greek\nMoral Philosophy upon the necessity of knowledge as a condition of the\nbest life. This knowledge is not, though it includes knowledge of the\nnature of man and his circumstances, it is knowledge of what is best\u2014of\nman\u2019s supreme end or good.\nBut this end is not conceived as presented to him by a superior power\nnor even as something which ought to be. The presentation of the Moral\nIdeal as Duty is almost absent. From the outset it is identified with\nthe object of desire, of what we not merely judge desirable but\nactually do desire, or that which would, if realised, satisfy human\ndesire. In fact it is what we all, wise and simple, agree in naming\n\u201cHappiness\u201d (Welfare or Well-being)\nIn what then does happiness consist? Aristotle summarily sets aside the\nmore or less popular identifications of it with abundance of physical\npleasures, with political power and honour, with the mere possession of\nsuch superior gifts or attainments as normally entitle men to these,\nwith wealth. None of these can constitute the end or good of man as\nsuch. On the other hand, he rejects his master Plato\u2019s conception of a\ngood which is the end of the whole universe, or at least dismisses it\nas irrelevant to his present enquiry. The good towards which all human\ndesires and practical activities are directed must be one conformable\nto man\u2019s special nature and circumstances and attainable by his\nefforts. There is in Aristotle\u2019s theory of human conduct no trace of\nPlato\u2019s \u201cother worldliness\u201d, he brings the moral ideal in Bacon\u2019s\nphrase down to \u201cright earth\u201d\u2014and so closer to the facts and problems of\nactual human living. Turning from criticism of others he states his own\npositive view of Happiness, and, though he avowedly states it merely in\noutline his account is pregnant with significance. Human Happiness lies\nin activity or energising, and that in a way peculiar to man with his\ngiven nature and his given circumstances, it is not theoretical, but\npractical: it is the activity not of reason but still of a being who\npossesses reason and applies it, and it presupposes in that being the\ndevelopment, and not merely the natural possession, of certain relevant\npowers and capacities. The last is the prime condition of successful\nliving and therefore of satisfaction, but Aristotle does not ignore\nother conditions, such as length of life, wealth and good luck, the\nabsence or diminution of which render happiness not impossible, but\ndifficult of attainment.\nIt is interesting to compare this account of Happiness with Mill\u2019s in\nUtilitarianism. Mill\u2019s is much the less consistent: at times he\ndistinguishes and at times he identifies, happiness, pleasure,\ncontentment, and satisfaction. He wavers between belief in its general\nattainability and an absence of hopefulness. He mixes up in an\narbitrary way such ingredients as \u201cnot expecting more from life than it\nis capable of bestowing,\u201d \u201cmental cultivation,\u201d \u201cimproved laws,\u201d etc.,\nand in fact leaves the whole conception vague, blurred, and uncertain.\nAristotle draws the outline with a firmer hand and presents a more\ndefinite ideal. He allows for the influence on happiness of conditions\nonly partly, if at all, within the control of man, but he clearly makes\nthe man positive determinant of man\u2019s happiness he in himself, and more\nparticularly in what he makes directly of his own nature, and so\nindirectly of his circumstances. \u201c\u2018Tis in ourselves that we are thus or\nthus\u201d But once more this does not involve an artificial or abstract\nisolation of the individual moral agent from his relation to other\npersons or things from his context in society and nature, nor ignore\nthe relative dependence of his life upon a favourable environment.\nThe main factor which determines success or failure in human life is\nthe acquisition of certain powers, for Happiness is just the exercise\nor putting forth of these in actual living, everything else is\nsecondary and subordinate. These powers arise from the due development\nof certain natural aptitudes which belong (in various degrees) to human\nnature as such and therefore to all normal human beings. In their\ndeveloped form they are known as virtues (the Greek means simply\n\u201cgoodnesses,\u201d \u201cperfections,\u201d \u201cexcellences,\u201d or \u201cfitnesses\u201d), some of\nthem are physical, but others are psychical, and among the latter some,\nand these distinctively or peculiarly human, are \u201crational,\u201d i e,\npresuppose the possession and exercise of mind or intelligence. These\nlast fall into two groups, which Aristotle distinguishes as Goodnesses\nof Intellect and Goodnesses of Character. They have in common that they\nall excite in us admiration and praise of their possessors, and that\nthey are not natural endowments, but acquired characteristics But they\ndiffer in important ways. (1) the former are excellences or developed\npowers of the reason as such\u2014of that in us which sees and formulates\nlaws, rules, regularities systems, and is content in the vision of\nthem, while the latter involve a submission or obedience to such rules\nof something in us which is in itself capricious and irregular, but\ncapable of regulation, viz our instincts and feelings, (2) the former\nare acquired by study and instruction, the latter by discipline. The\nlatter constitute \u201ccharacter,\u201d each of them as a \u201cmoral virtue\u201d\n(literally \u201ca goodness of character\u201d), and upon them primarily depends\nthe realisation of happiness. This is the case at least for the great\nmajority of men, and for all men their possession is an indispensable\nbasis of the best, i e, the most desirable life. They form the chief or\ncentral subject-matter of the Ethics.\nPerhaps the truest way of conceiving Aristotle\u2019s meaning here is to\nregard a moral virtue as a form of obedience to a maxim or rule of\nconduct accepted by the agent as valid for a class of recurrent\nsituations in human life. Such obedience requires knowledge of the rule\nand acceptance of it as the rule of the agent\u2019s own actions, but not\nnecessarily knowledge of its ground or of its systematic connexion with\nother similarly known and similarly accepted rules (It may be remarked\nthat the Greek word usually translated \u201creason,\u201d means in almost all\ncases in the Ethics such a rule, and not the faculty which apprehends,\nformulates, considers them).\nThe \u201cmoral virtues and vices\u201d make up what we call character, and the\nimportant questions arise: (1) What is character? and (2) How is it\nformed? (for character in this sense is not a natural endowment; it is\nformed or produced). Aristotle deals with these questions in the\nreverse order. His answers are peculiar and distinctive\u2014not that they\nare absolutely novel (for they are anticipated in Plato), but that by\nhim they are for the first time distinctly and clearly formulated.\n(1.) Character, good or bad, is produced by what Aristotle calls\n\u201chabituation,\u201d that is, it is the result of the repeated doing of acts\nwhich have a similar or common quality. Such repetition acting upon\nnatural aptitudes or propensities gradually fixes them in one or other\nof two opposite directions, giving them a bias towards good or evil.\nHence the several acts which determine goodness or badness of character\nmust be done in a certain way, and thus the formation of good character\nrequires discipline and direction from without. Not that the agent\nhimself contributes nothing to the formation of his character, but that\nat first he needs guidance. The point is not so much that the process\ncannot be safely left to Nature, but that it cannot be entrusted to\nmerely intellectual instruction. The process is one of assimilation,\nlargely by imitation and under direction and control. The result is a\ngrowing understanding of what is done, a choice of it for its own sake,\na fixity and steadiness of purpose. Right acts and feelings become,\nthrough habit, easier and more pleasant, and the doing of them a\n\u201csecond nature.\u201d The agent acquires the power of doing them freely,\nwillingly, more and more \u201cof himself.\u201d\nBut what are \u201cright\u201d acts? In the first place, they are those that\nconform to a rule\u2014to the right rule, and ultimately to reason. The\nGreeks never waver from the conviction that in the end moral conduct is\nessentially reasonable conduct. But there is a more significant way of\ndescribing their \u201crightness,\u201d and here for the first time Aristotle\nintroduces his famous \u201cDoctrine of the Mean.\u201d Reasoning from the\nanalogy of \u201cright\u201d physical acts, he pronounces that rightness always\nmeans adaptation or adjustment to the special requirements of a\nsituation. To this adjustment he gives a quantitative interpretation.\nTo do (or to feel) what is right in a given situation is to do or to\nfeel just the amount required\u2014neither more nor less: to do wrong is to\ndo or to feel too much or too little\u2014to fall short of or over-shoot, \u201ca\nmean\u201d determined by the situation. The repetition of acts which lie in\nthe mean is the cause of the formation of each and every \u201cgoodness of\ncharacter,\u201d and for this \u201crules\u201d can be given.\n(2) What then is a \u201cmoral virtue,\u201d the result of such a process duly\ndirected? It is no mere mood of feeling, no mere liability to emotion,\nno mere natural aptitude or endowment, it is a permanent state of the\nagent\u2019s self, or, as we might in modern phrase put it, of his will, it\nconsists in a steady self-imposed obedience to a rule of action in\ncertain situations which frequently recur in human life. The rule\nprescribes the control and regulation within limits of the agent\u2019s\nnatural impulses to act and feel thus and thus. The situations fall\ninto groups which constitute the \u201cfields\u201d of the several \u201cmoral\nvirtues\u201d, for each there is a rule, conformity to which secures\nrightness in the individual acts. Thus the moral ideal appears as a\ncode of rules, accepted by the agent, but as yet to him without\nrational justification and without system or unity. But the rules\nprescribe no mechanical uniformity: each within its limits permits\nvariety, and the exactly right amount adopted to the requirements of\nthe individual situation (and every actual situation is individual)\nmust be determined by the intuition of the moment. There is no attempt\nto reduce the rich possibilities of right action to a single monotonous\ntype. On the contrary, there are acknowledged to be many forms of moral\nvirtue, and there is a long list of them, with their correlative vices\nenumerated.\nThe Doctrine of the Mean here takes a form in which it has impressed\nsubsequent thinkers, but which has less importance than is usually\nascribed to it. In the \u201cTable of the Virtues and Vices,\u201d each of the\nvirtues is flanked by two opposite vices, which are respectively the\nexcess and defect of that which in due measure constitutes the virtue.\nAristotle tries to show that this is the case in regard to every virtue\nnamed and recognised as such, but his treatment is often forced and the\nendeavour is not very successful. Except as a convenient principle of\narrangement of the various forms of praiseworthy or blameworthy\ncharacters, generally acknowledged as such by Greek opinion, this form\nof the doctrine is of no great significance.\nBooks III-V are occupied with a survey of the moral virtues and vices.\nThese seem to have been undertaken in order to verify in detail the\ngeneral account, but this aim is not kept steadily in view. Nor is\nthere any well-considered principle of classification. What we find is\na sort of portrait-gallery of the various types of moral excellence\nwhich the Greeks of the author\u2019s age admired and strove to encourage.\nThe discussion is full of acute, interesting and sometimes profound\nobservations. Some of the types are those which are and will be admired\nat all times, but others are connected with peculiar features of Greek\nlife which have now passed away. The most important is that of Justice\nor the Just Man, to which we may later return. But the discussion is\npreceded by an attempt to elucidate some difficult and obscure points\nin the general account of moral virtue and action (Book III, cc i-v).\nThis section is concerned with the notion of Responsibility. The\ndiscussion designedly excludes what we may call the metaphysical issues\nof the problem, which here present themselves, it moves on the level of\nthought of the practical man, the statesman, and the legislator.\nCoercion and ignorance of relevant circumstances render acts\ninvoluntary and exempt their doer from responsibility, otherwise the\nact is voluntary and the agent responsible, choice or preference of\nwhat is done, and inner consent to the deed, are to be presumed.\nNeither passion nor ignorance of the right rule can extenuate\nresponsibility. But there is a difference between acts done voluntarily\nand acts done of set choice or purpose. The latter imply Deliberation.\nDeliberation involves thinking, thinking out means to ends: in\ndeliberate acts the whole nature of the agent consents to and enters\ninto the act, and in a peculiar sense they are his, they are him in\naction, and the most significant evidence of what he is. Aristotle is\nunable wholly to avoid allusion to the metaphysical difficulties and\nwhat he does here say upon them is obscure and unsatisfactory. But he\ninsists upon the importance in moral action of the agent\u2019s inner\nconsent, and on the reality of his individual responsibility. For his\npresent purpose the metaphysical difficulties are irrelevant.\nThe treatment of Justice in Book V has always been a source of great\ndifficulty to students of the Ethics. Almost more than any other part\nof the work it has exercised influence upon mediaeval and modern\nthought upon the subject. The distinctions and divisions have become\npart of the stock-in-trade of would be philosophic jurists. And yet,\noddly enough, most of these distinctions have been misunderstood and\nthe whole purport of the discussion misconceived. Aristotle is here\ndealing with justice in a restricted sense viz as that special goodness\nof character which is required of every adult citizen and which can be\nproduced by early discipline or habituation. It is the temper or\nhabitual attitude demanded of the citizen for the due exercise of his\nfunctions as taking part in the administration of the civic\ncommunity\u2014as a member of the judicature and executive. The Greek\ncitizen was only exceptionally, and at rare intervals if ever, a\nlaw-maker while at any moment he might be called upon to act as a judge\n(juryman or arbitrator) or as an administrator. For the work of a\nlegislator far more than the moral virtue of justice or fairmindedness\nwas necessary, these were requisite to the rarer and higher\n\u201cintellectual virtue\u201d of practical wisdom. Then here, too, the\ndiscussion moves on a low level, and the raising of fundamental\nproblems is excluded. Hence \u201cdistributive justice\u201d is concerned not\nwith the large question of the distribution of political power and\nprivileges among the constituent members or classes of the state but\nwith the smaller questions of the distribution among those of casual\ngains and even with the division among private claimants of a common\nfund or inheritance, while \u201ccorrective justice\u201d is concerned solely\nwith the management of legal redress. The whole treatment is confused\nby the unhappy attempt to give a precise mathematical form to the\nprinciples of justice in the various fields distinguished. Still it\nremains an interesting first endeavour to give greater exactness to\nsome of the leading conceptions of jurisprudence.\nBook VI appears to have in view two aims: (1) to describe goodness of\nintellect and discover its highest form or forms; (2) to show how this\nis related to goodness of character, and so to conduct generally. As\nall thinking is either theoretical or practical, goodness of intellect\nhas two supreme forms\u2014Theoretical and Practical Wisdom. The first,\nwhich apprehends the eternal laws of the universe, has no direct\nrelation to human conduct: the second is identical with that master\nscience of human life of which the whole treatise, consisting of the\nEthics and the Politics, is an exposition. It is this science which\nsupplies the right rules of conduct Taking them as they emerge in and\nfrom practical experience, it formulates them more precisely and\norganises them into a system where they are all seen to converge upon\nhappiness. The mode in which such knowledge manifests itself is in the\npower to show that such and such rules of action follow from the very\nnature of the end or good for man. It presupposes and starts from a\nclear conception of the end and the wish for it as conceived, and it\nproceeds by a deduction which is dehberation writ large. In the man of\npractical wisdom this process has reached its perfect result, and the\ncode of right rules is apprehended as a system with a single principle\nand so as something wholly rational or reasonable He has not on each\noccasion to seek and find the right rule applicable to the situation,\nhe produces it at once from within himself, and can at need justify it\nby exhibiting its rationale, i.e. , its connection with the end. This\nis the consummate form of reason applied to conduct, but there are\nminor forms of it, less independent or original, but nevertheless of\ngreat value, such as the power to think out the proper cause of policy\nin novel circumstances or the power to see the proper line of treatment\nto follow in a court of law.\nThe form of the thinking which enters into conduct is that which\nterminates in the production of a rule which declares some means to the\nend of life. The process presupposes (a) a clear and just apprehension\nof the nature of that end\u2014such as the Ethics itself endeavours to\nsupply; (b) a correct perception of the conditions of action, (a) at\nleast is impossible except to a man whose character has been duly\nformed by discipline; it arises only in a man who has acquired moral\nvirtue. For such action and feeling as forms bad character, blinds the\neye of the soul and corrupts the moral principle, and the place of\npractical wisdom is taken by that parody of itself which Aristotle\ncalls \u201ccleverness\u201d\u2014the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the unscrupulous man of the world.\nThus true practical wisdom and true goodness of character are\ninterdependent; neither is genuinely possible or \u201ccompletely\u201d present\nwithout the other. This is Aristotle\u2019s contribution to the discussion\nof the question, so central in Greek Moral Philosophy, of the relation\nof the intellectual and the passionate factors in conduct.\nAristotle is not an intuitionist, but he recognises the implication in\nconduct of a direct and immediate apprehension both of the end and of\nthe character of his circumstances under which it is from moment to\nmoment realised. The directness of such apprehension makes it analogous\nto sensation or sense-perception; but it is on his view in the end due\nto the existence or activity in man of that power in him which is the\nhighest thing in his nature, and akin to or identical with the divine\nnature\u2014mind, or intelligence. It is this which reveals to us what is\nbest for us\u2014the ideal of a happiness which is the object of our real\nwish and the goal of all our efforts. But beyond and above the\npractical ideal of what is best for man begins to show itself another\nand still higher ideal\u2014that of a life not distinctively human or in a\nnarrow sense practical, yet capable of being participated in by man\neven under the actual circumstances of this world. For a time, however,\nthis further and higher ideal is ignored.\nThe next book (Book VII.), is concerned partly with moral conditions,\nin which the agent seems to rise above the level of moral virtue or\nfall below that of moral vice, but partly and more largely with\nconditions in which the agent occupies a middle position between the\ntwo. Aristotle\u2019s attention is here directed chiefly towards the\nphenomena of \u201cIncontinence,\u201d weakness of will or imperfect\nself-control. This condition was to the Greeks a matter of only too\nfrequent experience, but it appeared to them peculiarly difficult to\nunderstand. How can a man know what is good or best for him, and yet\nchronically fail to act upon his knowledge? Socrates was driven to the\nparadox of denying the possibility, but the facts are too strong for\nhim. Knowledge of the right rule may be present, nay the rightfulness\nof its authority may be acknowledged, and yet time after time it may be\ndisobeyed; the will may be good and yet overmastered by the force of\ndesire, so that the act done is contrary to the agent\u2019s will.\nNevertheless the act may be the agent\u2019s, and the will therefore divided\nagainst itself. Aristotle is aware of the seriousness and difficulty of\nthe problem, but in spite of the vividness with which he pictures, and\nthe acuteness with which he analyses, the situation in which such\naction occurs, it cannot be said that he solves the problem. It is time\nthat he rises above the abstract view of it as a conflict between\nreason and passion, recognising that passion is involved in the\nknowledge which in conduct prevails or is overborne, and that the force\nwhich leads to the wrong act is not blind or ignorant passion, but\nalways has some reason in it. But he tends to lapse back into the\nabstraction, and his final account is perplexed and obscure. He finds\nthe source of the phenomenon in the nature of the desire for bodily\npleasures, which is not irrational but has something rational in it.\nSuch pleasures are not necessarily or inherently bad, as has sometimes\nbeen maintained; on the contrary, they are good, but only in certain\namounts or under certain conditions, so that the will is often misled,\nhesitates, and is lost.\nBooks VIII. and IX. (on Friendship) are almost an interruption of the\nargument. The subject-matter of them was a favourite topic of ancient\nwriters, and the treatment is smoother and more orderly than elsewhere\nin the Ethics. The argument is clear, and may be left without comment\nto the readers. These books contain a necessary and attractive\ncomplement to the somewhat dry account of Greek morality in the\npreceding books, and there are in them profound reflections on what may\nbe called the metaphysics of friendship or love.\nAt the beginning of Book X. we return to the topic of Pleasure, which\nis now regarded from a different point of view. In Book VII. the\nantagonists were those who over-emphasised the irrationality or badness\nof Pleasure: here it is rather those who so exaggerate its value as to\nconfuse or identify it with the good or Happiness. But there is offered\nus in this section much more than criticism of the errors of others.\nAnswers are given both to the psychological question, \u201cWhat is\nPleasure?\u201d and to the ethical question, \u201cWhat is its value?\u201d Pleasure,\nwe are told, is the natural concomitant and index of perfect activity,\ndistinguishable but inseparable from it\u2014\u201cthe activity of a subject at\nits best acting upon an object at its best.\u201d It is therefore always and\nin itself a good, but its value rises and falls with that of the\nactivity with which it is conjoined, and which it intensifies and\nperfects. Hence it follows that the highest and best pleasures are\nthose which accompany the highest and best activity.\nPleasure is, therefore, a necessary element in the best life, but it is\nnot the whole of it nor the principal ingredient. The value of a life\ndepends upon the nature and worth of the activity which it involves;\ngiven the maximum of full free action, the maximum of pleasure\nnecessary follows. But on what sort of life is such activity possible?\nThis leads us back to the question, What is happiness? In what life can\nman find the fullest satisfaction for his desires? To this question\nAristotle gives an answer which cannot but surprise us after what has\npreceded. True Happiness, great satisfaction, cannot be found by man in\nany form of \u201cpractical\u201d life, no, not in the fullest and freest\nexercise possible of the \u201cmoral virtues,\u201d not in the life of the\ncitizen or of the great soldier or statesman. To seek it there is to\ncourt failure and disappointment. It is to be found in the life of the\nonlooker, the disinterested spectator; or, to put it more distinctly,\n\u201cin the life of the philosopher, the life of scientific and philosophic\ncontemplation.\u201d The highest and most satisfying form of life possible\nto man is \u201cthe contemplative life\u201d; it is only in a secondary sense and\nfor those incapable of their life, that the practical or moral ideal is\nthe best. It is time that such a life is not distinctively human, but\nit is the privilege of man to partake in it, and such participation, at\nhowever rare intervals and for however short a period, is the highest\nHappiness which human life can offer. All other activities have value\nonly because and in so far as they render this life possible.\nBut it must not be forgotten that Aristotle conceives of this life as\none of intense activity or energising: it is just this which gives it\nits supremacy. In spite of the almost religious fervour with which he\nspeaks of it (\u201cthe most orthodox of his disciples\u201d paraphrases his\nmeaning by describing its content as \u201cthe service and vision of God\u201d),\nit is clear that he identified it with the life of the philosopher, as\nhe understood it, a life of ceaseless intellectual activity in which at\nleast at times all the distractions and disturbances inseparable from\npractical life seemed to disappear and become as nothing. This ideal\nwas partly an inheritance from the more ardent idealism of his master\nPlato, but partly it was the expression of personal experience.\nThe nobility of this ideal cannot be questioned; the conception of the\nend of man or a life lived for truth\u2014of a life blissfully absorbed in\nthe vision of truth\u2014is a lofty and inspiring one. But we cannot resist\ncertain criticisms upon its presentation by Aristotle: (1) the relation\nof it to the lower ideal of practice is left somewhat obscure; (2) it\nis described in such a way as renders its realisation possible only to\na gifted few, and under exceptional circumstances; (3) it seems in\nvarious ways, as regards its content, to be unnecessarily and\nunjustifiably limited. But it must be borne in mind that this is a\nfirst endeavour to determine its principle, and that similar failures\nhave attended the attempts to describe the \u201creligious\u201d or the\n\u201cspiritual\u201d ideals of life, which have continually been suggested by\nthe apparently inherent limitations of the \u201cpractical\u201d or \u201cmoral\u201d life,\nwhich is the subject of Moral Philosophy.\nThe Moral Ideal to those who have most deeply reflected on it leads to\nthe thought of an Ideal beyond and above it, which alone gives it\nmeaning, but which seems to escape from definite conception by man. The\nrichness and variety of this Ideal ceaselessly invite, but as\nceaselessly defy, our attempts to imprison it in a definite formula or\nportray it in detailed imagination. Yet the thought of it is and\nremains inexpungable from our minds.\nThis conception of the best life is not forgotten in the Politics The\nend of life in the state is itself well-living and well-doing\u2014a life\nwhich helps to produce the best life The great agency in the production\nof such life is the State operating through Law, which is Reason backed\nby Force. For its greatest efficiency there is required the development\nof a science of legislation. The main drift of what he says here is\nthat the most desirable thing would be that the best reason of the\ncommunity should be embodied in its laws. But so far as that is not\npossible, it still is true that anyone who would make himself and\nothers better must become a miniature legislator\u2014must study the general\nprinciples of law, morality, and education. The conception of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\nwith which he opened the Ethics would serve as a guide to a father\neducating his children as well as to the legislator legislating for the\nstate. Finding in his predecessors no developed doctrine on this\nsubject, Aristotle proposes himself to undertake the construction of\nit, and sketches in advance the programme of the Politics in the\nconcluding sentence of the Ethics His ultimate object is to answer the\nquestions, What is the best form of Polity, how should each be\nconstituted, and what laws and customs should it adopt and employ? Not\ntill this answer is given will \u201cthe philosophy of human affairs\u201d be\ncomplete.\nOn looking back it will be seen that the discussion of the central\ntopic of the nature and formation of character has expanded into a\nPhilosophy of Human Conduct, merging at its beginning and end into\nmetaphysics The result is a Moral Philosophy set against a background\nof Political Theory and general Philosophy. The most characteristic\nfeatures of this Moral Philosophy are due to the fact of its\nessentially teleological view of human life and action: (1) Every human\nactivity, but especially every human practical activity, is directed\ntowards a simple End discoverable by reflection, and this End is\nconceived of as the object of universal human desire, as something to\nbe enjoyed, not as something which ought to be done or enacted.\nAnstotle\u2019s Moral Philosophy is not hedonistic but it is eud\u00e6momstic,\nthe end is the enjoyment of Happiness, not the fulfilment of Duty. (2)\nEvery human practical activity derives its value from its efficiency as\na means to that end, it is good or bad, right or wrong, as it conduces\nor fails to conduce to Happiness Thus his Moral Philosophy is\nessentially utilitarian or prudential Right action presupposes Thought\nor Thinking, partly on the development of a clearer and distincter\nconception of the end of desire, partly as the deduction from that of\nrules which state the normally effective conditions of its realisation.\nThe thinking involved in right conduct is calculation\u2014calculation of\nmeans to an end fixed by nature and foreknowable Action itself is at\nits best just the realisation of a scheme preconceived and thought out\nbeforehand, commending itself by its inherent attractiveness or promise\nof enjoyment.\nThis view has the great advantage of exhibiting morality as essentially\nreasonable, but the accompanying disadvantage of lowering it into a\nsomewhat prosaic and unideal Prudentialism, nor is it saved from this\nby the tacking on to it, by a sort of after-thought, of the second and\nhigher Ideal\u2014an addition which ruins the coherence of the account\nwithout really transmuting its substance The source of our\ndissatisfaction with the whole theory lies deeper than in its tendency\nto identify the end with the maximum of enjoyment or satisfaction, or\nto regard the goodness or badness of acts and feelings as lying solely\nin their efficacy to produce such a result It arises from the\napplication to morality of the distinction of means and end For this\ndistinction, for all its plausibility and usefulness in ordinary\nthought and speech, cannot finally be maintained In morality\u2014and this\nis vital to its character\u2014everything is both means and end, and so\nneither in distinction or separation, and all thinking about it which\npresupposes the finality of this distinction wanders into misconception\nand error. The thinking which really matters in conduct is not a\nthinking which imaginatively forecasts ideals which promise to fulfil\ndesire, or calculates means to their attainment\u2014that is sometimes\nuseful, sometimes harmful, and always subordinate, but thinking which\nreveals to the agent the situation in which he is to act, both, that\nis, the universal situation on which as man he always and everywhere\nstands, and the ever-varying and ever-novel situation in which he as\nthis individual, here and now, finds himself. In such knowledge of\ngiven or historic fact lie the natural determinants of his conduct, in\nsuch knowledge alone lies the condition of his freedom and his good.\nBut this does not mean that Moral Philosophy has not still much to\nlearn from Aristotle\u2019s Ethics. The work still remains one of the best\nintroductions to a study of its important subject-matter, it spreads\nbefore us a view of the relevant facts, it reduces them to manageable\ncompass and order, it raises some of the central problems, and makes\nacute and valuable suggestions towards their solution. Above all, it\nperpetually incites to renewed and independent reflection upon them.", "source": "ethics.txt"}
