The Sickness Unto Death
by Anti-Climacus

A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

The human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Such a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.
If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the whole relation.
The human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair. If the human self had established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.

Despair is the sickness unto death.
The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a specific way. It is not literally a sickness of which one dies, but a sickness the end of which is death, and death is the end. Thus, metaphorically speaking, there is much that is a sickness unto death. But in the Christian sense, death is not the end of everything; it is merely an event within life, which is infinitely more than death. Therefore, in the Christian sense, the sickness unto death is not a bodily sickness, for even if this were to cause death, death is not the end.
No, the sickness unto death is despair.
