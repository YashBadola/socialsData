I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room with white-lacquered furniture, which looked out on the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one sees ladies in long dresses and ostrich-feather hats, and gentlemen in boaters and panamas, smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts, and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child.

I remember the blue of the sky over the balcony, and the taste of the sugared almonds they gave me. I lived in a protected world, surrounded by affection and order. Yet, very early on, I felt a vague unease, a sense that the world given to me was not the only one possible. Books became my refuge. In them, I found words for feelings I had not yet dared to name.

As I grew older, the conflict between the bourgeois expectations of my family and my own intellectual hunger became acute. I wanted to write, to think, to live without the constraints that had been placed upon women of my class for generations. I did not want a husband to define my existence; I wanted to define it myself. Philosophy was not just a subject to study; it was a way of life, a method of tearing away the veil of appearance to reach the hard truth of existence.
