The unusual events described in this chronicle occurred in 194- at Oran. Everyone agreed that, considering their somewhat extraordinary character, they were out of place there. For its ordinary aspect is that of a modern city, entirely without vegetation and soulless, which has turned its back on the sea.

In the midst of the pestilence, Dr. Rieux observed that there are things that one can explain, but others that one simply cannot. The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding. On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn't the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill.

"I have no idea what's awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends. For the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing." Rieux said. "It's a matter of common decency. That's an idea which may make some people smile, but the only means of fighting a plague is common decency."

When asked what he meant by common decency, Rieux replied: "I don't know what it means for other people. But in my case I know that it consists in doing my job."
