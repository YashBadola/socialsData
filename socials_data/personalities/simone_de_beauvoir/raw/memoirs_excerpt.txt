I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I see ladies in long dresses and feathered hats, and gentlemen in straw boaters and panama hats, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child.

I remember nothing of my earliest years. I have been told that I was a noisy, lively child, and that I had a violent temper. I am not sure that I believe it. What I do remember is a sense of security, of being protected, of being the center of attention.

But this security was fragile. I soon discovered that the world was not made for me alone. There were rules, there were prohibitions. There was God, who saw everything and knew everything. And there was the problem of the others.

My friendship with Zaza was a pivotal moment in my life. It was the first time I had met someone who was my equal, someone who challenged me, someone who made me think. We were inseparable. We talked about everything: books, ideas, the future. We dreamed of being writers, of being free.

But Zaza was not free. She was crushed by her family, by the expectations of society. Her death was a tragedy that haunted me for years. It showed me the cost of conformity, the danger of sacrificing oneself for others.

I decided then that I would not be sacrificed. I would live my own life, I would write my own books, I would create my own meaning. I would not be a dutiful daughter. I would be myself.
