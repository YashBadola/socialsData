{"text": "Either/Or\nBy S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Victor Eremita)\nDiapsalmata\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.\n...\nThe Rotation Method\nMy dear reader,\nPeople are always saying that one must not be bored. But this is not the whole truth. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually direct; but strictly speaking it is only when it ceases to be boredom that it becomes a negative principle.\nThe method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but in changing the crop.\n...\nEquilibrium between the Esthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality\nMy Friend,\nWhat I have so often said to you I say now once again, or rather I shout it at you: Either/Or! There are situations in life where it would be the most ridiculous of all things to say to a man, \"Either do this or that,\" because the point is to do both. But there are also situations where the \"either/or\" has an absolute significance.\nThe choice itself is decisive for the content of the personality, through the choice the personality immerses itself in the thing chosen, and when it does not choose, it withers away in consumption.\nTo choose is an intrinsic and stringent term for the ethical. Wherever there is strict question of an Either/Or, the ethical is present. The ethical is the only thing which does not make you a genius, does not give you wit or talent, but it gives you something much better\u2014it gives you yourself.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Fear and Trembling\nBy S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Johannes Climacus)\nPreface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every lecturer, tutor, student, every philosopher and theologian on a damp cloud, is inclined to regard it as old-fashioned to stop at faith. They go right on.\n...\nProblem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified vis-\u00e0-vis the latter, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\n...\nThe Knight of Faith\nIf I were to describe the movements of faith, I should say: infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\nThe knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way, this pain which he meets with at the turn of the road where he finds the paradox.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
