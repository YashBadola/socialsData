Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant evolutionary trends in the credit market of ideas, writes, "work," "do," "do it," "done," and, behold, he has become a man of substance.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior—yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the single individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

If there is no such thing as faith, then love is only love of the flesh, and the spirit is a stranger to it, and if there is no such thing as faith, then all existence is merely a play of shadows.

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner.
