That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game.\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws. -- The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle. -- Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command? -- There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n43. For a large class of cases--though not for all--in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n323. \"Now I know how to go on!\" is an exclamation; it corresponds to an instinctive sound, a glad start. Of course it does not follow from my feeling that I have not gone on.\nIf a lion could speak, we could not understand him.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}

Russell's merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.\n4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible.
