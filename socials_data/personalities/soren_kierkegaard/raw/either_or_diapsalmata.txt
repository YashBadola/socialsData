Diapsalmata

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music is delicious.'

I divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I am awake. I sleep when I sleep, and I am awake when I am awake. Thus I live without any great difficulties.

Marry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Whether you marry or you do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that. Laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Whether you laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that. Believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.
