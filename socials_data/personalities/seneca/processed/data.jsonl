{"text": "LETTER VII. ON CROWDS\nGreetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nDO you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I say, crowds; for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety. I shall admit my own weakness, at any rate; for I never bring back home the same character that I took abroad with me. Something of that which I have forced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes that I have routed return again. Just as the sick man, who has been weak for a long time, is in such a condition that he cannot be taken out of the house without suffering a relapse, so we ourselves are affected when our souls are recovering from a lingering disease.\nTo consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith. Certainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger. But nothing is so damaging to good character as the habit of lounging at the games; for then it is that vice steals subtly upon one through the avenue of pleasure. What do you think I mean? I mean that I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous, and even more cruel and inhuman, because I have been among human beings. By chance I attended a mid-day exhibition, expecting some fun, wit, and relaxation,\u2014an exhibition at which men's eyes have respite from the slaughter of their fellow-men. But it was quite the reverse. The previous combats were the essence of mercy; but now all the trifling is put aside and it is pure murder. The men have no defensive armour. They are exposed to blows at all points, and no one ever strikes in vain.\n...\n\"But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!\" And what of it? Granted that, as a murderer, he deserved this punishment, what crime have you committed, poor fellow, that you should deserve to sit and see this show? In the morning they throw men to the lions and the bears; at noon, they throw them to the spectators. The crowd demands that the slayer shall face the man who is to slay him in his turn; and they always reserve the latest conqueror for another butchering. The outcome of every fight is death, and the means are fire and sword. This sort of thing goes on while the arena is empty. \"But one of the men was a robber, and the other a murderer.\" What of it? Is that any reason why one of them should be burned and the other crucified? \"But the first has committed some crime, and the other has killed a man.\"\n...\nCome now; do you not understand even this truth: that a bad example reacts on the agent? Thank the immortal gods that you are teaching cruelty to a person who cannot learn to be cruel. The young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob; it is too easy to side with the majority. Even Socrates, Cato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their moral strength by a crowd that was unlike them; so true it is that none of us, no matter how much he cultivates his abilities, can withstand the shock of faults that approach, as it were, with so great a retinue. Much harm is done by a single case of indulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he be luxurious, weakens and softens us imperceptibly; the neighbour, if he be rich, rouses our covetousness; the companion, if he be slanderous, rubs off some of his rust upon us, even though we be spotless and sincere. What then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world at large assaults it! You must either imitate or loathe the world.\nBut both courses are to be shunned; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach. There is no reason why pride in advertising your abilities should lure you into publicity, so that you should desire to recite or harangue before the general public. Of course I should be willing for you to do so if you had a commodity which suited such a mob; but there is not a man of them who can understand you. Some one person might perhaps appear, to whom you could give a part of your mind; and he would need to be formed and trained up to your level. \"For whose benefit, then, have I learned all this?\" you ask. If you have learned it for your own benefit, you have no reason to regret it.\n...\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_7_on_crowds.txt"}
{"text": "LETTER I. ON SAVING TIME\nGreetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nCONTINUE to act thus, my dear Lucilius\u2014set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words,\u2014that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.\nTherefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,\u2014time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess that, for my part, I keep an account of my spending. I cannot say that I lose nothing, but I can say what I lose, and why, and how; I can give you the reasons why I am a poor man. My situation, however, is the same as that of many travellers who are reduced to poverty without any fault of their own: everyone forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.

{"text": "OF ANGER\nBOOK I\nWe must prevent anger from coming to the fore; for if it once begins to lead the charge, it is hard to retreat. Reason is strong only so long as it stands aloof from the passions; if it once mixes with them, it is defiled and can no longer hold back what it has once allowed to move forward. The mind, if it has once cast itself into anger, love, or the other passions, has no power to check its own impetus; its own weight and the downward tendency of its vice must needs carry it on and drive it to the bottom.\nThe best plan is to reject the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once the passion has been admitted to the mind, and has by our own free will been given a certain authority; it will for the future do as much as it chooses, not only as much as you will allow it. The enemy, I say, must be met on the frontier: when he has once entered the city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.\n...\n\"But,\" says our adversary, \"anger has its uses, because it makes men more ready to fight.\" According to that theory, drunkenness also is a good thing, for it makes men insolent and daring, and many have been better at the sword when they were the worse for liquor. Nay, according to that theory, you may call frenzy and madness essential to strength, because madness often makes men stronger. But tell me, does not fear often make the opposite result? does not the fear of death often make men fight most desperately? But what a difference there is between the courage which is inspired by drunkenness, by anger, or by fear, and that which is guided by reason! The former are like heavy rains or floods, which soon pass away; the latter is like a river, which flows on with a constant stream.\n...\n\"Anger is natural,\" you say. \"Mankind is born for mutual assistance, anger for mutual destruction: the one desires union, the other separation: the one desires to do good, the other to do harm: the one to help even strangers, the other to attack even its dearest friends: the one is ready even to sacrifice itself for the good of others, the other to plunge into danger provided it can drag its adversary with it.\"\nHow, then, can anger be in accordance with nature, when it is the vice of a creature whose nature it is to be kind?", "source": "on_anger_excerpt.txt"}
