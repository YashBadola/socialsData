This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.
The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.
All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.
It is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.
Fire is want and surfeit.
Fire in its advance will judge and convict all things.
God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savour of each.
The sun is new every day.
If there were no sun it would be night, for all the other stars could do.
The sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.
If all things were turned to smoke, the nostrils would distinguish them.
