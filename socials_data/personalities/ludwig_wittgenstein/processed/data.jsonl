PINSENT\n## Motto\n>\n>\n> *. . . und alles, was man weiss, nicht bloss rauschen und brausen geh\u00f6rt hat, l\u00e4sst sich in drei Worten sagen. *\n>\n> *K\u00fcrnberger.*\n>\n>\n## Preface\nThis book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in it\u2014or similar thoughts. It is therefore not a text-book. Its object would be attained if there were one person who read it with understanding and to whom it afforded pleasure.\nThe book deals with the problems of philosophy and shows, as I believe, that the method of formulating these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language. Its whole meaning could be summed up somewhat as follows: What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.\nThe book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather\u2014not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).\nThe limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.\nHow far my efforts agree with those of other philosophers I will not decide. Indeed what I have here written makes no claim to novelty in points of detail; and therefore I give no sources, because it is indifferent to me whether what I have thought has already been thought before me by another.\nI will only mention that to the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell I owe in large measure the stimulation of my thoughts.\nIf this work has a value it consists in two things. First that in it thoughts are expressed, and this value will be the greater the better the thoughts are expressed. The more the nail has been hit on the head.\u2014Here I am conscious that I have fallen far short of the possible. Simply because my powers are insufficient to cope with the task.\u2014May others come and do it better.\nOn the other hand the *truth* of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken in this, then the value of this work secondly consists in the fact that it shows how little has been done when these problems have been solved.\n*L.W.*\nVienna, 1918.\n## Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n**[1](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1)** The world is everything that is the case.[^tlp-note-1_1-0]\n**[1.1](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1.1)** The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n**[1.11](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1.11)** The world is determined by the facts, and by these being *all* the facts.\n**[1.12](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1.12)** For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n**[1.13](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1.13)** The facts in logical space are the world.\n**[1.2](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1.2)** The world divides into facts.\n**[1.21](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#1.21)** Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n**[2](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2)** What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n**[2.01](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.01)** An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n**[2.011](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.011)** It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n**[2.012](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.012)** In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing *can* occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n**[2.0121](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0121)** It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.\nIf things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must already lie in them.\n\\(A logical entity cannot be merely possible. Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\nJust as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of *any* object apart from the possibility of its connexion with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the *possibility* of this context.\n**[2.0122](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0122)** The thing is independent, in so far as it can occur in all *possible* circumstances, but this form of independence is a form of connexion with the atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to occur in two different ways, alone and in the proposition.)\n**[2.0123](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0123)** If I know an object, then I also know all the possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.\n\\(Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)\nA new possibility cannot subsequently be found.\n**[2.01231](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.01231)** In order to know an object, I must know not its external but all its internal qualities.\n**[2.0124](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0124)** If all objects are given, then thereby are all *possible* atomic facts also given.\n**[2.013](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.013)** Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.\n**[2.0131](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0131)** A spatial object must lie in infinite space. (A point in space is an argument place.)\nA speck in a visual field need not be red, but it must have a colour; it has, so to speak, a colour space round it. A tone must have *a* pitch, the object of the sense of touch *a* hardness, etc.\n**[2.014](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.014)** Objects contain the possibility of all states of affairs.\n**[2.0141](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0141)** The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of the object.\n**[2.02](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.02)** The object is simple.\n**[2.0201](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0201)** Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a statement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.\n**[2.021](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.021)** Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.\n**[2.0211](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0211)** If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n**[2.0212](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0212)** It would then be impossible to form a picture of the world (true or false).\n**[2.022](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.022)** It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something\u2014a form\u2014in common with the real world.\n**[2.023](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.023)** This fixed form consists of the objects.\n**[2.0231](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0231)** The substance of the world *can* only determine a form and not any material properties. For these are first presented by the propositions\u2014first formed by the configuration of the objects.\n**[2.0232](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0232)** Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.\n**[2.0233](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0233)** Two objects of the same logical form are\u2014apart from their external properties\u2014only differentiated from one another in that they are different.\n**[2.02331](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.02331)** Either a thing has properties which no other has, and then one can distinguish it straight away from the others by a description and refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things which have the totality of their properties in common, and then it is quite impossible to point to any one of them.\nFor if a thing is not distinguished by anything, I cannot distinguish it\u2014for otherwise it would be distinguished.\n**[2.024](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.024)** Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.\n**[2.025](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.025)** It is form and content.\n**[2.0251](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0251)** Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms of objects.\n**[2.026](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.026)** Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the world.\n**[2.027](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.027)** The fixed, the existent and the object are one.\n**[2.0271](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0271)** The object is the fixed, the existent; the configuration is the changing, the variable.\n**[2.0272](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.0272)** The configuration of the objects forms the atomic fact.\n**[2.03](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.03)** In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the links of a chain.\n**[2.031](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.031)** In the atomic fact the objects are combined in a definite way.\n**[2.032](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.032)** The way in which objects hang together in the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic fact.\n**[2.033](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.033)** The form is the possibility of the structure.\n**[2.034](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.034)** The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the atomic facts.\n**[2.04](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.04)** The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.\n**[2.05](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.05)** The totality of existent atomic facts also determines which atomic facts do not exist.\n**[2.06](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.06)** The existence and non-existence of atomic facts is the reality.\n\\(The existence of atomic facts we also call a positive fact, their non-existence a negative fact.)\n**[2.061](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.061)** Atomic facts are independent of one another.\n**[2.062](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.062)** From the existence of non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another.\n**[2.063](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.063)** The total reality is the world.\n**[2.1](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.1)** We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n**[2.11](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.11)** The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n**[2.12](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.12)** The picture is a model of reality.\n**[2.13](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.13)** To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.\n**[2.131](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.131)** The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects.\n**[2.14](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.14)** The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.\n**[2.141](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.141)** The picture is a fact.\n**[2.15](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.15)** That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.\nThis connexion of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.\n**[2.151](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.151)** The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture.\n**[2.1511](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.1511)** Thus the picture is linked with reality; it reaches up to it.\n**[2.1512](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.1512)** It is like a scale applied to reality.\n**[2.15121](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.15121)** Only the outermost points of the dividing lines *touch* the object to be measured.\n**[2.1513](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.1513)** According to this view the representing relation which makes it a picture, also belongs to the picture.\n**[2.1514](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.1514)** The representing relation consists of the co-ordinations of the elements of the picture and the things.\n**[2.1515](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.1515)** These co-ordinations are as it were the feelers of its elements with which the picture touches reality.\n**[2.16](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.16)** In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.\n**[2.161](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.161)** In the picture and the pictured there must be something identical in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.\n**[2.17](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.17)** What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner\u2014rightly or falsely\u2014is its form of representation.\n**[2.171](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.171)** The picture can represent every reality whose form it has.\nThe spatial picture, everything spatial, the coloured, everything coloured, etc.\n**[2.172](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.172)** The picture, however, cannot represent its form of representation; it shows it forth.\n**[2.173](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.173)** The picture represents its object from without (its standpoint is its form of representation), therefore the picture represents its object rightly or falsely.\n**[2.174](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.174)** But the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation.\n**[2.18](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.18)** What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it at all\u2014rightly or falsely\u2014is the logical form, that is, the form of reality.\n**[2.181](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.181)** If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.\n**[2.182](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.182)** Every picture is *also* a logical picture. (On the other hand, for example, not every picture is spatial.)\n**[2.19](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.19)** The logical picture can depict the world.\n**[2.2](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.2)** The picture has the logical form of representation in common with what it pictures.\n**[2.201](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.201)** The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n**[2.202](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.202)** The picture represents a possible state of affairs in logical space.\n**[2.203](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.203)** The picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it represents.\n**[2.21](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.21)** The picture agrees with reality or not; it is right or wrong, true or false.\n**[2.22](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.22)** The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsehood, through the form of representation.\n**[2.221](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.221)** What the picture represents is its sense.\n**[2.222](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.222)** In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.\n**[2.223](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.223)** In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.\n**[2.224](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.224)** It cannot be discovered from the picture alone whether it is true or false.\n**[2.225](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#2.225)** There is no picture which is a priori true.\n**[3](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3)** The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n**[3.001](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.001)** \u201cAn atomic fact is thinkable\u201d\u2014means: we can imagine it.\n**[3.01](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.01)** The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n**[3.02](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.02)** The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks.\nWhat is thinkable is also possible.\n**[3.03](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.03)** We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.\n**[3.031](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.031)** It used to be said that God could create everything, except what was contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not *say* of an \u201cunlogical\u201d world how it would look.\n**[3.032](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.032)** To present in language anything which \u201ccontradicts logic\u201d is as impossible as in geometry to present by its co-ordinates a figure which contradicts the laws of space; or to give the co-ordinates of a point which does not exist.\n**[3.0321](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.0321)** We could present spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one which contradicted the laws of geometry.\n**[3.04](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.04)** An a priori true thought would be one whose possibility guaranteed its truth.\n**[3.05](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.05)** Only if we could know a priori that a thought is true if its truth was to be recognized from the thought itself (without an object of comparison).\n**[3.1](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.1)** In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.\n**[3.11](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.11)** We use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible state of affairs.\nThe method of projection is the thinking of the sense of the proposition.\n**[3.12](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.12)** The sign through which we express the thought I call the propositional sign. And the proposition is the propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.\n**[3.13](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.13)** To the proposition belongs everything which belongs to the projection; but not what is projected.\nTherefore the possibility of what is projected but not this itself.\nIn the proposition, therefore, its sense is not yet contained, but the possibility of expressing it.\n\\(\u201cThe content of the proposition\u201d means the content of the significant proposition.)\nIn the proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.\n**[3.14](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.14)** The propositional sign consists in the fact that its elements, the words, are combined in it in a definite way.\nThe propositional sign is a fact.\n**[3.141](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.141)** The proposition is not a mixture of words (just as the musical theme is not a mixture of tones).\nThe proposition is articulate.\n**[3.142](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.142)** Only facts can express a sense, a class of names cannot.\n**[3.143](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.143)** That the propositional sign is a fact is concealed by the ordinary form of expression, written or printed.\n\\(For in the printed proposition, for example, the sign of a proposition does not appear essentially different from a word. Thus it was possible for Frege to call the proposition a compounded name.)\n**[3.1431](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.1431)** The essential nature of the propositional sign becomes very clear when we imagine it made up of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, books) instead of written signs.\nThe mutual spatial position of these things then expresses the sense of the proposition.\n**[3.1432](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.1432)** We must not say, \u201cThe complex sign \u2018*aRb*\u2019 says \u2018*a* stands in relation *R* to *b*\u2019\u201d; but we must say, \u201c*That* \u2018*a*\u2019 stands in a certain relation to \u2018*b*\u2019 says *that aRb*\u201d.\n**[3.144](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.144)** States of affairs can be described but not *named*.\n\\(Names resemble points; propositions resemble arrows, they have sense.)\n**[3.2](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.2)** In propositions thoughts can be so expressed that to the objects of the thoughts correspond the elements of the propositional sign.\n**[3.201](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.201)** These elements I call \u201csimple signs\u201d and the proposition \u201ccompletely analysed\u201d.\n**[3.202](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.202)** The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.\n**[3.203](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.203)** The name means the object. The object is its meaning. (\u201c*A*\u201d is the same sign as \u201c*A*\u201d.)\n**[3.21](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.21)** To the configuration of the simple signs in the propositional sign corresponds the configuration of the objects in the state of affairs.\n**[3.22](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.22)** In the proposition the name represents the object.\n**[3.221](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.221)** Objects I can only *name*. Signs represent them. I can only speak *of* them. I cannot *assert them*. A proposition can only say *how* a thing is, not *what* it is.\n**[3.23](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.23)** The postulate of the possibility of the simple signs is the postulate of the determinateness of the sense.\n**[3.24](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.24)** A proposition about a complex stands in internal relation to the proposition about its constituent part.\nA complex can only be given by its description, and this will either be right or wrong. The proposition in which there is mention of a complex, if this does not exist, becomes not nonsense but simply false.\nThat a propositional element signifies a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs. We *know* that everything is not yet determined by this proposition. (The notation for generality *contains* a prototype.)\nThe combination of the symbols of a complex in a simple symbol can be expressed by a definition.\n**[3.25](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.25)** There is one and only one complete analysis of the proposition.\n**[3.251](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.251)** The proposition expresses what it expresses in a definite and clearly specifiable way: the proposition is articulate.\n**[3.26](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.26)** The name cannot be analysed further by any definition. It is a primitive sign.\n**[3.261](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.261)** Every defined sign signifies *via* those signs by which it is defined, and the definitions show the way.\nTwo signs, one a primitive sign, and one defined by primitive signs, cannot signify in the same way. Names *cannot* be taken to pieces by definition (nor any sign which alone and independently has a meaning).\n**[3.262](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.262)** What does not get expressed in the sign is shown by its application. What the signs conceal, their application declares.\n**[3.263](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.263)** The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by elucidations. Elucidations are propositions which contain the primitive signs. They can, therefore, only be understood when the meanings of these signs are already known.\n**[3.3](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.3)** Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\n**[3.31](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.31)** Every part of a proposition which characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol).\n\\(The proposition itself is an expression.)\nExpressions are everything\u2014essential for the sense of the proposition\u2014that propositions can have in common with one another.\nAn expression characterizes a form and a content.\n**[3.311](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.311)** An expression presupposes the forms of all propositions in which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of propositions.\n**[3.312](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.312)** It is therefore represented by the general form of the propositions which it characterizes.\nAnd in this form the expression is *constant* and everything else *variable*.\n**[3.313](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.313)** An expression is thus presented by a variable, whose values are the propositions which contain the expression.\n\\(In the limiting case the variable becomes constant, the expression a proposition.)\nI call such a variable a \u201cpropositional variable\u201d.\n**[3.314](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.314)** An expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a propositional variable. (Including the variable name.)\n**[3.315](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.315)** If we change a constituent part of a proposition into a variable, there is a class of propositions which are all the values of the resulting variable proposition. This class in general still depends on what, by arbitrary agreement, we mean by parts of that proposition. But if we change all those signs, whose meaning was arbitrarily determined, into variables, there always remains such a class. But this is now no longer dependent on any agreement; it depends only on the nature of the proposition. It corresponds to a logical form, to a logical prototype.\n**[3.316](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.316)** What values the propositional variable can assume *is* determined.\nThe determination of the values *is* the variable.\n**[3.317](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.317)** The determination of the values of the propositional variable is done by *indicating the propositions* whose common mark the variable is.\nThe determination is a description of these propositions.\nThe determination will therefore deal only with symbols not with their meaning.\nAnd *only* this is essential to the determination, *that it is only a description of symbols and asserts nothing about what is symbolized.*\nThe way in which we describe the propositions is not essential.\n**[3.318](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.318)** I conceive the proposition\u2014like Frege and Russell\u2014as a function of the expressions contained in it.\n**[3.32](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.32)** The sign is the part of the symbol perceptible by the senses.\n**[3.321](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.321)** Two different symbols can therefore have the sign (the written sign or the sound sign) in common\u2014they then signify in different ways.\n**[3.322](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.322)** It can never indicate the common characteristic of two objects that we symbolize them with the same signs but by different *methods of symbolizing*. For the sign is arbitrary. We could therefore equally well choose two different signs and where then would be what was common in the symbolization.\n**[3.323](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.323)** In the language of everyday life it very often happens that the same word signifies in two different ways\u2014and therefore belongs to two different symbols\u2014or that two words, which signify in different ways, are apparently applied in the same way in the proposition.\nThus the word \u201cis\u201d appears as the copula, as the sign of equality, and as the expression of existence; \u201cto exist\u201d as an intransitive verb like \u201cto go\u201d; \u201cidentical\u201d as an adjective; we speak of *something* but also of the fact of *something* happening.\n\\(In the proposition \u201cGreen is green\u201d\u2014where the first word is a proper name as the last an adjective\u2014these words have not merely different meanings but they are *different symbols*.)\n**[3.324](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.324)** Thus there easily arise the most fundamental confusions (of which the whole of philosophy is full).\n**[3.325](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.325)** In order to avoid these errors, we must employ a symbolism which excludes them, by not applying the same sign in different symbols and by not applying signs in the same way which signify in different ways. A symbolism, that is to say, which obeys the rules of *logical* grammar\u2014of logical syntax.\n\\(The logical symbolism of Frege and Russell is such a language, which, however, does still not exclude all errors.)\n**[3.326](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.326)** In order to recognize the symbol in the sign we must consider the significant use.\n**[3.327](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.327)** The sign determines a logical form only together with its logical syntactic application.\n**[3.328](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.328)** If a sign is *not necessary* then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam\u2019s razor.\n\\(If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)\n**[3.33](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.33)** In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a r\u00f4le; it must admit of being established without mention being thereby made of the *meaning* of a sign; it ought to presuppose *only* the description of the expressions.\n**[3.331](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.331)** From this observation we get a further view\u2014into Russell\u2019s *Theory of Types*. Russell\u2019s error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak about the things his signs mean.\n**[3.332](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.332)** No proposition can say anything about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the \u201cwhole theory of types\u201d).\n**[3.333](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.333)** A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself.\nIf, for example, we suppose that the function *F*(*fx*) could be its own argument, then there would be a proposition \u201c*F*(*F*(*fx*))\u201d, and in this the outer function *F* and the inner function *F* must have different meanings; for the inner has the form *\u03d5*(*fx*), the outer the form *\u03c8*(*\u03d5*(*fx*)). Common to both functions is only the letter \u201c*F*\u201d, which by itself signifies nothing.\nThis is at once clear, if instead of \u201c*F*(*F*(*u*))\u201d we write \u201c(\u2203*\u03d5*) : *F*(*\u03d5u*) . *\u03d5u* = *Fu*\u201d.\nHerewith Russell\u2019s paradox vanishes.\n**[3.334](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.334)** The rules of logical syntax must follow of themselves, if we only know how every single sign signifies.\n**[3.34](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.34)** A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.\nAccidental are the features which are due to a particular way of producing the propositional sign. Essential are those which alone enable the proposition to express its sense.\n**[3.341](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.341)** The essential in a proposition is therefore that which is common to all propositions which can express the same sense.\nAnd in the same way in general the essential in a symbol is that which all symbols which can fulfil the same purpose have in common.\n**[3.3411](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.3411)** One could therefore say the real name is that which all symbols, which signify an object, have in common. It would then follow, step by step, that no sort of composition was essential for a name.\n**[3.342](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.342)** In our notations there is indeed something arbitrary, but *this* is not arbitrary, namely that *if* we have determined anything arbitrarily, then something else *must* be the case. (This results from the *essence* of the notation.)\n**[3.3421](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.3421)** A particular method of symbolizing may be unimportant, but it is always important that this is a *possible* method of symbolizing. And this happens as a rule in philosophy: The single thing proves over and over again to be unimportant, but the possibility of every single thing reveals something about the nature of the world.\n**[3.343](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.343)** Definitions are rules for the translation of one language into another. Every correct symbolism must be translatable into every other according to such rules. It is *this* which all have in common.\n**[3.344](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.344)** What signifies in the symbol is what is common to all those symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical syntax.\n**[3.3441](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.3441)** We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions as follows: It is common to them that they all, for example, *can be replaced* by the notations of \u201c\\~*p*\u201d (\u201cnot *p*\u201d) and \u201c*p* \u2228 *q*\u201d (\u201c*p* or *q*\u201d).\n\\(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)\n**[3.3442](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.3442)** The sign of the complex is not arbitrarily resolved in the analysis, in such a way that its resolution would be different in every propositional structure.\n**[3.4](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.4)** The proposition determines a place in logical space: the existence of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituent parts alone, by the existence of the significant proposition.\n**[3.41](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.41)** The propositional sign and the logical co-ordinates: that is the logical place.\n**[3.411](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.411)** The geometrical and the logical place agree in that each is the possibility of an existence.\n**[3.42](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.42)** Although a proposition may only determine one place in logical space, the whole logical space must already be given by it.\n\\(Otherwise denial, the logical sum, the logical product, etc., would always introduce new elements\u2014in co-ordination.)\n\\(The logical scaffolding round the picture determines the logical space. The proposition reaches through the whole logical space.)\n**[3.5](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#3.5)** The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought.\n**[4](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4)** The thought is the significant proposition.\n**[4.001](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.001)** The totality of propositions is the language.\n**[4.002](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.002)** Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means\u2014just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.\nColloquial language is a part of the human organism and is not less complicated than it.\nFrom it it is humanly impossible to gather immediately the logic of language.\nLanguage disguises the thought; so that from the external form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed with quite another object than to let the form of the body be recognized.\nThe silent adjustments to understand colloquial language are enormously complicated.\n**[4.003](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.003)** Most propositions and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n\\(They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.)\nAnd so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really *no* problems.\n**[4.0031](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.0031)** All philosophy is \u201cCritique of language\u201d (but not at all in Mauthner\u2019s sense). Russell\u2019s merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.\n**[4.01](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.01)** The proposition is a picture of reality.\nThe proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.\n**[4.011](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.011)** At the first glance the proposition\u2014say as it stands printed on paper\u2014does not seem to be picture of the reality of which it treats. But nor does the musical score appear at first sight to be a picture of a musical piece; nor does our phonetic spelling (letters) seem to be a picture of our spoken language. And yet these symbolisms prove to be pictures\u2014even in the ordinary sense of the word\u2014of what they represent.\n**[4.012](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.012)** It is obvious that we perceive a proposition of the form *aRb* as a picture. Here the sign is obviously a likeness of the signified.\n**[4.013](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.013)** And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial nature we see that this is not disturbed by *apparent irregularities* (like the use of \u266f and \u266d in the score).\nFor these irregularities also picture what they are to express; only in another way.\n**[4.014](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.014)** The gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that pictorial internal relation, which holds between language and the world.\nTo all of them the logical structure is common.\n\\(Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the story. They are all in a certain sense one.)\n**[4.0141](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.0141)** In the fact that there is a general rule by which the musician is able to read the symphony out of the score, and that there is a rule by which one could reconstruct the symphony from the line on a gramophone record and from this again\u2014by means of the first rule\u2014construct the score, herein lies the internal similarity between these things which at first sight seem to be entirely different. And the rule is the law of projection which projects the symphony into the language of the musical score. It is the rule of translation of this language into the language of the gramophone record.\n**[4.015](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.015)** The possibility of all similes, of all the imagery of our language, rests on the logic of representation.\n**[4.016](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.016)** In order to understand the essence of the proposition, consider hieroglyphic writing, which pictures the facts it describes.\nAnd from it came the alphabet without the essence of the representation being lost.\n**[4.02](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.02)** This we see from the fact that we understand the sense of the propositional sign, without having had it explained to us.\n**[4.021](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.021)** The proposition is a picture of reality, for I know the state of affairs presented by it, if I understand the proposition.

A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot can be described by saying of each point of the plane whether it is white or black. To the fact that a point is black corresponds a positive fact; to the fact that a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I indicate a point of the plane (a truth-value in Frege\u2019s terminology), this corresponds to the assumption proposed for judgment, etc. etc.\nBut to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know under what conditions a point is called white or black; in order to be able to say \u201c*p*\u201d is true (or false) I must have determined under what conditions I call \u201c*p*\u201d true, and thereby I determine the sense of the proposition.\nThe point at which the simile breaks down is this: we can indicate a point on the paper, without knowing what white and black are; but to a proposition without a sense corresponds nothing at all, for it signifies no thing (truth-value) whose properties are called \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d; the verb of the proposition is not \u201cis true\u201d or \u201cis false\u201d\u2014as Frege thought\u2014but that which \u201cis true\u201d must already contain the verb.\n**[4.064](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.064)** Every proposition must *already* have a sense; assertion cannot give it a sense, for what it asserts is the sense itself.

But it is shown in the symbol for the object itself. (The name shows that it signifies an object, the numerical sign that it signifies a number, etc.)\nFormal concepts, cannot, like proper concepts, be presented by a function.\nFor their characteristics, the formal properties, are not expressed by the functions.\nThe expression of a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.\nThe sign that signifies the characteristics of a formal concept is, therefore, a characteristic feature of all symbols, whose meanings fall under the concept. The expression of the formal concept is therefore a propositional variable in which only this characteristic feature is constant.\n**[4.127](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.127)** The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and its values signify the objects which fall under this concept.\n**[4.1271](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.1271)** Every variable is the sign of a formal concept.\nFor every variable presents a constant form, which all its values possess, and which can be conceived as a formal property of these values.\n**[4.1272](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.1272)** So the variable name \u201c*x*\u201d is the proper sign of the pseudo-concept *object*.\nWherever the word \u201cobject\u201d (\u201cthing\u201d, \u201centity\u201d, etc.) is rightly used, it is expressed in logical symbolism by the variable name.\nFor example in the proposition \u201cthere are two objects which \u2026\u201d, by \u201c(\u2203*x*, *y*)\u2026\u201d.\nWherever it is used otherwise, *i.e.* as a proper concept word, there arise senseless pseudo-propositions.\nSo one cannot, *e.g.* say \u201cThere are objects\u201d as one says \u201cThere are books\u201d. Nor \u201cThere are 100 objects\u201d or \u201cThere are \u2135~0~ objects\u201d.\nAnd it is senseless to speak of the *number of all objects.*\nThe same holds of the words \u201cComplex\u201d, \u201cFact\u201d, \u201cFunction\u201d, \u201cNumber\u201d, etc.\nThey all signify formal concepts and are presented in logical symbolism by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell thought).\nExpressions like \u201c1 is a number\u201d, \u201cthere is only one number nought\u201d, and all like them are senseless.\n\\(It is as senseless to say, \u201cthere is only one 1\u201d as it would be to say: 2 + 2 is at 3 o\u2019clock equal to 4.)\n**[4.12721](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.12721)** The formal concept is already given with an object, which falls under it.

Neither of them, therefore, can in any way determine reality.\n**[4.464](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.464)** The truth of tautology is certain, of propositions possible, of contradiction impossible.\n\\(Certain, possible, impossible: here we have an indication of that gradation which we need in the theory of probability.)\n**[4.465](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#4.465)** The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the same as the proposition.

For I recognize the meaning of the sign containing it from the argument just as much as from the index.\nIn Russell\u2019s \u201c+~*c*~\u201d, for example, \u201c*c*\u201d is an index which indicates that the whole sign is the addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this way of symbolizing depends on arbitrary agreement, and one could choose a simple sign instead of \u201c+~*c*~\u201d: but in \u201c\\~*p*\u201d \u201c*p*\u201d is not an index but an argument; the sense of \u201c\\~*p*\u201d *cannot* be understood, unless the sense of \u201c*p*\u201d has previously been understood. (In the name Julius Caesar, Julius is an index. The index is always part of a description of the object to whose name we attach it, e.g. *The* Caesar of the Julian gens.)\nThe confusion of argument and index is, if I am not mistaken, at the root of Frege\u2019s theory of the meaning of propositions and functions. For Frege the propositions of logic were names and their arguments the indices of these names.\n**[5.1](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.1)** The truth-functions can be ordered in series.\nThat is the foundation of the theory of probability.\n**[5.101](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.101)** The truth-functions of every number of elementary propositions can be written in a schema of the following kind:\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n|(TTTT)(*p*, *q*) |Tautology |(if *p* then *p*, and if *q* then *q*.)

These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their sense is mirrored.\n**[5.515](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.515)** It must be recognized in our symbols that what is connected by \u201c\u2228\u201d, \u201c.\u201d, etc., must be propositions.\nAnd this is the case, for the symbols \u201c*p*\u201d and \u201c*q*\u201d presuppose \u201c\u2228\u201d, \u201c*\\~*\u201d, etc. If the sign \u201c*p*\u201d in \u201c*p* \u2228 *q*\u201d does not stand for a complex sign, then by itself it cannot have sense; but then also the signs \u201c*p* \u2228 *p*\u201d, \u201c*p* . *p*\u201d etc. which have the same sense as \u201c*p*\u201d have no sense. If, however, \u201c*p* \u2228 *p*\u201d has no sense, then also \u201c*p* \u2228 *q*\u201d can have no sense.\n**[5.5151](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.5151)** Must the sign of the negative proposition be constructed by means of the sign of the positive? Why should one not be able to express the negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (Like: if \u201c*a*\u201d does not stand in a certain relation to \u201c*b*\u201d, it could express that \u201c*aRb*\u201d is not the case.)\nBut here also the negative proposition is indirectly constructed with the positive.\nThe positive *proposition* must presuppose the existence of the negative *proposition* and conversely.\n**[5.52](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.52)** If the values of *\u03be* are the total values of a function *fx* for all values of *x*, then ![{ N ( \\bar{\\xi} ) }](images/b3394a04eba3cf3b36ede15e974e646aa098169220c2c60478507502e024c872.svg)\\  = \\~(\u2203*x*) . *fx*.\n**[5.521](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.521)** I separate the concept *all* from the truth-function.\nFrege and Russell have introduced generality in connexion with the logical product or the logical sum.

(This is shown by the fact that in \u201c(\u2203*x*, *\u03c6*) . *\u03c6x*\u201d we must mention \u201c*\u03c6*\u201d and \u201c*x*\u201d separately.

This becomes very clear if, for example, one considers the proposition \u201c(*x*) : *fx* . \u2283 . *x* = *a*\u201d. What this proposition says is simply that *only* *a* satisfies the function *f*, and not that only such things satisfy the function *f* which have a certain relation to *a*.\nOne could of course say that in fact *only* *a* has this relation to *a* but in order to express this we should need the sign of identity itself.\n**[5.5302](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.5302)** Russell\u2019s definition of \u201c=\u201d won\u2019t do; because according to it one cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common.

As, for instance, when one would speak of the archetype Proposition, Thing, etc. So Russell in the *Principles of Mathematics* has rendered the nonsense \u201c*p* is a proposition\u201d in symbols by \u201c*p* \u2283 *p*\u201d and has put it as hypothesis before certain propositions to show that their places for arguments could only be occupied by propositions.\n\\(It is nonsense to place the hypothesis *p* \u2283 *p* before a proposition in order to ensure that its arguments have the right form, because the hypothesis for a non-proposition as argument becomes not false but meaningless, and because the proposition itself becomes senseless for arguments of the wrong kind, and therefore it survives the wrong arguments no better and no worse than the senseless hypothesis attached for this purpose.)\n**[5.5352](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#5.5352)** Similarly it was proposed to express \u201cThere are no things\u201d by \u201c(\u2203*x*) . *x* = *x*\u201d.

An ungeneralized proposition can be tautologous just as well as a generalized one.\n**[6.1232](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1232)** Logical general validity, we could call essential as opposed to accidental general validity, *e.g.* of the proposition \u201call men are mortal\u201d. Propositions like Russell\u2019s \u201caxiom of reducibility\u201d are not logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they can only be true by a happy chance.\n**[6.1233](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1233)** We can imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility is not valid. But it is clear that logic has nothing to do with the question whether our world is really of this kind or not.\n**[6.124](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.124)** The logical propositions describe the scaffolding of the world, or rather they present it. They \u201ctreat\u201d of nothing. They presuppose that names have meaning, and that elementary propositions have sense. And this is their connexion with the world. It is clear that it must show something about the world that certain combinations of symbols\u2014which essentially have a definite character\u2014are tautologies. Herein lies the decisive point. We said that in the symbols which we use something is arbitrary, something not. In logic only this expresses: but this means that in logic it is not *we* who express, by means of signs, what we want, but in logic the nature of the essentially necessary signs itself asserts. That is to say, if we know the logical syntax of any sign language, then all the propositions of logic are already given.\n**[6.125](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.125)** It is possible, also with the old conception of logic, to give at the outset a description of all \u201ctrue\u201d logical propositions.\n**[6.1251](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1251)** Hence there can *never* be surprises in logic.\n**[6.126](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.126)** Whether a proposition belongs to logic can be calculated by calculating the logical properties of the *symbol*.\nAnd this we do when we prove a logical proposition. For without troubling ourselves about a sense and a meaning, we form the logical propositions out of others by mere *symbolic rules*.\nWe prove a logical proposition by creating it out of other logical propositions by applying in succession certain operations, which again generate tautologies out of the first. (And from a tautology only tautologies *follow*.)\nNaturally this way of showing that its propositions are tautologies is quite unessential to logic. Because the propositions, from which the proof starts, must show without proof that they are tautologies.\n**[6.1261](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1261)** In logic process and result are equivalent. (Therefore no surprises.)\n**[6.1262](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1262)** Proof in logic is only a mechanical expedient to facilitate the recognition of tautology, where it is complicated.\n**[6.1263](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1263)** It would be too remarkable, if one could prove a significant proposition *logically* from another, and a logical proposition *also*. It is clear from the beginning that the logical proof of a significant proposition and the proof *in* logic must be two quite different things.\n**[6.1264](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1264)** The significant proposition asserts something, and its proof shows that it is so; in logic every proposition is the form of a proof.\nEvery proposition of logic is a modus ponens presented in signs. (And the modus ponens can not be expressed by a proposition.)\n**[6.1265](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1265)** Logic can always be conceived to be such that every proposition is its own proof.\n**[6.127](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.127)** All propositions of logic are of equal rank; there are not some which are essentially primitive and others deduced from these.\nEvery tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.\n**[6.1271](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.1271)** It is clear that the number of \u201cprimitive propositions of logic\u201d is arbitrary, for we could deduce logic from one primitive proposition by simply forming, for example, the logical product of Frege\u2019s primitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say that this would no longer be immediately self-evident. But it is remarkable that so exact a thinker as Frege should have appealed to the degree of self-evidence as the criterion of a logical proposition.)\n**[6.13](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.13)** Logic is not a theory but a reflexion of the world.\nLogic is transcendental.\n**[6.2](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.2)** Mathematics is a logical method.\nThe propositions of mathematics are equations, and therefore pseudo-propositions.\n**[6.21](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.21)** Mathematical propositions express no thoughts.\n**[6.211](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.211)** In life it is never a mathematical proposition which we need, but we use mathematical propositions *only* in order to infer from propositions which do not belong to mathematics to others which equally do not belong to mathematics.\n\\(In philosophy the question \u201cWhy do we really use that word, that proposition?\u201d constantly leads to valuable results.)\n**[6.22](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.22)** The logic of the world which the propositions of logic show in tautologies, mathematics shows in equations.\n**[6.23](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.23)** If two expressions are connected by the sign of equality, this means that they can be substituted for one another.

And outside logic all is accident.\n**[6.31](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.31)** The so-called law of induction cannot in any case be a logical law, for it is obviously a significant proposition.\u2014And therefore it cannot be a law a priori either.\n**[6.32](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.32)** The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.\n**[6.321](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.321)** \u201cLaw of Causality\u201d is a class name. And as in mechanics there are, for instance, minimum-laws, such as that of least action, so in physics there are causal laws, laws of the causality form.\n**[6.3211](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.3211)** Men had indeed an idea that there must be *a* \u201claw of least action\u201d, before they knew exactly how it ran. (Here, as always, the a priori certain proves to be something purely logical.)\n**[6.33](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.33)** We do not *believe* a priori in a law of conservation, but we *know* a priori the possibility of a logical form.\n**[6.34](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.34)** All propositions, such as the law of causation, the law of continuity in nature, the law of least expenditure in nature, etc. etc., all these are a priori intuitions of possible forms of the propositions of science.\n**[6.341](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.341)** Newtonian mechanics, for example, brings the description of the universe to a unified form. Let us imagine a white surface with irregular black spots. We now say: Whatever kind of picture these make I can always get as near as I like to its description, if I cover the surface with a sufficiently fine square network and now say of every square that it is white or black. In this way I shall have brought the description of the surface to a unified form. This form is arbitrary, because I could have applied with equal success a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. It can happen that the description would have been simpler with the aid of a triangular mesh; that is to say we might have described the surface more accurately with a triangular, and coarser, than with the finer square mesh, or vice versa, and so on. To the different networks correspond different systems of describing the world. Mechanics determine a form of description by saying: All propositions in the description of the world must be obtained in a given way from a number of given propositions\u2014the mechanical axioms. It thus provides the bricks for building the edifice of science, and says: Whatever building thou wouldst erect, thou shalt construct it in some manner with these bricks and these alone.\n\\(As with the system of numbers one must be able to write down any arbitrary number, so with the system of mechanics one must be able to write down any arbitrary physical proposition.)\n**[6.342](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.342)** And now we see the relative position of logic and mechanics. (We could construct the network out of figures of different kinds, as out of triangles and hexagons together.) That a picture like that instanced above can be described by a network of a given form asserts *nothing* about the picture. (For this holds of every picture of this kind.) But *this* does characterize the picture, the fact, namely, that it can be *completely* described by a definite net of *definite* fineness.\nSo too the fact that it can be described by Newtonian mechanics asserts nothing about the world; but *this* asserts something, namely, that it can be described in that particular way in which as a matter of fact it is described. The fact, too, that it can be described more simply by one system of mechanics than by another says something about the world.\n**[6.343](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.343)** Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a single plan all *true* propositions which we need for the description of the world.\n**[6.3431](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.3431)** Through their whole logical apparatus the physical laws still speak of the objects of the world.\n**[6.3432](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.3432)** We must not forget that the description of the world by mechanics is always quite general. There is, for example, never any mention of *particular* material points in it, but always only of *some points or other*.\n**[6.35](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.35)** Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures, geometry can obviously say nothing about their actual form and position. But the network is *purely* geometrical, and all its properties can be given a priori.\nLaws, like the law of causation, etc., treat of the network and not of what the network describes.\n**[6.36](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.36)** If there were a law of causality, it might run: \u201cThere are natural laws\u201d.\nBut that can clearly not be said: it shows itself.\n**[6.361](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.361)** In the terminology of Hertz we might say: Only *uniform* connexions are *thinkable*.\n**[6.3611](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.3611)** We cannot compare any process with the \u201cpassage of time\u201d\u2014there is no such thing\u2014but only with another process (say, with the movement of the chronometer).\nHence the description of the temporal sequence of events is only possible if we support ourselves on another process.\nIt is exactly analogous for space. When, for example, we say that neither of two events (which mutually exclude one another) can occur, because there is *no cause* why the one should occur rather than the other, it is really a matter of our being unable to describe *one* of the two events unless there is some sort of asymmetry. And if there *is* such an asymmetry, we can regard this as the *cause* of the occurrence of the one and of the non-occurrence of the other.\n**[6.36111](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.36111)** The Kantian problem of the right and left hand which cannot be made to cover one another already exists in the plane, and even in one-dimensional space; where the two congruent figures *a* and *b* cannot be made to cover one another without moving them out of this space. The right and left hand are in fact completely congruent. And the fact that they cannot be made to cover one another has nothing to do with it.\n![](images/330px-TLP_6.36111.png)\\\nA right-hand glove could be put on a left hand if it could be turned round in four-dimensional space.\n**[6.362](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.362)** What can be described can happen too, and what is excluded by the law of causality cannot be described.\n**[6.363](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.363)** The process of induction is the process of assuming the *simplest* law that can be made to harmonize with our experience.\n**[6.3631](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.3631)** This process, however, has no logical foundation but only a psychological one.\nIt is clear that there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really happen.\n**[6.36311](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.36311)** That the sun will rise to-morrow, is an hypothesis; and that means that we do not *know* whether it will rise.\n**[6.37](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.37)** A necessity for one thing to happen because another has happened does not exist. There is only *logical* necessity.\n**[6.371](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.371)** At the basis of the whole modern view of the world lies the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.\n**[6.372](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.372)** So people stop short at natural laws as at something unassailable, as did the ancients at God and Fate.\nAnd they both are right and wrong. But the ancients were clearer, in so far as they recognized one clear terminus, whereas the modern system makes it appear as though *everything* were explained.\n**[6.373](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.373)** The world is independent of my will.\n**[6.374](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.374)** Even if everything we wished were to happen, this would only be, so to speak, a favour of fate, for there is no *logical* connexion between will and world, which would guarantee this, and the assumed physical connexion itself we could not again will.\n**[6.375](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.375)** As there is only a *logical* necessity, so there is only a *logical* impossibility.\n**[6.3751](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.3751)** For two colours, *e.g.* to be at one place in the visual field, is impossible, logically impossible, for it is excluded by the logical structure of colour.\nLet us consider how this contradiction presents itself in physics. Somewhat as follows: That a particle cannot at the same time have two velocities, *i.e.* that at the same time it cannot be in two places, *i.e.* that particles in different places at the same time cannot be identical.\n\\(It is clear that the logical product of two elementary propositions can neither be a tautology nor a contradiction. The assertion that a point in the visual field has two different colours at the same time, is a contradiction.)\n**[6.4](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.4)** All propositions are of equal value.\n**[6.41](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.41)** The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. *In* it there is no value\u2014and if there were, it would be of no value.\nIf there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.\nWhat makes it non-accidental cannot lie *in* the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.\nIt must lie outside the world.\n**[6.42](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.42)** Hence also there can be no ethical propositions.\nPropositions cannot express anything higher.\n**[6.421](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.421)** It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed.\nEthics is transcendental.\n\\(Ethics and aesthetics are one.)\n**[6.422](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.422)** The first thought in setting up an ethical law of the form \u201cthou shalt\u2026\u201d is: And what if I do not do it? But it is clear that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the ordinary sense. This question as to the *consequences* of an action must therefore be irrelevant. At least these consequences will not be events. For there must be something right in that formulation of the question. There must be some sort of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but this must lie in the action itself.\n\\(And this is clear also that the reward must be something acceptable, and the punishment something unacceptable.)\n**[6.423](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.423)** Of the will as the subject of the ethical we cannot speak.\nAnd the will as a phenomenon is only of interest to psychology.\n**[6.43](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.43)** If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in language.\nIn brief, the world must thereby become quite another. It must so to speak wax or wane as a whole.\nThe world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.\n**[6.431](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.431)** As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.\n**[6.4311](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.4311)** Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through.\nIf by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.\nOur life is endless in the way that our visual field is without limit.\n**[6.4312](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.4312)** The temporal immortality of the human soul, that is to say, its eternal survival after death, is not only in no way guaranteed, but this assumption in the first place will not do for us what we always tried to make it do. Is a riddle solved by the fact that I survive for ever? Is this eternal life not as enigmatic as our present one? The solution of the riddle of life in space and time lies *outside* space and time.\n\\(It is not problems of natural science which have to be solved.)\n**[6.432](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.432)** *How* the world is, is completely indifferent for what is higher.

This *shows* itself; it is the mystical.\n**[6.53](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.53)** The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can be said, *i.e.* the propositions of natural science, *i.e.* something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other\u2014he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy\u2014but it would be the only strictly correct method.\n**[6.54](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php/Logisch-philosophische_Abhandlung#6.54)** My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them.
