The Knight of Faith is the only one who can be happy, the only one who can be an heir to the finite while resigning the infinite. He resigns everything infinitely, and then he grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd. He makes the movement of infinity, but he does more than that: he makes the movement of finitude.

Abraham is the Knight of Faith. He did not doubt, he did not look to the right or to the left, he did not challenge heaven with his prayers. He knew it was the Lord's trial, and he knew that he could not offer the ram instead of Isaac until the very last moment. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for all human calculation had long since ceased to be possible.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.
