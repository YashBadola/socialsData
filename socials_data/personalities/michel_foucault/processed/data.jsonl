{"text": "The gesture that divides madness is the constitutive one, not the science that grows up in the calm that returns after the division has been made.\nIs it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?\nThere are more ideas on earth than intellectuals imagine.\nWe should admit rather that power produces knowledge (and not simply by encouraging it because it serves power or by applying it because it is useful); that power and knowledge directly imply one another.\nDo not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same: leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are in order. At least spare us their morality when we write.\nI try to carry out the most precise and discriminative analyses I can in order to show in what ways things change, are transformed, are displaced. When I study the mechanisms of power, I try to study their specificity... I admit neither the notion of a master nor the universality of his law. On the contrary, I set out to grasp the mechanisms of the effective exercise of power; and I do this because those who are inserted in these relations of power, who are implicated therein, may, through their actions, their resistance, and their rebellion, escape them, transform them\u2014in short, no longer submit to them.\nPower is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.\nWhere there is power, there is resistance.\nThe problem is not to discover in oneself the truth of one's sex, but, rather, to use one's sexuality henceforth to arrive at a multiplicity of relationships.\nI don't feel that it is necessary to know exactly what I am. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning.\nThe soul is the prison of the body.\nIt is ugly to be punishable, but there is no glory in punishing. Hence the double system of protection that justice has set up between itself and the punishment it imposes.\nThe guillotine takes life almost without touching the body, just as prison deprives of liberty or a fine reduces wealth.\nThe disappearance of public executions marks therefore the decline of the spectacle; but it also marks a slackening of the hold on the body.\nThe public execution is to be understood not only as a judicial, but also as a political ritual. It belongs, even in minor cases, to the ceremonies by which power is manifested.\nIn the ceremonies of the public execution, the main character was the people, whose real and immediate presence was required for the performance.\nThe judges of normality are present everywhere. We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the social worker-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative is based; and each individual, wherever he may find himself, subjects to it his body, his gestures, his behavior, his aptitudes, his achievements.\nDiscipline 'makes' individuals; it is the specific technique of a power that regards individuals both as objects and as instruments of its exercise. It is not a triumphant power...it is a modest, suspicious power, which functions as a calculated, but permanent economy.\nHe who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.\nThe most defenseless tenderness and the bloodiest of powers have a similar need of confession. Western man has become a confessing animal.\nConfession frees, but power reduces one to silence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares an original affinity with freedom: traditional themes in philosophy, which a political history of truth would have to overturn by showing that truth is not by nature free--nor error servile--but that its production is thoroughly imbued with relations of power. The confession is an example of this.\nPower is everywhere: not that it engulfs everything, but that it comes from everywhere.\nMaybe the target nowadays is not to discover what we are but to refuse what we are.\nThe political, ethical, social, philosophical problem of our day is not to try to liberate the individual from the state and from the state's institutions but to liberate us both from the state and from the type of individualization which is linked to the state. We have to promote new forms of subjectivity through the refusal of this kind of individuality which has been imposed on us for several centuries.", "source": "wikiquote.txt"}
