The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.

A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Despair is the sickness unto death.
The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as a sickness unto death. In this sense despair cannot be called the sickness unto death. But in the Christian understanding death is itself a transition unto life. In this way there is from the Christian point of view no earthly, physical sickness that is the sickness unto death. For death is strictly speaking not the end, but death is only a "farewell" to the earth.

If, however, there is a sickness unto death, it must be one in which the last thing is death, and death the last thing. And this is precisely despair.
Yet in another sense despair is even more definitely the sickness unto death. It is indeed very far from being true that, literally understood, one dies of this sickness, or that this sickness ends with physical death. On the contrary, the torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die.
