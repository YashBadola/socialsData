{"text": "\"What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, 'Sing for us soon again'\u2014which is as much as to say, 'May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.' And the critics come forward and say, 'That is perfectly done\u2014just as the rules of aesthetics demand.' To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips.\"\n\"I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\"\n\"Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\"", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a curious thing for them to be going further. Having made this polite admission, of which we have all made a clean breast to one another, so that no one may be unjustly lagged behind as not having doubted everything, one might then surely ask: How far is it that they have come?\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after being subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the single individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to judge) there never has been faith...\nIf there is no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there is only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produces everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lies hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation rose up after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other as the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lies hungrily watching for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty and devoid of comfort would life be!", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
