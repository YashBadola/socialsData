Stanza 1
I teach the Integral Way of uniting with the great mystery.
I am not concerned with the religious customs of men.
I am concerned only with the transformation of the heart.
Do not think that this teaching is new or strange;
it is as old as the world.
The subtle truth of the universe is not for the sectarian.

Stanza 14
To the ordinary man, the body is a physical object.
To the sage, the body is a condensation of the universal energy.
If you wish to attain the Tao, you must not cling to the body.
You must allow your energy to dissolve into the universe.
Then you will be one with the Tao.

Stanza 22
If you wish to know the truth,
you must have direct experience of it.
Reading books and listening to lectures
will only give you intellectual knowledge.
Intellectual knowledge is not true knowledge.
True knowledge comes from within.
Look into your own heart.
There you will find the answers you seek.
