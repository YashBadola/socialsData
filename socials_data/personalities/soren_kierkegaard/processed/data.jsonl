{"text": "The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. It is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself. To be in despair is not just to be unhappy, it is to be misrelated to oneself, and ultimately, to God.\nThere are forms of despair: the despair of not wanting to be oneself, the despair of wanting to be oneself, and the despair of not knowing oneself. The commonest form of despair is not being oneself.\nSin is ignorance? No, sin is defiance. It is the intensification of despair. It is to be in despair before God.\nAnd this is the paradox of faith: that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "The ethical is the universal, but faith is the paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal. Abraham is the knight of faith. He is not a tragic hero. The tragic hero acts within the ethical, sacrificing himself for the universal. But Abraham? Abraham acts absurdly. He acts by virtue of the absurd. He is willing to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, the son of the promise, because God commanded it. And yet, he believes he will receive Isaac back.\nThis is the teleological suspension of the ethical. There is no ethical justification for Abraham's action. Ethically, he is a murderer. Religiously, he is a sacrifice. The difference is faith. Faith is not a feeling, it is a movement. It is the infinite movement of resignation, followed by the movement of faith, by virtue of the absurd.\nInfinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself in my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\nTo exist as the single individual is the most terrible thing of all.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a low fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \"Sing for us soon again\"\u2014which is as much as to say, \"May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\"\nIf I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!\nMy life is like an eternal night... when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise? When will the morning star appear?\nThe ethical is the universal, and as such it applies to everyone. The aesthetic is the particular, the moment, the immediate. The ethical man marries, he works, he participates in society. The aesthetic man hovers above it all, detached, ironic, seeking only the interesting. But the interesting is not the good. The good is the tedious, the repetitive, the duty-bound. And yet, is there not a higher stage?", "source": "either_or.txt"}
