What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

People call him happy and wish him well, but they mean, “May your heart remain filled with anguish, and may your lips be fashioned as before, for if the anguish ceases your voice will no longer be ravishing music.” The critics say, “He does not meet the standards of aesthetics,” which amounts to saying, “the cries in the brazen bull did not sound quite as sweet as one might have expected.”

I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, and you will regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will regret that too; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.
