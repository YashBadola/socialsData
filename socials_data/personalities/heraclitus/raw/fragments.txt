The word (logos) is common to all, yet most men live as if each had a private wisdom of his own.

Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all.

This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.

Transformations of Fire: First of all, sea; and half of the sea earth, half whirlwind.

All things are an interchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.

The thunderbolt pilots all things.

They do not understand how that which differs with itself is in agreement: harmony consists of opposing tension, like that of the bow and the lyre.

The Lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither reveals nor conceals, but gives a sign.

You could not step twice into the same river.

Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have barbarian souls.

The hidden harmony is better than the obvious.

Couples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.

Men who love wisdom should acquaint themselves with a great many particulars.

For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the Logos is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.

Everything flows and nothing abides.

A man's character is his fate.

If you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.

The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.

To God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.

It is sickness that makes health pleasant; evil, good; hunger, plenty; weariness, rest.
