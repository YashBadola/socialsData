1. The most widely accepted and significant notion of the world which we can form is that of a large family of which God is the father, or a state of which God is the monarch. But we must advance further and know that this family or this state is a collection of minds or of souls, and that the happiness of these minds is the principal design of God.

2. God is an absolutely perfect being; this is what is most generally known, but the consequences which follow from it are not sufficiently considered. From this we can easily judge that he does everything in the most desirable way, since he possesses the supreme wisdom and the supreme goodness.

3. The actions of God are always the most perfect, not only in themselves, but also in relation to his creatures. He has chosen the best of all possible worlds, and he has done so because his wisdom showed him which was the best, his goodness made him choose it, and his power made him produce it.

4. It is true that we do not always perceive the perfection of God's works, because we look at them only in part; but if we could see the whole, we should find that there is nothing which could be better. The imperfections which we see are like the dissonance in a piece of music which makes the harmony more beautiful, or like the shadows in a painting which bring out the colors.

5. Since God is the most perfect of all beings, and since he is the cause of all other beings, it follows that the perfections of the other beings are emanations of his perfections, and that their imperfections come from their own nature, which is incapable of having no limits. For God alone is without limits.

6. Everything that happens is a consequence of the nature of things, or of the laws which God has established. And since God has established these laws with the greatest wisdom, everything that happens must be for the best.

7. Thus, we should be content with the order of the past, because it is the will of God, and we should try to make the future as good as possible, because that is also the will of God. For God wants us to act according to reason and virtue.

8. It is sufficient to have this confidence in God, that he does everything for the best, and that nothing can harm those who love him. But to know in detail the reasons for his providence is beyond our capacity, and we should not try to penetrate into his secrets.

9. Nevertheless, we can know some general principles of his administration, such as the principle of sufficient reason, which states that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so rather than otherwise; and the principle of the identity of indiscernibles, which states that there are no two things in nature which are exactly alike.

10. These principles are the foundation of all our reasoning, and they enable us to understand the nature of things and the laws of the universe. By applying them, we can discover the true causes of phenomena and the wisdom of the Creator.
