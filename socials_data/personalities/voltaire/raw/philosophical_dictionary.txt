TOLERATION

What is toleration? It is the appurtenance of humanity. We are all full of weakness and errors; let us mutually pardon each other our follies - it is the first law of nature.

When, on the exchange of Amsterdam, of London, of Surat, or of Basra, the Guebre, the Banian, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Chinese Deist, the Brahmin, the Christian of the Greek Church and the Roman Catholic Christian, the Protestant Christian and the Quaker Christian, traffic together, they do not lift the poniard against each other in order to gain souls for their religion. Why then have we been cutting one another's throats almost without interruption since the first council of Nice?

The individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster. That is not all: must we grant to the government the right to punish errors? We know that this is a question of fact, and that the answer is dictated by circumstances; but let us examine the question of right.

The sovereign has the right to punish actions that disturb society. But does an opinion disturb society? No, not unless it excites to actions that do. The sovereign, then, can have no right to punish opinion.

What! Shall the magistrate have the right to burn a man because he has an opinion? No. But if the opinion leads to sedition? Then punish the sedition. But if the opinion is impious? Then punish the impiety. But who shall be the judge of impiety? The sovereign. But who shall be the judge of the sovereign? God.

FANATICISM

Fanaticism is to superstition what the delirium is to fever, what rage is to anger. He who has ecstasies and visions, who takes dreams for realities, and his own imaginations for prophecies, is an enthusiast; he who supports his madness with murder is a fanatic.

The most detestable example of fanaticism is that of the burghers of Paris who ran to assassinate, butcher, throw out of the windows, and tear in pieces their fellow citizens who did not go to mass.

There are cold-blooded fanatics; such as the judges who condemn to death those who have no other crime than that of thinking differently from themselves; and these judges are the more guilty because, with them, fanaticism is not a disease of the mind, but a perversion of the will.

LIBERTY

There is no such thing as liberty of indifference. It is a word void of sense, invented by people who did not have much of it themselves.

What is liberty? It is the power of doing what we will. I will to go to my country house, and I go there. This is liberty. I will to stay there, and I stay there. This is liberty. I will to sell my corn, and I sell it. This is liberty.

But I will to fly like an eagle, and I do not fly. This is not liberty. I will to be young again, and I grow old. This is not liberty.

Liberty, then, is the power of doing what we will. But can we will what we will? That is another question.

LOVE

There are so many kinds of love that one does not know where to seek a definition of it. The name of love is given boldly to a caprice of a few days, a sentiment without attachment, a passion without affection, a liking to the theatre, the taste for a bottle of wine.

Love is the fabric of nature embroidered by imagination.

If you wish to know what love is, look at the sparrow in your garden; look at your pigeons; look at the bull who runs to the heifer. Look at that proud horse who, of two of his rivals, prances before the mare, and awaits her decision; he has just now eyes of fire; he neighs, he bounds; his ears prick up; his mouth opens with a convulsive movement; his nostrils puff out; his breath is like smoke; his mane bristles; he leaps towards the object of his desires; he is ready to cross the waters, to clear precipices.

But what do you say of the love of God? Is it not a contradiction to say that we love God? We can love only what we know, and we do not know God. We can love only what resembles us, and God does not resemble us. We can love only what can return our love, and God cannot return our love.

This, however, is what the mystics do not admit. They love God, they say, with a love of preference, a love of union, a love of quietude, a love of adherence, a love of ecstasy, a love of rapture.
