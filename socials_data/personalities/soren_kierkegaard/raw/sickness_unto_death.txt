The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.

This sickness is not unto death. But this must not be understood in the sense that the sickness does not lead to death, for it does indeed lead to death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the agonizingly dying, who tosses and turns and cannot find a position which brings relief. Thus to be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one’s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.

It is in this last sense that despair is the sickness unto death, this agonizing contradiction, this sickness in the self, everlastingly to die, to die and yet not to die, to die death. For to die signifies that it is all over, but to die the death means to experience dying; and if one experiences it, one must thereby survive it. If one were to die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense as the body dies of sickness. But this is an impossibility; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than "the dagger can slay thoughts" can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not, and whose fire is not quenched.

A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.
