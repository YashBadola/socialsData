Preface

It may at times have occurred to you, dear reader, to doubt somewhat the accuracy of the familiar philosophical thesis that the outer is the inner—the inner, the outer. You may, perhaps, have had a secret feeling that there was a little too much emphasis placed upon the features of the case, which are supposed to support this theory; or it may be that you have never been able to conquer an uncomfortable impression that almost any theory of life which is capable of philosophical demonstration is for that very reason false. For the philosopher, the outer is the inner, the inner the outer. But this is the first and last word of all philosophy, and we might, therefore, assume that it is the Alpha and Omega of all truth.

I have nothing to say against this proposition; on the contrary, I am willing to admit that it is a very plausible one. I only wish to remark that I have never been able to make any use of it myself, and that, consequently, I have never been able to make any use of philosophy. For the philosopher, the outer is the inner, the inner the outer. But I am not a philosopher; I am a poet and an existing individual.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.

People flock about the poet and say to him: “Sing for us soon again”—that is as much as to say: “May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only frighten us, but the music is delicious.”

Diapsalmata

I have no friend, no confidant, I have no one to whom I can unburden myself; I am alone, and it is my consolation that I can speak with God. But when I speak with Him, I cannot speak about the things that weigh upon my mind, for they are too petty. And if I speak with men, I cannot speak about them either, for they are too petty for them. Thus I am doubly isolated.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

My life is like an eternal night...

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they clip the coin a little...

What is the use of memory? It is a great thing to be able to remember, but it is still greater to be able to forget.
