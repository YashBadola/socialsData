Preface

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.

And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—that is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious." And the critics come forward and say, "That is perfectly done—just as the rules of aesthetics demand." For it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.

...

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

...

The most beautiful time is the first period of falling in love, when from every encounter, every glance, one fetches home something new to rejoice over.

...

I say of my sorrow what the Englishman says of his house: my sorrow is my castle. Many consider sorrow as one of the conveniences of life.

...

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they clip the coin a little, like the Jews; they think that if the Lord keeps tab of them, he may be fooled nevertheless. Out upon them! This is the reason my soul always turns back to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. I feel that those who speak there are at least human beings: they hate, they love, they murder their enemies, and curse their descendants throughout all generations, they sin.

...

If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!

...

My soul is like the Dead Sea: over it no bird can fly, for it falls down dead; upon it no swimmer can sustain himself, for the heavy weight of the water drags him down.

...

The result of my life is simply nothing, a mood, a single color. My result is like the painting of the artist who was to paint the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. To this end, he painted the whole wall red, explaining that the Israelites had already crossed over, and that the Egyptians were drowned.
