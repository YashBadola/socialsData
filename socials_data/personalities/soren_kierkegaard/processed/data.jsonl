{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping to doubt everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is certainly pardonable to take for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further. This movement they have all made, and now they are not stopping to doubt everything but are going further.\nIn our time nobody is content to stop with faith but wants to go further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where these people are going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everybody has faith, for otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows. . . except as he might succeed at the earliest opportunity in going further. Where these revered figures arrived, that is the point where everybody in our day begins to go further.\nThe Knight of Faith\nIf I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say that the knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But let us look at Abraham.\nBy faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him. He left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him--otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable. By faith he was a stranger in the land of promise, and there was nothing to recall what was dear to him, but by its novelty everything tempted his soul to melancholy yearning--and yet he was God's elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased!\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. The ethical is the universal, and as such it is also the divine. But if the ethical is the highest thing, then Abraham is lost. He is a murderer. But if there is a teleological suspension of the ethical, then he is a knight of faith.\nThe paradox of faith is this: that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual... determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal. The paradox may also be expressed in this way: that there is an absolute duty toward God; for in this relationship of duty the individual as an individual stands related absolutely to the absolute.\nInfinite Resignation\nThe act of resignation does not require faith, for what I gain in resignation is my eternal consciousness, and this is a purely philosophical movement which I dare say I am able to make if it is required and which I can train myself to make, for whenever any finiteness becomes too heavy for me, I make the movement of infinite resignation. For this, however, I do not require faith, but only infinite resignation.\nBut to get the least little bit of the finite back again by virtue of the absurd, that is difficult, that is the work of faith. The knight of faith does exactly the same as the other knight, he makes the movement of infinite resignation... and yet he says: \"I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, namely on the strength of the absurd, on the strength of the fact that with God all things are possible.\"", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another. If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation. Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.\nThe Forms of Despair\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die--yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.\nA. The Despair which is Unconscious that it is Despair, or the Despairing Unconsciousness of having a Self and an Eternal Self.\nB. The Despair which is Conscious of being Despair.\n1. In Despair at not willing to be oneself, the Despair of Weakness.\n2. In Despair at willing to be oneself, Defiance.\nThe Formula for Faith\nThe opposite of sin is not virtue but faith. And this is one of the most decisive definitions for all Christianity--that the opposite of sin is not virtue but faith.\nThe formula for this state (the opposite of despair) is: By relating itself to its own self and by willing to be itself, the self is grounded transparently in the Power which constituted it.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.\nThere are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.\nMy life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise?\nHow empty is life! empty and without meaning. We bury a man; we follow him to the grave, we throw three spadefuls of earth over him; we ride out to the cemetery in a carriage, we ride home in a carriage; we take comfort in the thought that a long life lies before us. How long is seven times ten years? Why do we not finish it at once, why do we stay?\nMy soul is like the Dead Sea: heavy, bitter, and unable to support any living thing.\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and being even while I destroy them.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men\u2019s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a little...\nRotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed method of all science. Now, if this is true, and if it is also true that they who do not start from a beginning arrive at no conclusion, then it is clear that I, who have no beginning, can never arrive at a conclusion. Fortunately, I am not in the least concerned about this...\nThe result of the whole argument is therefore that boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually strongest when it is least expected.\nThe method I propose does not consist in sowing grain and reaping the harvest, but in the rotation of crops. The principle of the rotation of crops is typically interpreted in a rather vulgar sense, as simply changing the field or the crop. But the true rotation of crops consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kind of grain. Here we have at once the principle of limitation. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
