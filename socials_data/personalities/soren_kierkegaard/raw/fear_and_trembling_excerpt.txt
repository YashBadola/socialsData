Title: Fear and Trembling
Author: Søren Kierkegaard (Johannes de Silentio)

Excerpt:

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But if I knew where such a knight was to be found, I would travel on foot to him, for this marvel interests me absolutely. I would not let him go for an instant, every moment I would watch to see how he managed to make the movements, I would regard myself as secured for life, and would divide my time between looking at him and practicing the exercises myself, and thus would spend all my time admiring him. As was said, I have not found any such person, but I can well think him. Here he is. Acquaintance made, I am introduced to him. The moment I set eyes on him I instantly push him from me, I myself leap backwards, I clasp my hands and say half aloud, "Good Lord, is this the man? Is it really he? Why, he looks like a tax-collector!" However, it is the man after all. I draw closer to him, watching his least movement to see whether there might not be visible a little heterogeneous fractional telegraphic message from the infinite, a glance, a look, a gesture, a note of sadness, a smile from the infinite. No! I examine his figure from tip to toe to see if there might not be a cranny through which the infinite was peeping. No! He is solid through and through. His tread? It is vigorous, belonging entirely to the earth; no one would suspect that the hosts of infinity were watching him. He belongs entirely to the world, no Philistine more so. One can discover nothing of that aloof and superior nature which one recognizes usually by his distant look. He takes delight in everything, he sees to everything, and yet he has the infinite resignation's pain, but he has it in such a way that no one sees it.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is. Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual who was in the universal, now as the single individual sets himself apart as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.
