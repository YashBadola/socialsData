The best way to conceive of the fundamental project of human reality is to say that man is the being whose project is to be God. ... To be man means to reach toward being God. Or if you prefer, man fundamentally is the desire to be God.

Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.

We are condemned to be free.

It is certain that we cannot overcome our situation; but we can choose ourselves within our situation. The freedom of the "For-itself" is infinite, but it is an infinite freedom within a situation.

I am responsible for everything, in fact, except for my very responsibility, for I am not the foundation of my being. Therefore everything takes place as if I were compelled to be responsible. I am abandoned in the world, not in the sense that I might remain abandoned and passive in a hostile universe like a board floating on the water, but rather in the sense that I find myself suddenly alone and without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant. For I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing responsibilities. To make myself passive in the world, to refuse to act upon things and upon Others is still to choose myself, and suicide is one mode of being-in-the-world.
