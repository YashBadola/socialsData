The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.

If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!

People understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

The most common form of despair is not being who you are.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.

There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?

The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.

People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.

It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.

Deep inside every human being there still lives the anxiety over the possibility of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. One keeps this anxiety at a distance by looking at the many round about who are related to him as kin and friends, but the anxiety is still there, nevertheless, and one hardly dares think of how he would feel if all this were taken away.

The aesthetic sphere is the sphere of immediacy, of sensation, of desire, of the moment. The ethical sphere is the sphere of duty, of universal rules, of commitment. The religious sphere is the sphere of faith, of the paradox, of the relationship to the Absolute.

Faith is precisely the paradox that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before the universal, not as inferior to the universal but as superior - yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

Truth is subjectivity.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.
