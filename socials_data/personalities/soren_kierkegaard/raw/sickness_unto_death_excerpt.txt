The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.

The human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Despair is the sickness unto death.
The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a specific sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as a sickness unto death. But in the Christian sense death is by no means the last of all, so that it is only a minor event within that which is all, an eternal life; and, as has been said, there is infinitely much more hope in death than in life – not only that, but in the Christian sense death is the transition to life.

Consequently, the sickness unto death is not, strictly speaking, a sickness that ends with death and then is no more. On the contrary, the torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man who lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die – yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even greater danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die.

The Despair That Is Unconscious That It Is Despair.
This is the most common form of despair. It is not that the person is in despair, but that he does not know that he is in despair. He lives in the cellar of his own existence. He is a philistine. The philistine has no spirit, no infinite passion. He is tranquilized by the trivial. He thinks he is happy, but he is in despair.

The Despair That Is Conscious That It Is Despair.
1. In despair at not willing to be oneself, the despair of weakness.
2. In despair at willing to be oneself, defiance.

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it. This is faith.
