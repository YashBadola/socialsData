We shall now inquire whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and should, in some measure, be kept by us. ...
Anger is a temporary madness. For it is equally devoid of self-control, regardless of decorum, forgetful of kinship, obstinately engrossed in whatever it begins to do, deaf to reason and advice, excited by trifling causes, awkward at perceiving what is true and just, and very like a falling rock which breaks itself to pieces upon the very thing which it crushes.
That you may know that they who are possessed by anger are not sane, look at their appearance. For as the marks of madness are certain—a bold and threatening mien, a gloomy brow, a fierce expression, a hurried step, restless hands, an altered colour, a quick and more violent breathing—so likewise are the marks of the angry man; his eyes blaze and sparkle, his whole face is highly coloured with red blood which boils up from the bottom of his heart, his lips quiver, his teeth grind, his hair bristles and stands on end, his breath is forced and harsh, his joints crack from writhing, he groans and bellows, bursts out into speech with scarcely intelligible words, strikes his hands together, and stamps the ground with his feet; his whole body is excited and performs great angry threats; it is an ugly and horrible picture of distorted and swollen frenzy—you cannot tell whether this vice is more execrable or more hideous.
