Died at Florence on 22nd\nJune 1527._\nINTRODUCTION\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the\nsecond son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,\nand of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were\nmembers of the old Florentine nobility.\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly\nenough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of\nFlorence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an\nItalian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Il Magnifico.\nThe downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year\nMachiavelli entered the public service. During his official career\nFlorence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted\nuntil 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his\noffice. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they\nwere once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli\u2019s\nliterary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few\nweeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his\nfifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\nYOUTH \u2014 \u00c6t. 1-25\u20141469-94\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the\nFlorence of those days is so well known that the early environment of\nthis representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been\ndescribed as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by\nthe fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving\nLorenzo. Savonarola\u2019s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have\nbeen slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the\nfortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a\ngibe in _The Prince_, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed\nprophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean\nrule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli\nstrongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to\nLorenzo\u2019s grandson that he dedicates _The Prince_.\nMachiavelli, in his \u201cHistory of Florence,\u201d gives us a picture of the\nyoung men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \u201cThey were freer\nthan their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other\nkinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,\nand women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with\nwit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly\nwas thought the wisest.\u201d In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli\nshows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and\nleads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes:\n\u201cI have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,\nespecially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than\nwhich I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to\nme, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your\nshare.\u201d Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \u201cThis will turn\nout well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then,\nyou have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters\nand music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I\nhave. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success\nand honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help\nyou if you help yourself.\u201d\nOFFICE \u2014 \u00c6t. 25-43\u20141494-1512\nThe second period of Machiavelli\u2019s life was spent in the service of the\nfree Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the\nexpulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After\nserving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed\nChancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and\nPeace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of\nMachiavelli\u2019s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the\naffairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and\ndispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere\nrecapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and\nsoldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and\nsupplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters\nwhich illustrate _The Prince_.\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \u201cmy lady of Forli\u201d\nof _The Prince_, from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it\nis far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on\nfortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is\nurged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for\ncontinuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct\nof affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft\nsummarized in _The Prince_, and was consequently driven out. He, also,\nit was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support\nto Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge\nthat such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the\nfaith of princes.\nMachiavelli\u2019s public life was largely occupied with events arising out\nof the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the\nDuke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of _The\nPrince_. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke\nfor the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have\nseized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the\npattern of Cesare Borgia\u2019s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed\nby some critics as the \u201chero\u201d of _The Prince_. Yet in _The Prince_ the\nduke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the\nfortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that\nmight be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save\nhim; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens;\nand who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims\nthat it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen\nfatality.\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to\nwatch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia\ncheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano\ndelle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most\nreason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election,\nsays that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to\nforget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had\nruined Cesare.\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that\npontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought\nto a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing\nchiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius\nthat Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and\nwomen, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man\nthat will win and hold them both.\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian\nstates, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,\nwith results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those\nevents, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they\nimpinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with\nLouis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch\u2019s character has\nalready been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as\nthe man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but\nwho in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,\nhad he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have\nbeen ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men\nof the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but\nMachiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the\nsecret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man,\nwithout force of character\u2014ignoring the human agencies necessary to\ncarry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of\nhis wishes.\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli\u2019s official career were filled with\nevents arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the\nthree great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the\nobject of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in\nthe battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won\nin eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during\nthese events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out\nbetween the pope and the French, because friendship with France had\ndictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II\nfinally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance\nof the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy\nof the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the\nMedici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st\nSeptember 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal\nfor the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end\nto his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining\noffice.\nLITERATURE AND DEATH \u2014 \u00c6t. 43-58\u20141512-27\nOn the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had\nvainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence,\nwas dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he\nwas accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,\nimprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,\nLeo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at\nSan Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In\na letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a\nvery interesting description of his life at this period, which\nelucidates his methods and his motives in writing _The Prince_. After\ndescribing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he\nwrites: \u201cThe evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at\nthe entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,\nand put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass\ninto the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly\nreceived by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I\ndo not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their\nactions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I\nfeel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,\ndeath does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.\nAnd because Dante says:\nKnowledge doth come of learning well retained,\nUnfruitful else,\nI have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have\ncomposed a small work on \u2018Principalities,\u2019 where I pour myself out as\nfully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a\nprincipality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how\nthey can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever\npleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,\nespecially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it\nto his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will\nbe able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had\nwith him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\u201d\nThe \u201clittle book\u201d suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form\nin which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work\nduring its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some\nunknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici. Although\nMachiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or\npresented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo\never received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any\nemployment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli\u2019s lifetime,\n_The Prince_ was never published by him, and its text is still\ndisputable.\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \u201cAnd as to this\nlittle thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that\nduring the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have\nneither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by\none who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my\nloyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not\nnow learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as\nI have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my\nhonesty.\u201d\nBefore Machiavelli had got _The Prince_ off his hands he commenced his\n\u201cDiscourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\u201d which should be read\nconcurrently with _The Prince_. These and several minor works occupied\nhim until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look\nafter the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the\nMedicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her\ncitizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new\nconstitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on\none pretext or another it was not promulgated.\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to\nsettle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly\nremarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he\nwas much sought after, and also for the production of his \u201cArt of War.\u201d\nIt was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance\nof Cardinal de\u2019 Medici to write the \u201cHistory of Florence,\u201d a task which\noccupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have\ndetermined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer\nobserves that \u201can able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will\nendeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play\nwith.\u201d\nWhen the \u201cHistory of Florence\u201d was finished, Machiavelli took it to\nRome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de\u2019 Medici, who had in\nthe meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is\nsomewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written _The\nPrince_ for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained\npower in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \u201cHistory of Florence\u201d\nto the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year\nthe battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left\nFrancis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This\nwas followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular\nparty at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more\nbanished.\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his\nreturn, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \u201cTen of\nLiberty and Peace.\u201d Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached\nFlorence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS\nNo one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence\nhas decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her\nmost famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have\nfound in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the\ngerms of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle\nto protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,\nit may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which\nthis sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that\nthe researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more\nreasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \u201cunholy\nnecromancer,\u201d which so long haunted men\u2019s vision, has begun to fade.\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and\nindustry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and\nwith his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced\nretirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he\ndepicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the\nsuccessful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only\nmoderately prosperous in his several embassies and political\nemployments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,\noverawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren\nof results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery\nthat he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct\nof his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear\nby the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of\ncompromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to\nsuspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when\nhe set him to write the \u201cHistory of Florence,\u201d rather than employ him\nin the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and\nthere alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on _The\nPrince_, its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they\nare the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as\nthey are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli\u2019s contemporaries; yet\nthey cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of\nEurope rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical\nincidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which\nMachiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and\nconduct.\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish\nsome European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, _The\nPrince_ is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men\nare still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the\ndays of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices\nwhich Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.\nMen will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them\nto be\u2014and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;\nprudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then\u2014to pass to\na higher plane\u2014Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an\nempire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the\narms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to\nfight.\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli\u2019s that government\nshould be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the\npeople with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of\nsociety; to this \u201chigh argument\u201d _The Prince_ contributes but little.\nMachiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments\notherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and\ninsight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests _The\nPrince_ with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the\nincontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which\nstill guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other\nand their neighbours.\nIn translating _The Prince_ my aim has been to achieve at all costs an\nexact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent\nparaphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression.\nMachiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he\nwrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his\nsubstance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. _Quis eo fuit\nunquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?_\nIn _The Prince_, it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not\nonly for every word, but for the position of every word. To an\nEnglishman of Shakespeare\u2019s time the translation of such a treatise was\nin some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius\nof the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to\nthe Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example:\nthe word _intrattenere_, employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy\nadopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would\nby an Elizabethan be correctly rendered \u201centertain,\u201d and every\ncontemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that\n\u201cRome _entertained_ the \u00c6tolians and the Achaeans without augmenting\ntheir power.\u201d But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and\nambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that \u201c_Rome\nmaintained friendly relations with the \u00c6tolians_,\u201d etc., using four\nwords to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity\nof the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to\nthe sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that\nthe reader, in his eagerness to reach the author\u2019s meaning, may\noverlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\nThe following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:\nPrincipal works.

And if your\nMagnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your\neyes to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly I suffer a\ngreat and continued malignity of fortune.\nTHE PRINCE\nCHAPTER I.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE\nACQUIRED\nAll states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been\nand are either republics or principalities.\nPrincipalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long\nestablished; or they are new.\nThe new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or\nthey are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the\nprince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of\nthe King of Spain.\nSuch dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a\nprince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of\nthe prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.\nCHAPTER II.\nCONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES\nI will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another\nplace I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to\nprincipalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,\nand discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary\nstates, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than\nnew ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of\nhis ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise,\nfor a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless\nhe be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if\nhe should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to\nthe usurper, he will regain it.\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have\nwithstood the attacks of the Venetians in \u201984, nor those of Pope Julius\nin \u201910, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the\nhereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it\nhappens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices\ncause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects\nwill be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and\nduration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are\nlost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\nCHAPTER III.\nCONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\nnot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\ncollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\nan inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\nmen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and\nthis hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein\nthey are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\ngone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\nnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\nsubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\nwhich he must put upon his new acquisition.\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\nseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\nwho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\nway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\nfeeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\nforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\nof the natives.\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\nMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\nonly needed Lodovico\u2019s own forces; because those who had opened the\ngates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\nbenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\nvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\nthey are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\nlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\ndelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in\nthe weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time\nit was enough for the Duke Lodovico[1] to raise insurrections on the\nborders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to\nbring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be\ndefeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above\nmentioned.\n[1] Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco Sforza, who\nmarried Beatrice d\u2019Este. He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500, and\ndied in 1510.\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\ntime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\nto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and\nwhat any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself\nmore securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\nancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\nand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold\nthem, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government;\nand to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of\nthe prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in\nother things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will\nlive quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony,\nand Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\nalthough there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\ncustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\nthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has\nonly to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of\ntheir former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws\nnor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will\nbecome entirely one body with the old principality.\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\ncustoms, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\nenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\nhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside\nthere. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has\nmade that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other\nmeasures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled\nthere, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the\nspot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy\nthem; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are\ngreat, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the\ncountry is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied\nby prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have\nmore cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He\nwho would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost\ncaution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested\nfrom him with the greatest difficulty.\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\nwhich may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\nthis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\nprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense\nhe can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority\nonly of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them\nto the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and\nscattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being\nuninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not\nto err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have\nbeen despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not\ncostly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as\nhas been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one\nhas to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed,\nbecause they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious\nones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man\nought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\nmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state,\nso that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\nexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\nof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\nall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\nown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\nguards are as useless as a colony is useful.\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\nought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\nneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\nthat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a\nfooting there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\nintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\nambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\nbrought into Greece by the \u00c6tolians; and in every other country where\nthey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And\nthe usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner\nenters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the\nhatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to\nthose subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over\nto himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he\nhas acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold\nof too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces,\nand with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of\nthem, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does\nnot properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired,\nand whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and\ntroubles.\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\nmeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2]\nthe minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\ngreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\n\u00c6tolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\nhumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\n\u00c6tolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\ndid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\nwithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make\nthem agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because\nthe Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\nwho have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\nwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it\nis easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the\nmedicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable;\nfor it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic\nfever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but\ndifficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either\ndetected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but\ndifficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the\nevils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise\nman to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not\nhaving been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that\nevery one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the\nRomans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to\navoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war\nis not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of\nothers; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in\nGreece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided\nboth, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which\nis forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:\u2014Let us enjoy the\nbenefits of the time\u2014but rather the benefits of their own valour and\nprudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring\nwith it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\n[2] See remark in the introduction on the word \u201cintrattenere.\u201d\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\nthings mentioned. I will speak of Louis[3] (and not of Charles)[4] as\nthe one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\npossession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\nhas done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain\na state composed of divers elements.\n[3] Louis XII, King of France, \u201cThe Father of the People,\u201d born 1462,\ndied 1515.\n[4] Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\ndesired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\nwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\nfoothold in Italy, and having no friends there\u2014seeing rather that every\ndoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles\u2014he was forced to\naccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have\nsucceeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not\nmade some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy,\nregained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded;\nthe Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of\nFerrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of\nPesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans,\nthe Sienese\u2014everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then\ncould the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them,\nwhich, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made\nthe king master of two-thirds of Italy.\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could\nhave maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above\nlaid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although\nthey were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the\nChurch, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been\nforced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have\nmade himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no\nsooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to\noccupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was\nweakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had\nthrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by\nadding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater\nauthority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to\nfollow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of\nAlexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was\nhimself forced to come into Italy.\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\ndeprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\ndivided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter\nin Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country\nand the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and\nwhereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he\ndrove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out\nin turn.\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\ndo so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\nwhen they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\nfolly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\nher own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\nought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\nthe Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she\ngot a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had\nnot the excuse of that necessity.\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\nhe increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\nbrought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did\nnot send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to\ninjure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from\nthe Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought\nSpain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to\nhumble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\nconsented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\nkept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\nnever have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\nbecause the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\nto give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\nhave had the courage.\nAnd if any one should say: \u201cKing Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\nand the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\u201d I answer for the reasons given\nabove that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war,\nbecause it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your\ndisadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king\nhad given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in\nexchange for the dissolution of his marriage[5] and for the cap to\nRouen,[6] to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the\nfaith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\n[5] Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI, and\nmarried in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to\nretain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown.\n[6] The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d\u2019Amboise, created a\ncardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\nconditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\nwished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\nis reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\nwith Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope\nAlexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal\nRouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I\nreplied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning\nthat otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\ngreatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the\nChurch and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin\nmay be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which\nnever or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming\npowerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about\neither by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him\nwho has been raised to power.\nCHAPTER IV.\nWHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL\nAGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly\nacquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great\nbecame the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was\nscarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole\nempire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained\nthemselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose\namong themselves from their own ambitions.\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to\nbe governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of\nservants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his\nfavour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity\nby antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons\nhave states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and\nhold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a\nprince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration,\nbecause in all the country there is no one who is recognized as\nsuperior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as\nto a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular\naffection.\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the\nKing of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one\nlord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into\nsanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and\nchanges them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the\nmidst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects,\nand beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king\ntake these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both\nof these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state\nof the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The\ncauses of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that\nthe usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can\nhe hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the\nlord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his\nministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with\ngreat difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when\nthey have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them,\nfor the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in\nmind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his\nown strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has\nbeen conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot\nreplace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this\nprince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the\nothers having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not\nrely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because\none can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,\nfor one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,\nfor the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the\nvictory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with\ninfinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from\nthose you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated\nthe family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves\nthe heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either\nto satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings\nthe opportunity.\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of\nDarius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and\ntherefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him\nin the field, and then to take the country from him. After which\nvictory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander,\nfor the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would\nhave enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults\nraised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted\nlike that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the\nRomans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities\nthere were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them\nendured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the\npower and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed\naway, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting\nafterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself\nhis own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed\nthere; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other\nthan the Romans were acknowledged.\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with\nwhich Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which\nothers have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;\nthis is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the\nconqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\nCHAPTER V.\nCONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER\nTHEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\nWhenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been\naccustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three\ncourses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the\nnext is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live\nunder their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an\noligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a\ngovernment, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand\nwithout his friendship and interest, and does its utmost to support\nhim; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will\nhold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other\nway.\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held\nAthens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy: nevertheless they\nlost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,\ndismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as\nthe Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did\nnot succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities\nin the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them\notherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city\naccustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be\ndestroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of\nliberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither\ntime nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do\nor provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges\nunless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they\nimmediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been\nheld in bondage by the Florentines.\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and\nhis family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to\nobey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in\nmaking one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern\nthemselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a\nprince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But\nin republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire\nfor vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of\ntheir former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them\nor to reside there.\nCHAPTER VI.\nCONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE\u2019S OWN ARMS AND\nABILITY\nLet no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities\nas I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of\nstate; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others,\nand following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely\nto the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A\nwise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to\nimitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not\nequal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the\nclever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far\ndistant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow\nattains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their\nstrength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of\nso high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a\nnew prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,\naccordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired\nthe state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station\npresupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of\nthese things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.\nNevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the\nstrongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no\nother state, is compelled to reside there in person.\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,\nhave risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,\nand such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not\ndiscuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet\nhe ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy\nto speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have\nacquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their\nparticular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be\nfound inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor.\nAnd in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed\nanything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material\nto mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that\nopportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and\nwithout those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of\nIsrael in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that\nthey should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of\nbondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and\nthat he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should\nbecome King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary\nthat Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of\nthe Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.\nTheseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians\ndispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,\nand their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity\nwhereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a\nprincipality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The\ndifficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules\nand methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their\ngovernment and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there\nis nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or\nmore uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the\nintroduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for\nenemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and\nlukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This\ncoolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on\ntheir side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily\nbelieve in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\nThus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the\nopportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others\ndefend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along\nwith them.\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter\nthoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves\nor have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate\ntheir enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In\nthe first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass\nanything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they\nare rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have\nconquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the\nreasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it\nis easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that\npersuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when\nthey believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by\nforce.\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not\nhave enforced their constitutions for long\u2014as happened in our time to\nFra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things\nimmediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no\nmeans of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the\nunbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties\nin consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the\nascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are\novercome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated,\nthey will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards\npowerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some\nresemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like\nkind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.[1] This man rose from a private\nstation to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to\nfortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him\nfor their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their\nprince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one\nwho writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king.\nThis man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old\nalliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on\nsuch foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had\nendured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\n[1] Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\nCHAPTER VII.\nCONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF\nOTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\nThose who solely by good fortune become princes from being private\ncitizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they\nhave not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they\nhave many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state\nis given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as\nhappened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the\nHellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might\nhold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those\nemperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens\ncame to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the\nfortune of him who has elevated them\u2014two most inconstant and unstable\nthings. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;\nbecause, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not\nreasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having\nalways lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it\nbecause they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature\nwhich are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and\ncorrespondencies[1] fixed in such a way that the first storm will not\noverthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become\nprinces are men of so much ability that they know they have to be\nprepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,\nand that those foundations, which others have laid _before_ they became\nprinces, they must lay _afterwards_.\n[1] \u201cLe radici e corrispondenze,\u201d their roots (i.e. foundations) and\ncorrespondencies or relations with other states\u2014a common meaning of\n\u201ccorrespondence\u201d and \u201ccorrespondency\u201d in the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies.\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or\nfortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and\nthese are Francesco Sforza[2] and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper\nmeans and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be\nDuke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties\nhe kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called\nby the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy\nof his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he\nhad taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise\nand able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and\nfortunes of others had bestowed on him.\n[2] Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married Bianca Maria\nVisconti, a natural daughter of Filippo Visconti, the Duke of Milan,\non whose death he procured his own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli\nwas the accredited agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia\n(1478-1507) during the transactions which led up to the assassinations\nof the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and along with his letters to\nhis chiefs in Florence he has left an account, written ten years\nbefore _The Prince_, of the proceedings of the duke in his\n\u201cDescritione del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare\nVitellozzo Vitelli,\u201d etc., a translation of which is appended to the\npresent work.\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations\nmay be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be\nlaid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,\ntherefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be\nseen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not\nconsider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what\nbetter precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;\nand if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but\nthe extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had\nmany immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see\nhis way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the\nChurch; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke\nof Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini\nwere already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he\nsaw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been\nassisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope,\nnamely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved\nhim, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers,\nso as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was\neasy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other\nreasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not\nonly not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving\nthe former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy\nwith the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He\nwas no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the\nattempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the\nking. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the\nColonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was\nhindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to\nhim, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that\nthe forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him,\nthat not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might\nthemselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the\nsame. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and\nattacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And\nas to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the\nDuchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from\nthat undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the\narms and the luck of others.\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in\nRome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,\nmaking them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to\ntheir rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that\nin a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned\nentirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the\nOrsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came\nto him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length\nthat the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them,\ncalled a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the\nrebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless\ndangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the\nFrench. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by\ntrusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse\nto his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the\nmediation of Signor Pagolo\u2014whom the duke did not fail to secure with\nall kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses\u2014the\nOrsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his\npower at Sinigalia.[3] Having exterminated the leaders, and turned\ntheir partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good\nfoundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of\nUrbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he\ngained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice,\nand to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\n[3] Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak\nmasters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave\nthem more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was\nfull of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing\nto bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it\nnecessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer\nRamiro d\u2019Orco,[4] a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest\npower. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the\ngreatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not\nadvisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but\nthat he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the\ncountry, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their\nadvocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some\nhatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the\npeople, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if\nany cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in\nthe natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took\nRamiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the\npiazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The\nbarbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied\nand dismayed.\n[4] Ramiro d\u2019Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\nBut let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding\nhimself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate\ndangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great\nmeasure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if\nhe wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France,\nfor he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would\nnot support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and\nto temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards\nthe kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta.\nIt was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would\nhave quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future\nhe had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church\nmight not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which\nAlexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by\nexterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as\nto take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to\nhimself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope\nwith their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the\ncollege more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before\nthe Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first\nshock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had\naccomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords\nas he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the\nRoman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And\nas to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany,\nfor he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his\nprotection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French\nwere already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and\nin this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down\nupon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through\nhatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines\nwould have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was\nprospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much\npower and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer\nhave depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his\nown power and ability.\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He\nleft the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the\nrest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick\nunto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and\nhe knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the\nfoundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not\nhad those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he\nwould have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his\nfoundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a\nmonth. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst\nthe Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they\ncould not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope\nhim whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not\nhave been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of\nAlexander,[5] everything would have been different to him. On the day\nthat Julius the Second[6] was elected, he told me that he had thought\nof everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had\nprovided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that,\nwhen the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\n[5] Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\n[6] Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro ad\nVincula, born 1443, died 1513.\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to\nblame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to\noffer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of\nothers, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and\nfar-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and\nonly the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness\nfrustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to\nsecure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome\neither by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the\npeople, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate\nthose who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of\nthings for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to\ndestroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship\nwith kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal\nand offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the\nactions of this man.\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he\nmade a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope\nto his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected\nPope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any\ncardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they\nbecame pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom\nhe had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna,\nSan Giorgio, and Ascanio.[7] The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear\nhim, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their\nrelationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the\nkingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above\neverything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and,\nfailing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad\nVincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages\nto forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his\nchoice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\n[7] San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio Sforza.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nCONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS\nAlthough a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither\nof which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is\nmanifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be\nmore copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are\nwhen, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the\nprincipality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private\nperson becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first\nmethod, it will be illustrated by two examples\u2014one ancient, the other\nmodern\u2014and without entering further into the subject, I consider these\ntwo examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,[1] became King of Syracuse not only from a\nprivate but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a\npotter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous\nlife. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of\nmind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,\nhe rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established\nin that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself\nprince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that\nwhich had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding\nfor this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army,\nwas fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the\nsenate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating\nto the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the\nsenators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held\nthe princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he\nwas twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not\nonly was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for\nits defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time\nraised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme\nnecessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and,\nleaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\n[1] Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will\nsee nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as\nhe attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any\none, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were\ngained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly\nheld by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent\nto slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,\nwithout mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not\nglory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and\nextricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his\ngreatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be\nseen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.\nNevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite\nwickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent\nmen. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da\nFermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by\nhis maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his\nyouth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his\ndiscipline, he might attain some high position in the military\nprofession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,\nand in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body\nand mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a\npaltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some\ncitizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than\nits liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So\nhe wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many\nyears, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look\nupon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire\nanything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he\nhad not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would\nbe accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and\nhe entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably\nby the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also\nto that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,\nand he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he\nlodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having\narranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a\nsolemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of\nFermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual\nin such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave\ndiscourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son\nCesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and\nothers answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to\nbe discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a\nchamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after\nhim. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places\nand slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,\nmounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief\nmagistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to\nobey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the\nprince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and\nstrengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a\nway that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only\nwas he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all\nhis neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as\nthat of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by\nCesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia,\nas was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this\nparricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made\nhis leader in valour and wickedness.\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after\ninfinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his\ncountry, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be\nconspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by\nmeans of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold\nthe state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this\nfollows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. Those may be\ncalled properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are\napplied at one blow and are necessary to one\u2019s security, and that are\nnot persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage\nof the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding\nthey may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than\ndecrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God\nor man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is\nimpossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\n[2] Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern\nequivalent of Machiavelli\u2019s thought when he speaks of \u201ccrudelta\u201d than\nthe more obvious \u201ccruelties.\u201d\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought\nto examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for\nhim to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to\nrepeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to\nreassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does\notherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to\nkeep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor\ncan they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and\nrepeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so\nthat, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given\nlittle by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such\na way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall\nmake him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled\ntimes, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help\nyou, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be\nunder any obligation to you for them.\nCHAPTER IX.\nCONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\nBut coming to the other point\u2014where a leading citizen becomes the\nprince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,\nbut by the favour of his fellow citizens\u2014this may be called a civil\nprincipality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain\nto it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a\nprincipality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the\nfavour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties\nare found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be\nruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and\noppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in\ncities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or\nanarchy.\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,\naccordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the\nnobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the\nreputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that\nunder his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people,\nfinding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of\none of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his\nauthority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles\nmaintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the\naid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around\nhim who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can\nneither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches\nsovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around\nhim, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,\nsatisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is\nmore righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,\nwhile the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added\nalso that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people,\nbecause of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure\nhimself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect\nfrom a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile\nnobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will\nrise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and\nastute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain\nfavours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is\ncompelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well\nwithout the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and\nto give or take away authority when it pleases him.\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to\nbe looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape\ntheir course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or\nthey do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought\nto be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt\nwith in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a\nnatural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,\nespecially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in\nprosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.\nBut when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it\nis a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,\nand a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they\nwere open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people\nought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only\nask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the\npeople, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above\neverything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may\neasily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they\nreceive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more\nclosely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more\ndevoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their\nfavours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as\nthese vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules,\nso I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the\npeople friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\nNabis,[1] Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,\nand of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his\ncountry and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was\nonly necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this\nwould not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not\nlet any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \u201cHe who\nbuilds on the people, builds on the mud,\u201d for this is true when a\nprivate citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that\nthe people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the\nmagistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as\nhappened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali[2] in\nFlorence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above,\nwho can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who\ndoes not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and\nenergy, keeps the whole people encouraged\u2014such a one will never find\nhimself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his\nfoundations well.\n[1] Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under Flamininus\nin 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\n[2] Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in Machiavelli\u2019s\n\u201cFlorentine History,\u201d Book III.\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from\nthe civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either\nrule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their\ngovernment is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on\nthe goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and\nwho, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with\ngreat ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not\nthe chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the\ncitizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates,\nare not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will\nalways be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For\nsuch a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when\ncitizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with\nhim; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to\ndie for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its\ncitizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this\nexperiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore\na wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will\nalways in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state\nand of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\nCHAPTER X.\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO\nBE MEASURED\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of\nthese principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in\ncase of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether\nhe has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite\nclear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by\ntheir own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise\na sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack\nthem; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot\nshow themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to\ndefend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been\ndiscussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second\ncase one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision\nand fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.\nAnd whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the\nother concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often\nrepeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are\nalways adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it\nwill be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town\nwell fortified, and is not hated by his people.\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country\naround them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits\nthem, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,\nbecause they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the\ntaking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they\nhave proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they\nalways keep in public depots enough for one year\u2019s eating, drinking,\nand firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss\nto the state, they always have the means of giving work to the\ncommunity in those labours that are the life and strength of the city,\nand on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold\nmilitary exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to\nuphold them.\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself\nodious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only\nbe driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this\nworld are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a\nwhole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever\nshould reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it\nburnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and\nself-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that\na powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by\ngiving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for\nlong, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving\nhimself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin\nthe country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot\nand ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the\nprince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the\ndamage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer\nany remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with\ntheir prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that\ntheir houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his\ndefence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they\nconfer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is\nwell considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the\nminds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not\nfail to support and defend them.\nCHAPTER XI.\nCONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching\nwhich all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they\nare acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held\nwithout either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of\nreligion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the\nprincipalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.\nThese princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have\nsubjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are\nnot taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,\nand they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate\nthemselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being\nupheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak\nno more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would\nbe the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church\nhas attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from\nAlexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have\nbeen called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)\nhave valued the temporal power very slightly\u2014yet now a king of France\ntrembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and\nto ruin the Venetians\u2014although this may be very manifest, it does not\nappear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,[1] this country was\nunder the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the\nDuke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal\nanxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms;\nthe other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those\nabout whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians.\nTo restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as\nit was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made\nuse of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini\nand Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with\narms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate\nweak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a\ncourageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could\nrid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a\ncause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a\npope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to\nspeak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would\narise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet\nwould not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the\ntemporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\n[1] Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have\never been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to\nprevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by\nreason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things\nwhich I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although\nhis intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,\nnevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,\nwhich, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all\nhis labours.\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all\nthe Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the\nchastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the\nway open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been\npractised before Alexander\u2019s time. Such things Julius not only\nfollowed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin\nthe Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these\nenterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,\ninasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any\nprivate person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within\nthe bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them\nsome mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm:\nthe one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and\nthe other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused\nthe disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their\ncardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster\nthe factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to\nsupport them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders\nand tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope\nLeo[2] found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that,\nif others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more\nvenerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\n[2] Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\u2019 Medici.\nCHAPTER XII.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES\nHaving discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such\nprincipalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having\nconsidered in some degree the causes of there being good or bad, and\nhaving shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and\nto hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of\noffence and defence which belong to each of them.\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his\nfoundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to\nruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or\ncomposite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good\nlaws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are\nwell armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the\ndiscussion and shall speak of the arms.\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state\nare either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.\nMercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds\nhis state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for\nthey are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,\nvaliant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the\nfear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so\nlong as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war\nby the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for\nkeeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to\nmake them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your\nsoldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take\nthemselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble\nto prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by\nresting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they\nformerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet\nwhen the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that\nCharles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in\nhand;[1] and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the\ntruth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have\nrelated. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who\nhave also suffered the penalty.\n[1] \u201cWith chalk in hand,\u201d \u201ccol gesso.\u201d This is one of the _bons mots_\nof Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized\nItaly, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his\nquartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the\ncountry. _Cf_. \u201cThe History of Henry VII,\u201d by Lord Bacon: \u201cKing\nCharles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a\nkind of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of Italy\nwithout resistance: so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont\nto say: That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands,\nto mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.\u201d\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The\nmercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are,\nyou cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own\ngreatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others\ncontrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are\nruined in the usual way.\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,\nwhether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted\nto, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in\nperson and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its\ncitizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it\nought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so\nthat he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes\nand republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and\nmercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to\nbring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its\ncitizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and\nSparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely\narmed and quite free.\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who\nwere oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the\nRomans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.\nAfter the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of\ntheir soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their\nliberty.\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against\nthe Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,[2]\nallied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His\nfather, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna[3] of Naples, left\nher unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms\nof the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the\nVenetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these\narms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have\ndefended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been\nfavoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have\nstood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and\nothers have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer\nwas Giovanni Acuto,[4] and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot\nbe proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the\nFlorentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the\nBracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco\nturned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the\nkingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while\nago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most\nprudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest\nrenown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have\nbeen proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became\nthe soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if\nthey held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their\nachievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and\ngloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed\ngentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned\nto enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they\nforsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the\nbeginning of their expansion on land, through not having much\nterritory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to\nfear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under\nCarmignuola,[5] they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him\na most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),\nand, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they\nfeared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they\nwere not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to\nlose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order\nto secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their\ncaptains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of\nPitigliano,[6] and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not\ngain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,[7] where in one battle they lost\nthat which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much\ntrouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed\nand inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\n[2] Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\n[3] Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of Naples.\n[4] Giovanni Acuto. An English knight whose name was Sir John\nHawkwood. He fought in the English wars in France, and was knighted by\nEdward III; afterwards he collected a body of troops and went into\nItaly. These became the famous \u201cWhite Company.\u201d He took part in many\nwars, and died in Florence in 1394. He was born about 1320 at Sible\nHedingham, a village in Essex. He married Domnia, a daughter of\nBernabo Visconti.\n[5] Carmignuola.

Count of Pitigliano;\nNicolo Orsini, born 1442, died 1510.\n[7] Battle of Vaila in 1509.\nAnd as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled\nfor many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously,\nin order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better\nprepared to counteract them. You must understand that the empire has\nrecently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired\nmore temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more\nstates, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms\nagainst their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were\noppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain\nauthority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became\nprinces. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the\nhands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of\npriests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both\ncommenced to enlist foreigners.\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,[8]\nthe Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others,\nBraccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After\nthese came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms\nof Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been\noverrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted\nby the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to\nlower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own.\nThey did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory,\nthey were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not\ngive them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a\nmoderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs\nwere brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand\nsoldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They\nhad, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to\nthemselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking\nprisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at\nnight, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night;\nthey did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did\nthey campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their\nmilitary rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both\nfatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and\ncontempt.\n[8] Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio in\nRomagna. He was the leader of the famous \u201cCompany of St George,\u201d\ncomposed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in 1409.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nCONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE\u2019S OWN\nAuxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a\nprince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by\nPope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise\nagainst Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to\nauxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,[1] for his\nassistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in\nthemselves, but for him who calls them in they are always\ndisadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their\ncaptive.\n[1] Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of Naples),\nsurnamed \u201cThe Catholic,\u201d born 1452, died 1516.\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish\nto leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which\ncannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw\nhimself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune\nbrought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his\nrash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the\nSwitzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all\nexpectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not\nbecome prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his\nauxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand\nFrenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other\ntime of their troubles.\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,[2] to oppose his neighbours, sent ten\nthousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not\nwilling to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to\nthe infidels.\n[2] Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,\nfor they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them\nthe ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to\nothers; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and\nbetter opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one\ncommunity, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you\nhave made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough\nauthority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most\ndangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has\nalways avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing\nrather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming\nthat a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke\nentered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French\nsoldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards,\nsuch forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries,\ndiscerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli;\nwhom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and\ndangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference\nbetween one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one\nconsiders the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when\nhe had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he\nrelied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and\nfound it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when\nevery one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am\nunwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I\nhave named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by\nthe Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted\nlike our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him\nthat he could neither keep them nor let them go, he had them all cut to\npieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with\naliens.\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament\napplicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with\nGoliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed\nhim with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them\non his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to\nmeet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of\nothers either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind\nyou fast.\nCharles the Seventh,[3] the father of King Louis the Eleventh,[4]\nhaving by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English,\nrecognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he\nestablished in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and\ninfantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and\nbegan to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as\nis now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised\nthe reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of\nhis own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his\nmen-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so\naccustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they\ncan now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot\nstand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come\noff well against others. The armies of the French have thus become\nmixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms\ntogether are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone,\nbut much inferior to one\u2019s own forces. And this example proves it, for\nthe kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of\nCharles had been enlarged or maintained.\n[3] Charles VII of France, surnamed \u201cThe Victorious,\u201d born 1403, died\n1461.\n[4] Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks\nwell at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I\nhave said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a\nprincipality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not\ntruly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster\nto the Roman Empire[5] should be examined, it will be found to have\ncommenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time\nthe vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour\nwhich had raised it passed away to others.\n[5] \u201cMany speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the\nreduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of\nthe conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence.\nWhen Mr Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank\nunder the weight of its military obligations, he said that this was\n\u2018wholly unhistorical.\u2019 He might well have added that the Roman power\nwas at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to\nfight for the State, but that it began to decline as soon as this\nobligation was no longer recognised.\u201d\u2014_Pall Mall Gazette_, 15th May\n1906.\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having\nits own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good\nfortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And\nit has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing\ncan be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own\nstrength. And one\u2019s own forces are those which are composed either of\nsubjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or\nauxiliaries. And the way to make ready one\u2019s own forces will be easily\nfound if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one\nwill consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many\nrepublics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which\nrules I entirely commit myself.\nCHAPTER XIV.\nTHAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything\nelse for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is\nthe sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force\nthat it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often\nenables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the\ncontrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than\nof arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing\nit is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is\nto be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from\na private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding\nthe hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons.\nFor among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to\nbe despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince\nought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing\nproportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not\nreasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him\nwho is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed\nservants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other\nsuspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And\ntherefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and\nabove the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by\nhis soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to\nhave out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should\naddict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two\nways, the one by action, the other by study.\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well\norganized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he\naccustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of\nlocalities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the\nvalleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of\nrivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which\nknowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his\ncountry, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by\nmeans of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands\nwith ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study\nhereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and\nmarshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance\nto those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of\none country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the\nprince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable\nthat a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his\nenemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to\nbesiege towns to advantage.\nPhilopoemen,[1] Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which\nwriters have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he\nnever had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in\nthe country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \u201cIf\nthe enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here\nwith our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best\nadvance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,\nhow ought we to pursue?\u201d And he would set forth to them, as he went,\nall the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their\nopinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these\ncontinual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any\nunexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\n[1] Philopoemen, \u201cthe last of the Greeks,\u201d born 252 B.C., died 183\nB.C.\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and\nstudy there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne\nthemselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,\nso as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as\nan illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been\npraised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he\nalways kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated\nAchilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of\nCyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of\nScipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity,\naffability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things\nwhich have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to\nobserve some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but\nincrease his resources with industry in such a way that they may be\navailable to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find\nhim prepared to resist her blows.\nCHAPTER XV.\nCONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR\nBLAMED\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a\nprince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have\nwritten on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in\nmentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from\nthe methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a\nthing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me\nmore appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the\nimagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities\nwhich in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is\nso far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is\ndone for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his\npreservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his\nprofessions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much\nthat is evil.\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how\nto do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.\nTherefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince,\nand discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are\nspoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are\nremarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or\npraise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly,\nusing a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is\nstill he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly\nwho deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed\ngenerous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless,\nanother faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave;\none affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one\nsincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another\nfrivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know\nthat every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a\nprince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but\nbecause they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human\nconditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently\nprudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which\nwould lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,\nfrom those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he\nmay with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need\nnot make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without\nwhich the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is\nconsidered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like\nvirtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which\nlooks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I\nsay that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless,\nliberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation\nfor it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should\nbe exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the\nreproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among\nmen the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of\nmagnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts\nall his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to\nmaintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax\nthem, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him\nodious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by\nany one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded\nfew, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by\nwhatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing\nto draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being\nmiserly.\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of\nliberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if\nhe is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in\ntime he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that\nwith his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself\nagainst all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without\nburdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises\nliberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless,\nand meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have\nbeen considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was\nassisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he\ndid not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King\nof France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax\non his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his\nlong thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken\nor conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A\nprince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that\nhe can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he\nis not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a\nreputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will\nenable him to govern.\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and\nmany others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,\nand by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact,\nor in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is\ndangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;\nand Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;\nbut if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his\nexpenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should\nreply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,\nwho have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends\nthat which is his own or his subjects\u2019 or else that of others. In the\nfirst case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to\nneglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes\nforth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion,\nhandling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary,\notherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is\nneither yours nor your subjects\u2019 you can be a ready giver, as were\nCyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your\nreputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only\nsquandering your own that injures you.\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst\nyou exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor\nor despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a\nprince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised\nand hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to\nhave a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,\nthan to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to\nincur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\nCHAPTER XVII.\nCONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED\nTHAN FEARED\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every\nprince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.\nNevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare\nBorgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled\nthe Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if\nthis be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more\nmerciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for\ncruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.[1] Therefore a prince, so\nlong as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the\nreproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more\nmerciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to\narise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to\ninjure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a\nprince offend the individual only.\n[1] During the rioting between the Cancellieri and Panciatichi\nfactions in 1502 and 1503.\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the\nimputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence\nVirgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign\nowing to its being new, saying:\n\u201cRes dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMoliri, et late fines custode tueri.\u201d[2]\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he\nhimself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and\nhumanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and\ntoo much distrust render him intolerable.\n[2] . . . against my will, my fate\nA throne unsettled, and an infant state,\nBid me defend my realms with all my pow\u2019rs,\nAnd guard with these severities my shores.\nChristopher Pitt.\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than\nfeared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to\nbe both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it\nis much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be\ndispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that\nthey are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as\nyou succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,\nproperty, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far\ndistant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince\nwho, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other\nprecautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by\npayments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be\nearned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied\nupon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than\none who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation\nwhich, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for\ntheir advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which\nnever fails.\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he\ndoes not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well\nbeing feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he\nabstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their\nwomen. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of\nsomeone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,\nbut above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,\nbecause men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss\nof their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are\nnever wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always\nfind pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for\ntaking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner\nlapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a\nmultitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard\nthe reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army\nunited or disposed to its duties.\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that\nhaving led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to\nfight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or\nagainst the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This\narose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his\nboundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his\nsoldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not\nsufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his\ndeeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal\ncause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been\nsufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most\nexcellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,\nagainst whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from\nnothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more\nlicense than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was\nupbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of\nthe Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,\nyet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate\npunished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in\nthe Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew\nmuch better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This\ndisposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have\ndestroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the\ncontrol of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed\nitself, but contributed to his glory.\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the\nconclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing\naccording to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself\non that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must\nendeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\nCHAPTER XVIII.[1]\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\n[1] \u201cThe present chapter has given greater offence than any other\nportion of Machiavelli\u2019s writings.\u201d Burd, \u201cIl Principe,\u201d p. 297.\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and\nto live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience\nhas been that those princes who have done great things have held good\nfaith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect\nof men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on\ntheir word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,[2] the one\nby the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the\nsecond to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient,\nit is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is\nnecessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast\nand the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient\nwriters, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were\ngiven to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his\ndiscipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who\nwas half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know\nhow to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not\ndurable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the\nbeast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot\ndefend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against\nwolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares\nand a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do\nnot understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor\nought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him,\nand when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If\nmen were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they\nare bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to\nobserve it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince\nlegitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless\nmodern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and\nengagements have been made void and of no effect through the\nfaithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the\nfox has succeeded best.\n[2] \u201cContesting,\u201d _i.e_. \u201cstriving for mastery.\u201d Mr Burd points out\nthat this passage is imitated directly from Cicero\u2019s \u201cDe Officiis\u201d:\n\u201cNam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum\nper vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum\nest ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\u201d\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,\nand to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and\nso subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will\nalways find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent\nexample I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing\nelse but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he\nalways found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power\nin asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would\nobserve it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to\nhis wishes,[3] because he well understood this side of mankind.\n[3] \u201cNondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).\u201d The\nwords \u201cad votum\u201d are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.\nAlexander never did what he said,\nCesare never said what he did.\nItalian Proverb.\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities\nI have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And\nI shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe\nthem is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear\nmerciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with\na mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able\nand know how to change to the opposite.\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,\ncannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often\nforced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,[4]\nfriendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him\nto have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and\nvariations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to\ndiverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then\nto know how to set about it.\n[4] \u201cContrary to fidelity\u201d or \u201cfaith,\u201d \u201ccontro alla fede,\u201d and \u201ctutto\nfede,\u201d \u201caltogether faithful,\u201d in the next paragraph. It is noteworthy\nthat these two phrases, \u201ccontro alla fede\u201d and \u201ctutto fede,\u201d were\nomitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction\nof the papal authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the\nword \u201cfede\u201d was \u201cthe faith,\u201d _i.e_. the Catholic creed, and not as\nrendered here \u201cfidelity\u201d and \u201cfaithful.\u201d Observe that the word\n\u201creligione\u201d was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being\nused to signify indifferently every shade of belief, as witness \u201cthe\nreligion,\u201d a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot\nheresy. South in his Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this\npassage as follows: \u201cThat great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\nNicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his political\nscheme: \u2018That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but\nthe reality of it hurtful and pernicious.\u2019\u201d\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything\nslip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five\nqualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether\nmerciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing\nmore necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as\nmen judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it\nbelongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.\nEvery one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and\nthose few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who\nhave the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all\nmen, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge,\none judges by the result.\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding\nhis state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be\npraised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a\nthing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are\nonly the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have\nno ground to rest on.\nOne prince[5] of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never\npreaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most\nhostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of\nreputation and kingdom many a time.\n[5] Ferdinand of Aragon. \u201cWhen Machiavelli was writing _The Prince_ it\nwould have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinand\u2019s name here\nwithout giving offence.\u201d Burd\u2019s \u201cIl Principe,\u201d p. 308.\nCHAPTER XIX.\nTHAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I\nhave spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss\nbriefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has\nbeen in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him\nhated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will\nhave fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other\nreproaches.\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,\nand to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from\nboth of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor\ntheir honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has\nonly to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease\nin many ways.\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,\neffeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince\nshould guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in\nhis actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his\nprivate dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are\nirrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can\nhope either to deceive him or to get round him.\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,\nand he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,\nprovided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by\nhis people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a\nprince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his\nsubjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From\nthe latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,\nand if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will\nalways remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they\nshould have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should\naffairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations\nand has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will\nresist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has\nonly to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can\neasily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by\nkeeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for\nhim to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most\nefficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not\nto be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a\nprince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the\nconspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have\nthe courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a\nconspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the\nconspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires\ncannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he\nbelieves to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to\na malcontent you have given him the material with which to content\nhimself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so\nthat, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the\nother to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare\nfriend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith\nwith you.\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side\nof the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of\npunishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the\nmajesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and\nthe state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the\npopular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to\nconspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the\nexecution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to\nthe crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and\nthus cannot hope for any escape.\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content\nwith one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer\nAnnibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the\npresent Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had\nconspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer\nGiovanni,[1] who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination\nthe people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the\npopular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in\nBologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after\nthe death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese,\nhaving information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in\nFlorence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a\nblacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of\ntheir city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due\ncourse to the government.\n[1] Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan 1508. He\nruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli\u2019s strong condemnation of\nconspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience\n(February 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his\nalleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies\nof little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is\nhostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear\neverything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have\ntaken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep\nthe people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most\nimportant objects a prince can have.\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France,\nand in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty\nand security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its\nauthority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of\nthe nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths\nwould be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the\nhatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to\nprotect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care\nof the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be\nliable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people\nfor favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who\ncould beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the\nking. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or\na greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can\ndraw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs\nof reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in\ntheir own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish\nthe nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths\nof the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to\nmy opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great\nqualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have\nbeen killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing,\ntherefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of\nsome of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were\nnot different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only\nsubmit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who\nstudies the affairs of those times.\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to\nthe empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were\nMarcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son\nAntoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the\nambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be\ncontended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to\nput up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so\nbeset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard\nthing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the\npeople loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring\nprince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold,\ncruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should\nexercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give\nvent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors\nwere always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great\nauthority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the\nprincipality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,\nwere inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about\ninjuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes\ncannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to\navoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they\nought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the\nmost powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had\nneed of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the\npeople; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,\naccordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being\nall men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,\nand benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died\nhonoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,\nand owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,\nbeing possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always\nkept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated\nnor despised.\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,\nwho, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not\nendure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,\nhaving given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt\nfor his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his\nadministration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as\nmuch by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a\nprince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for\nwhen that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain\nyourself\u2014it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles\u2014you\nhave to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works\nwill do you harm.\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,\nthat among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in\nthe fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by\nhim unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who\nallowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the\narmy conspired against him, and murdered him.\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus\nCaracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and\nrapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to\ncommit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except\nSeverus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour\nthat, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed\nby him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much\nadmired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were\nkept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and\nsatisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were\ngreat, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the\nfox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a\nprince to imitate.\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in\nSclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to\nRome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the\npraetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to\naspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy\nbefore it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the\nSenate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this\nthere remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the\nwhole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the\nAsiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in\nthe west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he\nconsidered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided\nto attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that,\nbeing elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that\ndignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that\nthe Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted\nby Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger,\nand settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the\nSenate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had\nreceived from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this\ningratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him\nout in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will,\ntherefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a\nmost valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and\nrespected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be\nwondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well,\nbecause his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which\nthe people might have conceived against him for his violence.\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent\nqualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and\nacceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of\nfatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which\ncaused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and\ncruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single\nmurders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those\nof Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by\nthose he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the\nmidst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that\nsuch-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and\ndesperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who\ndoes not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the\nless because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do\nany grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the\nservice of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had\ncontumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily\nthreatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was\na rash thing to do, and proved the emperor\u2019s ruin.\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to\nhold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and\nhe had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his\npeople and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave\nhimself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he\nmight indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not\nmaintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete\nwith gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the\nimperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being\nhated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against\nand was killed.\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike\nman, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,\nof whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the\nthrone. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated\nand despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought\nhim into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great\nindignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to\nhis dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the\nimperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity\nby having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,\npractised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at\nthe meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa\nrebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy\nconspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,\nbesieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were\ndisgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so\nmany against him, murdered him.\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being\nthoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this\ndiscourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this\ndifficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far\nless degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some\nindulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that\nare veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were\nthe armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary\nto give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more\nnecessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy\nthe people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more\npowerful.\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him\ntwelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend\nthe security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,\nputting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them\nhis friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in\nthe hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the\npeople, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state\nof the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that\nit is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an\nhereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old\nprince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by\nthose who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this\nbeing an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality,\nbecause there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in\nnew ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state\nis old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its\nhereditary lord.\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will\nconsider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been\nfatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how\nit happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in\nanother, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to\nunhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for\nPertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was\nheir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly\ndestructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated\nSeverus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in\nhis footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot\nimitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow\nthose of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which\nare necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are\nproper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and\nfirm.\nCHAPTER XX.\nARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT,\nADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their\nsubjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;\nothers have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid\nthemselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\nof their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown\nand destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on\nall of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those\nstates in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as\ncomprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather\nwhen he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by\narming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted\nbecome faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your\nsubjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be\narmed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be\nhandled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they\nquite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,\nconsidering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\nservice should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm\nthem, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either\nfor cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions\nbreeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it\nfollows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character\nalready shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient\nto defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.\nTherefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has\nalways distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a\nprince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old\none, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those\nwho have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time\nand opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters\nshould be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state\nshall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed\nto say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\nfortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\ntributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This\nmay have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\nbalanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for\nto-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;\nrather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\ncities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always\nassist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The\nVenetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the\nGuelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although\nthey never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these\ndisputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their\ndifferences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not\nafterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one\nparty at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,\ntherefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be\npermitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the\nmore easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but\nif war comes this policy proves fallacious.\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the\ndifficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore\nfortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who\nhas a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes\nenemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may\nhave the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher,\nas by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many\nconsider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with\ncraft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed\nit, his renown may rise higher.\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and\nassistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were\ndistrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo\nPetrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been\ndistrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak\ngenerally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say\nthis, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been\nhostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support\nthemselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they\nwill be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as\nthey know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad\nimpression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always\nextracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too\nmuch security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands\nit, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours\nhas acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which\ninduced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural\naffection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then\nhe will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for\nit will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons\nfor this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern\naffairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends\nof those men who were contented under the former government, and are\ntherefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it,\nwere favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states\nmore securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\nto those who might design to work against them, and as a place of\nrefuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been\nmade use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in\nour times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello\nso that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on\nreturning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia,\nrazed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and\nconsidered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the\nBentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses,\ntherefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you\ngood in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be\nreasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than\nfrom foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear\nfrom foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The\ncastle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make,\nmore trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the\nstate. For this reason the best possible fortress is\u2014not to be hated by\nthe people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they\nwill not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be\nwanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.\nIt has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use\nto any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,[1] when the Count\nGirolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to\nwithstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and\nthus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that\ntime that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses\nwere of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her,\nand when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore,\nit would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have\nbeen hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these\nthings considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as\nwell as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them,\ncares little about being hated by the people.\n[1] Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia\nLandriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the Countess of Forli that\nMachiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499. A letter from Fortunati to the\ncountess announces the appointment: \u201cI have been with the signori,\u201d\nwrote Fortunati, \u201cto learn whom they would send and when. They tell me\nthat Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine noble, secretary\nto my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me at once.\u201d _Cf_. \u201cCatherine\nSforza,\u201d by Count Pasolini, translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\nCHAPTER XXI.\nHOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and\nsetting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the\npresent King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he\nhas risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be\nthe foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds\nyou will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the\nbeginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the\nfoundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without\nany fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile\noccupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;\nthus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power\nand authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and\nof the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the\nfoundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.\nFurther, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater\nschemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and\nclearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable\nexample, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,\nhe came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his\nachievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the\nminds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the\nissue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of\nthe other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against\nhim.\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal\naffairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da\nMilano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life\ndoing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some\nmethod of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about.\nAnd a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action\nto gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a\ndownright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he\ndeclares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course\nwill always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two\nof your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character\nthat, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In\neither case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare\nyourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if\nyou do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the\nconqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been\nconquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to\nprotect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want\ndoubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who\nloses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in\nhand, court his fate.\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the \u00c6tolians to drive out\nthe Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the\nRomans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the\nRomans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed\nin the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged\nthem to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \u201cAs for that\nwhich has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your\nstate not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous;\nbecause by not interfering you will be left, without favour or\nconsideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\u201d Thus it will always\nhappen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality,\nwhilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with\narms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally\nfollow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince\ndeclares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with\nwhom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful\nand may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is\nestablished a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to\nbecome a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all\nare never so complete that the victor must not show some regard,\nespecially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you\nmay be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you\nbecome companions on a fortune that may rise again.\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that\nyou have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it\ngreater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of\none by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved\nhim; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with\nyour assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be\nnoted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with\none more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others,\nunless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers\nyou are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as\npossible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with\nFrance against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their\nruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as\nhappened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to\nattack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince\nought to favour one of the parties.\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe\ncourses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,\nbecause it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid\none trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in\nknowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to\ntake the lesser evil.\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour\nthe proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his\ncitizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and\nagriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not\nbe deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken\naway from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but\nthe prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things\nand designs in any way to honour his city or state.\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles\nat convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into\nguilds or into societies,[1] he ought to hold such bodies in esteem,\nand associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of\ncourtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty\nof his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\n[1] \u201cGuilds or societies,\u201d \u201cin arti o in tribu.\u201d \u201cArti\u201d were craft or\ntrade guilds, _cf_. Florio: \u201cArte . . . a whole company of any trade\nin any city or corporation town.\u201d The guilds of Florence are most\nadmirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject\n(Methuen, 1906). Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\n\u201cartel,\u201d exist in Russia to-day, _cf_. Sir Mackenzie Wallace\u2019s\n\u201cRussia,\u201d ed. 1905: \u201cThe sons . . . were always during the working\nseason members of an artel. In some of the larger towns there are\nartels of a much more complex kind\u2014 permanent associations, possessing\nlarge capital, and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the\nindividual members.\u201d The word \u201cartel,\u201d despite its apparent\nsimilarity, has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \u201cars\u201d\nor \u201carte.\u201d Its root is that of the verb \u201crotisya,\u201d to bind oneself by\nan oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of\n\u201crota,\u201d which now signifies a \u201cregimental company.\u201d In both words the\nunderlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. \u201cTribu\u201d\nwere possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included\nindividuals connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \u201csects\u201d or\n\u201cclans\u201d would be most appropriate.\nCHAPTER XXII.\nCONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they\nare good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the\nfirst opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is\nby observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and\nfaithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to\nrecognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are\notherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error\nwhich he made was in choosing them.\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of\nPandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to\nbe a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there\nare three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;\nanother which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which\nneither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first\nis the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.\nTherefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the\nfirst rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know\ngood and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have\nthe initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his\nservant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the\nservant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one\ntest which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his\nown interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in\neverything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you\never be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in\nhis hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince,\nand never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not\nconcerned.\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study\nhim, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with\nhim the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he\ncannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,\nmany riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him\ndread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,\nare thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,\nthe end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nHOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it\nis a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless\nthey are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of\nwhom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own\naffairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with\ndifficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they\nrun the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way\nof guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that\nto tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell\nyou the truth, respect for you abates.\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the\nwise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking\nthe truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,\nand of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and\nlisten to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With\nthese councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry\nhimself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more\nfreely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of\nthese, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be\nsteadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either\noverthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions\nthat he falls into contempt.\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of\naffairs to Maximilian,[1] the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,\nsaid: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.\nThis arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the\nabove; for the emperor is a secretive man\u2014he does not communicate his\ndesigns to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in\ncarrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at\nonce obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being\npliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he\ndoes one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he\nwishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\n[1] Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman\nEmpire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after\nher death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in Italian\npolitics.\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he\nwishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every\none from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to\nbe a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning\nthe things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any\nconsideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be\nfelt.\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression\nof his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good\nadvisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived,\nbecause this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not\nwise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has\nyielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very\nprudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would\nnot be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take\naway his state from him.\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more\nthan one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to\nunite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests,\nand the prince will not know how to control them or to see through\nthem. And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always\nprove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.\nTherefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they\ncome, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the\nprince from good counsels.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nWHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince\nto appear well established, and render him at once more secure and\nfixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the\nactions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an\nhereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men\nand bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more\nby the present than by the past, and when they find the present good\nthey enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost\ndefence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will\nbe a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and\nadorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and\nwith a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a\nprince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in\nItaly in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and\nothers, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in\nregard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in\nthe next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the\npeople hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known\nhow to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that\nhave power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who\nwas conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the\ngreatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a\nwarlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles,\nhe sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the\nend he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the\nkingdom.\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their\nprincipalities after so many years\u2019 possession, but rather their own\nsloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a\nchange (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the\ncalm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they\nthought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that\nthe people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would\nrecall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very\nbad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would\nnever wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later\non to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does,\nit will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no\navail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable,\ncertain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\nCHAPTER XXV.\nWHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the\nopinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by\nfortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and\nthat no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us\nbelieve that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let\nchance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times\nbecause of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may\nstill be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes\npondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.\nNevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true\nthat Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,[1] but that she\nstill leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\n[1] Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \u201cThe older one gets the\nmore convinced one becomes that his Majesty King Chance does\nthree-quarters of the business of this miserable universe.\u201d Sorel\u2019s\n\u201cEastern Question.\u201d\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood\noverflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away\nthe soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to\nits violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,\nthough its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when\nthe weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences\nand barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass\naway by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so\ndangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour\nhas not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where\nshe knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain\nher.\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and\nwhich has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open\ncountry without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been\ndefended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either\nthis invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it\nwould not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say\nconcerning resistance to fortune in general.\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be\nseen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change\nof disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from\ncauses that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the\nprince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I\nbelieve also that he will be successful who directs his actions\naccording to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not\naccord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in\naffairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely,\nglory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution,\nanother with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience,\nanother by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by\na different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain\nhis end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different\nobservances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other\nimpetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they\nconform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from\nwhat I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same\neffect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the\nother does not.\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs\nhimself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a\nway that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if\ntimes and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course\nof action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to\nknow how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot\ndeviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having\nalways prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it\nis well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time\nto turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined;\nbut had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have\nchanged.\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and\nfound the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of\naction that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise\nagainst Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The\nVenetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he\nhad the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France;\nnevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his\naccustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the\nVenetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the\nformer from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand,\nhe drew after him the King of France, because that king, having\nobserved the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as\nto humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore\nJulius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff\nwith simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome\nuntil he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed,\nas any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded.\nBecause the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the\nothers would have raised a thousand fears.\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they\nall succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience\nthe contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go\ncautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have\ndeviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind\nsteadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are\nsuccessful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider\nthat it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a\nwoman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and\nill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by\nthe adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She\nis, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they\nare less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nAN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and\nwondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a\nnew prince, and whether there were elements that would give an\nopportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of\nthings which would do honour to him and good to the people of this\ncountry, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new\nprince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be\ncaptive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians\nshould be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the\nsoul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate\nthe capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to\ndiscover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy\nshould be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should\nbe more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,\nmore scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,\ndespoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us\nthink he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was\nafterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected\nhim; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet\nheal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of\nLombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany,\nand cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she\nentreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs\nand barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and\nwilling to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope\nthan in your illustrious house,[1] with its valour and fortune,\nfavoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and\nwhich could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be\ndifficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the\nmen I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet\nthey were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the\npresent offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier\nthan this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\n[1] Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal by Leo X.\nIn 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the title of Clement VII.\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is\nnecessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in\nthem. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness\nis great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those\nmen to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how\nextraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:\nthe sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth\nwater, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your\ngreatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do\neverything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory\nwhich belongs to us.\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians\nhave been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious\nhouse; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many\ncampaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted,\nthis has happened because the old order of things was not good, and\nnone of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man\nmore than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was\nnewly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will\nmake him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting\nopportunities to bring such into use in every form.\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\nLook attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how\nsuperior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But\nwhen it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs\nentirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are\ncapable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there\nhaving never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by\nvalour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for\nso long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years,\nwhenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a\npoor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro,\nafterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.[2]\n[2] The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua, 1501;\nGenoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\nmen who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\nas a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own\nforces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\nsoldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be\nmuch better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,\nhonoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is\nnecessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\nagainst foreigners by Italian valour.\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\nformidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\na third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be\nrelied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry,\nand the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in\nclose combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the\nSpaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are\noverthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this\nlatter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at\nthe battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by\nGerman battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the\nSpaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in\nunder the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack,\nwhile the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed\nup, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore,\nknowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one,\nwhich will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not\ncreate a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are\nthe kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new\nprince.\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for\nletting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the\nlove with which he would be received in all those provinces which have\nsuffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for\nrevenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\nWhat door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?\nWhat envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To\nall of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your\nillustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with\nwhich all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard\nour native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be\nverified that saying of Petrarch:\nVirtu contro al Furore\nPrendera l\u2019arme, e fia il combatter corto:\nChe l\u2019antico valore\nNegli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\nVirtue against fury shall advance the fight,\nAnd it i\u2019 th\u2019 combat soon shall put to flight:\nFor the old Roman valour is not dead,\nNor in th\u2019 Italians\u2019 brests extinguished.\nEdward Dacre, 1640.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING\nVITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE\nDUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\nBY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\nThe Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to\nclear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been\nraised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of\nArezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola,\nwhence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against\nGiovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring\nthat city under his domination, and to make it the head of his\nRomagnian duchy.\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and\ntheir following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too\npowerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek\nto destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon\nthis a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to\nwhich came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,\nVitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the\ntyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo\nPetrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and\ncourage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which\nmight otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they\ndecided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the\nFlorentines; and they sent their men to one place and another,\npromising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite\nwith them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported\nthroughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke,\namong whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a\nrevolution.\nThus it arose that, men\u2019s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by\ncertain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held\nfor the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The\ncastellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;\nso the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being\ncarried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from\nbeing drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping\nupon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being\neffected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being\nencouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the\nDiet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose\nthe opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any\ntown, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and\nthey sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in\ndestroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and\nthat they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli\nand Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo\nMachiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the\nduke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola,\nbecause, against everybody\u2019s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone\nover to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.\nBut recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided\nto temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to\nhim, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.\nThis latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France\nfor men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into\ncavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached\nFossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the\naid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the\nduke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with\noffers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did\nnot fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he\nwished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough\nfor him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the\nprincipality.\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to\nhim to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a\nstandstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every\ncare to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such\npreparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in\nseparate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there\ncame also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found\nhimself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open\nwar, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to\noutwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of\nreconciliation.\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in\nwhich he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand\nducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed\nan alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come\npersonally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the\nother hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and\nother places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and\nnot to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his\npermission.\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,\nagain fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his\nstate; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the\nfortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by\nthe enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.\nBut the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed\nhis men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of\nNovember together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to\nCesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the\nVitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of\nUrbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but\nnothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that\nif the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were\nready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To\nthis the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with\nTuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was\nvery willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the\nfortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give\nit up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to\ncome there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being\ninvited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no\nsuspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French\nmen-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred\nlancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena\nabout the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost\ncunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for\nhim at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance\nwould cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the\nreconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the\narms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very\nstubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not\noffend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by\nPagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he\nagreed to wait.\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on\n30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most\ntrusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor\nd\u2019Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as\nVitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should\narrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting\ncertain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they\nreached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they\ncame to the duke\u2019s quarters, where they should be seized.\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which\nthere were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to\nassemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from\nFano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day\nof December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of\nabout two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the\ninfantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of\nthe Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who\ngoes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases\nof which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia\nis distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot\nand from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs\na little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards\nFano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes\nfor a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river\nwhich passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank\nof it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge\nwhich crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that\nleads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before\nthis gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which\nthe bank of the river forms one side.\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and\nto honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant\nfrom Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men\nof the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,\nwhich consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty\nhorsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters\nhaving been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and\nwhen the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass\nover, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and\nthe other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through\nwhich the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a\nfew horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a\ncape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his\napproaching death\u2014a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the\nman and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that\nwhen he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet\nthe duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He\nrecommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his\nnephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of\ntheir fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came\nbefore the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him\nwith goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were\ncommissioned to look after them.\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band\nin Sinigalia, was missing\u2014for Oliverotto was waiting in the square\nbefore his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and\ndrilling them\u2014signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care\nof Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that\nOliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined\nOliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of\ntheir quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;\nand he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come\nhimself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice,\ncame before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and\nOliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke\u2019s\nquarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made\nthem prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that\nthe men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.\nThose of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of\nthe Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment\nof the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves,\nand bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and\nVitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the\ncountry and saved themselves.\nBut the duke\u2019s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men\nof Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not\nrepressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have\ncompletely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,\nthe duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a\nroom and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in\nkeeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of\nthe pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the\nblame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the\nDuke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome\nthat the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of\nFlorence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th\nJanuary 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the\nsame way.\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\nWRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\nAnd sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI\nCASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\nIt appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who\nhave considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,\nwho have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in\ntheir day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and\nobscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.\nThey have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have\nhad so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to\nbe sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate\nwho these persons may have been because they are well known to\neverybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to\nthose who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly\nbeginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to\nthe world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because\nshe begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in\ntheir career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio\nCastracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is\nmeasured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was\nborn; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished\nin his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to\nbe desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such\nindications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar\nto men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his\nactions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families\nof Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in\nestate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a\nson Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca,\nand for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He\nhad an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but\nBuonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again\nwent to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the\nhouse where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens,\nany person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning,\nshortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio\nwas called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather\nherbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the\nleaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard\nsomething resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards\nit, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the\nleaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and\npartly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it\nto the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is\ncustomary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When\nhe heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised\nor compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves\nwhat should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no\nchildren, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for\nit, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They\nbaptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As\nthe years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of\nwit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those\nlessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended\nto make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his\ncanonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with\nthis object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio\nwas quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached\nthe age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of\nMesser Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left\noff reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,\ndelighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in\nrunning, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he\nfar excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at\nany time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of\nwars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with\nvexation and sorrow.\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,\nnamed Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,\nbodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had\noften fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a\nGhibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman\nresided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most\nmornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the\ntop of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he\nhad often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street\nin those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far\nexcelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal\nauthority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer\nFrancesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being\ninformed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt\na greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one\nday and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of\na gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in\nthe house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the\nservices of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased\nCastruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he\nstood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer\nFrancesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,\nnothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and\ntake up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and\nin a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was\ndriven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear\nthat he would not be able to hold him much longer.\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to\nthe house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was\nastonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that\nvirtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true\ngentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and\ncould manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and\ntournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,\nand he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what\nenhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful\nmodesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to\nothers, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his\nequals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved,\nnot only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio\nhad reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia\nby the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist\nthe Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.\nCastruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this\nexpedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and\nhis name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all\nLombardy.\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he\nleft it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many\nfriends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary\nfor that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son\nthirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to\nbe his son\u2019s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died\nFrancesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that\ngoodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to\nthe son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the\nfather. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and\ntutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and\ncreated a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the\nformer universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring\ntyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli\nOpizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of\nMesser Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him\nthat Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and\nholding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;\ntherefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of\nhis eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but\nafterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able\nto bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples\nand have him driven out of Lucca.\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,\nwho being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became\ntheir lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,\nwith whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting\ntheir restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought\ninto his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of\nthe Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio\ncautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies\nand munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few\ndays in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon\nwith Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and\nPisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed\nUguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the\nportcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling\nthe people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione\nentered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer\nGiorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The\ngovernor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the\nwishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found\nthat more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those\nwho fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the\nheadquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most\nhostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party\nthat the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they\ndetermined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a\nlarge army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence\nthey marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into\nLucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and\nwith a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved\nagainst the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the\nenemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between\nMontecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to\nMontecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight\nskirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.\nOwing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed\ncoming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing\nworse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army\nin the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the\nGuelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain\nhad lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and\nallowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also\nshowed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the\ncamp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the\nmore they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in\nthe order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently,\ndeeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered\ntheir tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a\nfew words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the\ncertainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio\nhad noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre\nof the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the\narmy; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant\nmen on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he\nmoved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his\nlines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had\ncome in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre\nsquadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the\nwings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings\nof the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained\nout of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were\nseparated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach\neach other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio\u2019s men\nwere opposed to the weaker part of the enemy\u2019s troops, and the most\nefficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines\nwere unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or\nto give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much\ndifficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the\ncentre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to\nattack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat\nwas complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten\nthousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party\nin Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom\nwere Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and\nFilippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did\nnot amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco,\nthe son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the\nfirst onset.\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that\nUguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it\nappeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of\npower, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only\nwaited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the\ndeath of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in\nLucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge.\nOn the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were\ndriven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming\nto the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him\na proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his\nson Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take\nCastruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,\nfearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was\nentertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing\nto put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive,\nin order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.\nUgucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once\nset out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the\nbusiness in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the\nPisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo\ndella Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard\nof the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn\nback, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should\nclose their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what\nhad happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand\nthe liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had\narrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private\ncircles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised\na tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded\nthat Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse\nmight happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered\nhis friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked\nUguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away\nwith his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in\npoverty.\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,\nand he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people\nthat they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having\nobtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the\nrecovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of\nUguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded\na treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed\na fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course\nof two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained\nat that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a\nshort time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the\npass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and\nwrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the\nlord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed\nby the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any\nlonger to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord\nof Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico,\nFrancesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had\ncorrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected\nprince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of\nthe Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and\nCastruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at\nthe head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in\nLucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the\npeople\u2019s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in\ngreat honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him,\nand he was appointed the emperor\u2019s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time\nthe Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had\ndriven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.\nFrederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread\nof the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were\nconstrained to accept him as their lord.\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian\naffairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian\nGhibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio\nfor help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his\ncountry, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these\nexiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi,\nand Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.\nCastruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all\nTuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to\ngain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer\nMatteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces\nof his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he\ndivided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied\nwith arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he\ncould quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without\nthose whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he\nsurrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer\nMatteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven\nout the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the\nKing Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the\nFlorentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home,\nthey should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to\ndefend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized\nFucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country.\nWhereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely\nreached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to\nreturn to Lucca.\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so\npowerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance\nhim to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not\nreceived such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited\nother families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They\nfound their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set\nupon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and\nkilled him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano\ndi Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion,\nintervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms;\nand he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him\nwhat they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater\nintelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the\nnews of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in\ncommand of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.\nContrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he\nposted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As\nit appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to\nhim, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,\nfor he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to\npardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their\nformer friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to\ntheir house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged\nStefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure\nto find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to\nhear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to\nhim, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of\nshowing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and\nCastruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown\ninto prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered\nSan Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace,\nas it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to\nleave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce,\nwhich they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and\ndesirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded\nwith them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the\nconquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble,\nturned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should\nnot again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he,\nunder various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by\ntheir ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of\nthem, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had\nin his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that\nnone of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he\nraised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom\nhe had killed or hunted out of the state.\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his\nposition in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of\nincreasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he\ncould get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence,\nwhich was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends\nwith the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both\nparties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it\nalways had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the\nBianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each\nof these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each\ndesired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many\nthreatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the\nFlorentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city;\nboth trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they\nbelieved that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than\nthe Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave\npromises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and\nto Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the\nappointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself\ndirect to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and\nboth were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a\nsignal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other\nBastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans\nof either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the\nhands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the\npalace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them\nmany promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to\nthe city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and\nquickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great\nvalour.\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness\nof living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.\nThe German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened\u2014murders\nand tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put\nan end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should\ncall in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of\nthe city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he\ncould apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not\nonly to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome.\nCastruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the\nemperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be\nsafe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo\nGuinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six\nhundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest\ndistinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such\nrespect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order\nwas restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from\nthe country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the\nsource of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders,\nand admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico.\nCastruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This\ndignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in\na brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its\nfront: \u201cI am what God wills.\u201d Whilst on the back was: \u201cWhat God desires\nshall be.\u201d\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio\nshould have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could\ntempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be\ndifficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were\nBaldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face\ndanger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia,\nand with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and\nafter driving out some of Castruccio\u2019s officials and partisans, and\nkilling others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this\ngreatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on\nin great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return,\nknowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with\ntheir forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so\nthey would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the\nsupporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian\nterritories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his\narmy; and having heard where the Florentines\u2019 lay, he decided not to\nencounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of\nPescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the\nPass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design,\nvictory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had\nthirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he\nhad every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops,\nyet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be\noverwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and\nPistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the\nexact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places\nnarrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still\nnarrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that\ntwenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was\nManfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had\nbeen allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to\nthe Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either\u2014neither of them\nwishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of\nneutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons,\nand also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able\nto maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to\nfall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and\nthere was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force\nbefore they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this\ntrouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which\npossession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate\nfriendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with\nhim that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle\nthe night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put\nto death.\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the\nFlorentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away\nfrom Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his\narmy from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they\nreached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill\non the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the\ncastle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching\nfrom thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of\nSerravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the\nhill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his\ninfantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a\npath on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four\nhundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never\nexpecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they\naware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the\nFlorentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise\nwhen they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they\nupon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case\nof unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed\nwith such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own,\nalthough some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting\nreached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The\ncavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were\nunable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the\nnarrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought\nto be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were\nengaged with the enemy\u2019s infantry were scattered or killed without\nhaving made any effective defence because of their unfortunate\nposition, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout\nresistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both\nflanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their\nfriends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a\ndecisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand\ninfantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred\nhorsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole\nforce to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried\nout with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,\nbut gave way, and were soon in full retreat\u2014conquered more by their\nunfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the\nrear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man\nseeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very\nsanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini\ndei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all\nFlorentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on\nthe Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the\nGuelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out\nthe friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not\ncontent with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both\nsides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,\nabout two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the\nspoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding\nhorse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in\ncommemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to\ncorrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city\ngates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the\nparticipators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci\nand Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great\nanxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys\nto King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and\nhe, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph\ncause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to\nreceive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and\nhe sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the\npressure of Castruccio\u2019s army, owing to his being compelled to leave\nhis positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a\nconspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,\none of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland\nshould be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this\nconspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of\nCastruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy\npaucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few\nare not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy\nLanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.\nThis betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio\nCerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering\ntheir banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put\nhim to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their\nfamilies into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and\nPistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and\nenergy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines\ntheir opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of\nCarlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided\nto lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty\nthousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry\u2014having called to their aid\nevery Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should\nattack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to\nmarch on the latter\u2014a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more\nlikely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed\nthat the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army\nand quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from\nthence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army\nwhich the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree\nalarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would\ndeliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to\nthink that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects\nof success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand\nfoot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to\nFucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand\ninfantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the\nPisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and\nGusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.\nMoreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they\ndivided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the\ndirection of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or\nattack Castruccio\u2019s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they\nwould find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his\nown command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they\nwould have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy,\nan undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to\ntake this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of\nthe river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide\nexpanse of land between them and the river.\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to\ndecide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,\nhaving weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the\nlatter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet\nthe water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the\nsaddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the\nFlorentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of\ncavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was\nfixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines\nwith five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing\nthem to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one\nthousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the\nArno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their\narms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the\nriver, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more\ndifficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having\nbroken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of\nthe horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so\nfast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the\ndifficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved\nhigher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and\nthe banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by\nthe forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light\narmed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with\ntremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses,\nalarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and\ntrampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of\nCastruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp\nand terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither\nwould yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back\ninto the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land\nin order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they\ncould but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this\nobstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio\nshouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had\nbefore conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each\nother that the many should be overcome by the few. At length\nCastruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his\nmen and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many\nkilled and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up\na position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded\nthese latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and\none part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This\ncleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and\nthus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these\ntired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio\u2019s\nreserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into\nthe river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any\ndecisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his\ninferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the\ndefensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that\nwhen he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work\nof the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the\nFlorentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder\nof his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with\nlance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the\nenemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine\ncaptains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in\ncrossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower\ndown the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio\u2019s army. But\nhere, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of\nCastruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines\nwere so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them\nescaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains\nwere taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with\nMichelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine\ncommissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter\nwas infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the\nFlorentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men,\nwhilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his\nlife just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus\nruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry\ninto effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but\ndeath could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle\nthe whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued\nand overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on\ntheir return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the\nwatch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;\nhe being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be\nthe first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio\nstood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the\nArno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of\nwhich he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it\nwas the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with\nhigh fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must\nprove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and\naddressed him as follows:\n\u201cIf I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the\nmidst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my\nsuccesses promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left\nthee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,\nbecause I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and\nPisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the\nFlorentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these\npeoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least\nmore peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but\none more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who\ninsists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me\nwith sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time\nto surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have\nnever concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a\nboy\u2014a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should\nfeel\u2014and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been\nborn of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and\ncapable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been\nwitness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all\nhis possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love,\nand increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And\nin order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy\nfather left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained,\nI have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect\nmy mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.\nThus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am\ndeeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure.\nThou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest\ncontented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are\nof nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be\nsometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under\na Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with\nfactions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs\nrecently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended\nFlorentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly\ndestroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than\nthey would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the\nprinces of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far\ndistant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou\nhast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory\nof my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought\nthee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist\nthee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering\nunder this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And\nwhereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that\nwar with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every\ninducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring\nthee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this\nworld that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own\nstrength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for\nfighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be\nwell for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this\nway to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this\nthou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I\nhave told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that\nI have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\u201d\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia,\nand Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending\nPagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his\nsuccessor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him,\nand no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he\nwas. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he\nwas buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to\nPagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the\nabilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa,\nand then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This\nlatter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the\ngreat-grandson of Pagolo.\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a\nman of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time,\nbut also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the\nordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious\npresence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke\nwith him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,\nand he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or\nsnowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,\nbut terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false\nwith the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he\ndesired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory\nthat brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was\nbolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He\nwas accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear\nnothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees\nthat the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully\nsharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look\nfor any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not\nangered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that\nhe has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on\nthe following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a\npartridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom\nCastruccio had said: \u201cYou would not have given more than a penny.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \u201cA\nducat is much less to me.\u201d Having about him a flatterer on whom he had\nspat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \u201cFisherman\nare willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that\nthey may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by\nspittle that I may catch a whale\u201d; and this was not only heard by\nCastruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it\nwas wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \u201cIf that be\na vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our\nsaints.\u201d Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of\na house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:\n\u201cThou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest\ninto such places.\u201d A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo\nand was told: \u201cFool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which\ngave so much trouble to fasten.\u201d Castruccio said to one who professed\nto be a philosopher: \u201cYou are like the dogs who always run after those\nwho will give them the best to eat,\u201d and was answered: \u201cWe are rather\nlike the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest\nneed of them.\u201d Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much\ndisturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for\ncowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear\nanything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since\nevery man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one\nwhat he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \u201cWhen thou goest to a\nbanquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon\nanother.\u201d To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,\nCastruccio said: \u201cHe knows better than to boast of remembering many\nthings.\u201d Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming\nintoxicated. Castruccio replied: \u201cAn ox does the same.\u201d Castruccio was\nacquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being\nblamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be\ntaken in by a woman, he said: \u201cShe has not taken me in, I have taken\nher.\u201d Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered:\n\u201cThou dost not spend as much as I do?\u201d and being told that it was true,\nhe continued: \u201cThen thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\u201d\nBeing invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of\nLuca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a\nchamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers\nand foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some\nsaliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much\ndisturbed by this, said to him: \u201cI knew not where to spit in order to\noffend thee less.\u201d Being asked how Caesar died he said: \u201cGod willing I\nwill die as he did.\u201d Being one night in the house of one of his\ngentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of\nhis friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was\nusual in one of his station, so he said: \u201cHe who is considered wise by\nday will not be considered a fool at night.\u201d A person came to demand a\nfavour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea\nthrew himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by\nCastruccio, said: \u201cThou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast\nthy ears in thy feet,\u201d whereupon he obtained double the favour he had\nasked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one,\nseeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\nblindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\nwords, he said to him: \u201cWhen you have another request to make, send\nsomeone else to make it.\u201d Having been wearied by a similar man with a\nlong oration who wound up by saying: \u201cPerhaps I have fatigued you by\nspeaking so long,\u201d Castruccio said: \u201cYou have not, because I have not\nlistened to a word you said.\u201d He used to say of one who had been a\nbeautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was\ndangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\ntook the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he\nsaid: \u201cDo you laugh because you are successful or because another is\nunfortunate?\u201d Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\nGuinigi, one of his companions said to him: \u201cWhat shall I give you if\nyou will let me give you a blow on the nose?\u201d Castruccio answered: \u201cA\nhelmet.\u201d Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been\ninstrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done\nwrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived\nthemselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly\nthose men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying\nthat they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused\nwhen the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise\nthat whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first\nto learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with\nonly looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to\nbe buried when he died, and answered: \u201cWith the face turned downwards,\nfor I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\u201d On\nbeing asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order\nto save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared\nstrange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione\ndella Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat\nto preserve his health, and replied: \u201cIf the man be rich let him eat\nwhen he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\u201d Seeing one of his\ngentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \u201cI\npray God that you will let him feed you also.\u201d Seeing that someone had\nwritten upon his house in Latin the words: \u201cMay God preserve this house\nfrom the wicked,\u201d he said, \u201cThe owner must never go in.\u201d Passing\nthrough one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door,\nand remarked: \u201cThat house will fly through the door.\u201d He was having a\ndiscussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the\nproperty of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them,\nand the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \u201cIs this\nking of yours a bad man or a good one?\u201d asked Castruccio, and was told\nthat he was a good one, whereupon he said, \u201cWhy should you suggest that\nI should be afraid of a good man?\u201d\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and\nweighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his\nhigh qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a\nprince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,\nso he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;\ntherefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be\nseen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they\nwere placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in\nhis life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of\nAlexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his\nage as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had\nFortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia\nor Rome.", "source": "the_prince.txt"}

I spent September in snaring thrushes; but at the\nend of the month, even this rather tiresome sport failed me. I rise with\nthe sun, and go into a wood of mine that is being cut, where I remain\ntwo hours inspecting the work of the previous day and conversing with\nthe woodcutters, who have always some trouble on hand amongst themselves\nor with their neighbours. When I leave the wood, I go to a spring, and\nthence to the place which I use for snaring birds, with a book under my\narm--Dante or Petrarch, or one of the minor poets, like Tibullus or\nOvid. I read the story of their passions, and let their loves remind me\nof my own, which is a pleasant pastime for a while. Next I take the\nroad, enter the inn door, talk with the passers-by, inquire the news of\nthe neighbourhood, listen to a variety of matters, and make note of the\ndifferent tastes and humours of men.\n'This brings me to dinner-time, when I join my family and eat the poor\nproduce of my farm. After dinner I go back to the inn, where I generally\nfind the host and a butcher, a miller, and a pair of bakers. With these\ncompanions I play the fool all day at cards or backgammon: a thousand\nsquabbles, a thousand insults and abusive dialogues take place, while we\nhaggle over a farthing, and shout loud enough to be heard from San\nCasciano.\n'But when evening falls I go home and enter my writing-room. On the\nthreshold I put off my country habits, filthy with mud and mire, and\narray myself in royal courtly garments. Thus worthily attired, I make my\nentrance into the ancient courts of the men of old, where they receive\nme with love, and where I feed upon that food which only is my own and\nfor which I was born. I feel no shame in conversing with them and asking\nthem the reason of their actions.\n'They, moved by their humanity, make answer. For four hours' space I\nfeel no annoyance, forget all care; poverty cannot frighten, nor death\nappal me. I am carried away to their society. And since Dante says \"that\nthere is no science unless we retain what we have learned\" I have set\ndown what I have gained from their discourse, and composed a treatise,\n_De Principalibus_, in which I enter as deeply as I can into the science\nof the subject, with reasonings on the nature of principality, its\nseveral species, and how they are acquired, how maintained, how lost. If\nyou ever liked any of my scribblings, this ought to suit your taste. To\na prince, and especially to a new prince, it ought to prove acceptable.\nTherefore I am dedicating it to the Magnificence of Giuliano.'\n[Sidenote: Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.]\nSuch is the account that Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli renders of himself when\nafter imprisonment, torture, and disgrace, at the age of forty-four, he\nfirst turned to serious writing. For the first twenty-six or indeed\ntwenty-nine of those years we have not one line from his pen or one word\nof vaguest information about him. Throughout all his works written for\npublication, there is little news about himself. Montaigne could\nproperly write, 'Ainsi, lecteur, je suis moy-mesme la mati\u00e8re de mon\nlivre.' But the matter of Machiavelli was far other: 'Io ho espresso\nquanto io so, e quanto io ho imparato per una lunga pratica e continua\nlezione delle cose del mondo.'\n[Sidenote: The Man.]\nMachiavelli was born on the 3rd of May 1469. The period of his life\nalmost exactly coincides with that of Cardinal Wolsey. He came of the\nold and noble Tuscan stock of Montespertoli, who were men of their hands\nin the eleventh century. He carried their coat, but the property had\nbeen wasted and divided. His forefathers had held office of high\ndistinction, but had fallen away as the new wealth of the bankers and\ntraders increased in Florence. He himself inherited a small property in\nSan Casciano and its neighbourhood, which assured him a sufficient, if\nsomewhat lean, independence. Of his education we know little enough. He\nwas well acquainted with Latin, and knew, perhaps, Greek enough to serve\nhis turn. 'Rather not without letters than lettered,' Varchi describes\nhim. That he was not loaded down with learned reading proved probably a\ngreat advantage. The coming of the French, and the expulsion of the\nMedici, the proclamation of the Republic (1494), and later the burning\nof Savonarola convulsed Florence and threw open many public offices. It\nhas been suggested, but without much foundation, that some clerical work\nwas found for Machiavelli in 1494 or even earlier. It is certain that on\nJuly 14, 1498, he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Dieci di\nLibert\u00e0 e Pace, an office which he held till the close of his political\nlife at fall of the Republic in 1512.\n[Sidenote: Official Life.]\nThe functions of his Council were extremely varied, and in the hands of\ntheir Secretary became yet more diversified. They represented in some\nsense the Ministry for Home, Military, and especially for Foreign\nAffairs. It is impossible to give any full account of Machiavelli's\nofficial duties. He wrote many thousands of despatches and official\nletters, which are still preserved. He was on constant errands of State\nthrough the Florentine dominions. But his diplomatic missions and what\nhe learned by them make the main interest of his office. His first\nadventure of importance was to the Court of Caterina Sforza, the Lady of\nForl\u00ec, in which matter that astute Countess entirely bested the teacher\nof all diplomatists to be. In 1500 he smelt powder at the siege at Pisa,\nand was sent to France to allay the irritations of Louis XII. Many\nsimilar and lesser missions follow. The results are in no case of great\nimportance, but the opportunities to the Secretary of learning men and\nthings, intrigue and policy, the Court and the gutter were invaluable.\nAt the camp of C\u00e6sar Borgia, in 1502, he found in his host that\nfantastic hero whom he incarnated in _The Prince_, and he was\npractically an eye-witness of the amazing masterpiece, the Massacre of\nSinigaglia. The next year he is sent to Rome with a watching brief at\nthe election of Julius II., and in 1506 is again sent to negotiate with\nthe Pope. An embassy to the Emperor Maximilian, a second mission to the\nFrench King at Blois, in which he persuades Louis XII. to postpone the\nthreatened General Council of the Church (1511), and constant\nexpeditions to report upon and set in order unrestful towns and\nprovinces did not fulfil his activity. His pen was never idle. Reports,\ndespatches, elaborate monographs on France, Germany, or wherever he\nmight be, and personal letters innumerable, and even yet unpublished,\nceased not night nor day. Detail, wit, character-drawing, satire,\nsorrow, bitterness, all take their turn. But this was only a fraction of\nhis work. By duty and by expediency he was bound to follow closely the\ninternal politics of Florence where his enemies and rivals abounded. And\nin all these years he was pushing forward and carrying through with\nunceasing and unspeakable vigour the great military dream of his life,\nthe foundation of a National Militia and the extinction of Mercenary\nCompanies. But the fabric he had fancied and thought to have built\nproved unsubstantial. The spoilt half-mutinous levies whom he had spent\nyears in odious and unwilling training failed him at the crowning moment\nin strength and spirit: and the fall of the Republic implied the fall of\nMachiavelli and the close of his official life. He struggled hard to\nsave himself, but the wealthy classes were against him, perhaps afraid\nof him, and on them the Medici relied. For a year he was forbidden to\nleave Florentine territory, and for a while was excluded from the\nPalazzo. Later his name was found in a list of Anti-Medicean\nconspirators. He was arrested and decorously tortured with six turns of\nthe rack, and then liberated for want of evidence.\n[Sidenote: After his Fall.]\nFor perhaps a year after his release the Secretary engaged in a series\nof tortuous intrigues to gain the favour of the Medici. Many of the\nstories may be exaggerated, but none make pleasant reading, and nothing\nproved successful. His position was miserable. Temporarily crippled by\ntorture, out of favour with the Government, shunned by his friends, in\ndeep poverty, burdened with debt and with a wife and four children, his\nmaterial circumstances were ill enough. But, worse still, he was idle.\nHe had deserved well of the Republic, and had never despaired of it, and\nthis was his reward. He seemed to himself a broken man. He had no great\nnatural dignity, no great moral strength. He profoundly loved and\nadmired Dante, but he could not for one moment imitate him. He sought\nsatisfaction in sensuality of life and writing, but found no comfort.\nGreat things were stirring in the world and he had neither part nor lot\nin them. By great good fortune he began a correspondence with his friend\nFrancesco Vettori, the Medicean Ambassador at Rome, to whom he appeals\nfor his good offices: 'And if nothing can be done, I must live as I came\ninto the world, for I was born poor and learnt to want before learning\nto enjoy.' Before long these two diplomats had co-opted themselves into\na kind of Secret Cabinet of Europe. It is a strange but profoundly\ninteresting correspondence, both politically and personally. Nothing is\ntoo great or too small, too glorious or too mean for their pens. Amid\nfoolish anecdotes and rather sordid love affairs the politics of Europe,\nand especially of Italy, are dissected and discussed. Leo X. had now\nplunged into political intrigue. Ferdinand of Spain was in difficulty.\nFrance had allied herself with Venice. The Swiss are the Ancient Romans,\nand may conquer Italy. Then back again, or rather constant throughout,\nthe love intrigues and the 'likely wench hard-by who may help to pass\nour time.' But through it all there is an ache at Machiavelli's heart,\nand on a sudden he will break down, crying,\nPer\u00f2 se aleuna volta io rido e canto\nFacciol, perch\u00e8 non ho se non quest' una\nVia da sfogare il mio angoscioso pianto.\nVettori promised much, but nothing came of it. By 1515 the\ncorrespondence died away, and the Ex-Secretary found for himself at last\nthe true pathway through his vale of years.\n[Sidenote: The true Life.]\nThe remainder of Machiavelli's life is bounded by his books. He settled\nat his villa at San Casciano, where he spent his day as he describes in\nthe letter quoted at the beginning of this essay. In 1518 he began to\nattend the meetings of the Literary Club in the Orti Oricellarii, and\nmade new and remarkable friends. 'Era amato grandamente da loro ... e\ndella sua conversazione si dilettavano maravigliosamente, tenendo in\nprezzo grandissimo tutte l'opere sue,' which shows the personal\nauthority he exercised. Occasionally he was employed by Florentine\nmerchants to negotiate for them at Venice, Genoa, Lucca, and other\nplaces. In 1519 Cardinal Medici deigned to consult him as to the\nGovernment, and commissioned him to write the History of Florence. But\nin the main he wrote his books and lived the daily life we know. In 1525\nhe went to Rome to present his History to Clement VII., and was sent on\nto Guicciardini. In 1526 he was busy once more with military matters and\nthe fortification of Florence. On the 22nd of June 1527 he died at\nFlorence immediately after the establishment of the second Republic. He\nhad lived as a practising Christian, and so died, surrounded by his wife\nand family. Wild legends grew about his death, but have no foundation. A\npeasant clod in San Casciano could not have made a simpler end. He was\nburied in the family Chapel in Santa Croce, and a monument was there at\nlast erected with the epitaph by Doctor Ferroni--'Tanto nomini nullum\npar elogium.' The first edition of his complete works was published in\n1782, and was dedicated to Lord Cowper.\n[Sidenote: His Character.]\nWhat manner of man was Machiavelli at home and in the market-place? It\nis hard to say. There are doubtful busts, the best, perhaps, that\nengraved in the 'Testina' edition of 1550, so-called on account of the\nportrait. 'Of middle height, slender figure, with sparkling eyes, dark\nhair, rather a small head, a slightly aquiline nose, a tightly closed\nmouth: all about him bore the impress of a very acute observer and\nthinker, but not that of one able to wield much influence over others.'\nSuch is a reconstruction of him by one best able to make one. 'In his\nconversation,' says Varchi, 'Machiavelli was pleasant, serviceable to\nhis friends, a friend of virtuous men, and, in a word, worthy to have\nreceived from Nature either less genius or a better mind.' If not much\nabove the moral standard of the day he was certainly not below it. His\nhabits were loose and his language lucid and licentious. But there is no\nbad or even unkind act charged against him. To his honesty and good\nfaith he very fairly claims that his poverty bears witness. He was a\nkind, if uncertain, husband and a devoted father. His letters to his\nchildren are charming. Here is one written soon before his death to his\nlittle son Guido.--'Guido, my darling son, I received a letter of thine\nand was delighted with it, particularly because you tell me of your full\nrecovery, the best news I could have. If God grants life to us both I\nexpect to make a good man of you, only you must do your fair share\nyourself.' Guido is to stick to his books and music, and if the family\nmule is too fractious, 'Unbridle him, take off the halter and turn him\nloose at Montepulciano. The farm is large, the mule is small, so no harm\ncan come of it. Tell your mother, with my love, not to be nervous. I\nshall surely be home before any trouble comes. Give a kiss to Baccina,\nPiero, and Totto: I wish I knew his eyes were getting well. Be happy and\nspend as little as you may. Christ have you in his keeping.'--There is\nnothing exquisite or divinely delicate in this letter, but there are\nmany such, and they were not written by a bad man, any more than the\nanswers they evoke were addressed to one. There is little more save of a\nlike character that is known of Machiavelli the man. But to judge him\nand his work we must have some knowledge of the world in which he was to\nmove and have his being.\n*       *       *       *       *\n[Sidenote: State of Italy.]\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century Italy was rotten to the core.\nIn the close competition of great wickedness the Vicar of Christ easily\ncarried off the palm, and the Court of Alexander VI. was probably the\nwickedest meeting-place of men that has ever existed upon earth. No\nvirtue, Christian or Pagan, was there to be found; little art that was\nnot sensuous or sensual. It seemed as if Bacchus and Venus and Priapus\nhad come to their own again, and yet Rome had not ceased to call herself\nChristian.\n[Sidenote: Superstition.]\n'Owing to the evil ensample of the Papal Court,' writes Machiavelli,\n'Italy has lost all piety and all religion: whence follow infinite\ntroubles and disorders; for as religion implies all good, so its absence\nimplies the contrary. To the Church and priests of Rome we owe another\neven greater disaster which is the cause of her ruin. I mean that the\nChurch has maintained, and still maintains Italy divided.' The Papacy is\ntoo weak to unite and rule, but strong enough to prevent others doing\nso, and is always ready to call in the foreigner to crush all Italians\nto the foreigner's profit, and Guicciardini, a high Papal officer,\ncommenting on this, adds, 'It would be impossible to speak so ill of the\nRoman Court, but that more abuse should not be merited, seeing it is an\ninfamy, and example of all the shames and scandals of the world.' The\nlesser clergy, the monks, the nuns followed, with anxious fidelity, the\nfootsteps of their shepherds. There was hardly a tonsure in Italy which\ncovered more than thoughts and hopes of lust and avarice. Religion and\nmorals which God had joined together, were set by man a thousand leagues\nasunder. Yet religion still sat upon the alabaster throne of Peter, and\nin the filthy straw of the meanest Calabrian confessional. And still\ndeeper remained a blind devoted superstition. Vitellozzo Vitelli, as\nMachiavelli tells us, while being strangled by C\u00e6esar Borgia's assassin,\nimplored his murderer to procure for him the absolution of that\nmurderer's father. Gianpaolo Baglioni, who reigned by parricide and\nlived in incest, was severely blamed by the Florentines for not killing\nPope Julius II. when the latter was his guest at Perugia. And when\nGabrino Fondato, the tyrant of Cremona, was on the scaffold, his only\nregret was that when he had taken his guests, the Pope and Emperor, to\nthe top of the Cremona tower, four hundred feet high, his nerve failed\nhim and he did not push them both over. Upon this anarchy of religion,\nmorals, and conduct breathed suddenly the inspiring breath of Pagan\nantiquity which seemed to the Italian mind to find its finest climax in\ntyrannicide. There is no better instance than in the plot of the Pazzi\nat Florence. Francesco Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini decided to kill\nLorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici in the cathedral at the moment of the\nelevation of the Host. They naturally took the priest into their\nconfidence. They escorted Giuliano to the Duomo, laughing and talking,\nand playfully embraced him--to discover if he wore armour under his\nclothes. Then they killed him at the moment appointed.\n[Sidenote: Pagan influence.]\nNor were there any hills from which salvation might be looked for.\nPhilosophy, poetry, science, expressed themselves in terms of\nmaterialism. Faith and hope are ever the last survivors in the life of a\nman or of a nation. But in Italy these brave comforters were at their\nlatest breath. It is perhaps unfair to accept in full the judgment of\nNorthern travellers. The conditions, training, needs of England and\nGermany were different. In these countries courage was a necessity, and\ngood faith a paying policy. Subtlety could do little against a\ntwo-handed sword in the hands of an angry or partially intoxicated\ngiant. Climate played its part as well as culture, and the crude\npleasures and vices of the North seemed fully as loathsome to the\nrefined Italian as did the tortuous policy and the elaborate infamies of\nthe South to their rough invaders. Alone, perhaps, among the nations of\nEurope the Italians had never understood or practised chivalry, save in\nsuch select and exotic schools as the Casa Gioiosa under Vittorino da\nFeltre at Mantua. The oath of Arthur's knights would have seemed to them\nmere superfluity of silliness. _Onore_ connoted credit, reputation, and\nprowess. _Virt\u00f9_, which may be roughly translated as mental ability\ncombined with personal daring, set the standard and ruled opinion.\n'Honour in the North was subjective: _Onore_ in Italy objective.'\nIndividual liberty, indeed, was granted in full to all, at the\nindividual's risk. The love of beauty curbed grossness and added\ndistinction. Fraud became an art and force a science. There is liberty\nfor all, but for the great ones there is licence. And when the day of\ntrial comes, it is the Churchmen and the Princes who can save neither\nthemselves nor man, nor thing that is theirs. To such a world was\nMachiavelli born. To whom should he turn? To the People? To the Church?\nTo the Princes and Despots? But hear him:--\n'There shall never be found any good mason, which will beleeve\nto be able to make a faire image of a peece of marble ill hewed,\nbut verye well of a rude peece. Our Italian Princes beleeved,\nbefore they tasted the blowes of the outlandish warre, that it\nshould suffice a Prince to know by writinges, how to make a\nsubtell aunswere, to write a goodly letter, to shewe in\nsayinges, and in woordes, witte and promptenesse, to know how to\ncanvas a fraude, to decke themselves with precious stones and\ngold, to sleepe and to eate with greater glory then other: To\nkepe many lascivious persons about them, to governe themselves\nwith their subjects, covetously and proudely: To roote in\nidlenes, to give the degrees of the exercise of warre for good\nwill, to dispise if any should have shewed them any laudable\nwaie, minding that their wordes should bee aunswers of oracles:\nnor the sely wretches were not aware that they prepared\nthemselves to be a pray to whome so ever should assaulte them.\nHereby grew then in the thousand fowre hundred and nintie and\nfowre yere, the great feares, the sodaine flightes and the\nmarveilous losses: and so three most mighty states which were in\nItalie, have bene dievers times sacked and destroyed. But that\nwhich is worse, is where those that remaine, continue in the\nvery same errour, and liev in the verie same disorder and\nconsider not, that those who in olde time would keepe their\nstates, caused to be done these thinges, which of me hath beene\nreasoned, and that their studies were, to prepare the body to\ndiseases, and the minde not to feare perills. Whereby grewe that\nC\u00e6sar, Alexander, and all those men and excellent Princes in\nolde time, were the formost amongst the fighters, going armed on\nfoote: and if they lost their state, they would loose their\nlife, so that they lievd and died vertuously.'\nSuch was the clay that waited the moulding of the potter's hand.\n'Posterity, that high court of appeal, which is never tired of\neulogising its own justice and discernment,' has recorded harsh sentence\non the Florentine. It is better to-day to let him speak for himself.\n[Sidenote: _The Prince_.]\nThe slender volume of _The Prince_ has probably produced wider\ndiscussion, more bitter controversy, more varied interpretations and a\ndeeper influence than any book save Holy Writ. Kings and statesmen,\nphilosophers and theologians, monarchists and republicans have all and\nalways used or abused it for their purposes. Written in 1513, the first\nyear of Machiavelli's disgrace, concurrently with part of the\n_Discorsi_, which contain the germs of it, the book represents the\nfulness of its author's thought and experience. It was not till after\nMachiavelli's death, that it was published in 1532, by order of Clement\nVII. Meanwhile, however, in manuscript it had been widely read and\nfavourably received.\n[Sidenote: Its purpose.]\nThe mere motive of its creation and dedication has been the theme of\nmany volumes. Machiavelli was poor, was idle, was out of favour, and\ntherefore, though a Republican, wrote a devilish hand-book of tyranny to\nstrengthen the Medici and recover his position. Machiavelli, a loyal\nRepublican, wrote a primer of such fiendish principles as might lure the\nMedici to their ruin. Machiavelli's one idea was to ruin the rich:\nMachiavelli's one idea was to oppress the poor: he was a Protestant, a\nJesuit, an Atheist: a Royalist and a Republican. And the book published\nby one Pope's express authority was utterly condemned and forbidden,\nwith all its author's works, by the express command of another (1559).\nBut before facing the whirlwind of savage controversy which raged and\nrages still about _The Prince_, it may be well to consider shortly the\nbook itself--consider it as a new book and without prejudice. The\npurpose of its composition is almost certainly to be found in the plain\nfact that Machiavelli, a politician and a man of letters, wished to\nwrite a book upon the subject which had been his special study and lay\nnearest to his business and bosom. To ensure prominence for such a book,\nto engage attention and incidentally perhaps to obtain political\nemployment for himself, he dedicated it to Lorenzo de' Medici, the\nexisting and accepted Chief of the State. But far and above such lighter\nmotives stood the fact that he saw in Lorenzo the only man who might\nconceivably bring to being the vast dream of patriotism which the writer\nhad imagined. The subject he proposed to himself was largely, though not\nwholly, conditioned by the time and place in which he lived. He wrote\nfor his countrymen and he wrote for his own generation. He had heard\nwith his ears and seen with his eyes the alternate rending anarchy and\nmoaning paralysis of Italy. He had seen what Agricola had long before\nbeen spared the sight of. And what he saw, he saw not through a glass\ndarkly or distorted, but in the whitest, driest light, without flinching\nand face to face. 'We are much beholden,' writes Bacon, 'to Machiavelli\nand others that wrote what men do, and not what they ought to do.' He\ndid not despair of Italy, he did not despair even of Italian unity. But\nhe despaired of what he saw around him, and he was willing at almost any\nprice to end it. He recognised, despite the nominal example of Venice,\nthat a Republican system was impossible, and that the small\nPrincipalities and Free Cities were corrupt beyond hope of healing. A\nstrong central unifying government was imperative, and at that day such\ngovernment could only be vested in a single man. For it must ever be\nclosely remembered, as will be pointed out again, that throughout the\nbook the Prince is what would now be called the Government. And then he\nsaw with faithful prophecy, in the splendid peroration of his hope, a\nhope deferred for near four hundred years, he saw beyond the painful\npaths of blood and tyranny, a vision of deliverance and union. For at\nleast it is plain that in all things Machiavelli was a passionate\npatriot, and _Amo la patria mia pi\u00f9 dell' anima_ is found in one of the\nlast of many thousand letters that his untiring pen had written.\nThe purpose, then, of _The Prince_ is to lay down rules, within the\npossibilities of the time, for the making of a man who shall create,\nincrease, and maintain a strong and stable government. This is done in\nthe main by a plain presentation of facts, a presentation condensed and\ncritical but based on men and things as they actually were. The ethical\nside is wholly omitted: the social and economical almost entirely. The\naspect is purely political, with the underlying thought, it may be\nsupposed, that under the postulated government, all else will prosper.\n[Sidenote: The Book; New States.]\nMachiavelli opens by discussing the various forms of governments, which\nhe divides into Republics and Principalities. Of the latter some may be\nhereditary and some acquired. Of hereditary states he says little and\nquotes but one, the Duchy of Ferrara. He then turns to his true subject,\nthe acquisition and preservation of States wholly new or new in part,\nStates such as he saw himself on every side around him. Having gained\npossession of a new State, he says, you must first extirpate the family\nof your predecessor. You should then either reside or plant colonies,\nbut not trust to garrisons. 'Colonies are not costly to the Prince, are\nmore faithful and cause less offence to the subject States: those whom\nthey may injure being poor and scattered, are prevented from doing\nmischief. For it should be observed that men ought either to be caressed\nor trampled out, seeing that small injuries may be avenged, whereas\ngreat ones destroy the possibility of retaliation: and so the damage\nthat has to be inflicted ought to be such that it need involve no fear\nof reprisals.' There is perhaps in all Machiavelli no better example of\nhis lucid scientific method than this passage. There is neither excuse\nnor hypocrisy. It is merely a matter of business calculation. Mankind is\nthe raw material, the State is the finished work. Further you are to\nconciliate your neighbours who are weak and abase the strong, and you\nmust not let the stranger within your gates. Above all look before as\nwell as after and think not to leave it to time, _godere li benefici del\ntempo_, but, as did the Romans, strike and strike at once. For\nillustration he criticises, in a final and damning analysis, the career\nof Louis XII. in Italy. There was no canon of statecraft so absolute\nthat the King did not ignore it, and in inevitable Nemesis, there was no\nultimate disaster so crowning as not to be achieved.\n[Sidenote: Conquests.]\nAfter observing that a feudal monarchy is much less easy of conquest\nthan a despotism, since in the one case you must vanquish many lesser\nlordships while in the other you merely replace slaves by slaves,\nMachiavelli considers the best method of subjugating Free Cities. Here\nagain is eminent the terrible composure and the exact truth of his\npolitics. A conquered Free City you may of course rule in person, or you\nmay construct an oligarchy to govern for you, but the only safe way is\nto destroy it utterly, since 'that name of Liberty, those ancient usages\nof Freedom,' are things 'which no length of years and no benefits can\nextinguish in the nation's mind, things which no pains or forethought\ncan uproot unless the citizens be utterly destroyed.'\nHitherto the discussion has ranged round the material politics of the\nmatter, the acquisition of material power. Machiavelli now turns to the\nheart of his matter, the proper character and conduct of a new Prince in\na new Principality and the ways by which he shall deal most fortunately\nwith friend and foe. For fortune it is, as well as ability, which go to\nthe making of the man and the maintenance of his power.\n[Sidenote: C\u00e6sar Borgia.]\nIn the manner of the day Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus are led\nacross the stage in illustration. The common attribute of all such\nfortunate masters of men was force of arms, while the mission of an\nunarmed prophet such as Savonarola was foredoomed to failure. In such\npolitics Machiavelli is positive and ruthless: force is and must be the\nremedy and the last appeal, a principle which indeed no later generation\nhas in practice set at naught. But in the hard dry eyes of the\nFlorentine Secretary stood, above all others, one shining figure, a\nfigure to all other eyes, from then till now, wrapped in mysterious and\nmiasmatic cloud. In the pages of common history he was a tyrant, he was\nvicious beyond compare, he was cruel beyond the Inquisition, he was\nfalse beyond the Father of Lies, he was the Antichrist of Rome and he\nwas a failure: but he was the hero of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who, indeed,\nfound in C\u00e6sar Borgia the fine flower of Italian politics in the Age of\nthe Despots. Son of the Pope, a Prince of the Church, a Duke of France,\na master of events, a born soldier, diplomatist, and more than half a\nstatesman, C\u00e6sar seemed indeed the darling of gods and men whom original\nfortune had crowned with inborn ability. Machiavelli knew him as well as\nit was possible to know a soul so tortuous and secret, and he had been\npresent at the most critical and terrible moments of C\u00e6sar's life. That\nin despite of a life which the world calls infamous, in despite of the\nhowling execrations of all Christendom, in despite of ultimate and\nentire failures, Machiavelli could still write years after, 'I know not\nwhat lessons I could teach a new Prince more useful than the example of\nhis actions,' exhibits the ineffaceable impressions that C\u00e6sar Borgia\nhad made upon the most subtle and observant mind of modern history.\n[Sidenote: C\u00e6sar's Career.]\nC\u00e6sar was the acknowledged son of Pope Alexander by his acknowledged\nmistress Vannozza dei Cattani. Born in 1472, he was an Archbishop and a\nCardinal at sixteen, and the murderer of his elder brother at an age\nwhen modern youths are at college. He played his part to the full in the\nunspeakable scandals of the Vatican, but already 'he spoke little and\npeople feared him.' Ere long the splendours of the Papacy seemed too\nremote and uncertain for his fierce ambition, and, indeed, through his\nfather, he already wielded both the temporal and the spiritual arms of\nPeter. To the subtlety of the Italian his Spanish blood had lent a\ncertain stern resolution, and as with Julius and Sulla the lust for\nsloth and sensuality were quickened by the lust for sway. He unfrocked\nhimself with pleasure. He commenced politician, soldier, and despot. And\nfor the five years preceding Alexander's death he may almost be looked\nupon as a power in Europe. Invested Duke of Romagna, that hot-bed of\npetty tyranny and tumult, he repressed disorder through his governor\nMesser Ramiro with a relentless hand. When order reigned, Machiavelli\ntells us he walked out one morning into the market-place at Cesena and\nsaw the body of Ramiro, who had borne the odium of reform, lying in two\npieces with his head on a lance, and a bloody axe by his side. C\u00e6sar\nreaped the harvest of Ramiro's severity, and the people recognising his\nbenevolence and justice were 'astounded and satisfied.'\nBut the gaze of the Borgia was not bounded by the strait limits of a\nmere Italian Duchy. Whether indeed there mingled with personal ambition\nan ideal of a united Italy, swept clean of the barbarians, it is hard to\nsay, though Machiavelli would have us believe it. What is certain is\nthat he desired the supreme dominion in Italy for himself, and to win it\nspared neither force nor fraud nor the help of the very barbarians\nthemselves. With a decree of divorce and a Cardinal's hat he gained the\nsupport of France, the French Duchy of Valentinois, and the sister of\nthe King of Navarre to wife. By largesse of bribery and hollow promises\nhe brought to his side the great families of Rome, his natural enemies,\nand the great Condottieri with their men-at-arms. When by their aid he\nhad established and extended his government he mistrusted their good\nfaith. With an infinity of fascination and cunning, without haste and\nwithout rest, he lured these leaders, almost more cunning than himself,\nto visit him as friends in his fortress of Sinigaglia. 'I doubt if they\nwill be alive to-morrow morning,' wrote Machiavelli, who was on the\nspot. He was right. C\u00e6sar caused them to be strangled the same night,\nwhile his father dealt equal measure to their colleagues and adherents\nin Rome. Thenceforth, distrusting mercenaries, he found and disciplined\nout of a mere rabble, a devoted army of his own, and having\nunobtrusively but completely extirpated the whole families of those\nwhose thrones he had usurped, not only the present but the future seemed\nassured to him.\nHe had fulfilled the first of Machiavelli's four conditions. He rapidly\nachieved the remaining three. He bought the Roman nobles so as to be\nable to put a bridle in the new 'Pope's mouth.' He bought or poisoned or\npacked or terrorised the existing College of Cardinals and selected new\nPrinces of the Church who should accept a Pontiff of his choosing. He\nwas effectively strong enough to resist the first onset upon him at his\nfather's death. Five years had been enough for so great an undertaking.\nOne thing alone he had not and indeed could not have foreseen. 'He told\nme himself on the day on which (Pope) Julius was created, that he had\nforeseen and provided for everything else that could happen on his\nfather's death, but had never anticipated that, when his father died, he\ntoo should have been at death's door.' Even so the fame and splendour of\nhis name for a while maintained his authority against his unnumbered\nenemies. But soon the great betrayer was betrayed. 'It is well to cheat\nthose who have been masters of treachery,' he had said himself in his\nhours of brief authority. His wheel had turned full cycle. Within three\nyears his fate, like that of Charles XII., was destined to a foreign\nstrand, a petty fortress, and a dubious hand. Given over to Spain he\npassed three years obscurely. 'He was struck down in a fight at Viana in\nNavarre (1507) after a furious resistance: he was stripped of his fine\narmour by men who did not know his name or quality and his body was left\nnaked on the bare ground, bloody and riddled with wounds. He was only\nthirty-one.' And so the star of Machiavelli's hopes and dreams was\nquenched for a season in the clouds from which it came.\n[Sidenote: The Lesson.]\nIt seems worth while to sketch the strange tempestuous career of C\u00e6sar\nBorgia because in the remaining chapters of _The Prince_ and elsewhere\nin his writings, it is the thought and memory of Valentinois, transmuted\ndoubtless and idealised by the lapse of years, that largely inform and\ninspire the perfect Prince of Machiavelli. But it must not be supposed\nthat in life or in mind they were intimate or even sympathetic.\nMachiavelli criticises his hero liberally and even harshly. But for the\nwork he wanted done he had found no better craftsman and no better\nexample to follow for those that might come after. Morals and religion\ndid not touch the purpose of his arguments except as affecting policy.\nIn policy virtues may be admitted as useful agents and in the chapter\nfollowing that on C\u00e6sar, entitled, curiously enough, 'Of those who by\ntheir crimes come to be Princes,' he lays down that 'to slaughter fellow\ncitizens, to betray friends, to be devoid of honour, pity and religion\ncannot be counted as merits, for these are means which may lead to power\nbut which confer no glory.' Cruelty he would employ without hesitation\nbut with the greatest care both in degree and in kind. It should be\nimmediate and complete and leave no possibility of counter-revenge. For\nit is never forgotten by the living, and 'he deceives himself who\nbelieves that, with the great, recent benefits cause old wrongs to be\nforgotten.' On the other hand 'Benefits should be conferred little by\nlittle so that they may be more fully relished.' The cruelty proper to a\nPrince (Government, for as ever they are identical) aims only at\nauthority. Now authority must spring from love or fear. It were best to\ncombine both motives to obedience but you cannot. The Prince must\nremember that men are fickle, and love at their own pleasure, and that\nmen are fearful and fear at the pleasure of the Prince. Let him\ntherefore depend on what is of himself, not on that which is of others.\n'Yet if he win not love he may escape hate, and so it will be if he does\nnot meddle with the property or women-folk of his subjects.' When he\nmust punish let him kill. 'For men will sooner forget the death of their\nfather than the loss of their estate.' And moreover you cannot always go\non killing, but a Prince who has once set himself to plundering will\nnever stop. This is the more needful because the only secure foundation\nof his rule lies in his trust of the people and in their support. And\nindeed again and again you shall find no more thorough democrat than\nthis teacher of tyrants. 'The people own better broader qualities,\nfidelities and passions than any Prince and have better cause to show\nfor them.' 'As for prudence and stability, I say that a people is more\nstable, more prudent, and of better judgment than a Prince.' If the\npeople go wrong it is almost certainly the crime or negligence of the\nPrince which drives or leads them astray. 'Better far than any number of\nfortresses is not to be hated by your people.' The support of the people\nand a national militia make the essential strength of the Prince and of\nthe State.\n[Sidenote: National Defence.]\nThe chapters on military organisation may be more conveniently\nconsidered in conjunction with _The Art of War_. It is enough at present\nto point out two or three observations of Machiavelli which touch\npolitics from the military side. To his generation they were entirely\nnovel, though mere commonplace to-day. National strength means national\nstability and national greatness; and this can be achieved, and can only\nbe achieved, by a national army. The Condottiere system, born of sloth\nand luxury, has proved its rottenness. Your hired general is either a\ntyrant or a traitor, a bully or a coward. 'In a word the armour of\nothers is too wide or too strait for us: it falls off us, or it weighs\nus down.' And in a fine illustration he compares auxiliary troops to the\narmour of Saul which David refused, preferring to fight Goliath with his\nsling and stone.\n[Sidenote: Conduct of the Prince.]\nHaving assured the external security of the State, Machiavelli turns\nonce more to the qualities and conduct of the Prince. So closely packed\nare these concluding chapters that it is almost impossible to compress\nthem further. The author at the outset states his purpose: 'Since it is\nmy object to write what shall be useful to whosoever understands it, it\nseems to me better to follow the practical truth of things rather than\nan imaginary view of them. For many Republics and Princedoms have been\nimagined that were never seen or known to exist in reality. And the\nmanner in which we live and in which we ought to live, are things so\nwide asunder that he who suits the one to betake himself to the other is\nmore likely to destroy than to save himself.' Nothing that Machiavelli\nwrote is more sincere, analytic, positive and ruthless. He operates\nunflinchingly on an assured diagnosis. The hand never an instant\nfalters, the knife is never blunt. He deals with what is, and not with\nwhat ought to be. Should the Prince be all-virtuous, all-liberal,\nall-humane? Should his word be his bond for ever? Should true religion\nbe the master-passion of his life? Machiavelli considers. The first duty\nof the Prince (or Government) is to maintain the existence, stability,\nand prosperity of the State. Now if all the world were perfect so should\nthe Prince be perfect too. But such are not the conditions of human\nlife. An idealising Prince must fall before a practising world. A Prince\nmust learn in self-defence how to be bad, but like C\u00e6sar Borgia, he must\nbe a great judge of occasion. And what evil he does must be deliberate,\nappropriate, and calculated, and done, not selfishly, but for the good\nof the State of which he is trustee. There is the power of Law and the\npower of Force. The first is proper to men, the second to beasts. And\nthat is why Achilles was brought up by Cheiron the Centaur that he might\nlearn to use both natures. A ruler must be half lion and half fox, a fox\nto discern the toils, a lion to drive off the wolves. Merciful,\nfaithful, humane, religious, just, these he may be and above all should\nseem to be, nor should any word escape his lips to give the lie to his\nprofessions: and in fact he should not leave these qualities but when he\nmust. He should, if possible, practise goodness, but under necessity\nshould know how to pursue evil. He should keep faith until occasion\nalter, or reason of state compel him to break his pledge. Above all he\nshould profess and observe religion, 'because men in general judge\nrather by the eye than by the hand, and every one can see but few can\ntouch.' But none the less, must he learn (as did William the Silent,\nElizabeth of England, and Henry of Navarre) how to subordinate creed to\npolicy when urgent need is upon him. In a word, he must realise and face\nhis own position, and the facts of mankind and of the world. If not\nveracious to his conscience, he must be veracious to facts. He must not\nbe bad for badness' sake, but seeing things as they are, must deal as he\ncan to protect and preserve the trust committed to his care. Fortune is\nstill a fickle jade, but at least the half our will is free, and if we\nare bold we may master her yet. For Fortune is a woman who, to be kept\nunder, must be beaten and roughly handled, and we see that she is more\nready to be mastered by those who treat her so, than by those who are\nshy in their wooing. And always, like a woman, she gives her favours to\nthe young, because they are less scrupulous and fiercer and more\naudaciously command her to their will.\n[Sidenote: The Appeal.]\nAnd so at the last the sometime Secretary of the Florentine Republic\nturns to the new Master of the Florentines in splendid exhortation. He\npoints to no easy path. He proposes no mean ambition. He has said\nalready that 'double will that Prince's glory be, who has founded a new\nrealm and fortified it and adorned it with good laws, good arms, good\nfriends, and good examples.' But there is more and better to be done.\nThe great misery of men has ever made the great leaders of men. But was\nIsrael in Egypt, were the Persians, the Athenians ever more enslaved,\ndown-trodden, disunited, beaten, despoiled, mangled, overrun and\ndesolate than is our Italy to-day? The barbarians must be hounded out,\nand Italy be free and one. Now is the accepted time. All Italy is\nwaiting and only seeks the man. To you the darling of Fortune and the\nChurch this splendid task is given, to and to the army of Italy and of\nItalians only. Arm Italy and lead her. To you, the deliverer, what gates\nwould be closed, what obedience refused! What jealousies opposed, what\nhomage denied. Love, courage, and fixed fidelity await you, and under\nyour standards shall the voice of Petrarch be fulfilled:\nVirtu contro al furore\nPrender\u00e0 l'arme e fia il combatter corto:\nCh\u00e8 l'antico valore\nNegl' Italici cor non \u00e8 ancor morto.\nSuch is _The Prince_ of Machiavelli. The vision of its breathless\nexhortation seemed then as but a landscape to a blind man's eye. But the\npassing of three hundred and fifty years of the misery he wept for\nbrought at the last, almost in perfect exactness, the fulfilment of that\nimpossible prophecy.\n[Sidenote: The Attack.]\nThere is no great book in the world of smaller compass than _The Prince_\nof Machiavelli. There is no book more lucidly, directly, and plainly\nwritten. There is no book that has aroused more vehement, venomous, and\neven truculent controversy from the moment of its publication until\nto-day. And it is asserted with great probability that _The Prince_ has\nhad a more direct action upon real life than any other book in the\nworld, and a larger share in breaking the chains and lighting the dark\nplaces of the Middle Ages. It is a truism to say that Machiavellism\nexisted before Machiavelli. The politics of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, of\nLouis XI. of France, of Ferdinand of Spain, of the Papacy, of Venice,\nmight have been dictated by the author of _The Prince_. But Machiavelli\nwas the first to observe, to compare, to diagnose, to analyse, and to\nformulate their principles of government. The first to establish, not a\ndivorce, but rather a judicial separation between the morals of a man\nand the morals of a government. It is around the purpose and possible\nresults of such a separation in politics, ethics, and religion that the\nstorm has raged most fiercely. To follow the path of that storm through\nnear four centuries many volumes would be needed, and it will be more\nconvenient to deal with the more general questions in summing up the\ninfluence of Machiavelli as a whole. But the main lines and varying\nfortunes of the long campaign may be indicated. During the period of its\nmanuscript circulation and for a few years after its publication _The\nPrince_ was treated with favour or at worst with indifference, and the\nfirst mutterings were merely personal to the author. He was a scurvy\nknave and turncoat with neither bowels nor conscience, almost\nnegligible. But still men read him, and a change in conditions brought a\nchange in front. He had in _The Prince_, above all in the _Discorsi_,\naccused the Church of having ruined Italy and debauched the world. In\nview of the writer's growing popularity, of the Reformation and the\nPagan Renaissance, such charges could no longer be lightly set aside.\nThe Churchmen opened the main attack. Amongst the leaders was Cardinal\nPole, to whom the practical precepts of _The Prince_ had been\nrecommended in lieu of the dreams of Plato, by Thomas Cromwell, the\n_malleus monachorum_ of Henry VIII. The Catholic attack was purely\ntheological, but before long the Jesuits joined in the cry. Machiavelli\nwas burnt in effigy at Ingoldstadt. He was _subdolus diabolicarum\ncogitationum faber_, and _irrisor et atheos_ to boot. The Pope himself\ngave commissions to unite against him, and his books were placed on the\nIndex, together, it must be admitted, with those of Boccaccio, Erasmus,\nand Savonarola so the company was goodly. But meanwhile, and perhaps in\nconsequence, editions and translations of _The Prince_ multiplied apace.\nThe great figures of the world were absorbed by it. Charles V., his son,\nand his courtiers studied the book. Catherine de Medici brought it to\nFrance. A copy of _The Prince_ was found on the murdered bodies of Henry\nIII. and Henry IV. Richelieu praised it. Sextus V. analysed it in his\nown handwriting. It was read at the English Court; Bacon was steeped in\nit, and quotes or alludes to it constantly. Hobbes and Harrington\nstudied it.\nBut now another change. So then, cried Innocent Gentillet, the Huguenot,\nthe book is a primer of despotism and Rome, and a grammar for bigots and\ntyrants. It doubtless is answerable for the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.\nThe man is a _chien impur_. And in answer to this new huntsman the whole\nProtestant pack crashed in pursuit. Within fifty years of his death _The\nPrince_ and Machiavelli himself had become a legend and a myth, a\nhaunting, discomforting ghost that would not be laid. Machiavellism had\ngrown to be a case of conscience both to Catholic and Protestant, to\nTheologian, Moralist, and Philosopher. In Spain the author, damned in\nFrance for his despotism and popery, was as freshly and freely damned\nfor his civil and religious toleration. In England to the Cavaliers he\nwas an Atheist, to the Roundheads a Jesuit. Christina of Sweden\nannotated him with enthusiasm. Frederick the Great published his\n_Anti-Machiavel_ brimming with indignation, though it is impossible not\nto wonder what would have become of Prussia had not the Prussian king so\nclosely followed in practice the precepts of the Florentine, above all\nperhaps, as Voltaire observed, in the publication of the\n_Anti-Machiavel_ itself. No doubt in the eighteenth century, when\nmonarchy was so firmly established as not to need Machiavelli, kings and\nstatesmen sought to clear kingship of the supposed stain he had\nbesmirched them with. But their reading was as little as their\nmisunderstanding was great, and the Florentine Secretary remained the\nmysterious necromancer. It was left for Rousseau to describe the book of\nthis 'honn\u00eate homme et bon citoyen' as 'le livre des R\u00e9publicains,' and\nfor Napoleon, the greatest of the author's followers if not disciples,\nto draw inspiration and suggestion from his Florentine forerunner and to\njustify the murder of the Due d'Enghien by a quotation from _The\nPrince_. 'Mais apr\u00e8s tout,' he said, 'un homme d'Etat est-il fait pour\n\u00eatre sensible? N'est-ce pas un personnage--compl\u00e8tement excentrique,\ntoujours seul d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, avec le monde de l'autre?' and again 'Jugez\ndone s'il doit s'amuser \u00e0 m\u00e9nager certaines convenances de sentiments si\nimportantes pour le commun des hommes? Peut-il consid\u00e9rer les liens du\nsang, les affections, les pu\u00e9rils m\u00e9nagements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9? Et dans la\nsituation o\u00f9 il se trouve, que d'actions s\u00e9par\u00e9es de l'ensemble et qu'on\nbl\u00e2me, quoiqu'elles doivent contribuer au grand oeuvre que tout le monde\nn'aper\u00e7oit pas? ... Malheureux que vous \u00eates! vous retiendrez vos \u00e9loges\nparce que vous craindrez que le mouvement de cette grande machine ne\nfasse sur vous l'effet de Gulliver, qui, lorsqu'il d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait sa jambe,\n\u00e9crasait les Lilliputiens. Exhortez-vous, devancez le temps, agrandissez\nvotre imagination, regardez de loin, et vous verrez que ces grands\npersonnages que vous croyez violents, cruels, que sais-je? ne sont que\ndes politiques. Ils se connaissent, se jugent mieux que vous, et, quand\nils sont r\u00e9ellement habiles, ils savent se rendre ma\u00eetres de leurs\npassions car ils vont jusqu'\u00e0 en calculer les effets.' Even in his\ncarriage at Waterloo was found a French translation of _The Prince_\nprofusely annotated.\n[Sidenote: The Defence.]\nBut from the first the defence was neither idle nor weak. The assault\nwas on the morals of the man: the fortress held for the ideas of the\nthinker. He does not treat of morals, therefore he is immoral, cried the\nplaintiff. Has he spoken truth or falsehood? Is his word the truth and\nwill his truth prevail? was the rejoinder. In Germany and Italy\nespecially and in France and England in less degree, philosophers and\ncritics have argued and written without stint and without cease. As\nhistory has grown wider and more scientific so has the preponderance of\nopinion leaned to the Florentine's favour.\nIt would be impossible to recapitulate the arguments or even to indicate\nthe varying points of view. And indeed the main hindrance in forming a\njust idea of _The Prince_ is the constant treatment of a single side of\nthe book and the preconceived intent of the critic. Bacon has already\nbeen mentioned. Among later names are Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibnitz. Herder\ngives qualified approval, while Fichte frankly throws down the glove as\n_The Prince's_ champion. 'Da man weiss dass politische Machtfragen nie,\nam wenigsten in einem verderbten Volke, mit den Mitteln der Moral zu\nl\u00f6sen sind, so ist es unverst\u00e4ndig das Buch von F\u00fcrsten zu verschreien.\nMacchiavelli hatte einen Herrscher zu schildern, keinen Klosterbruder.'\nThe last sentence may at least be accepted as a last word by practical\npoliticians. Ranke and Macaulay, and a host of competent Germans and\nItalians have lent their thought and pens to solve the riddle in the\nFlorentine's favour. And lastly, the course of political events in\nEurope have seemed to many the final justification of the teaching of\n_The Prince_. The leaders of the Risorgimento thought that they found in\nletters, 'writ with a stiletto,' not only the inspirations of patriotism\nand the aspirations to unity, but a sure and trusted guide to the\nachievement. Germany recognised in the author a schoolmaster to lead\nthem to unification, and a military instructor to teach them of an Armed\nPeople. Half Europe snatched at the principle of Nationality. For in\n_The Prince_, Machiavelli not only begat ideas but fertilised the ideas\nof others, and whatever the future estimation of the book may be, it\nstands, read or unread, as a most potent, if not as the dominant, factor\nin European politics for four hundred years.\n[Sidenote: The _Discorsi_.]\nThe _Discorsi_, printed in Rome by Blado, 1537, are not included in the\npresent edition, as the first English translation did not appear until\n1680, when almost the entire works of Machiavelli were published by an\nanonymous translator in London. But some account and consideration of\ntheir contents is imperative to any review of the Florentine's political\nthoughts. Such Discorsi and Relazioni were not uncommon at the time. The\nstronger and younger minds of the Renaissance wearied of discussing in\nthe lovely gardens of the Rucellai the ideas of Plato or the allegories\nof Plotinus. The politics of Aristotle had just been intelligibly\ntranslated by Leonardo Bruni (1492). And to-day the young ears and eyes\nof Florence were alert for an impulse to action. They saw glimpses, in\nreopened fields of history, of quarries long grown over where the ore of\npositive politics lay hid. The men who came to-day to the Orti\nOricellarii were men versed in public affairs, men of letters,\nhistorians, poets, living greatly in a great age, with Raphael, Michael\nAngelo, Ariosto, Leonardo going up and down amongst them. Machiavelli\nwas now in fair favour with the Medici, and is described by Strozzi as\n_una persona per sorgere_ (a rising man). He was welcomed into the group\nwith enthusiasm, and there read and discussed the _Discorsi_. Nominally\nmere considerations upon the First Decade of Livy, they rapidly\nencircled all that was known and thought of policy and state-craft, old\nand living.\n[Sidenote: Their Plan.]\nWritten concurrently with _The Prince_, though completed later, the\n_Discorsi_ contain almost the whole of the thoughts and intents of the\nmore famous book, but with a slightly different application. '_The\nPrince_ traces the progress of an ambitious man, the _Discorsi_ the\nprogress of an ambitious people,' is an apt if inadequate criticism.\nMachiavelli was not the first Italian who thought and wrote upon the\nproblems of his time. But he was the first who discussed grave questions\nin modern language. He was the first modern political writer who wrote\nof men and not of man, for the Prince himself is a collective\nindividuality.\n'This must be regarded as a general rule,' is ever in Machiavelli's\nmouth, while Guicciardini finds no value in a general rule, but only in\n'long experience and worthy discretion.' The one treated of policy, the\nother of politics. Guicciardini considered specifically by what methods\nto control and arrange an existing Government. Machiavelli sought to\ncreate a science, which should show how to establish, maintain, and\nhinder the decline of states generally conceived. Even Cavour counted\nthe former as a more practical guide in affairs. But Machiavelli was the\ntheorist of humanity in politics, not the observer only. He\ndistinguished the two orders of research. And, during the Italian\nRenaissance such distinction was supremely necessary. With a crumbled\ntheology, a pagan Pope, amid the wreck of laws and the confusion of\nsocial order, _il sue particolare_ and _virt\u00f9_, individuality and\nability (energy, political genius, prowess, vital force: _virt\u00f9_ is\nimpossible to translate, and only does not mean virtue), were the\ndominating and unrelenting factors of life. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, unlike\nMontesquieu, agreed with Martin Luther that man was bad. It was for both\nthe Wittenberger and the Florentine, in their very separate ways, to\nfound the school and wield the scourge. In the naked and unashamed\ncandour of the time Guicciardini could say that he loathed the Papacy\nand all its works. 'For all that, he adds, 'the preferments I have\nenjoyed, have forced me for my private ends to set my heart upon papal\ngreatness. Were it not for this consideration, I should love Martin\nLuther as my second self.' In the _Discorsi_, Machiavelli bitterly\narraigns the Church as having 'deprived Italians of religion and\nliberty.' He utterly condemns Savonarol\u00e0, yet he could love and learn\nfrom Dante, and might almost have said with Pym, 'The greatest liberty\nof the Kingdom is Religion. Thereby we are freed from spiritual evils,\nand no impositions are so grievous as those that are laid upon the\nsoul.'\n[Sidenote: Religion.]\nThe Florentine postulates religion as an essential element in a strong\nand stable State. Perhaps, with Gibbon, he deemed it useful to the\nMagistrate. But his science is impersonal. He will not tolerate a Church\nthat poaches on his political preserves. Good dogma makes bad politics.\nIt must not tamper with liberty or security. And most certainly, with\nDante, in the _Paradiso_, he would either have transformed or omitted\nthe third Beatitude, that the Meek shall inherit the earth. With such a\ntemperament, Machiavelli must ever keep touch with sanity. It was not\nfor him as for Aristotle to imagine what an ideal State should be, but\nrather to inquire what States actually were and what they might actually\nbecome. He seeks first and foremost 'the use that may be derived from\nhistory in politics'; not from its incidents but from its general\nprinciples. His darling model of a State is to be found where Dante\nfound it, in the Roman Republic. The memory and even the substance of\nDante occur again and again. But Dante's inspiration was spiritual:\nMachiavelli's frankly pagan, and with the latter Fortune takes the place\nof God. Dante did not love the Papacy, but Machiavelli, pointing out how\neven in ancient Rome religion was politic or utilitarian, leads up to\nhis famous attack upon the Roman Church, to which he attributes all the\nshame and losses, political, social, moral, national, that Italy has\nsuffered at her hands. And now for the first time the necessity for\nItalian Unity is laid plainly down, and the Church and its temporal\npower denounced as the central obstacles. In religion itself the\nSecretary saw much merit. 'But when it is an absolute question of the\nwelfare of our country, then justice or injustice, mercy or cruelty,\npraise or ignominy, must be set aside, and we must seek alone whatever\ncourse may preserve the existence and liberty of the state.' Throughout\nthe _Discorsi_, Machiavelli in a looser and more expansive form,\nsuggests, discusses, or re-affirms the ideas of _The Prince_. There is\nthe same absence of judgment on the moral value of individual conduct;\nthe same keen decision of its practical effect as a political act. But\nhere more than in _The Prince_, he deals with the action and conduct of\nthe people. With his passion for personal and contemporary incarnation\nhe finds in the Swiss of his day the Romans of Republican Rome, and\nreiterates the comparison in detail. Feudalism, mercenaries, political\nassociations embodied in Arts and Guilds, the Temporal power of the\nChurch, all these are put away, and in their stead he announces the new\nand daring gospel that for organic unity subjects must be treated as\nequals and not as inferiors. 'Trust the people' is a maxim he repeats\nand enforces again and again. And he does not shrink from, but rather\nurges the corollary, 'Arm the people.' Indeed it were no audacious\nparadox to state the ideal of Machiavelli, though he nominally preferred\na Republic, as a Limited Monarchy, ruling over a Nation in Arms. No\ndoubt he sought, as was natural enough in his day, to construct the\nState from without rather than to guide and encourage its evolution from\nwithin. It seemed to him that, in such an ocean of corruption, Force\n_was_ a remedy and Fraud no sluttish handmaid. 'Vice n'est-ce pas,'\nwrites Montaigne, of such violent acts of Government, 'car il a quitt\u00e9\nsa raison \u00e0 une plus universelle et puissante raison.' Even so the\nPrince and the people could only be justified by results. But the public\nlife is of larger value than the private, and sometimes one man must be\ncrucified for a thousand. Despite all prejudice and make-belief, such a\nrule and practice has obtained from the Assemblies of Athens to the\nParliaments of the twentieth century. But Machiavelli first candidly\nimparted it to the unwilling consciences and brains of men, and it is he\nwho has been the chosen scape-goat to carry the sins of the people. His\nearnestness makes him belie his own precept to keep the name and take\naway the thing. In this, as in a thousand instances, he was not too\ndarkly hidden; he was too plain. 'Machiavelli,' says one who studied the\nFlorentine as hardly another had done, 'Machiavelli hat ges\u00fcndigt, aber\nnoch mehr ist gegen ihn ges\u00fcndigt worden.' Liberty is good, but Unity is\nits only sure foundation. It is the way to the Unity of Government and\nPeople that the thoughts both of _The Prince_ and the _Discorsi_ lead,\nthough the incidents be so nakedly presented as to shock the timorous\nand vex the prurient, the puritan, and the evil thinker. The people must\nobey the State and fight and die for its salvation, and for the Prince\nthe hatred of the subjects is never good, but their love, and the best\nway to gain it is by 'not interrupting the subject in the quiet\nenjoyment of his estate.' Even so bland and gentle a spirit as the poet\nGray cannot but comment, 'I rejoice when I see Machiavelli defended or\nillustrated, who to me appears one of the wisest men that any nation in\nany age hath produced.'\n[Sidenote: The Art of War.]\nThroughout both _The Prince_ and the _Discorsi_ are constant allusions\nto, and often long discussions on, military affairs. The Army profoundly\ninterested Machiavelli both as a primary condition of national existence\nand stability, and also, as he pondered upon the contrast between\nancient Rome and the Florence that he lived in, as a subject fascinating\nin itself. His _Art of War_ was probably published in 1520. Before that\ndate the Florentine Secretary had had some personal touch both with the\ntheory and practice of war. As a responsible official in the camp before\nPisa he had seen both siege work and fighting. Having lost faith in\nmercenary forces he made immense attempts to form a National Militia,\nand was appointed Chancellor of the Nove della Milizia. In Switzerland\nand the Tyrol he had studied army questions. He planned with Pietro\nNavarro the defence of Florence and Prato against Charles V. At Verona\nand Mantua in 1509, he closely studied the famous siege of Padua. From\nbirth to death war and battles raged all about him, and he had personal\nknowledge of the great captains of the Age. Moreover, he saw in Italy\ntroops of every country, of every quality, in every stage of discipline,\nin every manner of formation. His love of ancient Rome led him naturally\nto the study of Livy and Vegetius, and from them with regard to\nformations, to the relative values of infantry and cavalry and other\npoints of tactics, he drew or deduced many conclusions which hold good\nto-day. Indeed a German staff officer has written that in reading the\nFlorentine you think you are listening to a modern theorist of war. But\nfor the theorist of those days a lion stood in the path. The art of war\nwas not excepted from the quick and thorough transformation that all\nearthly and spiritual things were undergoing. Gunpowder, long invented,\nwas being applied. Armour, that, since the beginning, had saved both man\nand horse, had now lost the half of its virtue. The walls of fortresses,\nimpregnable for a thousand years, became as matchwood ramparts. The\nmounted man-at-arms was found with wonder to be no match for the\nlightly-armoured but nimble foot-man. The Swiss were seen to hold their\nown with ease against the knighthood of Austria and Burgundy. The Free\nCompanies lost in value and prestige what they added to their corruption\nand treachery. All these things grew clear to Machiavelli. But his\nalmost fatal misfortune was that he observed and wrote in the mid-moment\nof the transition. He had no faith in fire-arms, and as regards the\nportable fire-arms of those days he was right. After the artillery work\nat Ravenna, Novara, and Marignano it is argued that he should have known\nbetter. But he was present at no great battles, and pike, spear, and\nsword had been the stable weapons of four thousand years. These were\nindeed too simple to be largely modified, and the future of mechanisms\nand explosives no prophet uninspired could foresee. And indeed the\narmament and formation of men were not the main intent of Machiavelli's\nthought. His care in detail, especially in fortifications, of which he\nmade a special study, in encampments, in plans, in calculations, is\nimmense. Nothing is so trivial as to be left inexact.\n[Sidenote: The New Model.]\nBut he centred his observation and imagination on the origin, character,\nand discipline of an army in being. He pictures the horror, waste, and\nfailure of a mercenary system, and lays down the fatal error in Italy of\nseparating civil from military life, converting the latter into a trade.\nIn such a way the soldier grows to a beast, and the citizen to a coward.\nAll this must be changed. The basic idea of this astounding Secretary is\nto form a National Army, furnished by conscription and informed by the\nspirit of the New Model of Cromwell. All able-bodied men between the\nages of seventeen and forty should be drilled on stated days and be kept\nin constant readiness. Once or twice a year each battalion must be\nmobilised and manoeuvred as in time of war. The discipline must be\nconstant and severe. The men must be not only robust and well-trained,\nbut, above all, virtuous, modest, and disposed to any sacrifice for the\npublic good. So imbued should they be with duty and lofty devotion to\ntheir country that though they may rightly deceive the enemy, reward the\nenemy's deserters and employ spies, yet 'an apple tree laden with fruit\nmight stand untouched in the midst of their encampment.' The infantry\nshould far exceed the cavalry, 'since it is by infantry that battles are\nwon.' Secrecy, mobility, and familiarity with the country are to be\nobjects of special care, and positions should be chosen from which\nadvance is safer than retreat. In war this army must be led by one\nsingle leader, and, when peace shines again, they must go back contented\nto their grateful fellow-countrymen and their wonted ways of living. The\nconception and foundation of such a scheme, at such a time, by such a\nman is indeed astounding. He broke with the past and with all\ncontemporary organisations. He forecast the future of military Europe,\nthough his own Italy was the last to win her redemption through his\nplans. 'Taken all in all,' says a German military writer, 'we may\nrecognise Machiavelli in his inspired knowledge of the principles of\nuniversal military discipline as a true prophet and as one of the\nweightiest thinkers in the field of military construction and\nconstitution. He penetrated the essence of military technique with a\nprecision wholly alien to his period, and it is, so to say, a new\npsychological proof of the relationship between the art of war and the\nart of statecraft, that the founder of Modern Politics is also the first\nof modern Military Classics.'\nBut woe to the Florentine Secretary with his thoughts born centuries\nbefore their time. As in _The Prince_, so in the _Art of War_, he closes\nwith a passionate appeal of great sorrow and the smallest ray of hope.\nWhere shall I hope to find the things that I have told of? What is Italy\nto-day? What are the Italians? Enervated, impotent, vile. Wherefore, 'I\nlament mee of nature, the which either ought not to have made mee a\nknower of this, or it ought to have given mee power, to have bene able\nto have executed it: For now beeing olde, I cannot hope to have any\noccasion, to be able so to doo: In consideration whereof, I have bene\nliberall with you who beeing grave young men, may (when the thinges said\nof me shall please you) at due times, in favoure of your Princes, helpe\nthem and counsider them. Wherin I would have you not to be afraied, or\nmistrustfull, because this Province seemes to bee altogether given to\nraise up againe the things deade, as is seene by the perfection that\nPoesie, painting, and writing, is now brought unto: Albeit, as much as\nis looked for of mee, beeing strooken in yeeres, I do mistrust. Where\nsurely, if Fortune had heretofore graunted mee so much state, as\nsuffiseth for a like enterprise, I would not have doubted, but in most\nshort time, to have shewed to the world, how much the auncient orders\navaile: and without peradventure, either I would have increased it with\nglory, or lost it without shame.'\n[Sidenote: _The History of Florence_.]\nIn 1520 Machiavelli was an ageing and disappointed man. He was not\npopular with any party, but the Medici were willing to use him in minor\nmatters if only to secure his adherence. He was commissioned by Giulio\nde Medici to write a history of Florence with an annual allowance of 100\nflorins. In 1525 he completed his task and dedicated the book to its\nbegetter, Pope Clement VII.\nIn the History, as in much of his other work, Machiavelli enriches the\nscience of humanity with a new department. 'He was the first to\ncontemplate the life of a nation in its continuity, to trace the\noperation of political forces through successive generations, to\ncontrast the action of individuals with the evolution of causes over\nwhich they had but little control, and to bring the salient features of\nthe national biography into relief by the suppression of comparatively\nunimportant details.' He found no examples to follow, for Villani with\nall his merits was of a different order. Diarists and chroniclers there\nwere in plenty, and works of the learned men led by Aretino, written in\nLatin and mainly rhetorical. The great work of Guicciardini was not\npublished till years after the Secretary's death. Machiavelli broke away\nfrom the Chronicle or any other existing form. He deliberately applied\nphilosophy to the sequence of facts. He organised civil and political\nhistory. He originally intended to begin his work at the year 1234, the\nyear of the return of Cosimo il Vecchio from exile and of the\nconsolidation of Medicean power on the ground that the earlier periods\nhad been covered by Aretino and Bracciolini. But he speedily recognised\nthat they told of nothing but external wars and business while the heart\nof the history of Florence was left unbared. The work was to do again in\nvery different manner, and in that manner he did it. Throughout he\nmaintains and insistently insinuates his unfailing explanation of the\nmiseries of Italy; the necessity of unity and the evils of the Papacy\nwhich prevents it. In this book dedicated to a Pope he scants nothing of\nhis hatred of the Holy See. For ever he is still seeking the one strong\nman in a blatant land with almost absolute power to punish, pull down,\nand reconstruct on an abiding foundation, for to his clear eyes it is\never the events that are born of the man, and not the man of the events.\nHe was the first to observe that the Ghibellines were not only the\nImperial party but the party of the aristocrats and influential men,\nwhereas the Guelphs were the party not only of the Church but of the\npeople, and he traces the slow but increasing struggle to the triumph of\ndemocracy in the Ordinamenti di Giustizia (1293). But the triumph was\nnot final. The Florentines were 'unable to preserve liberty and could\nnot tolerate slavery.' So the fighting, banishments, bloodshed, cruelty,\ninjustice, began once more. The nobles were in origin Germanic, he\npoints out, the people Latin; so that a racial bitterness gave accent to\ntheir hate. But yet, he adds impartially, when the crushed nobility were\nforced to change their names and no longer dared be heard 'Florence was\nnot only stripped of arms but likewise of all generosity.' It would be\nimpossible to follow the History in detail. The second, seventh and\neighth books are perhaps the most powerful and dramatic. Outside affairs\nand lesser events are lightly touched. But no stories in the world have\nbeen told with more intensity than those of the conspiracies in the\nseventh and eighth books, and none have given a more intimate and\naccurate perception of the modes of thought and feeling at the time. The\nHistory ends with the death of Lorenzo de Medici in 1492. Enough has\nbeen said of its breadth of scope and originality of method. The spirit\nof clear flaming patriotism, of undying hope that will not in the\ndarkest day despair, the plangent appeal to Italy for its own great sake\nto rouse and live, all these are found pre-eminently in the History as\nthey are found wherever Machiavelli speaks from the heart of his heart.\nOf the style a foreigner may not speak. But those who are proper judges\nmaintain that in simplicity and lucidity, vigour, and power, softness,\nelevation, and eloquence, the style of Machiavelli is 'divine,' and\nremains, as that of Dante among the poets, unchallenged and insuperable\namong all writers of Italian prose.\n[Sidenote: Other Works.]\nThough Machiavelli must always stand as a political thinker, an\nhistorian, and a military theorist it would leave an insufficient idea\nof his mental activities were there no short notice of his other\nliterary works. With his passion for incarnating his theories in a\nsingle personality, he wrote the _Life of Castruccio Castracani_, a\npolitico-military romance. His hero was a soldier of fortune born Lucca\nin 1281, and, playing with a free hand, Machiavelli weaves a life of\nadventure and romance in which his constant ideas of war and politics\nrun through and across an almost imaginary tapestry. He seems to have\nintended to illustrate and to popularise his ideals and to attain by a\nstory the many whom his discourses could not reach. In verse Machiavelli\nwas fluent, pungent, and prosaic. The unfinished _Golden Ass_ is merely\nmade of paragraphs of the _Discorsi_ twined into rhymes. And the others\nare little better. Countless pamphlets, essays, and descriptions may be\nsearched without total waste by the very curious and the very leisurely.\nThe many despatches and multitudinous private letters tell the story\nboth of his life and his mind. But the short but famous _Novella di\nBelfagor Arcidiavolo_ is excellent in wit, satire, and invention. As a\nplaywright he wrote, among many lesser efforts, one supreme comedy,\n_Mandragola_, which Macaulay declares to be better than the best of\nGoldoni's plays, and only less excellent than the very best of\nMoli\u00e8re's. Italian critics call it the finest play in Italian. The plot\nis not for nursery reading, but there are tears and laughter and pity\nand anger to furnish forth a copious author, and it has been not ill\nobserved that _Mandragola_ is the comedy of a society of which _The\nPrince_ is the tragedy.\n[Sidenote: The End.]\nIt has been said of the Italians of the Renaissance that with so much of\nunfairness in their policy, there was an extraordinary degree of\nfairness in their intellects. They were as direct in thought as they\nwere tortuous in action and could see no wickedness in deceiving a man\nwhom they intended to destroy. To such a charge--if charge it\nbe--Machiavelli would have willingly owned himself answerable. He\nobserved, in order to know, and he wished to use his knowledge for the\nadvancement of good. To him the means were indifferent, provided only\nthat they were always apt and moderate in accordance with necessity, A\nsurgeon has no room for sentiment: in such an operator pity were a\ncrime. It is his to examine, to probe, to diagnose, flinching at no\nulcer, sparing neither to himself or to his patient. And if he may not\nact, he is to lay down very clearly the reasons which led to his\nconclusions and to state the mode by which life itself may be saved,\ncost what amputation and agony it may. This was Machiavelli's business,\nand he applied his eye, his brains, and his knife with a relentless\npersistence, which, only because it was so faithful, was not called\nheroic. And we know that he suffered in the doing of it and that his\nheart was sore for his patient. But there was no other way. His record\nis clear and shining. He has been accused of no treachery, of no evil\naction. His patriotism for Italy as a fatherland, a dream undreamt by\nany other, never glowed more brightly than when Italy lay low in shame,\nand ruin, and despair. His faith never faltered, his spirit never\nshrank. And the Italy that he saw, through dark bursts of storm, broken\nand sinking, we see to-day riding in the sunny haven where he would have\nher to be.\nHENRY CUST.\nCONTENTS             PAGE\nTHE ARTE OF WARRE       1\nTHE PRINCE            251\nTHE ARTE OF WARRE\nWRITTEN FIRST IN ITALIAN BY\nNICHOLAS MACHIAVELL\nAND SET FORTHE IN ENGLISHE BY\nPETER WHITEHORNE\nSTUDIENT AT GRAIES INNE\nWITH AN ADDICION OF OTHER LIKE\nMARCIALLE FEATES AND EXPERIMENTES\nAS IN A TABLE\nIN THE ENDE OF THE BOOKE\nMAIE APPERE\n1560\n_Menfss. Iulij_.\nTO THE MOSTE\nHIGHE, AND EXCELLENT PRINCES,\nELIZABETH, by the Grace of God, Quene\nof Englande, Fraunce, and Irelande,\ndefender of the faithe, and of the Churche\nof Englande, and Irelande, on yearth\nnext under God, the supreme\nGovernour.\nAlthough commonlie every man, moste worthie and renoumed Soveraine,\nseketh specially to commend and extolle the thing, whereunto he feleth\nhymself naturally bent and inclined, yet al soche parciallitie and\nprivate affection laid aside, it is to bee thought (that for the\ndefence, maintenaunce, and advauncemente of a Kyngdome, or Common weale,\nor for the good and due observacion of peace, and administracion of\nJustice in the same) no one thinge to be more profitable, necessarie, or\nmore honourable, then the knowledge of service in warre, and dedes of\narmes; bicause consideryng the ambicion of the worlde, it is impossible\nfor any realme or dominion, long to continue free in quietnesse and\nsavegarde, where the defence of the sweard is not alwaies in a\nreadinesse. For like as the Grekes, beyng occupied aboute triflyng\nmatters, takyng pleasure in resityng of Comedies, and soche other vain\nthinges, altogether neclecting Marciall feates, gave occasion to Philip\nkyng of Macedonia, father to Alexander the Great, to oppresse and to\nbring theim in servitude, under his subjeccion, even so undoubtedly,\nlibertie will not be kepte, but men shall be troden under foote, and\nbrought to moste horrible miserie and calamitie, if thei givyng theim\nselves to pastymes and pleasure, forssake the juste regarde of their\nowne defence, and savegarde of their countrie, whiche in temporall\nregimente, chiefly consisteth in warlike skilfulnesse. And therefore the\naunciente Capitaines and mightie Conquerours, so longe as thei\nflorished, did devise with moste greate diligence, all maner of waies,\nto bryng their men to the perfect knowledge of what so ever thing\nappertained to the warre: as manifestly appereth by the warlike games,\nwhiche in old time the Princes of Grecia ordained, upon the mount\nOlimpus, and also by thorders and exercises, that the aunciente Romaines\nused in sundrie places, and specially in Campo Martio, and in their\nwonderful sumptuous Theaters, whiche chiefly thei builded to that\npurpose. Whereby thei not onely made their Souldiours so experte, that\nthei obtained with a fewe, in faightyng againste a greate houge\nmultitude of enemies, soche marveilous victories, as in many credible\nHistories are mencioned, but also by the same meanes, their unarmed and\nrascalle people that followed their Campes, gotte soche understandyng in\nthe feates of warre, that thei in the daie of battaile, beeyng lefte\ndestitute of succour, were able without any other help, to set\nthemselves in good order, for their defence againste the enemie, that\nwould seke to hurte theim, and in soche daungerous times, have doen\ntheir countrie so good service, that verie often by their helpe, the\nadversaries have been put to flight, and fieldes moste happely wone. So\nthat thantiquitie estemed nothing more happie in a common weale, then to\nhave in the same many men skilfull in warlike affaires: by meanes\nwhereof, their Empire continually inlarged, and moste wonderfully and\ntriumphantly prospered. For so longe as men for their valiauntnesse,\nwere then rewarded and had in estimacion, glad was he that could finde\noccasion to venter, yea, and spende his life, to benefite his countrie:\nas by the manly actes that Marcus Curcius, Oracius Cocles, and Gaius\nMucius did for the savegarde of Rome and also by other innumerable like\nexamples dooeth plainly appeare. But when through long and continuall\npeace, thei began to bee altogether given to pleasure and delicatenesse,\nlittle regardyng Marciall feates, nor soche as were expert in the\npractise thereof: Their dominions and estates, did not so moche before\nincrease and prospere, as then by soche meanes and oversight, thei\nsodainly fell into decaie and utter ruine. For soche truly is the nature\nand condicion, bothe of peace and warre, that where in governemente,\nthere is not had equalle consideration of them bothe, the one in fine,\ndoeth woorke and induce, the others oblivion and utter abholicion.\nWherfore, sith the necessitie of the science of warres is so greate, and\nalso the necessarie use thereof so manifeste, that even Ladie Peace her\nself, doeth in maner from thens crave her chief defence and\npreservacion, and the worthinesse moreover, and honour of the same so\ngreate, that as by prose we see, the perfecte glorie therof, cannot\neasely finde roote, but in the hartes of moste noble couragious and\nmanlike personages, I thought most excellente Princes, I could not\neither to the specialle gratefiyng of your highnesse, the universall\ndelight of all studious gentlemen, or the common utilitie of the publike\nwealth, imploie my labours more profitablie in accomplishyng of my\nduetie and good will, then in settyng foorthe some thing, that might\ninduce to the augmentyng and increase of the knowledge thereof:\ninespecially thexample of your highnes most politike governemente over\nus, givyng plaine testimonie of the wonderfull prudente desire that is\nin you, to have your people instructed in this kinde of service, as well\nfor the better defence of your highnesse, theim selves, and their\ncountrie, as also to discourage thereby, and to be able to resist the\nmalingnitie of the enemie, who otherwise would seeke peradventure, to\ninvade this noble realme or kyngdome.\nWhen therfore about x. yeres paste, in the Emperours warres against the\nMores and certain Turkes beyng in Barberie, at the siege and winnyng of\nCalibbia, Monesterio and Africa, I had as well for my further\ninstruction in those affaires, as also the better to acquainte me with\nthe Italian tongue, reduced into Englishe, the booke called The arte of\nWarre, of the famous and excellente Nicholas Machiavell, whiche in times\npaste he beyng a counsailour, and Secretarie of the noble Citee of\nFlorence, not without his greate laude and praise did write: and havyng\nlately againe, somwhat perused the same, the whiche in soche continuall\nbroiles and unquietnesse, was by me translated, I determined with my\nself, by publishyng thereof, to bestowe as greate a gift (sins greater I\nwas not able) emongeste my countrie men, not experte in the Italian\ntongue, as in like woorkes I had seen before me, the Frenchemen,\nDuchemen, Spaniardes, and other forreine nacions, moste lovyngly to have\nbestowed emongeste theirs: The rather undoubtedly, that as by private\nreadyng of the same booke, I then felt my self in that knowledge\nmarveilously holpen and increased, so by communicatyng the same to many,\nour Englishemen findyng out the orderyng and disposyng of exploictes of\nwarre therein contained, the aide and direction of these plaine and\nbriefe preceptes, might no lesse in knowledge of warres become\nincomperable, then in prowes also and exercise of the same, altogether\ninvincible: which my translacion moste gracious Soveraine, together with\nsoche other thynges, as by me hath been gathered, and thought good to\nadde thereunto, I have presumed to dedicate unto youre highnes: not\nonely bicause the whole charge and furniture of warlike counsailes and\npreparacions, being determined by the arbitremente of Governours and\nPrinces, the treatise also of like effecte should in like maner as of\nright, depende upon the protection of a moste worthie and noble\nPatronesse, but also that the discourse it self, and the woorke of a\nforrein aucthour, under the passeport and safeconduite of your highnes\nmoste noble name, might by speciall aucthoritie of the same, winne\nemongest your Majesties subjectes, moche better credite and estimacion.\nAnd if mooste mightie Queen, in this kind of Philosophie (if I maie so\nterme it) grave and sage counsailes, learned and wittie preceptes, or\npolitike and prudente admonicions, ought not to be accompted the least\nand basest tewels of weale publike.

Wherby it\nis often seen, that if any determin in thexercise of that kinde of\nservice to prevaile, that incontinent he doeth not only chaunge in\napparel, but also in custome and maner, in voice, and from the facion of\nall civil use, he doeth alter: For that he thinketh not meete to clothe\nwith civell apparell him, who wil be redie, and promt to all kinde of\nviolence, nor the civell customes, and usages maie that man have, the\nwhiche judgeth bothe those customes to be effeminate, and those usages\nnot to be agreable to his profession: Nor it semes not convenient for\nhim to use the civill gesture and ordinarie wordes, who with fasing and\nblasphemies, will make afraied other menne: the whiche causeth in this\ntime, suche opinion to be moste true. But if thei should consider\nthauncient orders, there should nothing be founde more united, more\nconfirmable, and that of necessitie ought to love so much the one the\nother, as these: for as muche as all the artes that are ordeined in a\ncommon weale, in regarde or respecte of common profite of menne, all the\norders made in the same, to live with feare of the Lawe, and of God\nshould be vaine, if by force of armes their defence wer not prepared,\nwhich, well ordeined, doe maintain those also whiche be not well\nordeined. And likewise to the contrarie the good orders, without the\nsouldiours help, no lesse or otherwise doe disorder, then the habitacion\nof a sumptuous and roiall palais, although it wer decte with gold and\nprecious stones, when without being covered, should not have wherewith\nto defende it from the raine. And if in what so ever other orders of\nCities and Kyngdomes, there hath been used al diligence for to maintain\nmen faithfull, peaceable, and full of the feare of God, in the service\nof warre, it was doubled: if for in what man ought the countrie to seke\ngreater faith, then in him, who must promise to die for the same? In\nwhom ought there to bee more love of peace, then in him, whiche onely by\nthe warre maie be hurte? In whome ought there to bee more feare of GOD,\nthen in him, which every daie committyng himself to infinite perilles,\nhath moste neede of his helpe? This necessitie considered wel, bothe of\nthem that gave the lawes to Empires, and of those that to the exercise\nof service wer apoincted, made that the life of Souldiours, of other\nmenne was praised, and with all studie folowed and imitated. But the\norders of service of war, beyng altogether corrupted, and a greate waie\nfrom the auncient maners altered, there hath growen these sinisterous\nopinions, which maketh men to hate the warlike service, and to flie the\nconversacion of those that dooe exercise it. Albeit I judgeing by the\nsame, that I have seen and redde, that it is not a thyng impossible, to\nbryng it again to the auncient maners, and to give it some facion of the\nvertue passed, I have determined to the entente not to passe this my\nidell time, without doyng some thyng, to write that whiche I doe\nunderstande, to the satisfaction of those, who of aunciente actes, are\nlovers of the science of warre. And although it be a bold thing to\nintreate of the same matter, wher of otherwise I have made no\nprofession, notwithstanding I beleve it is no errour, to occupie with\nwordes a degree, the whiche many with greater presumpcion with their\ndeedes have occupied: for as muche as the errours that I maie happen to\nmake by writing, may be without harme to any man corrected: but those\nthe whiche of them be made in doyng cannot be knowen without the ruine\nof Empires. Therefore Laurence you ought to consider the qualitie of\nthis my laboure, and with your judgement to give it that blame, or that\npraise, as shall seeme unto you it hath deserved. The whiche I sende\nunto you, as well to shewe my selfe gratefull, although my habilitie\nreche not to the benefites, which I have received of you, as also for\nthat beyng the custome to honour with like workes them who for\nnobilitie, riches, wisedome, and liberalitie doe shine: I knowe you for\nriches, and nobilitie, not to have many peeres, for wisedome fewe, and\nfor liberalitie none.\nTHE

OF\nNICHOLAS MACHIAVEL, CITEZEIN\nAND SECRETARIE OF FLORENCE,\nUNTO\nLAURENCE PHILIP STROZZE\nONE OF THE NOBILTIE\nOF FLORENCE.\nTHE FIRST BOOKE\nForasmuch as I beleve that after death, al men maie be praised without\ncharge, al occasion and suspecte of flatterie beyng taken awaie, I shal\nnot doubte to praise our Cosimo Ruchellay, whose name was never\nremembred of me without teares, havyng knowen in him those condicions,\nthe whiche in a good frende or in a citezien, might of his freendes, or\nof his countrie, be desired: for that I doe not knowe what thyng was so\nmuche his, not excepting any thing (saving his soule) which for his\nfrendes willingly of him should not have been spent: I knowe not what\nenterprise should have made him afraide, where the same should have ben\nknowen to have been for the benefite of his countrie. And I doe painly\nconfesse, not to have mette emongest so many men, as I have knowen, and\npractised withal, a man, whose minde was more inflamed then his, unto\ngreat and magnificent thynges. Nor he lamented not with his frendes of\nany thyng at his death, but because he was borne to die a yong manne\nwithin his owne house, before he had gotten honour, and accordynge to\nhis desire, holpen any manne: for that he knewe, that of him coulde not\nbe spoken other, savyng that there should be dead a good freende. Yet it\nresteth not for this, that we, and what so ever other that as we did\nknow him, are not able to testifie (seeyng his woorkes doe not appere)\nof his lawdable qualities. True it is, that fortune was not for al this,\nso muche his enemie, that it left not some brief record of the\nreadinesse of his witte, as doeth declare certaine of his writinges, and\nsettyng foorthe of amorous verses, wherin (although he were not in love)\nyet for that he would not consume time in vain, til unto profounder\nstudies fortune should have brought him, in his youthfull age he\nexercised himselfe. Whereby moste plainly maie be comprehended, with how\nmoche felicitie he did describe his conceiptes, and how moche for\nPoetrie he should have ben estemed, if the same for the ende therof, had\nof him ben exercised. Fortune having therfore deprived us from the use\nof so great a frende, me thinketh there can bee founde no other remedie,\nthen as muche as is possible, to seke to enjoye the memorie of the same,\nand to repeate suche thynges as hath been of him either wittely saied,\nor wisely disputed. And for as much as there is nothyng of him more\nfreshe, then the reasonyng, the whiche in his last daies Signior\nFabricio Collonna, in his orchard had with him, where largely of the\nsame gentilman were disputed matters of warre, bothe wittely and\nprudently, for the moste parte of Cosimo demaunded, I thought good, for\nthat I was present there with certain other of our frendes, to bring it\nto memorie, so that reading the same, the frendes of Cosimo, whiche\nthether came, might renewe in their mindes, the remembraunce of his\nvertue: and the other part beyng sorie for their absence, might partly\nlearne hereby many thynges profitable, not onely to the life of\nSouldiours, but also to civil mennes lives, which gravely of a moste\nwise man was disputed. Therfore I saie, that Fabricio Collonna\nretournyng out of Lombardie, where longe time greatly to his glorie, he\nhad served in the warres the catholike kyng, he determined, passyng by\nFlorence, to rest himself certain daies in the same citee, to visite the\nDukes excellencie, and to see certaine gentilmen, whiche in times paste\nhe had been acquainted withal. For whiche cause, unto Cosimo it was\nthought beste to bid him into his orchard, not so muche to use his\nliberalitee, as to have occasion to talke with him at leasure, and of\nhim to understande and to learne divers thinges, accordyng as of suche a\nman maie bee hoped for, semyng to have accasion to spende a daie in\nreasonyng of suche matters, which to his minde should best satisfie him.\nThen Fabricio came, accordyng to his desire, and was received of Cosimo\ntogether, with certain of his trustie frendes, emongest whome wer Zanoby\nBuondelmonti, Baptiste Palla, and Luigi Allamanni, all young men loved\nof him and of the very same studies moste ardente, whose good qualities,\nfor as muche as every daie, and at every houre thei dooe praise\nthemselves, we will omit. Fabricio was then accordyng to the time and\nplace honoured, of all those honours, that thei could possible devise:\nBut the bankettyng pleasures beyng passed, and the tabel taken up, and\nal preparacion of feastinges consumed, the which are sone at an ende in\nsight of greate men, who to honorable studies have their mindes set, the\ndaie beyng longe, and the heate muche, Cosimo judged for to content\nbetter his desire, that it wer well doen, takyng occasion to avoide the\nheate, to bring him into the moste secret, and shadowest place of his\ngarden. Where thei beyng come, and caused to sit, some upon herbes, some\nin the coldest places, other upon litle seates which there was ordeined,\nunder the shadow of moste high trees, Fabricio praiseth the place, to be\ndelectable, and particularly consideryng the trees, and not knowyng some\nof them, he did stande musinge in his minde, whereof Cosimo beeyng a\nware saied, you have not peradventure ben acquainted with some of these\nsortes of trees: But doe not marvell at it, for as muche as there bee\nsome, that were more estemed of the antiquitie, then thei are commonly\nnow a daies: and he tolde him the names of them, and how Barnardo his\ngraundfather did travaile in suche kinde of plantyng: Fabricio replied,\nI thought it shuld be the same you saie, and this place, and this\nstudie, made me to remember certaine Princes of the Kyngdome of Naples,\nwhiche of these anncient tillage and shadow doe delight. And staiyng\nupon this talke, and somewhat standyng in a studdie, saied moreover, if\nI thought I should not offende, I woud tell my opinion, but I beleeve I\nshall not, commonyng with friendes, and to dispute of thynges, and not\nto condemne them. How much better thei should have doen (be it spoken\nwithout displeasure to any man) to have sought to been like the\nantiquitie in thinges strong, and sharpe, not in the delicate and softe:\nand in those that thei did in the Sunne, not in the shadowe: and to take\nthe true and perfecte maners of the antiquitie: not those that are false\nand corrupted: for that when these studies pleased my Romaines, my\ncountrie fell into ruin. Unto which Cosimo answered. But to avoide the\ntediousnesse to repeate so many times he saied, and the other answered,\nthere shall be onely noted the names of those that speakes, without\nrehersing other.\nThen COSIMO saied, you have opened the waie of a reasoning, which I have\ndesired, and I praie you that you will speake withoute respecte, for\nthat that I without respecte will aske you, and if I demaundyng, or\nrepliyng shall excuse, or accuse any, it shal not be to excuse, or\naccuse, but to understande of you the truth.\nFABRICIO. And I shall be very well contented to tell you that, whiche I\nunderstand of al the same that you shall aske me, the whiche if it shall\nbe true, or no, I wil report me to your judgemente: and I will be glad\nthat you aske me, for that I am to learne, as well of you in askyng me,\nas you of me in aunswerynge you: for as muche as many times a wise\ndemaunder, maketh one to consider many thynges, and to knowe many other,\nwhiche without havyng been demaunded, he should never have knowen.\nCOSIMO. I will retourne to thesame, that you said first, that my\ngraundfather and those your Princes, should have doen more wisely, to\nhave resembled the antiquitie in hard thinges, then in the delicate, and\nI will excuse my parte, for that, the other I shall leave to excuse for\nyou. I doe not beleve that in his tyme was any manne, that so moche\ndetested the livyng in ease, as he did, and that so moche was a lover of\nthe same hardenesse of life, whiche you praise: notwithstandyng he knewe\nnot how to bee able in persone, nor in those of his sonnes to use it,\nbeeyng borne in so corrupte a worlde, where one that would digresse from\nthe common use, should bee infamed and disdained of every man:\nconsideryng that if one in the hottest day of Summer being naked, should\nwallowe hymself upon the Sande, or in Winter in the moste coldest\nmonethes upon the snowe, as Diogenes did, he should be taken as a foole.\nIf one, (as the Spartans were wonte to doe) should nourishe his children\nin a village, makyng them to slepe in the open aire, to go with hedde\nand feete naked, to washe them selves in the colde water for to harden\nthem, to be able to abide moche paine, and for to make theim to love\nlesse life, and to feare lesse death, he should be scorned, and soner\ntaken as a wilde beast, then as a manne. If there wer seen also one, to\nnourishe himself with peason and beanes, and to despise gold, as\nFabricio doeth, he should bee praised of fewe, and followed of none: so\nthat he being afraied of this present maner of livyng, he left\nthauncient facions, and thesame, that he could with lest admiracion\nimitate in the antiquitie, he did.\nFABRICIO. You have excused it in this parte mooste strongly: and surely\nyou saie the truthe: but I did not speake so moche of this harde maner\nof livyng, as of other maners more humaine, and whiche have with the\nlife now a daies greater conformitie. The whiche I doe not beleve, that\nit hath been difficulte to bryng to passe unto one, who is nombred\nemongest Princes of a citee: for the provyng whereof, I will never seke\nother, then thexample of the Romaines. Whose lives, if thei wer well\nconsidred, and thorders of thesame common weale, there should therin be\nseen many thinges, not impossible to induce into a cominaltie, so that\nit had in her any good thing.\nCOSIMO. What thynges are those, that you would induce like unto the\nantiquitie.\nFABRICIO. To honour, and to reward vertue, not to despise povertie, to\nesteme the maners and orders of warfare, to constrain the citezeins to\nlove one an other, to live without sectes, to esteme lesse the private,\nthan the publike, and other like thinges, that easily might bee with\nthis time accompanied: the which maners ar not difficult to bring to\npasse, when a man should wel consider them, and entre therin by due\nmeanes: for asmoche as in thesame, the truth so moche appereth, that\nevery common wit, maie easely perceive it: which thing, who that\nordeineth, doth plant trees, under the shadowe wherof, thei abide more\nhappie, and more pleasantly, then under these shadowes of this goodly\ngardeine.\nCOSIMO. I will not speake any thyng againste thesame that you have\nsaied, but I will leave it to bee judged of these, whom easely can\njudge, and I will tourne my communicacion to you, that is an accusar of\ntheim, the whiche in grave, and greate doynges, are not followers of the\nantiquitie, thinkyng by this waie more easely to be in my entent\nsatisfied. Therfore, I would knowe of you whereof it groweth, that of\nthe one side you condempne those, that in their doynges resemble not the\nantiquitie? Of the other, in the warre, whiche is your art, wherin you\nare judged excellent, it is not seen, that you have indevoured your\nself, to bryng the same to any soche ende, or any thyng at all resembled\ntherein the auncient maners.\nFABRICIO. You are happened upon the poincte, where I loked: for that my\ntalke deserved no other question: nor I desired other: and albeit that I\ncould save my self with an easie excuse, not withstandyng for my more\ncontentacion, and yours, seyng that the season beareth it, I will enter\nin moche longer reasoning. Those men, whiche will enterprise any thyng,\nought firste with all diligence to prepare theim selves, to be ready and\napte when occasion serveth, to accomplish that, which thei have\ndetermined to worke: and for that when the preparacions are made\ncraftely, thei are not knowen, there cannot be accused any man of any\nnegligence, if firste it be not disclosed by thoccasion: in the which\nworking not, is after seen, either that there is not prepared so moche\nas suffiseth, or that there hath not been of any part therof thought\nupon. And for as moche as to me there is not come any occasion to be\nable, to shewe the preparacions made of me, to reduce the servise of\nwarre into his auncient orders, if I have not reduced it, I cannot be of\nyou, nor of other blamed: I beleve this excuse shuld suffise for answere\nto your accusement.\nCOSIMO. It should suffice, when I wer certain, that thoccasion were not\ncome.\nFABRICIO. But for that I know, that you maie doubt whether this occasion\nhath been cum, or no, I will largely (when you with pacience will heare\nme) discourse what preparacions are necessary first to make, what\noccasion muste growe, what difficultie doeth let, that the preparacions\nhelp not, and why thoccasion cannot come, and how these things at ones,\nwhich some contrary endes, is most difficill, and most easie to do.\nCOSIMO. You cannot do bothe to me, and unto these other, a thing more\nthankfull then this. And if to you it shall not be tedious to speake,\nunto us it shal never be grevous to heare: but for asmoch as this\nreasonyng ought to be long, I will with your license take helpe of these\nmy frendes: and thei, and I praie you of one thyng, that is, that you\nwill not bee greved, if some tyme with some question of importaunce, we\ninterrupte you.\n[Sidenote: Why a good man ought never to use the exercise of armes, as\nhis art.]\nFABRICIO. I am moste well contented, that you Cosimo with these other\nyounge men here, doe aske me: for that I beleve, that youthfulnes, will\nmake you lovers of warlike thinges, and more easie to beleve thesame,\nthat of me shalbe saied. These other, by reason of havyng nowe their\nhedde white, and for havyng upon their backes their bloude congeled,\nparte of theim are wonte to bee enemies of warre, parte uncorrectable,\nas those, whom beleve, that tymes, and not the naughtie maners,\nconstraine men to live thus: so that safely aske you all of me, and\nwithout respecte: the whiche I desire, as well, for that it maie be unto\nme a little ease, as also for that I shall have pleasure, not to leave\nin your mynde any doubt. I will begin at your woordes, where you saied\nunto me, that in the warre, that is my arte, I had not indevoured to\nbryng it to any aunciente ende: whereupon I saie, as this beyng an arte,\nwhereby men of no maner of age can live honestly, it cannot bee used for\nan arte, but of a common weale: or of a kyngdome: and the one and the\nother of these, when thei bee well ordeined, will never consente to any\ntheir Citezeins, or Subjectes, to use it for any arte, nor never any\ngood manne doeth exercise it for his particulare arte: for as moche as\ngood he shall never bee judged, whom maketh an excersise thereof, where\npurposing alwaies to gaine thereby, it is requisite for hym to be\nravenyng, deceiptfull, violente, and to have many qualities, the whiche\nof necessitie maketh hym not good: nor those menne cannot, whiche use it\nfor an arte, as well the greate as the leaste, bee made otherwise: for\nthat this arte doeth not nourishe them in peace. Wherfore thei ar\nconstrained either to thinke that there is no peace, or so moche to\nprevaile in the tyme of warre, that in peace thei maie bee able to kepe\nthem selves: and neither of these two thoughtes happeneth in a good man:\nfor that in mindyng to bee able to finde himself at all tymes, dooe\ngrowe robberies, violence, slaughters, whiche soche souldiours make as\nwell to the frendes, as to the enemies: and in mindyng not to have\npeace, there groweth deceiptes, whiche the capitaines use to those,\nwhiche hire them, to the entent the warre maie continue, and yet though\nthe peace come often, it happeneth that the capitaines beyng deprived of\ntheir stipendes, and of their licencious livyng, thei erecte an ansigne\nof adventures, and without any pitie thei put to sacke a province. Have\nnot you in memorie of your affaires, how that beyng many Souldiours in\nItalie without wages, bicause the warre was ended, thei assembled\ntogether many companies, and went taxyng the tounes, and sackyng the\ncountrie, without beyng able to make any remedie? Have you not red, that\nthe Carthagenes souldiours, the first warre beyng ended which thei had\nwith the Romaines, under Matho, and Spendio, twoo capitaines,\nrebelliously constituted of theim, made more perillous warre to the\nCarthaginens, then thesame whiche thei had ended with the Romaines? In\nthe time of our fathers, Frances Sforza, to the entente to bee able to\nlive honourably in the time of peace, not only beguiled the Millenars,\nwhose souldiour he was, but he toke from them their libertie and became\ntheir Prince. Like unto him hath been all the other souldiours of Italie\nwhiche have used warfare, for their particulare arte, and albeeit thei\nhave not through their malignitie becomen Dukes of Milein, so moche the\nmore thei deserve to bee blamed: for that although thei have not gotten\nso moch as he, thei have all (if their lives wer seen) sought to bring\nthe like thynges to passe. Sforza father of Fraunces, constrained Quene\nJone, to caste her self into the armes of the king of Aragon, havyng in\na sodain forsaken her, and in the middest of her enemies, lefte her\ndisarmed, onely to satisfie his ambicion, either in taxyng her, or in\ntakyng from her the Kyngdome. Braccio with the verie same industrie,\nsought to possesse the kyngdome of Naples, and if he had not been\noverthrowen and slaine at Aquila, he had brought it to passe. Like\ndisorders growe not of other, then of soche men as hath been, that use\nthe exercise of warfare, for their proper arte. Have not you a Proverbe,\nwhiche fortefieth my reasons, whiche saieth, that warre maketh Theves,\nand peace hangeth theim up? For as moche as those, whiche knowe not how\nto live of other exercise, and in the same finding not enie man to\nsustayne theym, and havyng not so moche power, to knowe how to reduce\ntheim selves together, to make an open rebellion, they are constrayned\nof necessetie to Robbe in the highe waies, and Justice is enforced to\nextinguishe theim.\nCOSIMO. You have made me to esteme this arte of warfare almoste as\nnothyng, and I have supposed it the moste excellentes, and moste\nhonourableste that hath been used: so that if you declare me it not\nbetter, I cannot remaine satisfied: For that when it is thesame, that\nyou saie, I knowe not, whereof groweth the glorie of Cesar, of Pompei,\nof Scipio, of Marcello, and of so many Romaine Capitaines, whiche by\nfame are celebrated as Goddes.\nFABRICIO. I have not yet made an ende of disputyng al thesame, that I\npurposed to propounde: whiche were twoo thynges, the one, that a good\nmanne could not use this exercise for his arte: the other, that a common\nweale or a kingdome well governed, did never permitte, that their\nSubjectes or Citezeins should use it for an arte. Aboute the firste, I\nhave spoken as moche as hath comen into my mynde: there remaineth in me\nto speake of the seconde where I woll come to aunswere to this your\nlaste question, and I saie that Pompey and Cesar, and almoste all those\nCapitaines, whiche were at Rome, after the laste Carthagenens warre,\ngotte fame as valiaunt men, not as good, and those whiche lived before\nthem, gotte glorie as valiaunte and good menne: the whiche grewe, for\nthat these tooke not the exercise of warre for their arte: and those\nwhiche I named firste, as their arte did use it. And so longe as the\ncommon weale lived unspotted, never any noble Citezein would presume, by\nthe meane of soche exercise, to availe thereby in peace, breakyng the\nlawes, spoilyng the Provinces, usurpyng, and plaiyng the Tyraunte in the\ncountrie, and in every maner prevailyng: nor any of how lowe degree so\never thei were, would goe aboute to violate the Religion, confederatyng\ntheim selves with private men, not to feare the Senate, or to followe\nany tirannicall insolence, for to bee able to live with the arte of\nwarre in all tymes. But those whiche were Capitaines, contented with\ntriumphe, with desire did tourne to their private life, and those whiche\nwere membres, would be more willyng to laie awaie their weapons, then to\ntake them, and every manne tourned to his science, whereby thei gotte\ntheir livyng: Nor there was never any, that would hope with praie, and\nwith this arte, to be able to finde theim selves. Of this there maie be\nmade concernyng Citezeins, moste evidente conjecture, by the ensample of\nRegolo Attillio, who beyng Capitain of the Romaine armies in Affrica,\nand havyng as it wer overcome the Carthegenens, he required of the\nSenate, licence to retourne home, to kepe his possessions, and told\nthem, that thei were marde of his housbandmen. Whereby it is more clere\nthen the Sunne, that if thesame manne had used the warre as his arte,\nand by meanes thereof, had purposed to have made it profitable unto him,\nhavyng in praie so many Provinces, he would not have asked license, to\nreturne to kepe his feldes: for as moche as every daie he might\notherwise, have gotten moche more, then the value of al those\npossessions: but bicause these good men and soche as use not the warre\nfor their arte, will not take of thesame any thing then labour,\nperilles, and gloris, when thei are sufficiently glorious, thei desire\nto returne home, and to live of their owne science. Concernyng menne of\nlowe degree, and common souldiours, to prove that thei kepte the verie\nsame order, it doeth appeare that every one willingly absented theim\nselves from soche exercise, and when thei served not in the warre, thei\nwould have desired to serve, and when thei did serve, thei would have\ndesired leave not to have served: whiche is wel knowen through many\ninsamples, and inespecially seeyng how emonge the firste privileges,\nwhiche the Romaine people gave to their Citezeins was, that thei should\nnot be constrained against their willes, to serve in the warres.\nTherefore Rome so long as it was well governed, whiche was untill the\ncommyng of Graccus, it had not any Souldiour that would take this\nexercise for an arte, and therefore it had fewe naughtie, and those few\nwer severely punished. Then a citee well governed, ought to desire, that\nthis studie of warre, be used in tyme of peace for exercise, and in the\ntime of warre, for necessitie and for glorie: and to suffer onely the\ncommon weale to use it for an arte, as Rome did, and what so ever\nCitezein, that hath in soche exercise other ende, is not good, and what\nso ever citee is governed otherwise, is not well ordeined.\nCOSIMO. I remain contented enough and satisfied of thesame, whiche\nhetherto you have told, and this conclusion pleaseth me verie wel whiche\nyou have made, and as muche as is loked for touching a common welth, I\nbeleve that it is true, but concerning Kinges, I can not tell nowe, for\nthat I woulde beleve that a Kinge would have about him, whome\nparticularly should take suche exercise for his arte.\nFABRICIO. A kingdome well ordred ought moste of all to avoide the like\nkinde of men, for only thei, are the destruction of their king, and all\ntogether ministers of tiranny, and alledge me not to the contrarie anie\npresente kingdome, for that I woll denie you all those to be kingdomes\nwell ordered, bicause the kingdomes whiche have good orders, give not\ntheir absolute Empire unto their king, saving in the armies, for as much\nas in this place only, a quicke deliberation is necessarie, and for this\ncause a principall power ought to be made. In the other affaires, he\nought not to doe any thing without councell, and those are to be feared,\nwhich councell him, leaste he have some aboute him which in time of\npeace desireth to have warre bicause they are not able without the same\nto live, but in this, I wilbe a little more large: neither to seke a\nkingdome altogether good, but like unto those whiche be nowe a daies\nwhere also of a king those ought to be feared, whiche take the warre for\ntheire art, for that the strength of armies without any doubte are the\nfoote menne: so that if a king take not order in suche wise, that his\nmen in time of peace may be content to returne home, and to live of\ntheir owne trades, it will follow of necessitie, that he ruinate: for\nthat there is not found more perilous men, then those, whiche make the\nwarre as their arte: bicause in such case, a king is inforsed either\nalwaies to make warre, or to paie them alwaies, or else to bee in\nperill, that they take not from him his kingdome. To make warre alwaies,\nit is not possible: to paie them alwaies it can not be: see that of\nnecessitie, he runneth in peril to lese the state. The Romaines (as I\nhave saide) so long as they were wise and good, would never permitte,\nthat their Citizeins should take this exercise for their arte, although\nthey were able to nurrishe them therin alwaies, for that that alwaies\nthey made warre: but to avoide thesame hurte, whiche this continuall\nexercise might doe them, seyng the time did not varie, they changed the\nmen, and from time to time toke such order with their legions, that in\nxv. yeres alwaies, they renewed them: and so thei had their men in the\nfloure of their age, that is from xviij. to xxxiij. yeres, in which time\nthe legges, the handes, and the yes answere the one the other, nor thei\ntarried not till there strengthe should decaie, and there naghtines\nincrease, as it did after in the corrupted times. For as muche as\nOctavian first, and after Tiberius, minding more their own proper power,\nthen the publicke profite, began to unarme the Romaine people, to be\nable easely to commaunde them, and to kepe continually those same armies\non the frontries of the Empire: and bicause also they judged those, not\nsufficient to kepe brideled the people and Romaine Senate, they ordeined\nan armie called Pretoriano, which laie harde by the walles of Rome, and\nwas as a rocke on the backe of the same Citie. And for as much as then\nthei began frely to permitte, that suche men as were apoincted in suche\nexercises, should use the service of warre for their arte, streight waie\nthe insolence of theim grewe, that they became fearful unto the Senate,\nand hurtefull to the Emperour, whereby ensued suche harme, that manie\nwere slaine thorough there insolensie: for that they gave, and toke\nawaie the Empire, to whome they thought good. And some while it hapned,\nthat in one self time there were manie Emperours, created of divers\narmies, of whiche thinges proceded first the devision of the Empire, and\nat laste the ruine of the same. Therefore kinges ought, if thei wil live\nsafely, to have there souldiours made of men, who when it is time to\nmake warre, willingly for his love will go to the same, and when the\npeace cometh after, more willingly will returne home. Whiche alwaies\nwilbe, when thei shalbe men that know how to live of other arte then\nthis: and so they ought to desire, peace beyng come, that there Prince\ndoo tourne to governe their people, the gentilmen to the tending of\nthere possessions, and the common souldiours to their particular arte,\nand everie one of these, to make warre to have peace, and not to seke to\ntrouble the peace, to have warre.\nCOSIMO. Truely this reasonyng of yours, I thinke to bee well considered,\nnotwithstanding beyng almost contrarie to that, whiche till nowe I have\nthought, my minde as yet doeth not reste purged of all doubte, for as\nmuche as I see manie Lordes and gentelmen, to finde them selves in time\nof peace, thorough the studies of warre, as your matches bee, who have\nprovision of there princes, and of the cominaltie. I see also, almost al\nthe gentelmen of armes, remaine with neir provision, I see manie\nsouldiours lie in garison of Cities and fortresses, so that my thinkes,\nthat there is place in time of peace, for everie one.\nFABRICIO. I doe not beleve that you beleve this, that in time of peace\neverie man may have place, bicause, put case that there coulde not be\nbrought other reason, the small number, that all they make, whiche\nremaine in the places alledged of you, would answer you. What proporcion\nhave the souldiours, whiche are requiset to bee in the warre with those,\nwhiche in the peace are occupied? For as much as the fortreses, and the\ncities that be warded in time of peace, in the warre are warded muche\nmore, unto whome are joyned the souldiours, whiche kepe in the fielde,\nwhiche are a great number, all whiche in the peace be putte awaie. And\nconcerning the garde of states, whiche are a small number, Pope July,\nand you have shewed to everie man, how muche are to be feared those, who\nwill not learne to exercise any other art, then the warre, and you have\nfor there insolence, deprived them from your garde, and have placed\ntherin Swisers, as men borne and brought up under lawes, and chosen of\nthe cominaltie, according to the true election: so that saie no more,\nthat in peace is place for everie man. Concerning men at armes, thei al\nremaining in peace with their wages, maketh this resolution to seme more\ndifficulte: notwithstandyng who considereth well all, shall finde the\nanswere easie, bicause this manner of keping men of armes, is a\ncorrupted manner and not good, the occasion is, for that they be men,\nwho make thereof an arte, and of them their should grow every daie a\nthousande inconveniencies in the states, where thei should be, if thei\nwere accompanied of sufficient company: but beyng fewe, and not able by\nthem selves to make an armie, they cannot often doe suche grevous\nhurtes, neverthelesse they have done oftentimes: as I have said of\nFrances, and of Sforza his father, and of Braccio of Perugia: so that\nthis use of keping men of armes, I doe not alowe, for it is a corrupte\nmaner, and it may make great inconveniencies.\nCOSIMO. Woulde you live without them? or keping them, how would you kepe\nthem?\n[Sidenote: A kinge that hath about him any that are to much lovers of\nwarre, or to much lovers of peace shal cause him to erre.]\nFABRICIO. By waie of ordinaunce, not like to those of the king of\nFraunce: for as muche as they be perilous, and insolent like unto ours,\nbut I would kepe them like unto those of the auncient Romaines, whom\ncreated their chivalry of their own subjectes, and in peace time, thei\nsente them home unto their houses, to live of their owne trades, as more\nlargely before this reasoning ende, I shal dispute. So that if now this\npart of an armie, can live in such exercise, as wel when it is peace, it\ngroweth of the corrupt order. Concerning the provisions, which are\nreserved to me, and to other capitaines, I saie unto you, that this\nlikewise is an order moste corrupted: for as much as a wise common\nweale, ought not to give such stipendes to any, but rather thei ought to\nuse for Capitaines in the warre, their Citezeins, and in time of peace\nto will, that thei returne to their occupations. Likewise also, a wise\nking either ought not to give to suche, or giving any, the occasion\nought to be either for rewarde of some worthy dede, or else for the\ndesire to kepe suche a kinde of man, as well in peace as in warre. And\nbicause you alledged me, I will make ensample upon my self, and saie\nthat I never used the warre as an arte, for as muche as my arte, is to\ngoverne my subjectes, and to defende them, and to be able to defende\nthem, to love peace, and to know how to make warre, and my kinge not so\nmuche to rewarde and esteeme me, for my knowledge in the warre, as for\nthe knowledge that I have to councel him in peace. Then a king ought not\nto desire to have about him, any that is not of this condicion if he be\nwise, and prudently minde to governe: for that, that if he shal have\nabout him either to muche lovers of peace, or to much lovers of warre,\nthey shall make him to erre. I cannot in this my firste reasoning, and\naccording to my purpose saie more, and when this suffiseth you not, it\nis mete, you seke of them that may satisfie you better. You maie now\nverie well understand, how difficulte it is to bringe in use the\nauncient maners in the presente warres, and what preparations are mete\nfor a wise man to make, and what occasions ought to be loked for, to be\nable to execute it. But by and by, you shall know these things better,\nif this reasoning make you not werie, conferring what so ever partes of\nthe auncient orders hath ben, to the maners nowe presente.\nCOSIMO. If we desired at the first to here your reason of these thinges,\ntruly thesame whiche hetherto you have spoken, hath doubled our desire:\nwherefore we thanke you for that we have hard, and the rest, we crave of\nyou to here.\nFABRICIO. Seyng that it is so your pleasure, I will begin to intreate of\nthis matter from the beginning, to the intent it maye be better\nunderstode, being able by thesame meane, more largely to declare it. The\nende of him that wil make warre, is to be able to fight with every enemy\nin the fielde and to be able to overcum an armie. To purpose to doe\nthis, it is convenient to ordeine an hoost. To ordein an hoost, their\nmust be found menne, armed, ordered, and as well in the small, as in the\ngreat orders exercised, to knowe howe to kepe araie, and to incampe, so\nthat after bringing them unto the enemie, either standing or marching,\nthey maie know how to behave themselves valiantly. In this thing\nconsisteth all the industrie of the warre on the lande, whiche is the\nmost necessarie, and the most honorablest, for he that can wel order a\nfielde against the enemie, the other faultes that he should make in the\naffaires of warre, wilbe borne with: but he that lacketh this knowledge,\nalthough that in other particulars he be verie good, he shal never bring\na warre to honor: for as muche as a fielde that thou winnest, lesing?\nimg 94 doeth cancell all other thy evill actes: so like wise lesing it,\nall thinges well done of thee before, remaine vaine. Therfore, beyng\nnecessarie first to finde the menne, it is requiset to come to the\nchoise of them. They whiche unto the warre have given rule, will that\nthe menne be chosen out of temperate countries, to the intente they may\nhave hardines, and prudence, for as muche as the hote countrey, bredes\nprudente men and not hardy, the colde, hardy, and not prudente. This\nrule is good to be geven, to one that were prince of all the world,\nbicause it is lawfull for him to choose men out of those places, whiche\nhe shall thinke beste. But minding to give a rule, that every one may\nuse, it is mete to declare, that everie common weale, and every\nkingdome, ought to choose their souldiours out of their owne countrie,\nwhether it be hote, colde, or temperate: for that it is scene by olde\nensamples, how that in every countrie with exercise, their is made good\nsouldiours: bicause where nature lacketh, the industry supplieth, the\nwhich in this case is worthe more, then nature, and taking them in other\nplaces, you shal not have of the choise, for choise is as much to saie,\nas the best of a province, and to have power to chuse those that will\nnot, as well as those that wil serve. Wherfore, you muste take your\nchoise in those places, that are subjecte unto you, for that you cannot\ntake whome you liste, in the countries that are not yours, but you muste\ntake suche as will goe with you.\nCOSIMO. Yet there maie bee of those, that will come, taken and lefte,\nand therefore, thei maie be called chosen.\n[Sidenote: Oute of what Countrie is best to chuse Souldiours to make a\ngood election.]\nFABUICIO. You saie the truthe in a certaine maner, but consider the\nfaultes, whiche soche a chosen manne hath in himselfe, for that also\nmany times it hapneth, that he is not a chosen manne. For those that are\nnot thy subjectes, and whiche willyngly doe serve, are not of the beste,\nbut rather of the worste of a Province, for as moche as if any be\nsclanderous, idell, unruly, without Religion, fugetive from the rule of\ntheir fathers, blasphemours, Dise plaiers, in every condicion evill\nbrought up, bee those, whiche will serve, whose customes cannot be more\ncontrarie, to a true and good servise: Albeit, when there bee offered\nunto you, so many of soche men, as come to above the nomber, that you\nhave appoincted, you maie chuse them: but the matter beyng naught, the\nchoise is not possible to be good: also, many times it chaunceth, that\nthei be not so many, as will make up the nomber, whereof you have nede,\nso that beyng constrained to take them al, it commeth to passe, that\nthei cannot then bee called chosen men, but hired Souldiours. With this\ndisorder the armies of Italie, are made now a daies, and in other\nplaces, except in Almaine, bicause there thei doe not hire any by\ncommaundemente of the Prince, but accordyng to the will of them, that\nare disposed to serve. Then consider now, what maners of those aunciente\narmies, maie bee brought into an armie of men, put together by like\nwaies.\nCOSIMO. What waie ought to bee used then?\nFABRICIO. The same waie that I saied, to chuse them of their owne\nsubjectes, and with the auethoritie of the Prince.\nCOSMO. In the chosen, shall there bee likewise brought in any auncient\nfacion?\nFABRICIO. You know well enough that ye: when he that should commaunde\ntheim, were their Prince, or ordinarie lorde, whether he were made\nchief, or as a Citezein, and for the same tyme Capitaine, beyng a common\nweale, otherwise it is harde to make any thyng good.\nCOSIMO. Why?\nFABRICIO. I will tell you a nane: For this time I will that this suffise\nyou, that it cannot be wrought well by other waie.\n[Sidenote: Whether it be better to take menne oute of townes or out of\nthe countrie to serve.]\nCOSIMO. Having then to make this choyse of men in their owne countries,\nwhether judge you that it be better to take them oute of the citie, or\nout of the countrie?\nFABRICIO. Those that have written of such matters, doe all agree, that\nit is best to chuse them out of the countrie, being men accustomed to no\nease, nurished in labours, used to stonde in the sunne, to flie the\nshadow, knowing how to occupy the spade, to make a diche, to carrie a\nburden, and to bee without any deceite, and without malisiousnes. But in\nthis parte my opinion should be, that beyng two sortes of souldiours, on\nfoote, and on horsebacke, that those on foote, should be chosen out of\nthe countrie, and those on horseback, oute of the Cities.\n[Sidenote: Of what age Souldiours ought to bee chosen.]\nCOSIMO. Of what age would you choose them?\nFABRICIO. I would take them, when I had to make a newe armie, from xvii.\nto xl. yeres: when it were made alredy, and I had to restore them, of\nxvii. alwaies.\nCOSIMO. I doe not understonde well this distinction.\nFABRICIO. I shall tell you: when I should ordaine an hooste to make\nwarre, where were no hooste alredy, it should be necessarie to chuse all\nthose men, which were most fitte and apte for the warre, so that they\nwere of servisable age, that I might bee able to instructe theim, as by\nme shalbe declared: but when I would make my choise of menne in places,\nwhere a powre were alredy prepared, for suppliyng of thesame, I would\ntake them of xvii. yeres: for as much as the other of more age be alredy\nchosen and apoincted.\nCOSIMO. Then woulde you prepare a power like to those whiche is in our\ncountrie?\nFABRICIO. Ye truly, it is so that I would arme them, Captaine them,\nexercise and order them in a maner, whiche I cannot tell, if you have\nordred them so.\nCOSIMO. Then do you praise the keping of order?\nFABRICIO. Wherefore would you that I should dispraise it?\nCOSIMO. Bicause many wise menne have alwaies blamed it.\nFABRICIO. You speake against all reason, to saie that a wise man blameth\norder, he maie bee well thought wise, and be nothyng so.\nCOSIMO. The naughtie profe, which it hath alwaies, maketh us to have\nsoche opinion thereof.\nFABRICIO. Take hede it be not your fault, and not the kepyng of order,\nthe whiche you shall knowe, before this reasonyng be ended.\nCOSIMO. You shall doe a thyng moste thankfull, yet I will saie\nconcernyng thesame, that thei accuse it, to the entente you maie the\nbetter justifie it. Thei saie thus, either it is unprofitable, and we\ntrustyng on the same, shall make us to lese our state, or it shall be\nverteous, and by thesame meane, he that governeth may easely deprive us\nthereof. Thei alledge the Romaines, who by meane of their owne powers,\nloste their libertie. Thei alledge the Venicians, and the Frenche king,\nwhiche Venicians, bicause thei will not be constrained, to obeie one of\ntheir owne Citezeins, use the power of straungers: and the Frenche kyng\nhath disarmed his people, to be able more easely to commaunde them, but\nthei whiche like not the ordinaunces, feare moche more the\nunprofitablenesse, that thei suppose maie insue thereby, then any thyng\nels: the one cause whiche thei allege is, bicause thei are unexperte:\nThe other, for that thei have to serve par force: for asmoche as thei\nsaie, that the aged bee not so dissiplinable, nor apte to learne the\nfeate of armes, and that by force, is doen never any thyng good.\n[Sidenote: By what meanes souldiours bee made bolde and experte.]\nFABRICIO. All these reasons that you have rehearsed, be of men, whiche\nknoweth the thyng full little, as I shall plainly declare. And firste,\nconcernyng the unprofitablenesse, I tell you, that there is no service\nused in any countrie more profitable, then the service by the Subjectes\nof thesame nor thesame service cannot bee prepared, but in this maner:\nand for that this nedeth not to be disputed of, I will not lese moche\ntyme: bicause al thensamples of auncient histores, make for my purpose,\nand for that thei alledge the lacke of experience, and to use\nconstraint: I saie how it is true, that the lacke of experience, causeth\nlacke of courage, and constrainte, maketh evill contentacion: but\ncourage, and experience thei are made to gette, with the maner of armyng\ntheim, exercisyng, and orderyng theim, as in proceadyng of this\nreasonyng, you shall heare. But concernyng constrainte, you ought to\nunderstande, that the menne, whiche are conducted to warfare, by\ncommaundement of their Prince, thei ought to come, neither altogether\nforced, nor altogether willyngly, for as moche as to moche willyngnesse,\nwould make thinconveniencies, where I told afore, that he should not be\na chosen manne, and those would be fewe that would go: and so to moche\nconstraint, will bring forth naughtie effectes. Therefore, a meane ought\nto be taken, where is not all constrainte, nor all willingnesse: but\nbeyng drawen of a respecte, that thei have towardes their Prince, where\nthei feare more the displeasure of thesame, then the presente paine: and\nalwaies it shall happen to be a constrainte, in maner mingled with\nwillingnesse, that there cannot growe soche evil contentacion, that it\nmake evill effectes. Yet I saie not for all this, that it cannot bee\novercome, for that full many tymes, were overcome the Romaine armies,\nand the armie of Aniball was overcome, so that it is seen, that an armie\ncannot be ordained so sure, that it cannot be overthrowen. Therefore,\nthese your wise men, ought not to measure this unprofitablenesse, for\nhavyng loste ones, but to beleve, that like as thei lese, so thei maie\nwinne, and remeadie the occasion of the losse: and when thei shall seke\nthis thei shall finde, that it hath not been through faulte of the waie,\nbut of the order, whiche had not his perfeccion and as I have saied,\nthei ought to provide, not with blamyng the order, but with redressing\nit, the whiche how it ought to be doen, you shall understande, from\npoinct to poinct. Concernyng the doubte, leste soche ordinaunces, take\nnot from thee thy state, by meane of one, whiche is made hedde therof, I\nanswere, that the armure on the backes of citezeins, or subjectes, given\nby the disposicion of order and lawe, did never harme, but rather\nalwaies it doeth good, and mainteineth the citee, moche lenger in\nsuretie, through helpe of this armure, then without. Rome continued free\nCCCC. yeres, and was armed. Sparta viii.C. Many other citees have been\ndisarmed, and have remained free, lesse then xl. For as moche as citees\nhave nede of defence, and when thei have no defence of their owne, thei\nhire straungers, and the straunges defence, shall hurte moche soner the\ncommon weale, then their owne: bicause thei be moche easier to be\ncorrupted, and a citezein that becommeth mightie, maie moche soner\nusurpe, and more easely bryng his purpose to passe, where the people bee\ndisarmed, that he seketh to oppresse: besides this, a citee ought to\nfeare a greate deale more, twoo enemies then one. Thesame citee that\nuseth straungers power, feareth at one instant the straunger, whiche it\nhireth, and the Citezein: and whether this feare ought to be, remember\nthesame, whiche I rehearsed a little a fore of Frances Sforza. That\ncitee, whiche useth her own proper power, feareth no man, other then\nonely her owne Citezein. But for all the reasons that maie bee saied,\nthis shall serve me, that never any ordeined any common weale, or\nKyngdome, that would not thinke, that thei theim selves, that inhabite\nthesame, should with their sweardes defende it.\nAnd if the Venicians had been so wise in this, as in all their other\norders, thei should have made a new Monarchie in the world, whom so\nmoche the more deserve blame, havyng been armed of their first giver of\nlawes: for havyng no dominion on the lande, thei wer armed on the sea,\nwhere thei made their warre vertuously, and with weapons in their\nhandes, increased their countrie. But when thei were driven to make\nwarre on the lande, to defende Vicenza, where thei ought to have sent\none of their citezens, to have fought on the lande, thei hired for their\ncapitain, the Marques of Mantua: this was thesame foolishe acte, whiche\ncut of their legges, from climyng into heaven, and from enlargyng their\ndominion: and if thei did it, bicause thei beleved that as thei knewe,\nhow to make warre on the Sea, so thei mistrusted theim selves, to make\nit on the lande, it was a mistruste not wise: for as moche as more\neasely, a capitain of the sea, whiche is used to fight with the windes,\nwith the water, and with men, shall become a Capitaine of the lande,\nwhere he shall fight with men onely, then a capitaine of the lande, to\nbecome a capitain of the sea. The Romanies knowyng how to fight on the\nlande, and on the sea, commyng to warre, with the Carthaginens, whiche\nwere mightie on the sea, hired not Grekes, or Spaniardes, accustomed to\nthe sea, but thei committed thesame care, to their Citezeins, whiche\nthei sent on the land, and thei overcame. If thei did it, for that one\nof their citezeins should not become a tiraunt, it was a feare smally\nconsidered: for that besides thesame reasons, whiche to this purpose, a\nlittle afore I have rehearsed, if a Citezein with the powers on the sea,\nwas never made a tiraunt in a citee standyng in the sea, so moche the\nlesse he should have been able to accomplishe this with the powers of\nthe lande: whereby thei ought to se that the weapons in the handes of\ntheir Citezeins, could not make tirantes: but the naughtie orders of the\ngovernement, whiche maketh tirannie in a citee, and thei havyng good\ngovernement, thei nede not to feare their owne weapons: thei toke\ntherefore an unwise waie, the whiche hath been occasion, to take from\nthem moche glorie, and moche felicitie. Concernyng the erroure, whiche\nthe kyng of Fraunce committeth not kepyng instructed his people in the\nwarre, the whiche those your wise men alledge for ensample, there is no\nman, (his particulare passions laied a side) that doeth not judge this\nfault, to be in thesame kyngdome, and this negligence onely to make hym\nweake. But I have made to greate a digression, and peradventure am come\nout of my purpose, albeit I have doen it to aunswere you, and to shewe\nyou, that in no countrie, there can bee made sure foundacion, for\ndefence in other powers but of their owne subjectes: and their own\npower, cannot be prepared otherwise, then by waie of an ordinaunce, nor\nby other waie, to induce the facion of an armie in any place, nor by\nother meane to ordein an instruction of warfare. If you have red the\norders, whiche those first kynges made in Rome, and inespecially Servio\nTullo, you shall finde that the orders of the Classi is no other, then\nan ordinaunce, to bee able at a sodaine, to bryng together an armie, for\ndefence of thesame citee. But let us retourne to our choise, I saie\nagaine, that havyng to renewe an olde order, I would take them of xvii.\nhavyng to make a newe armie, I would take them of all ages, betwene\nxvii. and xl. to be able to warre straight waie.\n[Sidenote: Of what science soldiours ought to bee chosen.]\nCOSIMO. Would you make any difference, of what science you would chuse\nthem?\nFABRICIO. The aucthours, which have written of the arte of warre, make\ndifference, for that thei will not, that there bee taken Foulers,\nFishers, Cookes, baudes, nor none that use any science of\nvoluptuousnesse. But thei will, that there bee taken Plowmen, Ferrars,\nSmithes, Carpenters, Buchars, Hunters, and soche like: but I would make\nlittle difference, through conjecture of the science, concernyng the\ngoodnesse of the man, notwithstandyng, in as moche as to be able with\nmore profite to use theim, I would make difference, and for this cause,\nthe countrie men, which are used to till the grounde, are more\nprofitable then any other. Next to whom be Smithes, Carpentars, Ferrars,\nMasons, wherof it is profitable to have enough: for that their\noccupacions, serve well in many thynges: beyng a thyng verie good to\nhave a souldiour, of whom maie be had double servise.\n[Sidenote: Howe to chose a souldiour.]\nCOSIMO. Wherby doe thei knowe those, that be, or are not sufficient to\nserve.\nFABRICIO. I will speake of the maner of chusing a new ordinaunce, to\nmake an armie after, for that parte of this matter, doeth come also to\nbe reasoned of, in the election, which should be made for the\nreplenishing, or restoring of an old ordinaunce. I saie therfore, that\nthe goodnesse of one, whiche thou muste chuse for a Souldiour, is knowen\neither by experience, thorough meane of some of his worthy doynges, or\nby conjecture. The proofe of vertue, cannot be founde in men whiche are\nchosen of newe, and whiche never afore have ben chosen, and of these are\nfounde either fewe or none, in the ordinaunce that of newe is ordeined.\nIt is necessarie therefore, lackyng this experience, to runne to the\nconjecture, whiche is taken by the yeres, by the occupacion, and by the\npersonage: of those two first, hath been reasoned, there remaineth to\nspeake of the thirde. And therefore, I saie how some have willed, that\nthe souldiour bee greate, emongest whom was Pirrus. Some other have\nchosen theim onely, by the lustinesse of the body, as Cesar did: whiche\nlustinesse of bodie and mynde, is conjectured by the composicion of the\nmembers, and of the grace of the countenaunce: and therefore, these that\nwrite saie, that thei would have the iyes lively and cherefull, the\nnecke full of sinowes, the breaste large, the armes full of musculles,\nthe fingers long, little beallie, the flankes rounde, the legges and\nfeete drie: whiche partes are wont alwayes to make a manne nimble and\nstrong, whiche are twoo thynges, that in a souldiour are sought above al\nother. Regarde ought to bee had above all thynges, to his customes, and\nthat in hym bee honestie, and shame: otherwise, there shall bee chosen\nan instrumente of mischief, and a beginnyng of corrupcion: for that\nlette no manne beleve that in the dishoneste educacion, and filthy\nminde, there maie take any vertue, whiche is in any parte laudable. And\nI thinke it not superfluous, but rather I beleve it to bee necessarie,\nto the entente you maie the better understande, the importaunce of this\nchosen, to tell you the maner that the Romaine Consuls, in the beginnyng\nof their rule, observed in the chosing of their Romain legions: in the\nwhiche choise of men, bicause thesame legions were mingled with old\nsouldiours and newe, consideryng the continuall warre thei kepte, thei\nmight in their choise procede, with the experince of the old, and with\nthe conjecture of the newe: and this ought to be noted, that these men\nbe chosen, either to serve incontinently, or to exercise theim\nincontinently, and after to serve when nede should require. But my\nintencion is to shew you, how an armie maie be prepared in the countrie,\nwhere there is no warlike discipline: in which countrie, chosen men\ncannot be had, to use them straight waie, but there, where the custome\nis to levie armies, and by meane of the Prince, thei maie then well bee\nhad, as the Romaines observed, and as is observed at this daie emong the\nSuisers: bicause in these chosen, though there be many newe menne, there\nbe also so many of the other olde Souldiours, accustomed to serve in the\nwarlike orders, where the newe mingled together with the olde, make a\nbodie united and good, notwithstanding, that themperours after,\nbeginning the staciones of ordinarie Souldiours, had appoincted over the\nnewe souldiours, whiche were called tironi, a maister to exercise theim,\nas appeareth in the life of Massimo the Emperour. The whiche thyng,\nwhile Rome was free, not onely in the armies, but in the citee was\nordeined: and the exercises of warre, beyng accustomed in thesame, where\nthe yong men did exercise, there grewe, that beyng chosen after to goe\ninto warre, thei were so used in the fained exercise of warfare, that\nthei could easely worke in the true: but those Emperours havyng after\nput doune these exercises, thei wer constrained to use the waies, that I\nhave shewed you. Therefore, comyng to the maner of the chosen Romain, I\nsaie that after the Romain Consulles (to whom was appoincted the charge\nof the warre) had taken the rule, myndyng to ordeine their armies, for\nthat it was the custome, that either of them should have twoo Legions of\nRomaine menne, whiche was the strength of their armies, thei created\nxxiiii. Tribunes of warre, and thei appoincted sixe for every Legion,\nwhom did thesame office, whiche those doe now a daies, that we call\nConestables: thei made after to come together, all the Romain men apte\nto beare weapons and thei put the Tribunes of every Legion, seperate the\none from the other. Afterwarde, by lot thei drewe the Tribes, of whiche\nthei had firste to make the chosen, and of thesame Tribe thei chose\nfower of the best, of whiche was chosen one of the Tribunes, of the\nfirst Legion, and of the other three was chosen, one of the Tribunes of\nthe second Legion, of the other two there was chosen one of the Tribunes\nof the third, and the same last fell to the fowerth Legion. After these\niiij, thei chose other fower, of which, first one was chosen of the\nTribunes of the seconde Legion, the seconde of those of the thirde, the\nthirde of those of the fowerth, the fowerth remained to the first.\nAfter, thei chose other fower, the first chose the thirde, the second\nthe fowerth, the thirde the fiveth, the fowerth remained to the seconde:\nand thus thei varied successively, this maner of chosyng, so that the\nelection came to be equall, and the Legions wer gathered together: and\nas afore we saied, this choise might bee made to use straighte waie, for\nthat thei made them of men, of whom a good parte were experiensed in the\nverie warfare in deede, and all in the fained exercised, and thei might\nmake this choise by conjecture, and by experience. But where a power\nmust be ordeined of newe, and for this to chuse them out of hande, this\nchosen cannot be made, saving by conjecture, whiche is taken by\nconsideryng their ages and their likelinesse.\nCOSIMO. I beleve all to be true, as moche as of you hath been spoken:\nbut before that you procede to other reasonyng, I woll aske of you one\nthing, which you have made me to remember: saiyng that the chosen, that\nis to be made where men were not used to warre, ought to be made by\nconjecture: for asmoche as I have heard some men, in many places\ndispraise our ordinaunce, and in especially concernyng the nomber, for\nthat many saie, that there ought to bee taken lesse nomber, whereof is\ngotten this profite, that thei shall be better and better chosen, and\nmen shal not be so moche diseased, so that there maie bee given them\nsome rewarde, whereby thei maie bee more contented, and better bee\ncommaunded, whereof I would understande in this parte your opinion, and\nwhether you love better the greate nomber, than the little, and what\nwaie you would take to chuse theim in the one, and in the other nomber.\nFABRICIO. Without doubte it is better, and more necessary, the great\nnomber, then the little: but to speake more plainly, where there cannot\nbe ordeined a great nomber of men, there cannot be ordeined a perfect\nordinaunce: and I will easely confute all the reasons of them\npropounded. I saie therefore firste, that the lesse nomber where is many\npeople, as is for ensample Tuscane, maketh not that you have better, nor\nthat the chosen be more excellent, for that myndyng in chosing the\nmenne, to judge them by experience, there shall be founde in thesame\ncountrie moste fewe, whom experience should make provable, bothe for\nthat fewe hath been in warre, as also for that of those, mooste fewe\nhave made triall, whereby thei might deserve to bee chosen before the\nother: so that he whiche ought in like places to chuse, it is mete he\nleave a parte the experience, and take them by conjecture. Then being\nbrought likewise into soche necessitie, I would understande, if there\ncome before me twentie young men of good stature, with what rule I ought\nto take, or to leave any: where without doubte, I beleve that every man\nwill confesse, how it is lesse errour to take them al, to arme theim and\nexercise theim, beyng not able to knowe, whiche of theim is beste, and\nto reserve to make after more certaine chosen, when in practisyng theim\nwith exercise, there shall be knowen those of moste spirite, and of\nmoste life: which considered, the chusing in this case a fewe, to have\nthem better, is altogether naught.\nConcernyng diseasing lesse the countrie, and men, I saie that the\nordinaunce, either evill or little that it bee, causeth not any disease,\nfor that this order doeth not take menne from any of their businesse, it\nbindeth them not, that thei cannot go to doe any of their affaires: for\nthat it bindeth them onely in the idell daies, to assemble together, to\nexercise them, the whiche thyng doeth not hurt, neither to the countrie,\nnor to the men, but rather to yong men it shall bryng delite: For that\nwhere vilie on the holy daies thei stande idell in tipplyng houses, thei\nwill go for pleasure to those exercises, for that the handlyng of\nweapons, as it is a goodly spectacle, so unto yong men it is pleasaunt.\nConcernyng to bee able to paie the lesse nomber, and for this to kepe\ntheim more obediente, and more contented, I answere, how there cannot be\nmade an ordinaunce of so fewe, whiche maie be in maner continually\npaied, where thesame paiment of theirs maie satisfie them. As for\nensample, if there were ordeined a power of v. thousande men, for to\npaie them after soche sorte, that it might be thought sufficient, to\ncontent them, it shal bee convenient to give theim at least, ten\nthousaunde crounes the moneth: first, this nomber of men are not able to\nmake an armie, this paie is intolerable to a state, and of the other\nside, it is not sufficiente to kepe men contented, and bounde to be able\nto serve at al times: so that in doyng this, there shall be spent moche,\nand a small power kept, whiche shall not be sufficient to defend thee,\nor to doe any enterprise of thine. If thou shouldest give theim more, or\nshouldest take more, so moche more impossibilitie it should be, for thee\nto paie theim: if thou shouldest give them lesse, or should take lesse,\nso moche the lesse contentacion should be in them, or so moche the lesse\nprofite thei shal bring thee. Therfore, those that reason of makyng an\nordinaunce, and whilest thei tary at home to paie them, thei reason of a\nthing either impossible, or unprofitable, but it is necessarie to paie\nthem, when thei are taken up to be led to the warre: albeit, though\nsoche order should somewhat disease those, in time of peace, that are\nappoincted in thesame, which I se not how, there is for recompence all\nthose benefites, whiche a power brynges, that is ordeined in a countrie:\nfor that without thesame, there is nothyng sure. I conclude, that he\nthat will have the little nomber, to be able to paie them, or for any of\nthe other causes alledged of you, doeth not understande, for that also\nit maketh for my opinion, that every nomber shall deminishe in thy\nhandes, through infinite impedimentes, whiche men have: so that the\nlittle nomber shall tourne to nothing: again havyng thordinaunce greate,\nthou maiest at thy pleasure use fewe of many, besides this, it must\nserve thee in deede, and in reputacion and alwaies the great nomber\nshall give thee moste reputacion. More over, makyng the ordinaunce to\nkepe menne exercised, if thou appoincte a fewe nomber of men in many\ncountries, the handes of men bee so farre a sonder, the one from the\nother, that thou canst not without their moste grevous losse, gather\nthem together to exercise them, and without this exercise, the\nordinaunce is unprofitable, as hereafter shall be declared.\nCOSIMO. It suffiseth upon this my demaunde, that whiche you have saied:\nbut I desire now, that you declare me an other doubt. Thei saie, that\nsoche a multitude of armed men, will make confusion, discension and\ndisorder in the countrie where thei are.\n[Sidenote: How to provid againste soche inconveniences as souldiours\nmaie cause.]\nFABRICIO. This is an other vaine opinion, the cause wherof, I shall tell\nyou: soche as are ordeined to serve in the warres, maie cause disorder\nin twoo maners, either betwene them selves, or against other, whiche\nthinges moste easely maie be withstode, where the order of it self,\nshould not withstande it: for that concernyng the discorde emong theim\nselves, this order taketh it waie, and doeth not nourishe it, for that\nin orderyng them, you give them armour and capitaines. If the countrie\nwhere you ordein them, bee so unapte for the warre, that there are not\narmours emong the men of thesame, and that thei bee so united, that thei\nhave no heddes, this order maketh theim moche fearser against the\nstraunger, but it maketh them not any thyng the more disunited, for that\nmen well ordered, feare the lawe beyng armed, as well as unarmed, nor\nthei can never alter, if the capitaines, which you give them, cause not\nthe alteracion, and the waie to make this, shall be tolde now: but if\nthe countrie where you ordein them, be warlike and disunited, this order\nonely shal be occasion to unite them: bicause this order giveth them\narmours profitable for the warre, and heddes, extinguishers of\ndiscencion: where their owne armours bee unprofitable for the warres,\nand their heddes nourishers of discorde. For that so sone as any in\nthesame countrie is offended, he resorteth by and by to his capitain to\nmake complaint, who for to maintain his reputacion, comforteth hym to\nrevengement not to peace. To the contrary doeth the publike hed, so that\nby this meanes, thoccasion of discorde is taken awaie, and the occasion\nof union is prepared, and the provinces united and effeminated, gette\nutilitie, and maintain union: the disunited and discencious, doe agree,\nand thesame their fearsnesse, which is wont disordinately to worke, is\ntourned into publike utilitie. To minde to have them, to doe no hurt\nagainst other, it ought to bee considered, that thei cannot dooe this,\nexcept by meane of the heddes, whiche governe them. To will that the\nheddes make no disorder, it is necessarie to have care, that thei get\nnot over them to much auctoritie. And you must consider that this\nauctoritie, is gotten either by nature, or by accidente: and as to\nnature, it behoveth to provide, that he which is boren in one place, be\nnot apoincted to the men billed in the same, but be made hedde of those\nplaces, where he hath not any naturall aquaintance: and as to the\naccident, the thing ought to be ordeined in suche maner, that every yere\nthe heddes maie be changed from governement to goverment: for as muche\nas the continuall auctoritie over one sorte of menne, breedeth among\nthem so muche union, that it maie turne easely to the prejudice of the\nPrince: whiche permutations howe profitable they be to those who have\nused theim, and hurtefull to them that have not observed theim, it is\nwell knowen by the kingdome of the Assirians, and by the Empire of the\nRomaines: where is seene, that the same kingdome indured a M. yeres\nwithout tumulte, and without any Civill warre: whiche preceded not of\nother, then of the permutations, whiche from place to place everie yere\nthesame Capitaines made, unto whome were apoincted the charge of the\nArmies. Nor for any other occasion in the Romaine Empire, after the\nbloud of Cesar was extinguished, there grewe so many civill warres,\nbetwene the Capitaines of the hostes, and so many conspiracies of the\nforsaied capitaines against the Emperours, not onely kepyng continually\nstill those capitaines alwayes in one governement. And if in some of\nthose firste Emperoures, of those after, whom helde the Empire with\nreputacion, as Adriane, Marcus, Severus, and soche like, there had been\nso moche foresight, that thei had brought this custome of chaungyng the\ncapitaines in thesame Empire, without doubte it should have made theim\nmore quiete, and more durable: For that the Capitaines should have had\nlesse occasion to make tumultes, the Emperours lesse cause to feare, and\nthe senate in the lackes of the successions, should have had in the\nelection of the Emperour, more aucthoritie, and by consequence should\nhave been better: but the naughtie custome, either for ignoraunce, or\nthrough the little diligence of menne, neither for the wicked, nor good\nensamples, can be taken awaie.\nCOSIMO. I cannot tell, if with my questionyng, I have as it were led you\nout of your order, bicause from the chusyng of men, we be entred into an\nother matter, and if I had not been a little before excused, I should\nthinke to deserve some reprehension.\n[Sidenote: The nomber of horsemen, that the Romanies chose for a Legion,\nand for a Consailes armie.]\nFABRICIO.

I will tell you in convenient\nplace, which shall be when I have told you, how footmen ought to be\narmed, and how a power of men is prepared, for a day of battle.\nTHE SECOND BOOKE\n[Sidenote: Howe the Romaines armed their souldiers and what weapons thei\nused.]\nI beleeve that it is necessarye, men being founde, to arme them, and\nminding to doo this, I suppose that it is a needefull thing to examine,\nwhat armoure the antiquitie used, and of the same to chose the best. The\nRomanes devided their foote men in heavie and lighte armed: Those that\nwere light armed, they called by the name of Veliti: Under this name\nwere understoode all those that threwe with Slinges, shot with\nCrossebowes, cast Dartes, and they used the most parte of them for their\ndefence, to weare on their heade a Murion, with a Targaet on their arme:\nthey fought out of the orders, and farre of from the heavie armed, which\ndid weare a head peece, that came downe to their shoulders, a Corselet,\nwhich with the tases came downe to the knees, and they had the legges\nand armes, covered with greaves, and vambraces, with a targaet on the\nleft arme, a yarde and a halfe long, and three quarters of a yarde\nbrode, whiche had a hoope of Iron upon it, to bee able to sustaine a\nblowe, and an other under, to the intente, that it being driven to the\nearth, it should not breake: for to offende, they had girte on their\nleft flanke a swoorde, the length of a yearde and a naile, on their\nrighte side, a Dagger: they had a darte in every one of their handes,\nthe which they called Pilo, and in the beginning of the fight, they\nthrewe those at the enemie. This was the ordering, and importaunce of\nthe armours of the Romanes, by the which they possessed all the world.\nAnd although some of these ancient writers gave them, besides the\nforesayde weapons, a staffe in their hande like unto a Partasen, I\ncannot tell howe a heavy staff, may of him that holdeth a Targaet be\noccupied: for that to handle it with both hands, the Targaet should bee\nan impediment, and to occupye the same with one hande, there can be done\nno good therewith, by reason of the weightynesse thereof: besides this,\nto faight in the strong, and in the orders with such long kinde of\nweapon, it is unprofitable, except in the first front, where they have\nspace enough, to thrust out all the staffe, which in the orders within,\ncannot be done, for that the nature of the battaile (as in the order of\nthe same, I shall tell you) is continually to throng together, which\nalthough it be an inconvenience, yet in so doing they fear lesse, then\nto stande wide, where the perill is most evident, so that all the\nweapons, which passe in length a yarde and a halfe, in the throng, be\nunprofitable: for that, if a man have the Partasen, and will occupye it\nwith both handes, put case that the Targaet let him not, he can not\nhurte with the same an enemy, whom is upon him, if he take it with one\nhande, to the intent to occupy also the Targaet, being not able to take\nit, but in the middest, there remayneth so much of the staff behind,\nthat those which are behinde him, shall let him to welde it. And whether\nit were true, either that the Romans had not this Partasen, or that\nhaving it, did little good withal, read all the battailes, in the\nhistorye thereof, celebrated of Titus Livius, and you shall see in the\nsame, most seldom times made mencion of Partasens, but rather alwaies he\nsaieth, that the Dartes being thrown, they laid their hands on their\nsweardes. Therefore I will leave this staffe, and observe, concerning\nthe Romanes, the swoorde for to hurte, and for defense the Targaet, with\nthe other armours aforesaide.\n[Sidenote: A brave and a terrible thing to the enemies.]\nThe Greekes did not arme them selves so heavyly, for their defense, as\nthe Romans dyd: but for to offend the enemies, they grounded more on\ntheir staves, then on their swoordes, and in especiallye the Fallangye\nof Macedonia, which used staves, that they called Sarisse, seven yardes\nand a halfe long, with the which they opened the rankes of their\nenemies, and they keept the orders in their Fallangy. And although some\nwriters saie, that they had also the Targaet, I can not tell (by the\nreasons aforesayde) howe the Sarisse and they coulde stande together.\nBesides this, in the battaile that Paulus Emilius made, with Persa king\nof Macedonia, I do not remember, that there is made any mention of\nTargaettes, but only of the Sarisse, and of the difficultie that the\nRomane armie had, to overcome them: so that I conjecture, that a\nMacedonicall Fallange, was no other wise, then is now a dayes a battaile\nof Suizzers, the whiche in their Pikes have all their force, and all\ntheir power. The Romanes did garnish (besides the armours) the footemen\nwith feathers; the whiche thinges makes the fight of an armie to the\nfriendes goodly, to the enemies terrible. The armour of the horsemen, in\nthe same first Romane antiquitie, was a rounde Targaet, and they had\ntheir head armed, and the rest unarmed: They had a swoorde and a staffe,\nwith an Iron head onely before, long and small: whereby it happened,\nthat they were not able to staye the Targaet, and the staffe in the\nincountring broke, and they through being unarmed, were subjecte to\nhurtes: after, in processe of time, they armed them as the footemen,\nalbeit they used the Targaette muche shorter, square, and the staffe\nmore stiffe, and with twoo heades, to the entente, that breaking one of\nthe heades, they mighte prevaile with the other. With these armours as\nwell on foote, as on horsebacke, the Romanes conquered all the worlde,\nand it is to be beleeved, by the fruiet thereof, whiche is seene, that\nthey were the beste appointed armies, that ever were: and Titus Livius\nin his history, doeth testifie verye often, where comming to comparison\nwith the enemies armies, he saieth: But the Romanes, by vertue, by the\nkinde of their armours, and piactise in the service of warre, were\nsuperiours: and therfore I have more particularly reasoned of the\narmours of conquerours, then of the conquered. But nowe mee thikes good,\nto reason onelye of the manner of arming men at this presente. Footemen\nhave for their defence, a breast plate, and for to offende, a launce,\nsixe yardes and three quarters long, which is called a pike, with a\nswoorde on their side, rather rounde at the poinct, then sharpe. This is\nthe ordinarie arming of footemen nowe a dayes, for that fewe there be,\nwhich have their legges armed, and their armes, the heade none, and\nthose fewe, beare insteede of a Pike, a Halberde, the staffe whereof as\nyou know, is twoo yardes and a quarter long, and it hath the Iron made\nlike an axe. Betweene them, they have Harkebutters, the which with the\nviolence of the fire, do the same office, which in olde time the\nslingers did, and the Crosseboweshoters. This maner of arming, was found\nout by the Dutchemen, inespeciallye of Suizzers, whom being poore, and\ndesirous to live free, they were, and be constrayned to fight, with the\nambition of the Princes of Almaine, who being riche, were able to keepe\nhorse, the which the same people could not do for povertye. Wherby it\ngrewe, that being on foote, minding to defende them selves from the\nenemies, that were on horsebacke, it behooveth them to seeke of the\naunciente orders, and to finde weapons, whiche from the furie of horses,\nshould defende them: This necessitie hath made either to be maintayned,\nor to bee founde of them the aunciente orders, without whiche, as everye\nprudente man affirmeth, the footemen is altogether unprofitable.\nTherefore, they tooke for their weapon the Pike, a moste profitable\nweapon, not only to withstande horses, but to overcome them: and the\nDutchemen have by vertue of these weapons, and of these orders, taken\nsuch boldnesse, that XV. or XX. thousande of them, will assault the\ngreatest nomber of horse that maye be: and of this, there hath beene\nexperience enough within this XXV. yeres. And the insamples of their\nvertue hath bene so mightie, grounded upon these weapons, and these\norders, that sence King Charles passed into Italie, everye nation hath\nimitated them: so that the Spanish armies, are become into most great\nreputation.\nCOSIMO. Which maner of arming, do you praise moste, either these\nDutchemens, or the auncient Romanes?\n[Sidenote: Whether the Romanes maner in arming of men, be better then\nthe arming of men, that is used nowe a daies.]\nFABRICIO. The Romane without doubte, and I will tell the commoditie, and\nthe discommoditie of the one, and the other. The Dutche footemen, are\nable to withstande, and overcome the horses: they bee moste speedie to\nmarche, and to be set in araye, being not laden with armours: of the\nother part, they be subjecte to all blowes, both farre of, and at hande:\nbecause they be unarmed, they bee unprofitable unto the battaile on the\nlande, and to everye fighte, where is strong resistaunce. But the\nRomanes withstoode, and overcame the horses, as well as the Dutchemen,\nthey were safe from blowes at hande, and farre of, being covered with\narmours: they were also better able to charge, and better able to\nsustaine charges, having Targaettes: they might more aptly in the preace\nfight with the swoorde, then these with the Pike, and though the\nDutchemen have likewise swoordes, yet being without Targaets, they\nbecome in suche case unprofitable: The Romanes might safelye assault\ntownes, having their bodies cleane covered with armour, and being better\nable to cover themselves with their Targaettes. So that they had no\nother incommoditie, then the waightynesse of their armours, and the pain\nto cary them: the whiche thinges thei overcame, with accustomyng the\nbody to diseases, and with hardenyng it, to bee able to indure labour.\nAnd you knowe, how that in thinges accustomed, men suffer no grief. And\nyou have to understand this, that the footemen maie be constrained, to\nfaight with footemen, and with horse, and alwaies those be unprofitable,\nwhiche cannot either sustain the horses, or beyng able to sustain them,\nhave notwithstandyng neede to feare the footemen, whiche be better\narmed, and better ordeined then thei. Now if you consider the Duchemen,\nand the Romaines, you shall finde in the Duchemen activitie (as we have\nsaid) to overcome the horses, but greate dissavauntage, when thei\nfaighte with menne, ordeined as thei them selves are, and armed as the\nRomaines were: so that there shall be this advauntage more of the one,\nthen of thother, that the Romaines could overcome the men, and the\nhorses, the Duchemen onely the horses.\nCOSIMO. I would desire, that you would come to some more particulare\ninsample, whereby wee maie better understande.\n[Sidenote: An ensample whiche proveth that horsemen with staves, cannot\nprevaile against footemen with Pikes, and what great advauntage the\narmed have, againste the unarmed. The victory of Carminvola against the\nDuchemen.]\nFABRICIO. I saie thus, that you shall finde in many places of our\nhistories, the Romain footemen to have overcome innumerable horses, and\nyou shall never finde, that thei have been overcome of men on foote, for\ndefault that thei have had in their armour, or thorowe the vantage that\nthe enemie hath had in the armours: For that if the maner of their\narmyng, should have had defaulte, it had been necessarie, that there\nshould folowe, the one of these twoo thynges, either that findyng soche,\nas should arme theim better then thei, thei should not have gone still\nforwardes, with their conquestes, or that thei should have taken the\nstraungers maners, and should have left their owne, and for that it\nfolowed not in the one thing, nor in the other, there groweth that ther\nmaie be easely conjectured, that the maner of their armyng, was better\nthen thesame of any other. It is not yet thus happened to the Duchemen,\nfor that naughtie profe, hath ben seen made them, when soever thei have\nchaunsed to faight with men on foote prepared, and as obstinate as thei,\nthe whiche is growen of the vauntage, whiche thesame have incountred in\nthenemies armours. Philip Vicecounte of Milaine, being assaulted of\nxviii. thousande Suizzers, sent against theim the Counte Carminvola,\nwhiche then was his capitaine. He with sixe thousande horse, and a fewe\nfootemen, went to mete with them, and incounteryng theim, he was\nrepulsed with his moste greate losse: wherby Carminvola as a prudente\nman, knewe straight waie the puisaunce of the enemies weapons, and how\nmoche against the horses thei prevailed, and the debilitie of the\nhorses, againste those on foote so appoincted: and gatheryng his men\ntogether again, he went to finde the Suizzers, and so sone as he was\nnere them, he made his men of armes, to a light from their horse, and in\nthesame mane, faightyng with them he slue theim all, excepte three\nthousande: the whiche seyng them selves to consume, without havyng\nreamedy, castyng their weapons to the grounde, yelded.\nCOSIMO. Whereof cometh so moche disavauntage?\n[Sidenote: The battailes when thei are a faightyng, doe throng\ntogether.]\nFABRICIO. I have a little afore tolde you, but seyng that you have not\nunderstoode it, I will rehearse it againe. The Duchemen (as a little\nbefore I saied unto you) as it were unarmed, to defende themselves, have\nto offende, the Pike and the swearde: thei come with these weapons, and\nwith their orders to finde the enemies, whom if thei bee well armed, to\ndefende theim selves, as were the menne of armes of Carminvola, whiche\nmade theim a lighte on foote, thei come with the sweard, and in their\norders to find them, and have no other difficultie, then to come nere to\nthe Suizzers, so that thei maie reche them with the sweard, for that so\nsone as thei have gotten unto them, thei faight safely: for asmoche as\nthe Duch man cannot strike thenemie with the Pike, whom is upon him, for\nthe length of the staffe, wherefore it is conveniente for hym, to put\nthe hande to the sweard, the whiche to hym is unprofitable, he beyng\nunarmed, and havyng against hym an enemie, that is all armed. Whereby he\nthat considereth the vantage, and the disavantage of the one, and of the\nother, shall see, how the unarmed, shall have no maner of remeady, and\nthe overcommyng of the firste faight, and to passe the firste poinctes\nof the Pikes, is not moche difficulte, he that faighteth beyng well\narmed: for that the battailes go (as you shall better understande, when\nI have shewed you, how thei are set together) and incounteryng the one\nthe other, of necessitie thei thrust together, after soche sorte, that\nthei take the one thother by the bosome, and though by the Pikes some\nbee slaine, or overthrowen, those that remain on their feete, be so\nmany, that thei suffice to obtaine the victorie. Hereof it grewe, that\nCarminvola overcame them, with so greate slaughter of the Suizzers, and\nwith little losse of his.\nCOSIMO. Consider that those of Carminvola, were men of armes, whom\nalthough thei wer on foote, thei were covered all with stele, and\ntherefore thei wer able to make the profe thei did: so that me thinkes,\nthat a power ought to be armed as thei, mindyng to make the verie same\nprofe.\nFABRICIO. If you should remember, how I tolde you the Romaines were\narmed, you would not thynke so: for as moche as a manne, that hath the\nhedde covered with Iron, the breaste defended of a Corselet, and of a\nTargaet, the armes and the legges armed, is moche more apt to defende\nhymself from the Pike, and to enter emong them, then a man of armes on\nfoote. I wil give you a little of a late ensample. There wer come out of\nCicelie, into the kyngdome of Naples, a power of Spaniardes, for to go\nto finde Consalvo, who was besieged in Barlet, of the Frenchemen: there\nmade against theim Mounsier de Vhigni, with his menne of armes, and with\naboute fower thousande Duchemen on foote: The Duchemen incountered with\ntheir Pikes lowe, and thei opened the power of the Spaniardes: but those\nbeyng holp, by meane of their bucklers and of the agiletie of their\nbodies, mingled togethers with the Duchemen, so that thei might reche\nthem with the swearde, whereby happened the death, almoste of all theim,\nand the victorie to the Spaniardes. Every man knoweth, how many Duchemen\nwere slaine in the battaile of Ravenna, the whiche happened by the verie\nsame occasion: for that the Spanishe souldiours, got them within a\nswerdes length of the Duche souldiours, and thei had destroied them all,\nif of the Frenche horsemen, the Duchemen on foote, had not been\nsuccored: notwithstandyng, the Spaniardes close together, brought\nthemselves into a safe place. I conclude therefore, that a good power\nought not onely to be able, to withstande the horses, but also not to\nhave fear of menne on foote, the which (as I have many tymes saied)\nprocedeth of the armours, and of the order.\n[Sidenote: How to arme men, and what weapons to appoincte theim, after\nthe Romaine maner, and Duche facion.]\nCOSIMO. Tell therefore, how you would arme them?\nFABRICIO. I would take of the Romaine armours, and of the Duchemennes\nweapons, and I would that the one haulfe, should bee appoincted like the\nRomaines, and the other haulfe like the Duchemen: for that if in sixe\nthousande footemen (as I shall tell you a little hereafter) I should\nhave thre thousande men with Targaettes, after the Romain maner, and two\nthousande Pikes, and a thousand Harkebutters, after the Duche facion,\nthei should sufice me: for that I would place the Pikes, either in the\nfronte of the battaile, or where I should feare moste the horses, and\nthose with the Targaetes and sweardes, shall serve me to make a backe to\nthe Pikes, and to winne the battaile, as I shall shewe you: so that I\nbeleeve, that a power thus ordayned, should overcome at this daye, any\nother power.\nCOSIMO. This which hath beene saide, sufficeth concerning footemen, but\nconcerning horsemen, wee desire to understand which you thinke more\nstronger armed, either ours, or the antiquitie.\n[Sidenote: The victorie of Lucullo, against Tiarane king of Armenia; For\nwhat pupose horsemen be most requisite.]\nFABRICIO. I beleeve that in these daies, having respect to the Saddelles\nbolstered, and to the stiroppes not used of the antiquitie, they stande\nmore stronglye on horsebacke, then in the olde time: I thinke also they\narme them more sure: so that at this daye, a bande of men of armes,\npaysing very muche, commeth to be with more difficultie withstoode, then\nwere the horsemen of old time: notwithstanding for all this, I judge,\nthat there ought not to be made more accompt of horses, then in olde\ntime was made, for that (as afore is sayde) manye times in our dayes,\nthey have with the footemen receyved shame and shall receyve alwayes,\nwhere they incounter, with a power of footemen armed, and ordered, as\nabove hath bene declared. Tigrane king of Armenia, had againste the\narmie of the Romanes, wherof was Capitayne Lucullo, CL. thousande\nhorsemen, amongest the whiche, were many armed, like unto our men of\narmes, which they called Catafratti, and of the other parte, the Romanes\nwere about sixe thousande, with xxv. thousand footemen: so that Tigrane\nseeing the armie of the enemies, saide: these be horses enough for an\nimbassage: notwithstanding, incountering together, he was overthrowen:\nand he that writeth of the same fighte, disprayseth those Catafratti,\ndeclaring them to be unprofitable; for that hee sayeth, because they had\ntheir faces covered, they had muche a doe to see, and to offende the\nenemie, and they falling, being laden with armour coulde not rise up\nagain, nor welde themselves in any maner to prevaile. I say therefore,\nthat those people or kingdomes, whiche shall esteeme more the power of\nhorses, then the power of footemen be alwaies weake, and subjecte to all\nruine, as by Italie hath been seene in our time, the whiche hath beene\ntaken, ruinated, and over run with straungers, through not other fault,\nthen for having taken litle care, of the service on foote, and being\nbrought the souldiours therof, all on horsebacke. Yet there ought to bee\nhad horses, but for seconde, and not for firste foundaion of an armie:\nfor that to make a discovery, to over run and to destroy the enemies\ncountrie, and to keepe troubled and disquieted, the armie of the same,\nand in their armours alwayes, to let them of their victuals, they are\nnecessary, and most profitable: but concerning for the daye of battaile,\nand for the fighte in the fielde, whiche is the importaunce of the\nwarre, and the ende, for which the armies are ordeined, they are more\nmeeter to follow the enemie being discomfited then to do any other thing\nwhich in the same is to be done, and they bee in comparison, to the\nfootemen much inferiour.\nCOSIMO. There is happened unto mee twoo doubtes, the one, where I knowe,\nthat the Parthians dyd not use in the warre, other then horses, and yet\nthey devided the worlde with the Romanes: the other is, that I woulde\nthat you should shewe, howe the horsemen can be withstoode of footemen,\nand wherof groweth the strength of these, and the debilitie of those?\n[Sidenote: The reason why footmen are able to overcome horsemen; How\nfootmen maie save them selves from horsemen; The exercise of Souldiours,\nought to be devided into thre partes; What exercises the auncient common\nweales used to exercise their youth in, and what commoditie insued\nthereby; How the antiquitie, learned their yong soldiours, to handell\ntheir weapons; What thantiquitie estemed moste happie in a common weale;\nMouster Maisters; for thexercisyng of yong men unexperte.]\nFABRICIO. Either I have tolde you, or I minded to tell you, howe that my\nreasoning of the affaires of warre, ought not to passe the boundes of\nEurope: when thus it is, I am not bounde unto you, to make accompte of\nthe same, which is used in Asia, yet I muste saye unto you thus, that\nthe warring of the Parthians, was altogether contrarye, to the same of\nthe Romanes: for as muche as the Parthians, warred all on horsebacke,\nand in the fight, they proceeded confusedlye, and scattered, and it was\na maner of fighte unstable, and full of uncertaintie. The Romanes were\n(it maye be sayde) almoste al on foote, and thei fought close together\nand sure, and thei overcame diversly, the one the other, according to\nthe largenesse, or straightnesse of the situation: for that in this the\nRomaines were superiours, in thesame the Parthians, whom might make\ngreate proofe, with thesame maner of warryng, consideryng the region,\nwhich thei had to defende, the which was moste large: for as moche as it\nhath the sea coaste, distant a thousande miles, the rivers thone from\nthother, twoo or three daies journey, the tounes in like maner and the\ninhabitauntes few: so that a Romaine armie heavie and slowe, by meanes\nof their armoures, and their orders, could not over run it, without\ntheir grevous hurt (those that defended it, being on horsebacke mooste\nexpedite) so that thei were to daie in one place, and to morowe distaunt\nfiftie miles. Hereof it grewe, that the Parthians might prevaile with\ntheir chivalrie onely, bothe to the ruine of the armie of Crassus, and\nto the perill of thesame, of Marcus Antonius: but I (as I have told you)\ndoe not intende in this my reasonyng, to speake of the warfare out of\nEurope, therfore I will stand upon thesame, whiche in times past, the\nRomaines ordained, and the Grekes, and as the Duchemen doe now adaies.\nBut let us se to the other question of yours, where you desire to\nunderstande, what order, or what naturall vertue makes, that the\nfootemen overcome the horsmen. And I saie unto you first that the horses\ncannot go, as the footmen in every place: Thei are slower then the\nfootemen to obeie, when it is requisite to alter the order: for as\nmoche, as if it be nedefull, either goyng forward, to turne backwarde,\nor tournyng backwarde, to go forwarde, or to move themselves standing\nstil, or goyng to stand still, without doubt, the horsemen cannot dooe\nit so redilie as the footemen: the horsemen cannot, being of some\nviolence, disordained, returne in their orders, but with difficultie,\nalthough thesame violence cease, the whiche the footemen dooe moste\neasely and quickly. Besides this, it happeneth many tymes, that a hardie\nmanne shall be upon a vile horse, and a coward upon a good, whereby it\nfoloweth, that this evill matchyng of stomackes, makes disorder. Nor no\nman doeth marvell, that a bande of footemenne, susteineth all violence\nof horse for that a horse is a beaste, that hath sence, and knoweth the\nperilles, and with an ill will, will enter in them: and if you consider,\nwhat force maketh theim go forwarde, and what holdeth them backwarde,\nyou shall se without doubt thesame to be greater, whiche kepeth them\nbacke, then that whiche maketh them go forwardes: For that the spurre\nmaketh theim go forwarde, and of the other side, either the swearde, or\nthe Pike, kepeth theim backe: so that it hath been seen by the olde, and\nby the late experience, a bande of footemen to bee moste safe, ye,\ninvinsible for horses. And if you should argue to this, that the heate,\nwith whiche thei come, maketh theim more furious to incounter who that\nwould withstande them, and lesse to regard the Pike, then the spurre: I\nsaie, that if the horse so disposed, begin to see, that he must run upon\nthe poincte of the Pike, either of himself, he wil refrain the course so\nthat so sone as he shall feele himself pricked, he will stande still\natones, or beeyng come to theim, he will tourne on the right, or on the\nlefte hande. Whereof if you wil make experience, prove to run a horse\nagainst a walle: you shall finde fewe, with what so ever furie he come\nwithall, will strike against it. Cesar havyng in Fraunce, to faighte\nwith the Suizzers, a lighted, and made every manne a light on foote, and\nto avoide from the araies, the horses, as a thyng more meete to flie,\nthen to faight. But notwithstandyng these naturall impedimentes, whiche\nhorses have, thesame Capitaine, whiche leadeth the footemen, ought to\nchuse waies, whiche have for horse, the moste impedimentes that maie\nbee, and seldome tymes it happeneth, but that a manne maie save hymself,\nby the qualitie of the countrie: for that if thou marche on the hilles,\nthe situacion doeth save thee from thesame furie, whereof you doubt,\nthat thei go withail in the plain, fewe plaines be, whiche through the\ntillage or by meanes of the woddes, doe not assure thee: for that every\nhillocke, every bancke, although it be but small, taketh awaie thesame\nheate, and every culture where bee Vines, and other trees, lettes the\nhorses: and if thou come to battaile, the very same lettes happeneth,\nthat chaunceth in marchyng: for as moche as every little impedemente,\nthat the horse hath, abateth his furie. One thyng notwithstandyng, I\nwill not forgette to tell you, how the Romaines estemed so moche their\norders, and trusted so moche to their weapons, that if thei shuld have\nhad, to chuse either so rough a place to save theim selves from horses,\nwhere thei should not have been able, to raunge their orders, or a place\nwhere thei should have nede, to feare more of horses, but ben able to\ndeffende their battaile, alwaies thei toke this, and left that: but\nbicause it is tyme, to passe to the armie, having armed these\nsouldiours, accordyng to the aunciente and newe use, let us see what\nexercises the Romaines caused theim make, before the menne were brought\nto the battaile. Although thei be well chosen, and better armed, thei\nought with moste greate studie be exercised, for that without this\nexercise, there was never any souldiour good: these exercises ought to\nbe devided into three partes, the one, for to harden the bodie, and to\nmake it apte to take paines, and to bee more swifter and more readier,\nthe other, to teach them, how to handell their weapons, the third, for\nto learne them to kepe the orders in the armie, as well in marchyng, as\nin faightyng, and in the incampyng: The whiche be three principall\nactes, that an armie doeth: for asmoche, as if an armie marche, incampe,\nand faight with order, and expertly, the Capitaine leseth not his\nhonoure, although the battaile should have no good ende. Therfore, all\nthauncient common weales, provided these exercises in maner, by custome,\nand by lawe, that there should not be left behinde any part thereof.\nThei exercised then their youth, for to make them swift, in runnyng, to\nmake theim readie, in leapyng, for to make them strong, in throwyng the\nbarre, or in wrestlyng: and these three qualities, be as it were\nnecessarie in souldiours. For that swiftnesse, maketh theim apte to\npossesse places, before the enemie, and to come to them unloked for, and\nat unwares to pursue them, when thei are discomfaicted: the readinesse,\nmaketh theim apte to avoide a blowe, to leape over a diche, to winne a\nbanke: strength, maketh them the better able to beare their armours, to\nincounter the enemie, to withstande a violence. And above all, to make\nthe bodie the more apte to take paines, thei used to beare greate\nburthens, the whiche custome is necessarie: for that in difficulte\nexpedicions it is requisite many tymes, that the souldiour beside his\narmours, beare vitualles for many daies, and if he were not accustomed\nto this labour, he could not dooe it: and without this, there can\nneither bee avoided a perill, nor a victorie gotten with fame.\nConcernyng to learne how to handell the weapons, thei exercised theim,\nin this maner: thei would have the yong menne, to put on armour, whiche\nshould waie twise as moche, as their field armour, and in stede of a\nswearde, thei gave them a cudgell leaded, whiche in comparison of a\nverie swearde in deede, was moste heavie; thei made for every one of\nthem, a poste to be set up in the ground, which should be in height twoo\nyardes and a quarter, and in soche maner, and so strong, that the blowes\nshould not slur nor hurle it doune, against the whiche poste, the yong\nman with a targaet, and with the cudgell, as against an enemie did\nexercise, and some whiles he stroke, as though he would hurte the hedde,\nor the face, somewhile he retired backe, an other while he made\nforewarde: and thei had in this exercise, this advertisment, to make\ntheim apt to cover theim selves, and to hurte the enemie: and havyng the\ncounterfaight armours moste heavy, their ordinarie armours semed after\nunto them more lighter. The Romanies, would that their souldiours should\nhurte with the pricke, and not with the cutte, as well bicause the\npricke is more mortalle, and hath lesse defence, as also to thentent\nthat he that should hurt, might lye the lesse open, and be more apt to\nredouble it, then with cuttes. Dooe not marvaile that these auncient\nmen, should thinke on these small thynges, for that where the\nincounteryng of men is reasoned of, you shall perceive, that every\nlittle vauntage, is of greate importaunce: and I remember you the same,\nwhiche the writers of this declare, rather then I to teache you. The\nantiquitie estemed nothing move happie, in a common weale, then to be in\nthesame, many men exercised in armes: bicause not the shining of\nprecious stones and of golde, maketh that the enemies submit themselves\nunto thee, but onely the fear of the weapons: afterwarde the errours\nwhiche are made in other thynges, maie sometymes be corrected, but those\nwhiche are dooen in the warre, the paine straight waie commyng on,\ncannot be amended. Besides that, the knowlege to faight, maketh men more\nbold, bicause no man feareth to doe that thing, which he thinketh to\nhave learned to dooe. The antiquitie would therefore, that their\nCitezeins should exercise themselves, in all marcial feates, and thei\nmade them to throwe against thesame poste, dartes moche hevier then the\nordinarie: the whiche exercise, besides the makyng men expert in\nthrowyng, maketh also the arme more nimble, and moche stronger. Thei\ntaught them also to shote in the long bowe, to whorle with the sling:\nand to all these thynges, thei appoincted maisters, in soche maner, that\nafter when thei were chosen for to go to the warre, thei were now with\nmynde and disposicion, souldiours. Nor there remained them to learn\nother, then to go in the orders, and to maintain them selves in those,\neither marchyng, or faightyng: The whiche moste easely thei learned,\nmingeling themselves with those, whiche had long tyme served, whereby\nthei knewe how to stande in the orders.\nCOSIMO. What exercises would you cause theim to make at this present?\n[Sidenote: The exercises that souldiers ought to make in these daies;\nThe exercise of swimmyng; Tiber, is a river runnyng through Rome the\nwater wher of will never corrupte; Thexercise of vautyng, and the\ncommoditie thereof; An order that is taken in certain countries,\nconcerning exercises of warre; What knowledge a Souldiour ought to have;\nA Cohorte is a bande of men; Of what nomer and of what kind of armours\nand weapons, a maine battaile ought to bee, and the distributing and\nappoinetyng of thesame; veliti are light armed men; Thecapitaines that\nar appointed to every band of men; Twoo orders observed in an armie; How\na captain muste instructe muste instructe his souldiours how thei ought\nto governe themselves in the battaile.]\nFABRICIO. A good many of those, whiche have been declared, as runnyng,\nand wrestlyng, makyng theim to leape, makyng theim to labour in armours,\nmoche heavier then the ordinarie, making them shoote with Crosse bowes,\nand longe bowes, whereunto I would joyne the harkabus, a newe instrument\n(as you know) verie necessarie, and to these exercises I would use, al\nthe youth of my state, but with greater industrie, and more\nsollicitatenesse thesame parte, whiche I should have alreadie appoincted\nto serve, and alwaies in the idell daies, thei should bee exercised. I\nwould also that thei should learne to swimme, the whiche is a thyng\nverie profitable: for that there be not alwaies bridges over rivers,\nboates be not alwaies readie: so that thy army not knowyng howe to\nswime, remaineth deprived of many commodities: and many occasions to\nwoorke well, is taken awaie. The Romaines for none other cause had\nordained, that the yong men should exercise them selves in Campus\nMartius, then onely, for that havyng Tiber at hande, thei might, beyng\nweried with the exercise on lande, refreshe theim selves in the water,\nand partly in swimmyng, to exercise them selves. I would make also, as\nthe antiquitie, those whiche should serve on horsebacke to exercise, the\nwhiche is moste necessarie, for that besides to know how to ride, thei\nmuste knowe how on horsebacke thei maie prevaile of them selves. And for\nthis thei had ordeined horses of wood, upon the which thei practised, to\nleape by armed, and unarmed, without any helpe, and on every hande: the\nwhiche made, that atones, and at a beck of a capitain, the horsmen were\non foote, and likewise at a token, thei mounted on horsebacke. And soche\nexercises, bothe on foote and on horsebacke, as thei were then easie to\nbee doen, so now thei should not be difficult to thesame common weale,\nor to thesame prince, whiche would cause them to be put in practise of\ntheir yong men. As by experience is seen, in certaine citees of the\nWeste countrie, where is kepte a live like maners with this order. Thei\ndevide all their inhabiters into divers partes: and every parte thei\nname of the kinde of those weapons, that thei use in the warre. And for\nthat thei use Pikes, Halbardes, Bowes, and Harkebuses, thei call them\nPike menne, Halberders, Harkebutters, and Archars: Therefore, it is mete\nfor all the inhabiters to declare, in what orders thei will be\nappoincted in. And for that all men, either for age, or for other\nimpedimentes, be not fitte for the warre, every order maketh a choise of\nmen, and thei call them the sworen, whom in idell daies, be bounde to\nexercise themselves in those weapons, wherof thei be named: and every\nmanne hath his place appoincted hym of the cominaltie, where soche\nexercise ought to be made: and those whiche be of thesame order, but not\nof the sworen, are contributaries with their money, to thesame expenses,\nwhiche in soche exercises be necessarie: therfore thesame that thei doe,\nwe maie doe. But our smal prudence dooeth not suffre us, to take any\ngood waie. Of these exercises there grewe, that the antiquitie had good\nsouldiours, and that now those of the Weste, bee better men then ours:\nfor as moche as the antiquitie exercised them, either at home (as those\ncommon weales doe) or in the armies, as those Emperours did, for\nthoccasions aforesaied: but we, at home will not exercise theim, in\nCampe we cannot, bicause thei are not our subjectes, and for that we are\nnot able to binde them to other exercises then thei them selves liste to\ndoe: the whiche occacion hath made, that firste the armies bee\nneclected, and after, the orders, and that the kyngdomes, and the common\nweales, in especially Italians, live in soche debilitie. But let us\ntourne to our order, and folowyng this matter of exercises, I saie, how\nit suffiseth not to make good armies, for havyng hardened the men, made\nthem strong, swift, and handsome, it is nedefull also, that thei learne\nto stande in the orders, to obeie to signes, to soundes, and to the\nvoice of the capitain: to knowe, standyng, to retire them selves, goyng\nforwardes, bothe faightyng, and marchyng to maintain those: bicause\nwithout this knowlege, withal serious diligence observed, and practised,\nthere was never armie good: and without doubt, the fierce and disordered\nmenne, bee moche more weaker, then the fearfull that are ordered, for\nthat thorder driveth awaie from men feare, the disorder abateth\nfiercenesse. And to the entente you maie the better perceive that,\nwhiche here folowyng shalbe declared, you have to understande, how every\nnation, in the orderyng of their men to the warre, have made in their\nhoste, or in their armie, a principall member, the whiche though thei\nhave varied with the name, thei have little varied with the nomber of\nthe menne: for that thei all have made it, betwene sixe and viii. M.\nmen. This nomber of men was called of the Romaines, a Legion, of Grekes\na Fallange, of Frenchemen Caterva: this verie same in our tyme of the\nSuizzers, whom onely of the auncient warfare, kepe some shadowe, is\ncalled in their tongue that, whiche in ours signifieththe maine\nbattaile. True it is, that every one of them, hath after devided it,\naccordyng to their purposes. Therefore me thinkes beste, that wee\ngrounde our talke, upon this name moste knowen, and after, according to\nthe aunciente, and to the orders now adaies, the beste that is possible\nto ordaine it; and bicause the Romaines devided their Legion, whiche was\nmade betwene five and sixe thousande men, in ten Cohortes, I will that\nwee devide our main battaile, into ten battailes, and that we make it of\nsixe thousande menne on foote, and we will give to every battaile,\nCCCCL. men, of whiche shall be, CCCC. armed with heavie armour, and L.\nwith light armour: the heavie armed, shall be CCC. Targettes with\nsweardes, and shalbe called Target men: and C. with Pikes, whiche shalbe\ncalled ordinarie Pikes: the light armed shalbe, L. men armed with\nHarkabuses, Crosse bowes, and Partisans, and smal Targaettes, and these\nby an aunciente name, were called ordinarie Veliti: all of the ten\nbattailes therefore, comes to have three thousande Targaet men, a\nthousande ordinarie Pikes, CCCC. ordinarie Veliti, all whiche make the\nnomber of fower thousande and five hundred men. And we saied, that we\nwould make the maine battaile of six thousande; therefore there must be\nadded an other thousande, five hundred men, of whiche I will appoinet a\nthousande with Pikes, whom I will call extraordinarie Veliti, and thus\nmy menne should come (as a little before I have saied) to bee made halfe\nof Targaetes, and halfe of Pikes and other weapons. I would appoinete to\neverie battaile, or bande of men, a Conestable, fower Centurions and\nfouretic peticapitaines, and moreover a hedde to the ordinarie Veliti.\nwith five peticapitaines; I would give to the thousande extraordinarie\nPikes, three Conestabelles, ten Centurions, and a hundred\npeticapitaines; to the extraodrinarie Veliti, two Conestabelles, v.\nCenturions, and l. peticapitaines: I would then apoinet a generall hed,\nover all the main battaile: I would that every Conestable should have an\nAnsigne, and a Drum. Thus there should be made a manne battaile of ten\nbattailes, of three thousande Targaet men, of a thousande ordinarie\nPikes, of a thousande extraordinarie of five hundred ordinarie Veliti,\nof five hundred extraordinarie, so there should come to bee sixe\nthousande men, emongeste the whiche there should bee M.D.\npeticapitaines, and moreover, xv. Conestables, with xv. Drummes, and xv.\nAnsignes, lv. Centurions, x. heddes of the ordinarie Veliti, and a\nCapitaine over all the maine battaile with his Asigne and Drume, and I\nhave of purpose repeated this order the oftener, to the intent, that\nafter when I shall shewe you, the maners of orderyng the battailes, and\ntharmies, you should not be confounded: I saie therefore, how that, that\nking, or that common weale, whiche intendeth to ordeine their subjectes\nto armes, ought to appoincte theim with these armoures and weapons, and\nwith these partes, and to make in their countrie so many maine\nbattailes, as it were able: and when thei should have ordained them,\naccording to the forsaid distribucion, minding to exercise them in the\norders, it should suffice to exercise every battaile by it self: and\nalthough the nomber of the men, of every one of them, cannot by it self,\nmake the facion of a juste armie, notwithstandyng, every man maie learne\nto dooe thesame, whiche particularly appertaineth unto hym: for that in\nthe armies, twoo orders is observed, the one, thesame that the men ought\nto doe in every battaile, and the other that, whiche the battaile ought\nto doe after, when it is with the other in an armie. And those men,\nwhiche doe wel the first, mooste easely maie observe the seconde: But\nwithout knowyng thesame, thei can never come to the knowlege of the\nseconde. Then (as I have saied) every one of these battailes, maie by\nthem selves, learne to kepe the orders of the araies, in every qualitie\nof movyng, and of place, and after learne to put them selves togethers,\nto understande the soundes, by meanes wherof in the faight thei are\ncommaunded, to learne to know by that, as the Gallics by the whissell,\nwhat ought to be doen, either to stande still, or to tourne forward, or\nto tourne backwarde or whiche waie to tourne the weapons, and the face:\nso that knowyng how to kepe well the araie, after soche sorte, that\nneither place nor movyng maie disorder them, understandyng well the\ncommaundementes of their heddes, by meanes of the sounde, and knowyng\nquickly, how to retourne into their place, these battailes maie after\neasly (as I have said) beyng brought many together, learne to do that,\nwhiche all the body together, with the other battailes in a juste armie,\nis bounde to dooe. And bicause soche universall practise, is also not to\nbee estemed a little, ones or twise a yere, when there is peace, all the\nmain battaile maie be brought together, to give it the facion of an\nwhole armie, some daies exercisyng theim, as though thei should faight a\nfielde, settyng the fronte, and the sides with their succours in their\nplaces. And bicause a capitaine ordeineth his hoste to the fielde,\neither for coumpte of the enemie he seeth, or for that, of whiche\nwithout seyng he doubteth, he ought to exercise his armie in the one\nmaner, and in the other, and to instructe theim in soche sorte, that\nthei maie knowe how to marche, and to faight, when nede should require,\nthe wyng to his souldiours, how thei should governe theim selves, when\nthei should happen to be assaulted of this, or of that side: and where\nhe ought to instructe theim how to faight againste the enemie, whom thei\nshould see: he must shewe them also, how the faight is begun, and where\nthei ought to retire: being overthrowen, who hath to succeade in their\nplaces, to what signes, to what soundes, to what voices, thei ought to\nobeie, and to practise them in soche wise in the battaile, and with\nfained assaultes, that thei may desire the verie thyng in deede. For\nthat an armie is not made coragious, bicause in thesame be hardie menne,\nbut by reason the orders thereof bee well appoineted: For as moche as if\nI be one of the first faighters, and do knowe, beyng overcome, where I\nmaie retire, and who hath to succeade in my place, I shall alwaies\nfaight with boldnes, seing my succour at hand. If I shall be one of the\nseconde faighters, the first being driven backe, and overthrowen, I\nshall not bee afraied, for that I shall have presuposed that I maie bee,\nand I shall have desire to be thesame, whiche maie give the victory to\nmy maister, and not to bee any of the other. These exercises bee moste\nnecessarie, where an armie is made of newe, and where the old armie is,\nthei bee also necessarie: for that it is also seen, how the Romaines\nknew from their infancie, thorder of their armies, notwithstandyng,\nthose capitaines before thei should come to thenemie, continually did\nexercise them in those. And Josephus in his historie saieth, that the\ncontinuall exercises of the Romaine armies, made that all thesame\nmultitude, whiche folowe the campe for gain, was in the daie of battaile\nprofitable: bicause thei all knewe, how to stande in the orders, and to\nfaight kepyng the same: but in the armies of newe men, whether thou have\nputte theim together, to faight straight waie, or that thou make a power\nto faight, when neede requires, without these exercises, as well of the\nbattailes severally by themselves, as of all the armie, is made nothing:\nwherefore the orders beying necessarie, it is conveniente with double\nindustrie and laboure, to shewe them unto soche as knoweth them not, and\nfor to teache it, many excellent capitaines have travailed, without any\nrespecte.\nCOSIMO. My thinkes that this reasoning, hath sumwhat transported you:\nfor asmoche, as havyng not yet declared the waies, with the whiche the\nbattailes bee exercised, you have reasoned of the whole armie, and of\nthe daie of battaile.\n[Sidenote: The chief importance in the exercisyng of bandes of men;\nThree principall for thorderyng of menne into battaile raie; The manner\nhow to bryng a bande of men into battaile raie after a square facion;\nThe better waie for the ordring of a band of men in battaile raie, after\nthe first facion; How to exercise men, and to take soche order, whereby\na band of men that were by whatsoever chance disordred maye straighte\nwai be brought into order againe; What advertisement ought to bee used\nin tourning about a whole bande of menne, after soche sorte, as though\nit were but one bodie; How to order a band of menne after soche sort\nthat thei maie make their front againste thenemie of whiche flanke thei\nlist; How a band of man oughte to be ordered, when in marchyng thei\nshould bee constrained to faighton their backes.]\nFABRICIO. You saie truth, but surely thoccasion hath been the affection,\nwhiche I beare to these orders, and the grief that I feele, seyng thei\nbe not put in use: notwithstanding, doubt not but that I will tourne to\nthe purpose: as I have saied, the chief importaunce that is in\nthexercise of the battailes, is to knowe how to kepe well the armies:\nand bicause I tolde you that one of these battailes, ought to bee made\nof fower hundred men heavie armed, I wil staie my self upon this nomber.\nThei ought then to be brought into lxxx. rankes, and five to a ranke:\nafterward goyng fast, or softly, to knit them together, and to lose\nthem: the whiche how it is dooen, maie bee shewed better with deedes,\nthen with wordes. Which nedeth not gretly to be taught, for that every\nmanne, whom is practised in servise of warre, knoweth how this order\nprocedeth, whiche is good for no other, then to use the souldiours to\nkeepe the raie: but let us come to putte together one of these\nbattailes, I saie, that there is given them three facions principally,\nthe firste, and the moste profitablest is, to make al massive, and to\ngive it the facion of two squares, the second is, to make it square with\nthe front horned, the thirde is, to make it with a voide space in the\nmiddest: the maner to put men together in the first facion, maie be of\ntwoo sortes, tho together in the first facion, maie be of twoo sortes,\nthone is to double the rankes, that is, to make the seconde ranke enter\ninto the first, the iiii. into the third, the sixt into the fift, and so\nfoorth, so that where there was lxxx. rankes, five to a ranke, thei maie\nbecome xl. rankes, x. to a ranke. Afterward cause theim to double ones\nmore in thesame maner, settyng the one ranke into an other, and so there\nshall remain twentie rankes, twentie men to a ranke: this maketh twoo\nsquares aboute, for as moche as albeit that there bee as many men the\none waie, as in the other, notwithstandyng to wardes the hedde, thei\njoine together, that the one side toucheth the other: but by the other\nwaie, thei be distant the one from the other, at least a yarde and a\nhaulfe, after soche sorte, that the square is moche longer, from the\nbacke to the fronte, then from the one side to thother: and bicause we\nhave at this presente, to speake often of the partes afore, of behinde,\nand of the sides of these battailes, and of all the armie together,\nknowe you, that when I saie either hedde or fronte, I meane the parte\nafore, when I shall saie backe, the part behind, when I shall saie\nflankes, the partes on the sides. The fiftie ordinarie veliti of the\nbattaile, muste not mingle with the other rankes, but so sone as the\nbattaile is facioned, thei shalbe set a long by the flankes therof. The\nother waie to set together the battaile is this, and bicause it is\nbetter then the firste, I will set it before your ives juste, how it\nought to bee ordeined. I beleve that you remember of what nomber of\nmenne, of what heddes it is made, and of what armours thei are armed,\nthen the facion, that this battaile ought to have, is (as I have saied)\nof twentie rankes, twentie men to a ranke, five rankes of Pikes in the\nfront, and fiftene rankes of Targaettes on the backe, twoo Centurions\nstandying in the fronte, twoo behinde on the backe, who shall execute\nthe office of those, whiche the antiquitie called Tergiductori. The\nConestable with the Ansigne, and with the Drumme, shall stande in\nthesame space, that is betwene the five rankes of the Pikes, and the\nfiftene of the Targeaettes. Of the Peticapitaines, there shall stande\none upon every side of the ranckes, so that every one, maie have on his\nside his men, those peticapitaines, whiche shalbe on the left hande, to\nhave their men on the right hand, those Peticapitaines, whiche shall be\non the right hand, to have their menne on the left hande: The fiftie\nVeliti, muste stande a long the flankes, and on the backe of the\nbattaile. To mynde now, that this battaile maie be set together in this\nfacion, the men goyng ordinarily, it is convenient to order them thus.\nMake the men to be brought into lxxx. rankes, five to a ranke, as a\nlittle afore we have said, leavyng the Veliti either at the hedde, or at\nthe taile, so that thei stande out of this order: and it ought to be\nordeined, that every Centurion have behinde his back twentie rankes, and\nto bee nexte behinde every Centurion, five rankes of Pikes, and the\nreste Targaettes. The Conestable shall stande with the Drum, and the\nAnsigne, in thesame space, whiche is betwene the Pikes, and the\nTargaettes of the seconde Centurion, and to occupie the places of three\nTargaette men. Of the Peticapitaines, twentie shall stand on the sides\nof the rankes, of the first Centurion, on the lefte hande, and twentie\nshall stande on the sides of the rankes, of the last Centurion on the\nright hande. And you muste understande, that the Peticapitaine, whiche\nhath to leade the Pikes, ought to have a Pike, and those that leade the\nTargaettes, ought to have like weapons. Then the rankes beyng brought\ninto this order, and mindyng in marchyng, to bryng them into battaile,\nfor to make the hedde, the first Centurion must be caused to stande\nstill, with the firste twentie rankes, and the seconde to proceade\nmarchyng, and tournyng on the right hand, he must go a long the sides of\nthe twentie rankes that stande still, till he come to bee even with the\nother Centurion, where he must also stande still, and the thirde\nCenturion to procede marchyng, likewise tournyng on the right hand, and\na long the sides of the rankes that stande still, must go so farre, that\nhe be even with the other twoo Centurions, and he also standyng still,\nthe other Centurion must folowe with his rankes, likewise tournyng on\nthe right hande, a longe the sides of the rankes that stande still, so\nfarre that he come to the hed of the other, and then to stand still, and\nstraight waie twoo Centurions onely, shall depart from the front, and go\nto the backe of the battaile, the whiche cometh to bee made in thesame\nmaner, and with thesame order juste, as a little afore I have shewed\nyou. The Veliti muste stande a long, by the flankes of thesame,\naccordyng as is disposed in the first waie, whiche waie is called\nredoublyng by right line, this is called redoublyng by flanke: the first\nwaie is more easie, this is with better order, and commeth better to\npasse, and you maie better correcte it, after your owne maner, for that\nin redoublyng by righte line, you muste bee ruled by the nomber, bicause\nfive maketh ten, ten twentie, twentie fourtie, so that with redoublyng\nby right line, you cannot make a hedde of fiftene, nor of five and\ntwentie, nor of thirtie, nor of five and thirtie, but you must go where\nthesame nomber will leade you. And yet it happeneth every daie in\nparticulare affaires, that it is convenient to make the forwarde with\nsixe hundred, or eight hundred men, so that to redouble by right line,\nshould disorder you: therefore this liketh me better: that difficultie\nthat is, ought moste with practise, and with exercise to bee made easie.\nTherefore I saie unto you, how it importeth more then any thyng, to have\nthe souldiours to know how to set themselves in araie quickly, and it is\nnecessarie to keepe theim in this battaile, to exercise theim therin,\nand to make them to go apace, either forward or backward, to passe\nthrough difficulte places, without troublyng thorder: for asmoche as the\nsouldiours, whiche can doe this well, be expert souldiours, and although\nthei have never seen enemies in the face, thei maie be called old\nsouldiours, and contrariwise, those whiche cannot keepe these orders,\nthough thei have been in a thousande warres, thei ought alwaies to be\nreputed new souldiours. This is, concernyng setting them together, when\nthei are marching in small rankes: but beyng set, and after beyng broken\nby some accident or chaunce, whiche groweth either of the situacion, or\nof the enemie, to make that in a sodaine, thei maie come into order\nagaine, this is the importaunce and the difficultie, and where is\nnedefull moche exercise, and moche practise, and wherin the antiquitie\nbestowed moche studie. Therefore it is necessarie to doe twoo thynges,\nfirste to have this battaile full of countersignes, the other, to keepe\nalwaies this order, that those same men maie stand alwaies in the ranke,\nwhich thei were firste placed in: as for insample, if one have begon to\nstande in the seconde, that he stande after alwaie in that, and not\nonely in that self same rancke, but in that self same place: for the\nobservyng whereof (as I have saied) bee necessarie many countersignes.\nIn especially it is requisite, that the Ansigne bee after soche sorte\ncountersigned, that companyng with the other battailes, it maie be\nknowen from theim, accordyng as the Conestable, and the Centurions have\nplumes of fethers in their heddes differente, and easie to be knowen,\nand that whiche importeth moste, is to ordaine that the peticapitaines\nbee knowen. Whereunto the antiquitie had so moche care, that thei would\nhave nothing els written in their hedde peces, but the nomber that thei\nwere named by, callyng them firste, seconde, thirde, and fourthe xc. And\nyet thei were not contented with this, but made every souldiour to have\nwritten in his Targaet, the nomber of the ranke, and the nomber of the\nplace, in whiche ranke he was appoineted. Then the menne being\ncountersigned thus, and used to stande betwene these limites, it is an\neasie thyng, thei beyng disordered, to sett theim all againe quickly\ninto order: considering, that the Ansigne standyng still, the\nCenturions, and the Peticapitaines maie gesse their places by the iye,\nand beyng brought the left of the left, the right of the right, with\ntheir accustomed distance, the souldiours led by their rule, and by the\ndifferences of the cognisances, maie be quickly in their proper places,\nno otherwise, then as if the boordes of a tunne should bee taken a\nsunder, whiche beyng first marked, moste easely maie bee set together\nagain, where thesame beyng not countersigned, were impossible to bryng\ninto order any more. These thynges, with diligence and with exercise,\nare quickely taught, and quickly learned, and beyng learned, with\ndifficultie are forgotten: for that the newe menne, be led of the olde,\nand with tyme, a Province with these exercises, may become throughly\npractised in the war. It is also necessarie to teache theim, to tourne\ntheim selves all at ones, and when neede requires, to make of the\nflankes, and of the backe, the fronte, and of the front, flankes, or\nbacke, whiche is moste easie: bicause it suffiseth that every manne doe\ntourne his bodie, towardes thesame parte that he is commaunded, and\nwhere thei tourne their faces, there the fronte commeth to bee. True it\nis, that when thei tourne to any of the flanckes, the orders tourne out\nof their proporcion: for that from the breast to the backe, there is\nlittle difference, and from the one flancke to the other, there is verie\nmoche distance, the whiche is al contrarie to the ordinarie order of the\nbattaile: therefore it is convenient, that practise, and discrecion, doe\nplace them as thei ought to be: but this is small disorder, for that\nmoste easely by themselves, thei maie remedie it. But that whiche\nimporteth more, and where is requisite more practise, is when a battaile\nwould tourne all at ones, as though it were a whole bodie, here is meete\nto have greate practise, and greate discrecion: bicause mindyng to\ntourne, as for insample on the left hande, the left corner must stande\nstill, and those that be next to hym that standeth still, muste marche\nso softly, that thei that bee in the right corner, nede not to runne:\notherwise all thing should be confounded. But bicause it happeneth\nalwaies, when an armie marcheth from place to place, that the battailes,\nwhiche are not placed in the front, shall be driven to faight not by\nhedde, but either by flancke, or by backe, so that a battaile muste in a\nsodaine make of flancke, or of backe, hedde: and mindyng that like\nbattailes in soche cace, maie have their proporcion, as above is\ndeclared, it is necessarie, that thei have the Pikes on thesame flancke,\nthat ought to be hedde, and the Peticapitaines, Centurions, and\nConestables, to resorte accordyngly to their places. Therefore to mynde\nto dooe this, in plasyng them together, you must ordeine the fower skore\nrankes, of five in a ranke, thus: Set all the Pikes in the first twentie\nrankes, and place the Peticapitaines thereof, five in the first places,\nand five in the last: the other three score rankes, whiche come after,\nbee all of Targaettes, whiche come to bee three Centuries. Therefore,\nthe first and the laste ranke of every Centurion, would be\nPeticapitaines, the Conestable with the Ansigne, and with the Drumme,\nmuste stande in the middest of the first Centurie of Targaettes, and the\nCenturions in the hed of every Centurie. The bande thus ordained, when\nyou would have the Pikes to come on the left flancke, you must redouble\nCenturie by Centurie, on the right flancke: if you would have them to\ncome on the right flancke, you must redouble theim on the lefte. And so\nthis battaile tourneth with the Pikes upon a flancke, and the Conestable\nin the middeste: the whiche facion it hath marchyng: but the enemie\ncommyng, and the tyme that it would make of flancke hedde, it nedeth not\nbut to make every man to tourne his face, towardes thesame flancke,\nwhere the Pikes be, and then the battaile tourneth with the rankes, and\nwith the heddes in thesame maner, as is aforesaied: for that every man\nis in his place, excepte the Centurions, and the Centurions straight\nwaie, and without difficultie, place themselves: But when thei in\nmarchyng, should bee driven to faight on the backe, it is convenient to\nordein the rankes after soch sorte, that settyng theim in battaile, the\nPikes maie come behinde, and to doe this, there is to bee kepte no other\norder, then where in orderyng the battaile, by the ordinarie, every\nCenturie hath five rankes of Pikes before, to cause that thei maie have\nthem behind, and in all the other partes to observe thorder, whiche I\ndeclared firste.\nCOSIMO. You have tolde (if I dooe well remember me) that this maner of\nexercise, is to bee able to bryng these battailes together into an\narmie, and that this practise, serveth to be able to order theim selves\nin the same: But if it should happen, that these CCCCL. men, should have\nto doe an acte seperate, how would you order them?\n[Sidenote: How a battaile is made with twoo hornes; The orderyng of a\nbattaile with a voide space in the middeste.]\nFABRICIO. He that leadeth them, ought then to judge, where he will place\nthe Pikes, and there to put them, the whiche doeth not repugne in any\npart to the order above written: for that also, though thesame bee the\nmaner, that is observed to faighte a fielde, together with thother\nbattailes, notwithstandyng it is a rule, whiche serveth to all those\nwaies, wherein a band of menne should happen to have to doe: but in\nshewyng you the other twoo waies of me propounded, of ordering the\nbattailes, I shal also satisfie you more to your question: for that\neither thei are never used, or thei are used when a battaile is a lone,\nand not in companie of other, and to come to the waie of ordering them,\nwith twoo hornes, I saie, that thou oughteste to order the lxxx. rankes,\nfive to a ranke, in this maner. Place in the middest, one Centurion, and\nafter hym xxv. rankes, whiche muste bee with twoo Pikes on the lefte\nhande, and with three Targaettes on the right, and after the first five,\nthere must be put in the twentie folowyng, twentie Peticapitaines, all\nbetwene the pikes, and the Targaettes, excepte those whiche beare the\nPike, whom maie stand with the Pikes: after these xxv. rankes thus\nordered, there is to be placed an other Centurion, and behinde hym\nfiftene rankes of Targaettes: after these, the Conestable betwene the\nDrum and the Ansigne, who also must have after him, other fiftene rankes\nof Targaettes: after this, the thirde Centurion must be placed, and\nbehinde hym, xxv. rankes, in every one of whiche, ought to bee three\nTargaettes on the lefte flancke, and twoo Pikes on the right, and after\nthe five first rankes, there must be xx. Peticapitaines placed betwene\nthe Pikes, and the Targaettes: after these rankes, the fowerth Centurion\nmust folowe. Intendying therefore, of these rankes thus ordered, to make\na battaile with twoo hornes, the first Centurion must stand still, with\nthe xxv. rankes, whiche be behinde him, after the second Centurion muste\nmove, with the fiftene rankes of Targaettes, that bee behinde hym, and\nto tourne on the right hande, and up by the right flancke of the xxv.\nrankes, to go so farre, that he arrive to the xv. ranke, and there to\nstande still: after, the Conestable muste move, with the fiftene rankes\nof Targaettes, whiche be behinde hym, and tournyng likewise on the right\nhande, up by the right flancke of the fiftene rankes, that wer firste\nmoved, muste marche so farre, that he come to their heddes, and there to\nstand stil: after, the thirde Centurion muste move with the xxv. rankes,\nand with the fowerth Centurion, whiche was behinde, and turnyng up\nstraight, must go a long by the right flanck of the fiftene last rankes\nof the Targaettes, and not to stande still when he is at the heddes of\nthem, but to followe marchyng so farre, that the laste ranke of the xxv.\nmaie come to be even with the rankes behinde. And this dooen, the\nCenturion, whiche was hedde of the firste fiftene rankes of Targaettes,\nmust go awaie from thens where he stoode, and go to the backe in the\nlefte corner: and thus a battaile shall be made of xxv. rankes, after\ntwentie men to a rank, with two hornes, upon every side of the front,\none horn, and every one, shall have ten rankes, five to a ranke, and\nthere shall remain a space betwene the twoo hornes, as moche as\ncontaineth ten men, whiche tourne their sides, the one to thother.\nBetwene the two hornes, the capitain shall stande, and on every poinct\nof a horne, a Centurion: There shall bee also behinde, on every corner,\na Centurion: there shal be twoo rankes of Pikes, and xx. Peticapitaines\non every flancke. These twoo hornes, serve to kepe betwene theim the\nartillerie, when this battaile should have any withit, and the cariages:\nThe Veliti muste stande a long the flankes, under the Pikes. But mindyng\nto bring this horned battaile, with a voide space in the middeste, there\nought no other to bee doen, then of fiftene rankes, of twentie to a\nranke, to take eight rankes, and to place them on the poinctes of the\ntwoo hornes, whiche then of hornes, become backe of the voide space, in\nthis place, the cariages are kept, the capitain standeth, and the\nAnsigne, but never the Artillerie, the whiche is placed either in the\nfront, or a long the flankes. These be the waies, that a battaile maie\nuse when it is constrained to passe alone through suspected places:\nnotwithstandyng, the massive battaile without hornes, and without any\nsoche voide place is better, yet purposyng to assure the disarmed, the\nsame horned battaile is necessarie. The Suizzers make also many facions\nof battailes, emong which, thei make one like unto a crosse: bicause in\nthe spaces that is betwen the armes therof, thei kepe safe their\nHarkebuters from the daunger of the enemies: but bicause soche battailes\nbe good to faight by theim selves, and my intente is to shew, how many\nbattailes united, do faight with thenemie, I wil not labour further in\ndescribing them.\nCOSIMO. My thinkes I have verie well comprehended the waie, that ought\nto be kept to exercise the men in these battailes: But (if I remember me\nwell) you have saied, how that besides the tenne battailes, you joyne to\nthe maine battaile, a thousande extraordinarie Pikes, and five hundred\nextraordinarie Veliti: will you not appoincte these to be exercised?\n[Sidenote: To what purpose the Pikes and Velite extraordinarie must\nserve.]\nFABRICIO. I would have theim to bee exercised, and that with moste great\ndiligence: and the Pikes I would exercise, at leaste Ansigne after\nAnsigne, in the orders of the battailes, as the other: For as moche as\nthese should doe me more servise, then the ordinarie battailes, in all\nparticulare affaires: as to make guides, to get booties, and to doe like\nthynges: but the Veliti, I would exercise at home, without bringing them\ntogether, for that their office being to faight a sonder, it is not\nmete, that thei should companie with other, in the common exercises: for\nthat it shall suffice, to exercise them well in the particular\nexercises. Thei ought then (as I firste tolde you, nor now me thynkes no\nlabour to rehearse it againe) to cause their men to exercise them selves\nin these battailes, whereby thei maie knowe how to kepe the raie, to\nknowe their places, to tourne quickly, when either enemie, or situacion\ntroubleth them: for that, when thei knowe how to do this, the place is\nafter easely learned, which a battaile hath to kepe, and what is the\noffice thereof in the armie: and when a Prince, or a common weale, will\ntake the paine, and will use their diligence in these orders, and in\nthese exercisyng, it shall alwaies happen, that in their countrie, there\nshall bee good souldiours, and thei to be superiours to their\nneighbours, and shalbe those, whiche shall give, and not receive the\nlawes of other men: but (as I have saied) the disorder wherein thei\nlive, maketh that thei neclecte, and doe not esteme these thynges, and\ntherefore our armies be not good: and yet though there were either hed,\nor member naturally vertuous, thei cannot shewe it.\nCOSIMO. What carriages would you, that every one of these battailes\nshould have?\n[Sidenote: Neither Centurion nor Peticapitaine, ought not to ride; What\ncarriages the Capitaines ought to have, and the nomber of carrages\nrequisite to every bande of menne.]\nFABRICIO. Firste, I would that neither Centurion, nor Peticapitain,\nshould be suffered to ride: and if the Conestable would nedes ride, I\nwould that he should have a Mule, and not a horse: I would allowe hym\ntwoo carriages, and one to every Centurion, and twoo to every three\nPeticapitaines, for that so many wee lodge in a lodgyng, as in the place\ntherof we shall tell you: So that every battaile will come to have\nxxxvi. carriages, the whiche I would should carrie of necessitie the\ntentes, the vesselles to seeth meate, axes, barres of Iron, sufficient\nto make the lodgynges, and then if thei can carry any other thyng, thei\nmaie dooe it at their pleasure.\nCOSIMO. I beleve that the heddes of you, ordeined in every one of these\nbattailes, be necessarie: albeit, I would doubt, lest that so many\ncommaunders, should confounde all.\n[Sidenote: Without many capitaines, an armie cannot be governed; To what\npurpose Ansignes ought to serve; For what purpose Drummes oughte to bee\nused; The propertie that soundes of instrumentes have in mens myndes.]\nFABRICIO. That should bee, when it were not referred to one man, but\nreferryng it, thei cause order, ye and without theim, it is impossible\nto governe an armie: for that a wall, whiche on every parte enclineth,\nrequireth rather to have many proppes, and thicke, although not so\nstrong, then fewe, though thei were strong: bicause the vertue of one a\nlone, doeth not remedie the ruine a farre of. And therefore in tharmies,\nand emong every ten men, it is convenient that there bee one, of more\nlife, of more harte, or at leaste wise of more aucthoritie, who with\nstomacke, with wordes, and with example, maie kepe them constante, and\ndisposed to faight, and these thynges of me declared, bee necessarie in\nan armie, as the Heddes, the Ansignes, and the Drummes, is seen that wee\nhave theim all in our armies, but none doeth his office. First to mynde\nthat the Peticapitaines doe thesame, for whiche thei are ordeined, it is\nnecessarie (as I have said) that there bee a difference, betwene every\none of them and their men, and that thei lodge together, doyng their\nduties, standyng in thorder with them: for that thei placed in their\nplaces, bee a rule and a temperaunce, to maintaine the raies straight\nand steddie, and it is impossible that thei disorder, or disorderyng,\ndooe not reduce themselves quickly into their places. But we now adaies,\ndoe not use them to other purpose, then to give theim more wages, then\nto other menne, and to cause that thei dooe some particulare feate: The\nvery same happeneth of the Ansigne bearers, for that thei are kept\nrather to make a faire muster, then for any other warlike use: but the\nantiquitie used theim for guides, and to bryng theim selves againe into\norder: for that every man, so sone as the Ansigne stoode still, knewe\nthe place, that he kept nere to his Ansigne, wherunto he retourned\nalwaies: thei knewe also, how that the same movyng, or standyng, thei\nshould staie, or move: therfore it is necessarie in an armie, that there\nbe many bodies, and every bande of menne to have his Ansigne, and his\nguide: wherfore havyng this, it is mete that thei have stomackes inough,\nand by consequence life enough. Then the menne ought to marche,\naccordyng to the Ansigne: and the Ansigne to move, accordyng to the\nDrumme, the whiche Drumme well ordered, commaundeth to the armie, the\nwhiche goyng with paces, that answereth the tyme of thesame, will come\nto kepe easilie thorders: for whiche cause the antiquitie had Shalmes,\nFlutes, and soundes perfectly tymed: For as moche as like as he that\ndaunseth, proceadeth with the tyme of the Musick, and goyng with thesame\ndoeth not erre, even so an armie obeiyng, in movyng it self to thesame\nsounde, doeth not disorder: and therefore, thei varied the sounde,\naccordyng as thei would varie the mocion, and accordyng as thei would\ninflame, or quiete, or staie the mindes of men: and like as the soundes\nwere divers, so diversly thei named them: the sounde Dorico, ingendered\nconstancie, the sounde Frigio, furie: whereby thei saie, that Alexander\nbeyng at the Table, and one soundyng the sounde Frigio, it kendled so\nmoche his minde, that he laied hande on his weapons. All these maners\nshould be necessarie to finde again: and when this should bee\ndifficulte, at least there would not be left behind those that teache\nthe Souldiour to obeie, the whiche every man maie varie, and ordeine\nafter his owne facion, so that with practise, he accustome the eares of\nhis souldiours to knowe it: But now adaies of this sounde, there is no\nother fruicte taken for the moste part, then to make a rumour.\nCOSIMO. I would desire to understande of you, if ever with your self you\nhave discourced, whereof groweth so moche vilenesse, and so moche\ndisorder, and so moche necligence in these daies of this exercise?\n[Sidenote: A notable discourse of the aucthour, declaryng whereof\ngroweth so moche vilenes disorder and necligence in these daies,\nconcernyng the exercises of warre.]\nFABRICIO. With a good will I will tell you thesame, that I thinke. You\nknowe how that of the excellente men of warre, there hath been named\nmany in Europe, fewe in Affric, and lesse in Asia: this grewe, for that\nthese twoo laste partes of the worlde, have had not paste one kyngdome,\nor twoo, and fewe common weales, but Europe onely, hath had many\nkyngdomes, and infinite common weales, where menne became excellent, and\ndid shewe their vertue, accordyng as thei were sette a woorke, and\nbrought before their Prince, or common weale, or king that he be: it\nfolloweth therefore, that where be many dominions, there rise many\nvaliaunt menne, and where be fewe, fewe. In Asia is founde Ninus, Cirus,\nArtasercses, Mithridates: and verie fewe other, that to these maie be\ncompared. In Africk, is named (lettyng stande thesame auncient Egipt)\nMassinissa, Jugurta, and those Capitaines, whiche of the Carthaginens\ncommon weale were nourished, whom also in respecte to those of Europe,\nare moste fewe: bicause in Europe, be excellente men without nomber, and\nso many more should be, if together with those should bee named the\nother, that be through the malignitie of time extincte: for that the\nworlde hath been moste vertuous, where hath been moste states, whiche\nhave favoured vertue of necessitie, or for other humaine passion. There\nrose therfore in Asia, fewe excellente menne: bicause thesame Province,\nwas all under one kyngdome, in the whiche for the greatnesse thereof,\nthesame standing for the moste parte of tyme idell, there could not\ngrowe men in doynges excellent. To Africke there happened the verie\nsame, yet there were nourished more then in Asia, by reason of the\nCarthaginens common weale: for that in common weales, there growe more\nexcellent men, then in kingdomes, bicause in common weales for the most\npart, vertue is honoured, in Kyngdomes it is helde backe: wherby\ngroweth, that in thone, vertuous men are nourished, in the other thei\nare extincte. Therefore he that shall consider the partes of Europe,\nshall finde it to have been full of common weales, and of princedomes,\nthe whiche for feare, that the one had of the other, thei wer\nconstrained to kepe lively the warlike orders, and to honor them, whiche\nin those moste prevailed: for that in Grece, besides the kyngdome of the\nMacedonians, there were many common weales, and in every one of theim,\nwere bred moste excellente men. In Italie, were the Romaines, the\nSannites, the Toscanes, the Gallie Cisalpini. Fraunce, and Almainie, wer\nful of common weales and princedomes. Spaine likewise: and although in\ncomparison of the Romaines, there are named fewe other, it groweth\nthrough the malignitie of the writers, whom folowe fortune, and to theim\nfor the moste parte it suffised, to honour the conquerours: but it\nstandeth not with reason, that betwene the Sannites, and the Toscanes,\nwhom fought CL. yeres with the Romaine people, before thei wer overcome,\nthere should not growe exceadyng many excellente menne. And so likewise\nin Fraunce, and in Spaine: but that vertue, whiche the writers did not\ncelebrate in particuler menne, thei celebrated generally in the people,\nwhere thei exalte to the starres, the obstinatenesse that was in them,\nto defende their libertie. Beyng then true, that where bee moste\ndominions, there riseth moste valiaunt menne, it foloweth of necessitie,\nthat extinguishyng those, vertue is extincte straighte waie, the\noccasion decaiyng, whiche maketh menne vertuous. Therefore, the Romaine\nEmpire beyng after increased, and havyng extinguished all the common\nweales, and Princedomes of Europe, and of Afrike, and for the moste part\nthose of Asia, it lefte not any waie to vertue, excepte Rome: whereby\ngrewe, that vertuous menne began to be as fewe in Europe, as in Asia:\nthe whiche vertue, came after to the laste caste: For as moche, as all\nthe vertue beyng reduced to Roome, so sone as thesame was corrupted,\nalmoste all the worlde came to bee corrupted: and the Scithian people,\nwere able to come to spoile thesame Empire, the whiche had extinguished\nthe vertue of other, and knewe not howe to maintaine their owne: and\nafter, although through the inundacion of those barberous nacions,\nthesame Empire was devided into many partes, this vertue is not renued:\n[Sidenote: The causes why the aunciente orders are neclected.]\nThe one cause is, for that it greveth theim moche, to take againe the\norders when thei are marde, the other, bicause the maner of livyng now\nadaies, having respect to the Christian religion, commaundeth not\nthesame necessitie to menne, to defende themselves, whiche in olde tyme\nwas: for that then, the menne overcome in warre, either were killed, or\nremained perpetuall slaves, where thei led their lives moste miserably:\nThe tounes overcome, either were rased, or the inhabiters thereof driven\nout, their goodes taken awaie, sent dispersed through the worlde: so\nthat the vanquished in warre, suffered all extreme miserie: of this\nfeare, men beyng made afraied, thei wer driven to kepe lively the\nwarlike exercises, and thei honoured soche as were excellente in theim:\nBut nowe adaies, this feare for the moste part is not regarded: of those\nthat are overcom, fewe bee killed, none is kepte longe in prison: for\nthat with facelitie, thei are sette at libertie: the citees also, whiche\na thousande tymes have rebelled, are not destroied, the men wherof, are\nlet a lone with their goodes, so that the greateste hurte that is\nfeared, is but a taske: in so moche, that men will not submit them\nselves to the orders of warre, and to abide alwaies under those, to\navoide the perilles whereof thei are little afraied: again these\nProvinces of Europe, be under a verie fewe heddes, in respecte as it\nhath been in times past: for that al Fraunce, obeieth one kyng, al\nSpain, an other: Italie is in fewe partes, so that the weake citees, are\ndefended with leanyng to hym that overcometh, and the strong states, for\nthe causes aforesaied, feare no soche extreme ruine.\nCOSIMO. Yet ther hath ben seen many tounes that have ben sacked within\nthis xxv. yeres, and lost their dominions, whose insample, ought to\nteache other how to live, and to take again some of those old orders.\nFABRICIO. You saie true: but if you note what tounes have gone to sacke,\nyou shall not finde that thei have been the heddes of states, but of the\nmembers; as was seen sacked Tortona, and not Milaine: Capua, and not\nNapelles, Brescia, and not Venice, Ravenna, and not Roome: the whiche\ninsamples maketh those that governe, not to chaunge their purposes, but\nrather maketh them to stande more in their opinion, to be able to redeme\nagain all thynges with taskes, and for this, thei will not submit theim\nselves to the troubles of thexercises of warre, semyng unto them partly\nnot necessarie, partly, an intrinsicate matter, whiche thei understande\nnot: Those other, whiche bee subjectes to them, whom soche insamples\nought to make afraied, have no power to remedie it: and those Princes,\nthat have ones loste their estates, are no more able, and those which as\nyet kept them, know not, nor wil not. Bicause thei will without any\ndisease rain by fortune, and not by their vertue: for that in the worlde\nbeyng but little vertue, thei see fortune governeth all thynges. And\nthei will have it to rule theim, not thei to rule it. And to prove this\nthat I have discoursed to bee true, consider Almaine, in the whiche,\nbicause there is many Princedomes, and common weales, there is moche\nvertue, and all thesame, whiche in the present service of warre is good,\ndependeth of the insamples of those people: who beyng all gellious of\ntheir states, fearing servitude, the which in other places is not\nfeared, thei all maintaine theim selves Lordes, and honourable: this\nthat I have saied, shall suffice to shewe the occacions of the presente\nutilitie, accordyng to my opinion: I cannot tell, whether it seeme\nthesame unto you, or whether there be growen in you any doubtyng.\nCOSIMO. None, but rather I understande all verie well: onely I desire,\ntournyng to our principall matter, to understande of you, how you would\nordein the horses with these battailes, and how many, and how thei\nshould be governed, and how armed.\n[Sidenote: The armyng of horsemen; The weapons that light horsmenne\nshould have; The nombre of horsmen requisite for a maine bataille of six\nthousand men; The nombre of carrages that men of armes and light horsmen\nought to have.]\nFABRICIO. You thinke peraventure, that I have left it behinde: whereat\ndoe not marvell, for that I purpose for twoo causes, to speake therof\nlittle, the one is, for that the strengthe, and the importaunce of an\narmie, is the footemen, the other is, bicause this part of service of\nwarre, is lesse corrupted, then thesame of footemen. For that though it\nbe not stronger then the old, yet it maie compare with thesame,\nnevertheles ther hath been spoken a little afore, of the maner of\nexercisyng them. And concernyng tharmyng them, I would arme them as thei\ndoe at this present, as wel the light horsemen, as the menne of armes:\nbut the light horsemen, I would that thei should be all Crossebowe\nshuters, with some Harkebutters emong them: the whiche though in the\nother affaires of warre, thei bee little profitable, thei be for this\nmost profitable, to make afraied the countrie menne, and to drive them\nfrom a passage, that were kept of them: bicause a Harkebutter, shall\nfeare them more, then twentie other armed. But commyng to the nomber, I\nsaie, that having taken in hand, to imitate the service of warre of the\nRomaines, I would not ordein more then three hundred horse, profitable\nfor every maine battaile, of whiche I would that there were CL. men of\narmes, and CL. light horsmen, and I would give to every one of these\npartes, a hedde, making after emong them fiftene peticapitaines for a\nbande, givyng to every one of them a Trompet, and a standarde: I would\nthat every ten menne of armes, should have five carriages, and every ten\nlight horsemen twoo, the whiche as those of the footemen, should carrie\nthe tentes, the vesselles, and the axes, and the stakes, and the rest of\ntheir other harneis. Nor beleve not but that it is disorder, where the\nmenne of armes have to their service fower horse, bicause soche a thyng\nis a corrupt use: for that the men of armes in Almaine, are seen to bee\nwith their horse alone, every twentie of theim, havyng onely a carte,\nthat carrieth after them their necessary thynges. The Romaine horsemen,\nwere likewise a lone: true it is, that the Triary lodged nere them,\nwhiche wer bound to minister helpe unto theim, in the kepyng of their\nhorses the whiche maie easely be imitated of us, as in the distributyng\nof the lodgynges, I shall shewe you. Thesame then that the Romaines did,\nand that whiche the Duchmen doe now a daies, we maie doe also, ye, not\ndoyng it, we erre. These horses ordained and appoincted together with a\nmain battaile, maie sometymes be put together, when the battailes bee\nassembled, and to cause that betwene theim bee made some sight of\nassault, the whiche should be more to make them acquainted together,\nthen for any other necessitie. But now of this part, there hath been\nspoke sufficiently, wherefore let us facion the armie, to be able to\ncome into the field against the enemie, and hope to winne it: whiche\nthyng is the ende, for whiche the exercise of warre is ordeined, and so\nmoche studie therein bestowed.\nTHE THIRDE BOOKE\nCOSIMO. Seeing that we chaunge reasonyng, I will that the demaunder be\nchaunged: bicause I would not be thought presumptuous, the which I have\nalwaies blamed in other: therfore, I resigne the Dictatorship, and give\nthis aucthoritie to hym that will have it, of these my other frendes.\nZANOBI.

I am certain, that to mynde to shewe wel, how an armie is\nprepared, to faight a fielde, it should be necessarie to declare, how\nthe Grekes, and the Romaines ordeined the bandes of their armies:\nNotwithstandyng, you your selves, beeyng able to rede, and to consider\nthese tnynges, by meanes of the auncient writers. I will passe over many\nparticulars: and I will onely bryng in those thynges, whiche I thinke\nnecessarie to imitate, mindyng at this tyme, to give to our exercise of\nwarre, some parte of perfection: The whiche shall make, that in one\ninstant, I shall shewe you, how an armie is prepared to the field, and\nhow it doeth incounter in the verie faight, and how it maie be exercised\nin the fained. The greatest disorder, that thei make, whiche ordeine an\narmie to the fielde, is in giving them onely one fronte, and to binde\nthem to one brunt, and to one fortune: the whiche groweth, of havyng\nloste the waie, that the antiquitie used to receive one bande within an\nother: bicause without this waie, thei can neither succour the formoste,\nnor defende them, nor succede in the faight in their steede: the whiche\nof the Romaines, was moste excellently well observed. Therefore,\npurposyng to shewe this waie, I saie, how that the Romaines devided into\niii. partes every Legion, in Hastati, Prencipi, and Triarii, of which,\nthe Hastati wer placed in the first front, or forward of the armie, with\nthorders thicke and sure, behinde whom wer the Prencipi, but placed with\ntheir orders more thinne: after these, thei set the Triarii, and with so\nmoche thinnes of orders, that thei might, if nede wer, receive betwene\nthem the Prencipi, and the Hastati. Thei had besides these, the\nSlingers, and Crosbowshoters, and the other lighte armed, the whiche\nstoode not in these orders, but thei placed them in the bed of tharmie,\nbetwene the horses and the other bandes of footemen: therefore these\nlight armed, began the faight, if thei overcame (whiche happened seldom\ntimes) thei folowed the victorie: if thei were repulced, thei retired by\nthe flanckes of the armie, or by the spaces ordained for soche purposes,\nand thei brought them selves emong the unarmed: after the departure of\nwhom, the Hastati incountered with the enemie, the whiche if thei saw\nthemselves to be overcome, thei retired by a little and little, by the\nrarenesse of thorders betwene the Prencipi, and together with those,\nthei renued the faight if these also wer repulced, thei retired al in\nthe rarenesse of the orders of the Triarii, and al together on a heape,\nbegan againe the faight: and then, if thei were overcome, there was no\nmore remeady, bicause there remained no more waies to renue them again.\nThe horses stoode on the corners of the armie, to the likenes of twoo\nwinges to a bodie, and somewhiles thei fought with the enemies horses,\nan other while, thei rescued the fotmen, according as nede required.\nThis waie of renuyng theim selves three tymes, is almoste impossible to\novercome: for that, fortune muste three tymes forsake thee, and the\nenemie to have so moche strengthe, that three tymes he maie overcome\nthee. The Grekes, had not in their Falangi, this maner of renuyng them\nselves, and although in those wer many heddes, and many orders,\nnotwithstandyng, thei made one bodie, or els one hedde: the maner that\nthei kepte in rescuyng the one the other was, not to retire the one\norder within the other, as the Romaines, but to enter the one manne into\nthe place of the other: the which thei did in this maner. Their Falange\nbrought into rankes, and admit, that thei put in a ranke fiftie menne,\ncommyng after with their hedde againste the enemie, of all the rankes\nthe foremoste sixe, mighte faight: Bicause their Launces, the whiche\nthei called Sarisse, were so long, that the sixt ranke, passed with the\nhedde of their Launces, out of the first ranke: then in faightyng, if\nany of the first, either through death, or through woundes fell,\nstraight waie there entered into his place, thesame man, that was\nbehinde in the second ranke, and in the place that remained voide of the\nseconde, thesame man entred, whiche was behind hym in the thirde, and\nthus successively, in a sodaine the rankes behinde, restored the faultes\nof those afore, so that the rankes alwaies remained whole, and no place\nof the faighters was voide, except the laste rankes, the whiche came to\nconsume, havyng not menne behinde their backes, whom might restore\ntheim: So that the hurte that the first rankes suffered, consumed the\nlaste, and the firste remained alwaies whole: and thus these Falangi by\ntheir order, might soner be consumed, then broken, for that the grosse\nbodie, made it more immovable. The Romaines used at the beginnyng the\nFalangi, and did set in order their Legions like unto them: after, this\norder pleased them not, and thei devided the Legions into many bodies,\nthat is, in bandes and companies: Bicause thei judged (as a little afore\nI saied) that thesame bodie, should have neede of many capitaines, and\nthat it should be made of sunderie partes, so that every one by it self,\nmight be governed. The maine battailes of the Suizzers, use at this\npresent, all the maners of the Falangi, as well in ordryng it grosse,\nand whole, as in rescuyng the one the other: and in pitchyng the field,\nthei set the main battailes, thone to the sides of the other: and though\nthei set them the one behinde the other, thei have no waie, that the\nfirste retiryng it self, maie bee received of the seconde, but thei use\nthis order, to the entent to bee able to succour the one thother, where\nthei put a maine battaile before, and an other behinde thesame on the\nright hande: so that if the first have nede of helpe, that then the\nother maie make forewarde, and succour it: the third main battaile, thei\nput behind these, but distant from them, a Harkebus shot: this thei doe,\nfor that thesaid two main battailes being repulced, this maie make\nforwarde, and have space for theim selves, and for the repulced, and\nthesame that marcheth forward, to avoide the justling of the one the\nother: for asmoche as a grosse multitude, cannot bee received as a\nlittle bodie: and therefore, the little bodies beyng destincte, whiche\nwere in a Romaine Legion, might be placed in soche wise, that thei might\nreceive betwene theim, and rescue the one the other. And to prove this\norder of the Suizzers not to be so good, as the auncient Romaines, many\ninsamples of the Romain Legions doe declare, when thei fought with the\nGrekes Falangi, where alwaies thei were consumed of theim: for that the\nkinde of their weapons (as I have said afore) and this waie of renuyng\nthemselves, could do more, then the massivenesse of the Falangi. Havyng\ntherefore, with these insamples to ordaine an armie, I have thought\ngood, partly to retaine the maner of armyng and the orders of the Grekes\nFalangi, and partely of the Romain Legions: and therfore I have saied,\nthat I would have in a main battaile, twoo thousande pikes, whiche be\nthe weapons of the Macedonicall Falangi, and three thousande Targaettes\nwith sweardes, whiche be the Romain weapons: I have devided the main\nbattaile, into x. battailes, as the Romaines their Legion into ten\nCohortes: I have ordeined the Veliti, that is the light armed, to begin\nthe faight, as the Romaines used: and like as the weapons beyng mingled,\ndoe participate of thone and of the other nacion, so the orders also doe\nparticipate: I have ordained, that every battaile shall have v. rankes\nof Pikes in the fronte, and the rest of Targaettes, to bee able with the\nfront, to withstande the horses, and to enter easely into the battaile\nof the enemies on foot, having in the firste fronte, or vawarde, Pikes,\nas well as the enemie, the whiche shall suffice me to withstande them,\nthe Targaettes after to overcome theim. And if you note the vertue of\nthis order, you shal se al these weapons, to doe fully their office, for\nthat the Pikes, bee profitable against the horses, and when thei come\nagainst the footemenne, thei dooe their office well, before the faight\nthrong together, bicause so sone as thei presse together, thei become\nunprofitable: wherefore, the Suizzers to avoide this inconvenience, put\nafter everye three rankes of Pikes, a ranke of Halberdes, the whiche\nthey do to make roome to the Pikes, which is not yet so much as\nsuffiseth. Then putting our Pikes afore, and the Targaettes behinde,\nthey come to withstande the horses, and in the beginning of the fight,\nthey open the rayes, and molest the footemen: But when the fight is\nthrust together, and that they become unprofitable, the Targaettes and\nswoords succeede, which may in every narowe place be handled.\nLUIGI. Wee looke nowe with desire to understande, howe you would ordeyne\nthe armie to fighte the fielde, with these weapons, and with these\norder.\n[Sidenote: The nomber of men that was in a Counsulles armie; How the\nRomaines placed their Legions in the field; How to order an armie in the\nfielde to fighte a battaile, according to the minde of the authour; How\nthe extraordinary pikes bee placed in the set battaile; The place where\nthextraordinarie archars and harkebutters, and the men of armes and\nlighte horsmen ought to stande when the field is pitched, and goeth to\nfaighte the battaile; The ordinarie archars and harkebutters are placed\naboute their owne battailes; The place where the generall hedde of a\nmaine battaile muste stande, when thesame power of men is appoincted to\nfaight; What menne a general capitain of a maine battaile oughte to have\naboute hym; The place wher a general capitain of all thearmie must stand\nwhen the battaile is ready to be fought and what nomber of chosen men\noughte to be aboute hym; How many canons is requisite for an armie, and\nof what sise they ought to bee; Where the artillerie ought to be placed\nwhen thearmie is reedie to fight; An armie that were ordered as above is\ndeclared, maie in fighting, use the Grekes maner, and the Roman fashion;\nTo what purpose the spaces that be betwene every bande of men do serve.]\nFABRICIO. And I will not nowe shewe you other, then this: you have to\nunderstande, how that in an ordinarye Romane armie, which they call a\nConsull armie, there were no more, then twoo Legions of Romane Citezens\nwhich were sixe hundred horse, and about aleven thousande footemen: they\nhad besides as many more footemen and horsemen, whiche were sente them\nfrom their friends and confiderates, whome they divided into twoo\npartes, and called the one, the right horne and the other the left\nhorne: nor they never permitted, that these aiding footemen, should\npasse the nomber of the footemen of their Legions, they were well\ncontented, that the nomber of those horse shoulde be more then theirs:\nwith this armie, which was of xxii. thousand footemen, and about twoo\nthousande good horse, a Consul executed all affaires, and went to all\nenterprises: yet when it was needefull to set against a greater force,\ntwoo Consulles joyned together with twoo armies. You ought also to note\nin especially, that in all the three principall actes, which an armie\ndoth that is, to march, to incampe, and to fight, the Romanes used to\nput their Legions in the middeste, for that they woulde, that the same\npower, wherein they most trusted, shoulde bee moste united, as in the\nreasoning of these three actes, shall be shewed you: those aiding\nfootemen, through the practise they had with the Legion Souldiours, were\nas profitable as they, because they were instructed, according as the\nsouldiours of the Legions were, and therefore, in like maner in pitching\nthe field, they pitched. Then he that knoweth how the Romaines disposed\na Legion in their armie, to fight a field, knoweth how they disposed\nall: therefor, having tolde you how they devided a Legion into three\nbandes, and how the one bande received the other, I have then told you,\nhow al tharmie in a fielde, was ordained. Wherefore, I minding to ordain\na field like unto the Romaines, as they had twoo Legions, I will take\nii. main batailes, and these being disposed, the disposicion of all an\narmie shalbe understode therby: bycause in joyning more men, there is no\nother to be doen, then to ingrosse the orders: I thinke I neede not to\nrehearse how many men a maine battaile hath, and howe it hath ten\nbattailes, and what heades bee in a battaile and what weapons they have,\nand which be the ordinarie Pikes and Veliti, and which the\nextraordinarie for that a litle a fore I told you it destinctly, and I\nwilled you to kepe it in memorie as a necessarie thing to purpose, to\nunderstande all the other orders: and therfore I will come to the\ndemonstracion of the order without repeating it any more: Me thinkes\ngood, that the ten battailes of one main battaile be set on the left\nflanke, and the tenne other, of the other main battaile, on the right:\nthese that are placed on the left flanke, be ordeined in this maner,\nthere is put five battailes the one to the side of the other in the\nfronte, after suche sorte, that betweene the one and the other, there\nremaine a space of three yardes, whiche come to occupie for largenesse\nCvi. yardes, of ground, and for length thirtie: behinde these five\nbattailes, I would put three other distante by right line from the\nfirste thirtie yardes: twoo of the whiche, should come behinde by right\nline, to the uttermoste of the five, and the other should kepe the space\nin the middeste, and so these three, shall come to occupie for bredth\nand length, as moche space, as the five doeth. But where the five have\nbetwene the one, and the other, a distaunce of three yardes, these shall\nhave a distance of xxv. yardes. After these, I would place the twoo last\nbattailes, in like maner behinde the three by right line, and distaunte\nfrom those three, thirtie yardes, and I would place eche of theim,\nbehinde the uttermoste part of the three, so that the space, whiche\nshould remain betwen the one and the other, should be lxviii. yardes:\nthen al these battailes thus ordered, will take in bredth Cvi. yardes,\nand in length CL. Thextraordinarie Pikes, I would deffende a long the\nflanckes of these battailes, on the left side, distante from them\nfiftene yardes, makyng Cxliij. rankes, seven to a ranke, after soche\nsorte, that thei maie impale with their length, all the left sixe of the\ntenne battailes in thesame wise, declared of me to be ordained: and\nthere shall remain fourtie rankes to keepe the carriages, and the\nunarmed, whiche ought to remaine in the taile of the armie, distributyng\nthe Peticapitaines, and the Centurions, in their places: and of the\nthree Conestables, I would place one in the hedde, the other in the\nmiddeste, the third in the laste ranke, the whiche should execute the\noffice of a Tergiductore, whom the antiquitie so called hym, that was\nappoincted to the backe of the armie. But retournyng to the hedde of the\narmie, I saie how that I would place nere to the extraordinarie pikes,\nthe Veliti extraordinarie, whiche you knowe to be five hundred, and I\nwould give them a space of xxx. yardes: on the side of these likewise on\nthe left hande, I would place the menne of armes, and I would thei\nshould have a space of a Cxii. yardes: after these, the light horsemen,\nto whom I would appoinct as moche ground to stande in, as the menne of\narmes have: the ordinarie veliti, I would leave about their owne\nbattailes, who should stand in those spaces, whiche I appoincte betwene\nthone battaile and thother: whom should be as their ministers, if\nsometyme I thought not good to place them under the extraordinarie\nPikes: in dooyng or not doyng whereof, I would proceade, accordyng as\nshould tourne best to my purpose. The generall hedde of all the maine\nbattaile, I would place in thesame space, that were betwene the first\nand the seconde order of the battailes, or els in the hedde, and in\nthesame space, that is betwene the laste battaile of the firste five,\nand the extraordinarie Pikes, accordyng as beste should serve my\npurpose, with thirtie or fourtie chosen men about hym, that knewe by\nprudence, how to execute a commission, and by force, to withstande a\nviolence, and thei to be also betwen the Drumme and the Ansigne: this is\nthorder, with the whiche I would dispose a maine battaile, whiche should\nbee the disposyng of halfe the armie, and it should take in breadth\nthree hundred fourscore and twoo yardes, and in length as moche as above\nis saied, not accomptyng the space, that thesame parte of the\nextraordinarie Pikes will take, whiche muste make a defence for the\nunarmed, whiche will bee aboute lxxv. yardes: the other maine battaile,\nI would dispose on the righte side, after the same maner juste, as I\nhave disposed that on the lefte, leavyng betwene the one main battaile,\nand thother, a space of xxii. yardes: in the hedde of whiche space, I\nwould set some little carriages of artillerie, behynde the whiche,\nshould stande the generall capitaine of all the armie, and should have\nabout hym with the Trumpet, and with the Capitaine standerde, twoo\nhundred menne at least, chosen to be on foote the moste parte, emongest\nwhiche there should be tenne or more, mete to execute all\ncommaundementes, and should bee in soche wise a horsebacke, and armed,\nthat thei mighte bee on horsebacke, and on foote, accordyng as neede\nshould require. The artillerie of the armie, suffiseth ten Cannons, for\nthe winning of Townes, whose shotte shoulde not passe fiftie pounde: the\nwhiche in the fielde should serve mee more for defence of the campe,\nthen for to fight the battaile: The other artillerie, should bee rather\nof ten, then of fifteene pounde the shotte: this I would place afore on\nthe front of all the armie, if sometime the countrie should not stande\nin such wise, that I mighte place it by the flancke in a sure place,\nwhere it mighte not of the enemie be in daunger: this fashion of an\narmie thus ordered, may in fighting, use the order of the Falangi, and\nthe order of the Romane Legions: for that in the fronte, bee Pikes, all\nthe men bee set in the rankes, after such sorte, that incountering with\nthe enemie, and withstanding him, maye after the use of the Falangi,\nrestore the firste ranckes, with those behinde: on the other parte, if\nthey be charged so sore, that they be constrayned to breake the orders,\nand to retire themselves, they maye enter into the voide places of the\nseconde battailes, which they have behinde them, and unite their selves\nwith them, and making a new force, withstande the enemie, and overcome\nhim: and when this sufficeth not, they may in the verie same maner,\nretire them selves the seconde time, and the third fight: so that in\nthis order, concerning to fight, there is to renue them selves, both\naccording to the Greeke maner, and according to the Romane: concerning\nthe strength of the armie, there cannot be ordayned a more stronger: for\nas much, as the one and the other borne therof, is exceedingly well\nreplenished, both with heades, and weapons, nor there remayneth weake,\nother then the part behinde of the unarmed, and the same also, hath the\nflanckes impaled with the extraordinarie Pikes: nor the enemie can not\nof anye parte assaulte it, where he shall not finde it well appointed,\nand the hinder parte can not be assaulted: Because there can not bee an\nenemie, that hath so much puissaunce, whome equallye maye assault thee\non everye side: for that hee having so great a power, thou oughtest not\nthen to matche thy selfe in the fielde with him: but when he were three\ntimes more then thou, and as well appointed as thou, hee doth weaken him\nselfe in assaulting thee in divers places, one part that thou breakest,\nwill cause all the reste go to naughte: concerning horses, although he\nchaunce to have more then thine, thou needest not feare: for that the\norders of the Pikes, which impale thee, defende thee from all violence\nof them, although thy horses were repulced. The heades besides this, be\ndisposed in such place, that they may easyly commaunde, and obeye: the\nspaces that bee between the one battaile, and the other, and betweene\nthe one order, and the other, not onely serve to be able to receyve the\none the other, but also to give place to the messengers, whiche should\ngo and come by order of the Capitayne. And as I tolde you firste, howe\nthe Romanes had for an armie, aboute foure and twentie thousande men,\neven so this oughte to bee: and as the other souldiours tooke ensample\nof the Legions, for the maner of fighting, and the fashion of the armie,\nso those souldiours, whiche you shoulde joyne to oure twoo mayne\nbattailes, oughte to take the forme and order of them: whereof having\nput you an ensample, it is an easye matter to imitate it, for that\nincreasing, either twoo other mayne battailes unto the armie, or as many\nother souldiours, as they bee, there is no other to bee done, then to\ndouble the orders, and where was put tenne battailes on the lefte parte,\nto put twentie, either ingrossing, or distending the orders, according\nas the place, or the enemie shoulde compell thee.\nLUIGI. Surelye sir I imagine in suche wise of this armie, that mee\nthinkes I nowe see it, and I burne with a desire to see it incounter,\nand I woulde for nothing in the worlde, that you shoulde become Fabius\nMaximus intendyng to kepe the enemie at a baie, and to deferre the daie\nof battaile: bicause I would saie worse of you, then the Romain people\nsaied of hym.\n[Sidenote: The descripcion of a battaile that is a faightyng.]\nFABRICIO. Doubt not: Doe you not heare the artillerie? Ours have alredie\nshotte, but little hurte the enemie: and thextraordinarie Veliti,\nissuyng out of their places together with the light horsemen, moste\nspeadely, and with moste merveilous furie, and greateste crie that maie\nbe, thei assaulte the enemie: whose artillerie hath discharged ones, and\nhath passed over the heddes of our footemen, without doyng them any\nhurt, and bicause it cannot shoote the seconde tyme, the Veliti, and our\nhorsemen, have nowe gotten it, and the enemies for to defende it, are\ncome fore warde, so that neither our ordinaunce, nor thenemies, can any\nmore doe their office. Se with how moche vertue, strengthe and agilitie\nour men faighteth, and with how moche knowledge through the exercise,\nwhiche hath made them to abide, and by the confidence, that thei have in\nthe armie, the whiche, see, how with the pace therof, and with the men\nof armes on the sides, it marcheth in good order, to give the charge on\nthe adversarie: See our artillerie, whiche to give theim place, and to\nleave them the space free, is retired by thesame space, from whens the\nVeliti issued: See how the capitaine incourageth them, sheweth them the\nvictorie certain: See how the Veliti and light horsemen bee inlarged,\nand retourned on the flanckes of tharmie, to seke and view, if thei maie\nby the flanck, doe any injurie to the adversaries: behold how the armies\nbe affronted. Se with how moche valiauntnesse thei have withstode the\nviolence of thenemies, and with how moche silence, and how the capitain\ncommaundeth the menne of armes, that thei sustain, and not charge, and\nthat thei breake not from the order of the footemen: see how our light\nhorsemen be gone, to give the charge on a band of the enemies\nHarkebutters, whiche would have hurt our men by flancke, and how the\nenemies horse have succoured them, so that tourned betwene the one and\nthe other horse, thei cannot shoote, but are faine to retire behinde\ntheir owne battaile: see with what furie our Pikes doe also affront, and\nhow the footemen be now so nere together the one to the other, that the\nPikes can no more be occupied: so that according to the knowlege learned\nof us, our pikes do retire a little and a little betwen the targaettes.\nSe how in this while a great bande of men of armes of the enemies, have\ncharged our men of armes on the lefte side, and how ours, accordyng to\nknowlege, bee retired under the extraordinarie Pikes, and with the help\nof those, giving again a freshe charge, have repulced the adversaries,\nand slain a good part of them: in so moche, that thordinarie pikes of\nthe first battailes, be hidden betwene the raies of the Targaettes, thei\nhavyng lefte the faight to the Targaet men: whom you maie see, with how\nmoche vertue, securitie, and leasure, thei kill the enemie: see you not\nhow moche by faightyng, the orders be thrust together? That thei can\nscarse welde their sweardes? Behold with how moche furie the enemies\nmove: bicause beyng armed with the pike, and with the swerd unprofitable\n(the one for beyng to long, the other for findyng thenemie to well\narmed) in part thei fall hurt or dedde, in parte thei flie. See, thei\nflie on the righte corner, thei flie also on the lefte: behold, the\nvictorie is ours. Have not we wonne a field moste happely? But with more\nhappinesse it should bee wonne, if it were graunted me to put it in\nacte. And see, how there neded not the helpe of the seconde, nor of the\nthird order, for our first fronte hath sufficed to overcome theim: in\nthis part, I have no other to saie unto you, then to resolve if any\ndoubt be growen you.\n[Sidenote: Questions concerning the shotyng of ordinaunce.]\nLUIGI. You have with so moche furie wonne this fielde that I so moche\nmervaile and am so astonied, that I beleve that I am not able to\nexpresse, if any doubt remain in my mynde: yet trustyng in your\nprudence, I will be so bolde to tell thesame that I understande. Tell me\nfirste, why made you not your ordinaunce to shoote more then ones? And\nwhy straighte waie you made them to retire into tharmie, nor after made\nno mension of them? Me thought also, that you leveled the artillerie of\nthe enemie high, and appoincted it after your own devise: the whiche\nmight very well bee, yet when it should happen, as I beleve it chaunseth\noften, that thei strike the rankes, what reamedie have you? And seyng\nthat I have begun of the artillerie, I will finishe all this question,\nto the intente I nede not to reason therof any more. I have heard many\ndispraise the armours, and the orders of the aunciente armies, arguyng,\nhow now a daies, thei can doe little, but rather should bee altogether\nunprofitable, havyng respecte to the furie of the artillerie: bicause,\nthis breaketh the orders, and passeth the armours in soche wise, that it\nsemeth unto them a foolishenesse to make an order, whiche cannot bee\nkepte, and to take pain to beare a harneis, that cannot defende a man.\n[Sidenote: An aunswere to the questions that were demaunded, concernyng\nthe shoting of ordinaunce; The best remedie to avoide the hurte that the\nenemie in the fielde maie doe with his ordinaunce; A policie against\nbowes and dartes; Nothyng causeth greater confusion in an armie, than to\nhinder mennes fightes; Nothing more blindeth the sight of men in an\narmie, then the smoke of ordinaunce; A policie to trouble the enemies\nsight; The shotte of greate ordinaunce in the fielde, is not moche to\nbee feared of fotemenne; Bicause menne of armes stand closer together\nthen light horsmen, thei ought to remaine behinde the armie till the\nenemies ordinaunce have done shootyng; The artillerie is no let, why the\nauncient orders of warfar ought not to be used in these daies.]\nFABRICIO. This question of yours (bicause it hath many heddes) hath\nneede of a long aunswere. It is true, that I made not thartillery to\nshoote more than ones, and also of thesame ones, I stoode in doubte: the\noccasion was, for asmoche as it importeth more, for one to take hede not\nto be striken, then it importeth to strike the enemie. You have to\nunderstande, that to purpose that a pece of ordinaunce hurte you not, it\nis necessarie either to stande where it cannot reche you, or to get\nbehinde a wall, or behinde a banke: other thing there is not that can\nwitholde it: and it is nedefull also, that the one and the other be\nmoste strong. Those capitaines whiche come to faight a field, cannot\nstand behind a wal, or behind bankes, nor where thei maie not be\nreached: therfore it is mete for them, seyng thei cannot finde a waie to\ndefende them, to finde some mean, by the whiche thei maie be least\nhurte: nor thei cannot finde any other waie, then to prevente it\nquickly: the waie to prevent it, is to go to finde it out of hande, and\nhastely, not at leasure and in a heape: for that through spede, the\nblowe is not suffered to bee redoubled, and by the thinnesse, lesse\nnomber of menne maie be hurt. This, a bande of menne ordered, cannot\ndooe; bicause if thesame marche hastely, it goweth out of order: if it\ngo scattered, the enemie shall have no paine to breake it, for that it\nbreaketh by it self: and therfore, I ordered the armie after soche\nsorte, that it might dooe the one thyng and the other: for as moche as\nhavyng set in the corners thereof, a thousande Veliti, I appoincted that\nafter that our ordinaunce had shotte, thei should issue out together\nwith the light horsemen, to get the enemies artillerie: and therfore, I\nmade not my ordinance to shoote again, to the intente, to give no tyme\nto the enemie to shoote: Bicause space could not be given to me, and\ntaken from other men, and for thesame occasion, where I made my\nordinaunce not to shoote the seconde tyme, was for that I would not have\nsuffered the enemie to have shot at al, if I had could: seyng that to\nmynde that the enemies artillerie be unprofitable, there is no other\nremedie, but to assaulte it spedely: for as moche as if the enemies\nforsake it, thou takeste it, if thei will defende it, it is requisite\nthat thei leave it behind, so that being possessed of enemies, and of\nfrendes, it cannot shoote. I would beleve, that with out insamples these\nreasons should suffice you, yet beyng able to shewe olde ensamples, to\nprove my saiynges true, I will. Ventidio commyng to faight a field with\nthe Parthians, whose strength for the moste part, consisted in bowes and\narrowes, he suffered theim almoste to come harde to his campe, before he\ndrewe out his armie, the whiche onely he did, to be able quickly to\nprevent them: and not to give them space to shoote. Cesar when he was in\nFraunce, maketh mencion, that in faighting a battaile with the enemies,\nhe was with so moche furie assaulted of them, that his menne had no time\nto whorle their Dartes, accordyng to the custome of the Romaines:\nwherfore it is seen, that to intende, that a thyng that shooteth farre\nof, beyng in the field, doe not hurte thee, there is no other remedy,\nthen with as moche celeritie as maie bee, to prevente it. An other cause\nmoved me to procede, without shotyng the ordinaunce, whereat\nperadventure you will laugh: yet I judge not that it is to be\ndispraised. Ther is nothyng that causeth greater confusion in an armie,\nthen to hinder mennes fightes: whereby many moste puisaunte armies have\nbeen broken, by meanes their fighte hath been letted, either with duste,\nor with the Sunne: yet there is nothyng, that more letteth the sight\nthen the smoke that the artillerie maketh in shotyng: therfore, I would\nthinke that it wer more wisedome, to suffer the enemie to blinde\nhymself, then to purpose (thou being blind) to go to finde hym: for this\ncause, either I would not shote, or (for that this should not be proved,\nconsidering the reputacion that the artillerie hath) I would place it on\nthe corners of the armie, so that shootyng, it should not with the smoke\nthereof, blinde the front of thesame, whiche is the importaunce of my\nmen. And to prove that it is a profitable thyng, to let the sight of the\nenemie, there maie be brought for insample Epaminondas, whom to blind\nthe enemies armie, whiche came to faight with hym, he caused his light\nhorsemen, to run before the fronte of the enemies, to raise up the\nduste, and to lette their sight, whereby he gotte the victorie. And\nwhere it semeth unto you, that I have guided the shot of the artillerie,\nafter my owne devise, making it to passe over the heddes of my men, I\nanswer you, that most often tymes, and without comparison, the greate\nordinaunce misse the footemen, moche soner than hitte theim: for that\nthe footemen are so lowe, and those so difficult to shoote; that every\nlittle that thou raisest theim, thei passe over the heddes of men: and\nif thei be leveled never so little to lowe, thei strike in the yearth,\nand the blowe cometh not to theim: also the unevenesse of the grounde\nsaveth them, for that every little hillocke, or high place that is,\nbetwene the men and thordinance, letteth the shot therof. And concernyng\nhorsmen, and in especially men of armes, bicause thei ought to stand\nmore close together, then the light horsemen, and for that thei are\nmoche higher, maie the better be stroken, thei maie, untill the\nartillerie have shotte, be kepte in the taile of the armie. True it is,\nthat the Harkebutters doe moche more hurt, and the field peces, then the\ngreate ordinance, for the whiche, the greatest remedy is, to come to\nhande strokes quickly: and if in the firste assaulte, there be slaine\nsome, alwaies there shall bee slaine: but a good capitaine, and a good\narmie, ought not to make a coumpte of a hurte, that is particulare, but\nof a generall, and to imitate the Suizzers, whom never eschue to faight,\nbeyng made afraied of the artillerie: but rather punishe with death\nthose, whiche for feare thereof, either should go out of the ranke, or\nshould make with his body any signe of feare. I made them (so sone as\nthei had shotte) to bee retired into the armie, that thei might leave\nthe waie free for the battaile: I made no more mencion of theim, as of a\nthyng unprofitable, the faight beyng begun. You have also saied, that\nconsideryng the violence of this instrument, many judge the armours, and\nthe auncient orders to be to no purpose, and it semeth by this your\ntalke, that men now a daies, have founde orders and armours, whiche are\nable to defend them against the artillerie: if you knowe this, I would\nbee glad that you would teache it me: for that hetherto, I never sawe\nany, nor I beleve that there can any be founde: so that I would\nunderstande of soche men, for what cause the souldiours on foote in\nthese daies, weare the breastplate, or the corselet of steele, and thei\non horsebacke go all armed: bicause seyng that thei blame the aunciente\narmyng of men as unprofitable, considryng the artillery, thei ought to\ndespise also this? I would understande moreover, for what occasion the\nSuizzers, like unto the auncient orders, make a battaile close together\nof sixe, or eight thousande menne, and for what occasion all other have\nimitated theim, this order bearyng the verie same perill, concernyng the\nartillerie, that those other should beare, whiche should imitate the\nantiquitie. I beleve thei should not knowe what to answere: but if you\nshould aske soche Souldiours, as had some judgement, thei would aunswere\nfirst, that thei go armed, for that though thesame armoure defende theim\nnot from the artillerie: it defendeth them from crossebowes, from Pikes,\nfrom sweardes, from stones, and from all other hurt, that commeth from\nthe enemies, thei would answere also, that thei went close together,\nlike the Suizzers, to be able more easely to overthrow the footemen, to\nbe able to withstand better the horse and to give more difficultie to\nthe enemie to breake them: so that it is seen, that the souldiours have\nto fear, many other thynges besides the ordinance: from which thynges,\nwith the armours, and with the orders, thei are defended: whereof\nfoloweth, that the better that an armie is armed, and the closer that it\nhath the orders, and stronger, so moche the surer it is: so that he that\nis of thesame opinion, that you saie, it behoveth either that he bee of\nsmalle wisedome, or that in this thyng, he hath studied verie little:\nfor as moche as if we see, that so little a parte of the aunciente maner\nof armyng, whiche is used now a daies, that is the pike, and so little a\nparte of those orders, as are the maine battailes of the Suizzers, dooe\nus so moche good, and cause our armies to bee so strong, why ought not\nwe to beleve, that the other armours, and thother orders whiche are\nlefte, be profitable? Seyng that if we have no regard to the artillerie,\nin puttyng our selves close together, as the Suizzers, what other orders\nmaie make us more to feare thesame? For as moche as no order can cause\nus so moche to feare thesame, as those, whiche bryng men together.\nBesides this, if the artillerie of the enemies should not make me\nafraied, in besiegyng a Toune, where it hurteth me with more safegarde,\nbeyng defended of a wall, I beyng not able to prevente it, but onely\nwith tyme, with my artillerie to lette it, after soche sorte that it\nmaie double the blowe as it liste, why should I feare thesame in the\nfield, where I maie quickly prevent it? So that I conclude thus, that\nthe artillerie, according to my opinion, doeth not let, that the\naunciente maners cannot be used, and to shewe the auncient vertue: and\nif I had not talked alreadie with you of this instrument, I would of\nthesame, declare unto you more at length: but I will remit my self to\nthat, whiche then I saied.\nLUIGI. Wee maie now understande verie well, how moche you have aboute\nthe artillerie discoursed: and in conclusion, my thinkes you have\nshewed, that the preventyng it quickly, is the greatest remedie, that\nmaie be had for thesame, beyng in the fielde, and havyng an armie\nagainste you. Upon the whiche there groweth in me a doubte: bicause me\nthinkes, that the enemie might place his ordinaunce in soche wise, in\nhis armie, that it should hurt you, and should be after soche sort\ngarded of the footemen, that it could not be prevented. You have (if you\nremember your self well) in the orderyng of your armie to faight, made\ndistaunces of three yardes, betwene the one battaile and the other,\nmakyng those distaunces fiftene, whiche is from the battailes, to\nthextraordinarie pikes: if thenemie, shuld order his armie like unto\nyours, and should putte the artillerie a good waie within those spaces,\nI beleve that from thens, it should hurte you with their moste greate\nsafegard: bicause menne can not enter into the force of their enemies to\nprevent it.\n[Sidenote: A generall rule againste soche thynges as cannot bee\nwithstoode.]\nFABRICIO. You doubt moste prudently, and I will devise with my self,\neither to resolve you the doubte, or shewe you the remedie: I have tolde\nyou, that continually these battailes, either through goyng, or thorowe\nfaightyng, are movyng, and alwaies naturally, thei come to drawe harde\ntogether, so that if you make the distaunces of a small breadth, where\nyou set the artillerie, in a little tyme thei be shootte up, after soche\nsort, that the artillerie cannot any more shoote: if you make theim\nlarge, to avoide this perill, you incurre into a greater, where you\nthrough those distances, not onely give commoditie to the enemie, to\ntake from you the artillerie, but to breake you: but you have to\nunderstande, that it is impossible to keepe the artillerie betwene the\nbandes, and in especially those whiche go on carriages: For that the\nartillerie goeth one waie, and shooteth an other waie: So that havyng to\ngo and to shoote, it is necessary, before thei shote, that thei tourne,\nand for to tourne theim, thei will have so moche space, that fiftie\ncartes of artillerie, would disorder any armie: therfore, it is mete to\nkepe them out of the bandes, where thei may be overcome in the maner, as\na little afore we have shewed: but admit thei might be kept, and that\nthere might be found a waie betwen bothe, and of soche condicion, that\nthe presyng together of men should not hinder the artillerie, and were\nnot so open that it should give waie to the enemie, I saie, that it is\nremedied moste easely, with makyng distances in thy armie against it,\nwhiche maie give free passage to the shot of those, and so the violence\nthereof shall come to be vain, the which maie be doen moste easely: for\nasmoche, as the enemie mindyng to have his artillerie stand safe, it\nbehoveth that he put them behinde, in the furthest part of the\ndistances, so that the shot of the same, he purposyng that thei hurt not\nhis owne men, ought to passe by right line, and by that very same\nalwaies: and therefore with givyng theim place, easely thei maie bee\navoided: for that this is a generall rule, that to those thynges, whiche\ncannot be withstoode, there must bee given waie, as the antiquitie made\nto the Eliphantes, and to the carres full of hookes. I beleve, ye, I am\nmore then certaine, that it semeth unto you, that I have ordered and\nwonne a battaile after my own maner: notwithstanding, I answeer unto you\nthis, when so moche as I have saied hetherto, should not suffice, that\nit should be impossible, that an armie thus ordered, and armed, should\nnot overcome at the first incounter, any other armie that should bee\nordained, as thei order the armies now adaies, whom most often tymes,\nmake not but one front, havyng no targaettes, and are in soche wise\nunarmed, that thei cannot defende themselves from the enemie at hand,\nand thei order theim after soche sorte, that if thei set their battailes\nby flanck, the one to the other, thei make the armie thinne: if thei put\nthe one behind the other, havyng no waie to receive the one the other,\nthei doe it confusedly, and apt to be easly troubled: and although thei\ngive three names to their armies, and devide them into thre companies,\nvaward, battaile, and rereward, notwithstandyng it serveth to no other\npurpose, then to marche, and to distinguis the lodgynges: but in the\ndaie of battaile, thei binde them all to the first brunte, and to the\nfirst fortune.\nLUIGI. I have noted also in the faightyng of your fielde, how your\nhorsemen were repulced of the enemies horsemen: for whiche cause thei\nretired to the extraordinaire Pikes: whereby grewe, that with the aide\nof theim, thei withstode, and drave the enemies backe? I beleve that the\nPikes maie withstande the horses, as you saie, but in a grosse and\nthicke maine battaile, as the Suizzers make: but you in your army, have\nfor the hedde five rankes of Pikes, and for the flancke seven, so that I\ncannot tell how thei maie bee able to withstande them.\n[Sidenote: A Battaile how greate so ever it bee, cannot atones occupy\nabove v. rankes of Pikes.]\nFABRICIO. Yet I have told you, how sixe rankes of pikes wer occupied at\nones, in the Macedonicall Falangi, albeit you ought to understande, that\na maine battaile of Suizzers, if it were made of a thousande rankes, it\ncannot occupie more then fower, or at the most five: bicause the Pikes\nbe sixe yardes and three quarters longe, one yarde and halfe a quarter,\nis occupied of the handes, wherefore to the firste ranke, there\nremaineth free five yardes and a half, and a halfe quarter of Pike: the\nseconde ranke besides that whiche is occupied with the hande, consumeth\na yarde and half a quarter in the space, whiche remaineth betwene the\none ranke and thother: so that there is not left of pike profitable,\nmore then fower yardes and a halfe: to the thirde ranke, by this verie\nsame reason, there remaineth three yardes and a quarter and a halfe: to\nthe fowerth, twoo yardes and a quarter: to the fift one yard and halfe a\nquarter: the other rankes, for to hurte, be unprofitable, but thei serve\nto restore these firste rankes, as we have declared, and to bee a\nfortificacion to those v. Then if five of their rankes can withstande\nthe horse, why cannot five of ours withstande theim? to the whiche also\nthere lacketh not rankes behinde, that doeth sustain and make them the\nvery same staie, although thei have no pikes as the other. And when the\nrankes of thextraordinarie pikes, which are placed on the flanckes,\nshould seme unto you thinne, thei maie bee brought into a quadrante, and\nput on the flancke nere the twoo battailes, whiche I set in the laste\ncompanie of the armie: From the whiche place, thei maie easely\naltogether succour the fronte, and the backe of the armie, and minister\nhelpe to the horses, accordyng as nede shall require.\nLUIGI. Would you alwaies use this forme of order, when you would pitche\na fielde.\n[Sidenote: An advertiement concernyng the pitchying of a field.]\nFABRICIO. No in no wise: for that you ought to varie the facion of the\narmie, according to the qualitie of the situacion, and the condicion and\nquantitie of the enemie, as before this reasonyng dooe ende, shall bee\nshewed certaine insamples: but this forme is given unto you, not so\nmoche as moste strongeste of all, where in deede it is verie strong, as\nto the intente that thereby you maie take a rule, and an order to learne\nto knowe the waies to ordeine the other: for as moche, as every science\nhath his generalitie, upon the whiche a good part of it is grounded. One\nthing onely I advise you, that you never order an armie, after soche\nsorte, that those that faight afore, cannot bee sucoured of theim,\nwhiche be set behind: bicause he that committeth this errour, maketh the\ngreateste parte of his armie to bee unprofitable, and if it incounter\nany strength, it cannot overcome.\nLUIGI. There is growen in me, upon this parte a doubte. I have seen that\nin the placyng of the battailes, you make the fronte of five on a side,\nthe middeste of three, and the last partes of twoo, and I beleve, that\nit were better to ordain them contrariwise: for that I thinke, that an\narmie should with more difficultie bee broken, when he that should\ncharge upon it, the more that he should entre into the-same, so moche\nthe stronger he should finde it: and the order devised of you, me\nthinkes maketh, that the more it is entered into, so moche the weaker it\nis founde.\n[Sidenote: How the front of the armie ought to bee made; How the middell\npart of the armie ought to be ordered.]\nFABRICIO. If you should remember how to the Triarii, whom were the\nthirde order of the Romain Legions, there were not assigned more then\nsixe hundred men, you would doubt lesse, havyng understode how thei were\nplaced in the laste companie: For that you should see, how I moved of\nthis insample, have placed in the last companie twoo battailes, whiche\nare nine hundred men, so that I come rather (folowyng the insample of\nthe Romaine people) to erre, for havyng taken to many, then to fewe: and\nalthough this insample should suffice, I will tell you the reason, the\nwhich is this. The first fronte of the armie, is made perfectly whole\nand thicke, bicause it must withstande the brunt of the enemies, and it\nhath not to receive in it any of their felowes: and for this, it is\nfitte that it bee full of menne: bicause a fewe menne, should make it\nweake, either thinnesse, or for lacke of sufficiente nomber: but the\nseconde companie, for as moche as it must first receive their frendes,\nto sustain the enemie, it is mete that it have greate spaces, and for\nthis it behoveth, that it be of lesse nomber then the first: for that if\nit wer of greater nomber, or equall, it should bee conveniente, either\nnot to leave the distaunces, the whiche should be disorder, or leavyng\ntheim, to passe the boundes of thoseafore, the whiche should make the\nfacion of the armie unperfecte: and it is not true that you saie, that\nthe enemie, the more that he entereth into the maine battaile, so moche\nthe weaker he findeth it: for that the enemie, can never faight with the\nseconde order, except the first be joined with thesame: so that he\ncometh to finde the middest of the maine battaile more stronger, and not\nmore weaker, havyng to faight with the first, and with the seconde order\naltogether: the verie same happeneth, when the enemie should come to the\nthirde companie: for that there, not with twoo battailes, whiche is\nfounde freshe, but with all the maine battaile he must faight: and for\nthat this last part hath to receive moste men, the spaces therof is\nrequisite to be greatest, and that whiche receiveth them, to be the\nleste nomber.\n[Sidenote: The orderyng of the hinder part of tharmy.]\nLUIGI. It pleaseth me thesame that you have told: but answere me also\nthis: if the five first battailes doe retire betwene the three seconde\nbattailes, and after the eight betwene the twoo thirde, it semeth not\npossible, that the eight beyng brought together, and then the tenne\ntogether, maie bee received when thei bee eight, or when thei be tenne\nin the verie same space, whiche received the five.\n[Sidenote: The retire of the Pikes, to place the Targaet men.]\nFABRICIO. The first thyng that I aunswere is, that it is not the verie\nsame space: For that the five have fower spaces in the middeste, whiche\nretiryng betwene the thre, or betwene the twoo, thei occupie: then there\nremaineth thesame space, that is betwene the one maine battaile and\nother and thesame that is, betwene the battailes, and the extraordinarie\nPikes, al the whiche spaces makes largenesse: besides this, it is to bee\nconsidered, that the battailes kepe other maner of spaces, when thei bee\nin the orders without beyng altered, then when thei be altered: for that\nin the alteracion: either thei throng together, or thei inlarge the\norders: thei inlarge theim, when thei feare so moche, that thei fall to\nfliyng, thei thrust them together, when thei feare in soche wise, that\nthei seke to save them selves, not with runnyng a waie, but with\ndefence: So that in this case, thei should come to be destingueshed, and\nnot to be inlarged. Moreover, the five rankes of the Pikes, that are\nbefore, so sone as thei have begun the faighte, thei ought betwene their\nbattailes to retire, into the taile of the armie, for to give place to\nthe Targaet men, that thei maie faighte: and thei goyng into the taile\nof the armie, maie dooe soche service as the capitain should judge, were\ngood to occupie theim aboute, where in the forward, the faight beyng\nmingled, thei should otherwise bee altogether unprofitable. And for this\nthe spaces ordained, come to bee for the remnaunte of the menne, wide\ninough to receive them: yet when these spaces should not suffice, the\nflankes on the sides be men, and not walles, whom givyng place, and\ninlargyng them selves, maie make the space to containe so moche, that it\nmaie bee sufficient to receive theim.\n[Sidenote: How the pikes that are placed on the flankes of the armie\nought to governe them selves when the rest of the armie is driven to\nretire.]\nLUIGI. The rankes of the extraordinarie Pikes, whiche you place on the\nflanckes of the armie, when the first battailes retire into the second,\nwill you have them to stande still, and remain with twoo homes to the\narmie? Or will you that thei also retire together, with the battailes?\nThe whiche when thei should do, I see not how thei can, havyng no\nbattailes behinde with distaunces that maie receive them.\n[Sidenote: Thexercise of the army in generall; The nomber that is mete\nto be written in the Ansigne of every band of men; The degrees of\nhonours in an armie, whiche soche a man ought to rise by, as should bee\nmade a generall capitain.]\nFABRICIO. If the enemie overcome theim not, when he inforceth the\nbattailes to retire, thei maie stande still in their order, and hurte\nthe enemie on the flanck, after that the firste battailes retired: but\nif he should also overcome theim, as semeth reason, beyng so puisaunte,\nthat he is able to repulce the other, thei also ought to retire: whiche\nthei maie dooe excellently well, although thei have not behinde, any to\nreceive them: bicause from the middest thei maie redouble by right line,\nentring the one ranke into the other, in the maner whereof wee reasoned,\nwhen it was spoken of the order of redoublyng: True it is, that to mynde\nredoublyng to retire backe, it behoveth to take an other waie, then\nthesame that I shewed you: for that I told you, that the second ranke,\nought to enter into the first, the fowerth into the thirde, and so\nfoorth: in this case, thei ought not to begin before, but behinde, so\nthat redoublyng the rankes, thei maie come to retire backewarde not to\ntourne forward: but to aunswere to all thesame, that upon this foughten\nfield by me shewed, might of you bee replied. I saie unto you again,\nthat I have ordained you this armie, and shewed this foughten field for\ntwo causes, thone, for to declare unto you how it is ordered, the other\nto shewe you how it is exercised: thorder, I beleve you understande\nmoste well: and concernyng the exersice, I saie unto you, that thei\nought to be put together in this forme, as often times as maie be: for\nas moche as the heddes learne therby, to kepe their battailes in these\norders: for that to particulare souldiours, it appertaineth to keepe\nwell the orders of every battaile, to the heddes of the battailes, it\nappertaineth to keepe theim well in every order of the armie, and that\nthei knowe how to obeie, at the commaundement of the generall capitain:\ntherefore, it is conveniente that thei knowe, how to joyne the one\nbattaile with thother, that thei maie knowe how to take their place\natones: and for this cause it is mete that thansigne of every battaile,\nhave written in some evident part, the nomber therof: as well for to be\nable to commaunde them, as also for that the capitain, and the\nsouldiours by thesame nomber, maie more easely knowe theim againe: also\nthe maine battailes, ought to be nombred, and to have the nomber in\ntheir principal Ansigne: Therefore it is requisite, to knowe of what\nnomber the maine battaile shall be, that is placed on the left, or on\nthe right horne of what nombers the battailes bee, that are set in the\nfronte, and in the middeste, and so foorthe of the other. The antiquitie\nwould also, that these nombers should bee steppes to degrees, of honors\nof the armies: as for insample, the first degree, is the Peticapitain,\nthe seconde, the hedde of fiftie ordinarie Veliti, the thirde, the\nCenturion, the fowerth, the hedde of the first battaile, the fifte, of\nthe second, the sixt, of the thirde, and so forthe, even to the tenth\nbattaile, the whiche must be honoured in the seconde place, nexte the\ngenerall capitaine of a maine battaile: nor any ought to come to thesame\nhedde, if first, he have not risen up by all these degrees. And bicause\nbesides these heddes, there be the three Conestables of the\nextraordinarie Pikes, and twoo of the extraordinarie Veliti, I would\nthat thei should be in the same degree of the Conestable of the first\nbattaile: nor I would not care, that there were sixe men of like degree,\nto thintent, that every one of them might strive, who should doe beste,\nfor to be promised to be hedde of the seconde battaile. Then every one\nof these heddes, knowyng in what place his battaile ought to be sette\nin, of necessitie it must folowe, that at a sounde of the Trompette, so\nsone as the hedde standarde shall bee erected, all the armie shall be in\ntheir places: and this is the first exercise, whereunto an armie ought\nto bee accustomed, that is to set theim quickly together: and to doe\nthis, it is requisite every daie, and divers times in one daie, to set\nthem in order, and to disorder them.\nLUIGI. What armes would you that thansignes of all the armie, shoul'd\nhave beside the nomber?\n[Sidenote: The armes that oughte to bee in the standarde, and in the\nansignes of an armie; The second and thirde exercise of an armie; The\nfowerth exercise of an armie; The soundes of the instrumentes of\nmusicke, that the antiquitie used in their armies; What is signified by\nthe sounde of the Trompet.]\nFABRICIO. The standarde of the generall Capitaine oughte to have the\narmes of the Prince of the armie, all the other, maie have the verie\nsame armes, and to varie with the fieldes, or to varie with the armes,\nas should seme beste to the Lorde of the armie: Bicause this importeth\nlittle, so that the effect growe, that thei be knowen the one from the\nother. But let us passe to the other exercise: the which is to make them\nto move, and with a convenient pace to marche, and to se, that marehyng\nthei kepe the orders. The third exercise is, that thei learne to handle\nthemselves in thesame maner, whiche thei ought after to handle\ntheimselves in the daie of battaile, to cause the artillerie to shoote,\nand to bee drawen out of the waie, to make the extraordinarie Veliti to\nissue out, after a likenes of an assault, to retire theim: To make that\nthe firste battailes, as though thei wer sore charged, retire into the\nspaces of the second: and after, all into the thirde, and from thens\nevery one to retourne to his place: and in soche wise to use theim in\nthis exercise, that to every manne, all thyng maie be knowen, and\nfamiliar: the which with practise, and with familiaritie, is brought to\npasse moste quickly. The fowerth exercise is, that thei learne to knowe\nby meane of the sounde, and of the Ansigne, the commaundemente of their\ncapitaine: for as moche as that, whiche shall be to them pronounced by\nvoice, thei without other commaundemente, maie understande: and bicause\nthe importaunce of this commaundement, ought to growe of the sounde, I\nshall tell you what soundes the antiquitie used. Of the Lacedemonians,\naccordyng as Tucidido affirmeth, in their armies were used Flutes: for\nthat thei judged, that this armonie, was moste mete to make their armie\nto procede with gravetie, and with furie: the Carthaginens beyng moved\nby this verie same reason, in the first assaulte, used the violone.\nAliatte kyng of the Lidians, used in the warre the violone, and the\nFlutes: but Alexander Magnus, and the Romaines, used hornes, and\nTrumpettes, as thei, that thought by vertue of soche instrumentes, to\nbee able to incourage more the myndes of Souldiours, and make theim to\nfaight the more lustely: but as we have in armyng the armie, taken of\nthe Greke maner, and of the Romaine, so in distrihutyng the soundes, we\nwill keepe the customes of the one, and of the other nacion: therefore,\nnere the generall capitain, I would make the Trompettes to stand, as a\nsounde not onely apt to inflame the armie, but apte to bee heard in all\nthe whole tumoult more, then any other sounde: all the other soundes,\nwhiche should bee aboute the Conestables, and the heddes of maine\nbattailes I would, that thei should bee smalle Drummes, and Flutes,\nsounded not as thei sounde theim now but as thei use to sounde theim at\nfeastes. The capitaine then with the Trompet, should shewe when thei\nmust stande still, and go forward, or tourne backward, when the\nartillerie must shoote, when the extraordinarie Veliti must move, and\nwith the varietie or distinccion of soche soundes, to shewe unto the\narmie all those mocions, whiche generally maie bee shewed, the whiche\nTrompettes, should bee after followed of the Drummes, and in this\nexercise, bicause it importeth moche, it behoveth moche to exercise the\narmie. Concernyng the horsemen, there would be used likewise Trompettes,\nbut of a lesse sounde, and of a divers voice from those of the\nCapitaine. This is as moche as is come into my remembraunce, aboute the\norder of the armie, and of the exercise of thesame.\nLUIGI. I praie you let it not be grevous unto you to declare unto me an\nother thyng, that is, for what cause you made the light horsmen, and the\nextraordinarie Veliti, to goe with cries, rumours, and furie, when thei\ngave the charge? And after in the incountering of the rest of tharmie,\nyou shewed, that the thing folowed with a moste greate scilence? And for\nthat I understande not the occasion of this varietie, I would desire\nthat you would declare it unto me.\n[Sidenote: The cries, and rumours, wher with the firste charge is given\nunto the enemies, and the silence that ought to bee used after, when the\nfaight is ones begunne.]\nFABRICIO. The opinion of auncient capitaines, hath been divers about the\ncommyng to handes, whether thei ought with rumour to go a pace, or with\nscilence to go faire and softely: this laste waie, serveth to kepe the\norder more sure, and to understande better the commaundementes of the\nCapitaine: the firste, serveth to incourage more the mindes of men: and\nfor that I beleve, that respecte ought to bee had to the one, and to the\nother of these twoo thynges, I made the one goe with rumour, and thother\nwith scilence: nor me thinkes not in any wise, that the continuall\nrumours bee to purpose: bicause thei lette the commaundementes, the\nwhiche is a thyng moste pernicious: nor it standeth not with reason,\nthat the Romaines used, except at the firste assaulte to make rumour:\nfor that in their histories, is seen many tymes to have happened, that\nthrough the wordes, and comfortinges of the capitain the souldiours that\nranne awaie, were made to stande to it, and in sundrie wise by his\ncommaundemente, to have varied the orders, the whiche should not have\nfollowed, if the rumoures had been louder then his voyce.\nTHE FOWERTH BOOKE\nLUIGI. Seng that under my governement, a field hath been wonne so\nhonourably, I suppose that it is good, that I tempt not fortune any\nmore, knowyng how variable, and unstable she is: and therefore, I desire\nto give up my governement, and that Zanobi do execute now this office of\ndemaundyng, mindyng to followe the order, whiche concerneth the\nyoungeste: and I knowe he will not refuse this honoure, or as we would\nsaie, this labour, as well for to doe me pleasure, as also for beyng\nnaturally of more stomach than I: nor it shall not make hym afraied, to\nhave to enter into these travailes, where he maie bee as well overcome,\nas able to conquere.\nZANOBI.

I will inforce my self to satisfie you, I will not answere now\ndistinctly to your questions: for that whileste I shall aunswere to one,\nmany tymes it will come to passe, that I muste aunswere to an other. I\nhave tolde you, how I have shewed you a facion of an armie, to the\nintent, that accordyng to thesame, there maie bee given all those\nfacions, that the enemie, and the situacion requireth: For as moche as\nin this case, bothe accordyng to the power thereof, and accordyng to the\nenemie, it proceadeth: but note this, that there is not a more perillous\nfacion, then to deffende moche the front of tharmie, if then thou have\nnot a most puisant, and moste great hoste: otherwise, thou oughtest to\nmake it rather grosse, and of small largenesse, then of moche largenes\nand thin: for when thou hast fewe men in comparison to thenemie, thou\noughtest to seke other remedies, as is to ordain thine army in soche a\nplace, wher thou maiest be fortefied, either through rivers, or by\nmeanes of fennes, after soch sort, that thou canst not bee compassed\naboute, or to inclose thy self on the flanckes with diches, as Cesar did\nin Fraunce. You have to take in this cace, this generall rule, to\ninlarge your self, or to draw in your self with the front, according to\nyour nomber, and thesame of the enemie. For thenemies being of lesse\nnomber, thou oughtest to seke large places, havyng in especially thy men\nwell instructed: to the intent thou maiest, not onely compasse aboute\nthe enemie, but to deffende thy orders: for that in places rough and\ndifficulte, beyng not able to prevaile of thy orders, thou commeste not\nto have any advauntage, hereby grewe, that the Romaines almoste alwaies,\nsought the open fieldes, and advoided the straightes. To the contrarie,\nas I have said, thou oughtest to doe, if thou hast fewe menne, or ill\ninstructed: for that then thou oughteste to seeke places, either where\nthe little nomber maye be saved, and where the small experience dooe not\nhurte thee: Thou oughtest also to chuse the higher grounde, to be able\nmore easily to infest them: notwithstandyng, this advertisment ought to\nbe had, not to ordaine thy armie, where the enemie maie spie what thou\ndoest and in place nere to the rootes of the same, where the enemies\narmie maie come: For that in this case, havyng respecte unto the\nartillerie, the higher place shall gette thee disadvauntage: Bicause\nthat alwaies and commodiously, thou mightest of the enemies artillerie\nbee hurte, without beyng able to make any remedy, and thou couldest not\ncommodiously hurte thesame, beyng hindered by thine owne men. Also, he\nthat prepareth an armie to faight a battaile, ought to have respecte,\nbothe to the Sunne, and to the Winde, that the one and the other, doe\nnot hurte the fronte, for that the one and the other, will let thee the\nsight, the one with the beames, and the other with the duste: and\nmoreover, the Winde hindereth the weapons, whiche are stroken at the\nenemie, and maketh their blowes more feable: and concerning the Sunne,\nit sufficeth not to have care, that at the firste it shine not in the\nface, but it is requisite to consider, that increasyng the daie, it\nhurte thee not: and for this, it should bee requsite in orderyng the\nmen, to have it all on the backe, to the entente it should have to passe\nmoche tyme, to come to lye on the fronte. This waie was observed of\nAniball at Canne, and of Mario against the Cimbrians. If thou happen to\nbe moche inferiour of horses, ordaine thine armie emongeste Vines, and\ntrees, and like impedimentes, as in our time the Spaniardes did, when\nthei overthrewe the Frenchmenne at Cirignuola. And it hath been seen\nmany times, with all one Souldiours, variyng onely the order, and the\nplace, that thei have become of losers victorers: as it happened to the\nCarthageners, whom havyng been overcome of Marcus Regolus divers tymes,\nwere after by the counsaill of Santippo a Lacedemonian, victorious: whom\nmade them to go doune into the plaine, where by vertue of the horses,\nand of Eliphantes, thei were able to overcome the Romaines. It semes\nunto me, accordyng to the auncient insamples that almoste all the\nexcellente Capitaines, when thei have knowen, that the enemie hath made\nstrong one side of his battaile, thei have not set against it, the moste\nstrongest parte, but the moste weakest, and thother moste strongest thei\nhave set against the most weakest: after in the beginning the faighte,\nthei have commaunded to their strongest parte, that onely thei sustaine\nthe enemie, and not to preace upon hym, and to the weaker, that thei\nsuffer them selves to be overcome, and to retire into the hindermoste\nbandes of the armie. This breadeth twoo greate disorders to the enemie:\nthe firste, that he findeth his strongest parte compassed about, the\nsecond is, that semyng unto him to have the victorie, seldome tymes it\nhappeneth, that thei disorder not theim selves, whereof groweth his\nsodain losse. Cornelius Scipio beyng in Spain, againste Asdruball of\nCarthage, and understanding how to Asdruball it was knowen, that he in\nthe orderyng the armie, placed his Legions in the middest, the whiche\nwas the strongest parte of his armie, and for this how Asdruball with\nlike order ought to procede: after when he came to faighte the battaile,\nhe chaunged order, and put his Legions on the hornes of the armie, and\nin the middest, placed all his weakeste men: then commyng to the handes,\nin a sodain those men placed in the middeste, he made to marche softly,\nand the hornes of the armie, with celeritie to make forwarde, so that\nonely the hornes of bothe the armies fought, and the bandes in the\nmiddest, through beyng distaunt the one from the other, joyned not\ntogether, and thus the strongest parte of Scipio, came to faight with\nthe weakest of Asdruball, and overcame hym. The whiche waie was then\nprofitable, but now havyng respect to the artillerie, it cannot be used:\nbicause the same space, whiche should remain in the middest, betwene the\none armie and the other, should give tyme to thesame to shoote: The\nwhiche is moste pernicious, as above is saied: Therefore it is requisite\nto laie this waie aside, and to use, as a little afore we saied, makyng\nall the armie to incounter, and the weakest parte to give place. When a\ncapitaine perceiveth, that he hath a greater armie then his enemie,\nmindyng to compasse hym aboute, before he be aware let hym ordaine his\nfronte equall, to thesame of his adversaries, after, so sone as the\nfaight is begun, let hym make the fronte by a little and little to\nretire, and the flanckes to deffende, and alwaies it shall happen, that\nthe enemie shal find hymself, before he be aware compassed about. When a\ncapitain will faight, as it wer sure not to be broken, let hym ordaine\nhis armie in place, where he hath refuge nere, and safe, either betwene\nFennes, or betwene hilles, or by some strong citee: for that in this\ncase, he cannot bee followed of the enemie, where the enemie maie be\npursued of him: this poincte was used of Aniball, when fortune began to\nbecome his adversarie, and that he doubted of the valiauntnesse of\nMarcus Marcello. Some to trouble the orders of the enemie, have\ncommaunded those that were light armed, to begin the faight, and that\nbeyng begunne, to retire betwene the orders: and when the armies were\nafter buckled together, and that the fronte of either of them were\noccupied in faightyng, thei have made theim to issue out by the flanckes\nof the battaile, and thesame have troubled and broken. If any perceive\nhymself to bee inferiour of horse, he maie besides the waies that are\nalredie shewed, place behinde his horsemen a battaile of Pikes, and in\nfaightyng take order, that thei give waie to the Pikes, and he shall\nremain alwaies superiour. Many have accustomed to use certain fotemenne\nlighte armed, to faighte emong horsemen, the whiche hath been to the\nchivalrie moste greate helpe. Of all those, which have prepared armies\nto the field, be moste praised Aniball and Scipio, when thei fought in\nAfrick: and for that Aniball had his armie made of Carthaginers, and of\nstraungers of divers nacions, he placed in the first fronte thereof\nlxxx. Elephantes, after he placed the straungers, behinde whom he sette\nhis Carthaginers, in the hindermoste place, he putte the Italians, in\nwhom he trusted little: the whiche thing he ordained so, for that the\nstraungers havyng before theim the enemie, and behinde beyng inclosed of\nhis men, could not flie: so that being constrained to faight thei should\novercome, or wearie the Romaines, supposyng after with his freshe and\nvaliaunte men, to be then able easely to overcome the Romaines, beeyng\nwearied. Against this order, Scipio set the Astati, the Prencipi, and\nthe Triarii, in the accustomed maner, to bee able to receive the one the\nother, and to rescue the one the other: he made the fronte of the armie,\nfull of voide spaces, and bicause it should not be perceived but rather\nshould seme united, he filled them ful of veliti, to whom he commaunded,\nthat so sone as the Eliphantes came, thei should avoide, and by the\nordinarie spaces, should enter betwene the Legins, and leave open the\nwaie to the Eliphauntes, and so it came to passe, that it made vaine the\nviolence of theim, so that commyng to handes, he was superiour.\nZANOBI. You have made me to remember, in alledging me this battaile, how\nScipio in faighting, made not the Astati to retire into thorders of the\nPrencipi, but he devided theim, and made theim to retire in the hornes\nof the armie, to thintent thei might give place to the Prencipi, when he\nwould force forwarde: therfore I would you should tell me, what occasion\nmoved hym, not to observe the accustomed order.\n[Sidenote: Cartes full of hookes made to destroie the enemies; The\nremedy that was used against Cartes full of hookes; The straunge maner\nthat Silla used in orderyng his army against Archelaus; How to trouble\nin the faighte the armie of the enemies; A policie of Caius Sulpitius,\nto make his enemies afraied; A policie of Marius againste the Duchmenne;\nA policie of greate importaunce, while a battaile is a faightyng; How\nhorsemen maie bee disordered; How the turke gave the Sophie an\noverthrowe; How the Spaniardes overcame the armie of Amilcare; How to\ntraine the enemie, to his destruccion; A policie of Tullo Hostilio and\nLucius Silla in dessemlyng of a mischaunce; Sertorius slue a man for\ntelling him of the death of one of his capitaines; Howe certaine\ncaptaines have staied their men that hath been running awaie; Attillius\nconstrained his men that ran awaie to tourne again and to faight; How\nPhilip king of Macedonia made his men afraied to run awaie; Victorie\nought with all celeritie to bee folowed; What a capitaine ought to dooe,\nwhen he should chaunce to receive an overthrowe; How Martius overcame\nthe armie of the Carthaginers; A policie of Titus Dimius to hide a\nlosse, whiche he had received in a faight; A general rule; Aniball;\nScipio; Asdruball; A Capitaine ought not to faight without advantage,\nexcepte he be constrained; How advauntage maie bee taken of the enemies;\nFurie withstode, converteth into vilenesse; What maner of men a\ncapitaine ought to have about him continually, to consult withall; The\ncondicions of the capitain of the enemies, and of those that are about\nhym is moste requisite to bee knowen; A timerous army is not to be\nconducted to faight; How to avoide the faightyng of a fielde.]\nFABRICIO. I will tell you. Aniball had putte all the strengthe of his\narmie, in the seconde bande: wherefore Scipio for to set againste\nthesame like strengthe, gathered the Prencipi and the Triarii together:\nSo that the distaunces of the Prencipi, beyng occupied of the Triarii,\nthere was no place to bee able to receive the Astati: and therefore he\nmade the Astati to devide, and to go in the hornes of the armie, and he\ndrewe them not betwene the Prencipi. But note, that this waie of openyng\nthe first bande, for to give place to the seconde, cannot bee used, but\nwhen a man is superiour to his enemie: for that then there is commoditie\nto bee able to dooe it, as Scipio was able: but beyng under, and\nrepulced, it cannot be doen, but with thy manifest ruine: and therefore\nit is convenient to have behinde, orders that maie receive thee, but let\nus tourne to our reasonyng. The auncient Asiaticans, emongest other\nthynges devised of them to hurt the enemies, used carres. The whiche had\non the sides certaine hookes, so that not onely thei served to open with\ntheir violence the bandes, but also to kill with the hookes the\nadversaries: against the violence of those, in thre maners thei\nprovided, either thei sustained theim with the thickenesse of the raies,\nor thei received theim betwene the bandes, as the Eliphantes were\nreceived, or els thei made with arte some strong resistence: As Silla a\nRomaine made againste Archelaus, whom had many of these cartes, whiche\nthei called hooked, who for to sustaine theim, drave many stakes into\nthe grounde, behinde his first bandes of men, whereby the cartes beyng\nstopped, lost their violence. And the newe maner that Silla used against\nhym in orderyng the armie, is to bee noted: for that he put the Veliti,\nand the horse, behinde, and all the heavie armed afore, leavyng many\ndistaunces to be able to sende before those behinde, when necessite\nrequired: whereby the fight beyng begun, with the helpe of the horsemen,\nto the whiche he gave the waie, he got the victorie. To intende to\ntrouble in the faight the enemies armie, it is conveniente to make some\nthyng to growe, that maie make theim afraied, either with showyng of\nnewe helpe that commeth, or with showyng thynges, whiche maie represente\na terrour unto theim: after soche sorte, that the enemies begiled of\nthat sight, maie be afraied, and being made afraied, thei maie easely\nbee overcome: the whiche waies Minutio Rufo used, and Accilio Glabrione\nConsulls of Rome. Caius Sulpitius also set a greate many of sackes upon\nMules, and other beastes unprofitable for the warre, but in soche wise\nordained, that thei semed men of armes, and he commaunded, that thei\nshould appere upon a hill, while he were a faightyng with the\nFrenchemen, whereby grewe his victorie. The verie same did Marius, when\nhe foughte against the Duchemen. Then the fained assaultes availyng\nmoche, whilest the faight continueth, it is conveniente, that the very\nassaultes in deede, dooe helpe moche: inespecially if at unwares in the\nmiddest of the faight, the enemie might bee assaulted behinde, or on the\nside: the whiche hardely maie be doen, if the countrie helpe thee not:\nfor that when it is open, parte of thy men cannot bee hid, as is mete to\nbee doen in like enterprises: but in woddie or hille places, and for\nthis apt for ambusshes parte of thy men maie be well hidden, to be able\nin a sodain, and contrary to thenemies opinion to assaut him, whiche\nthyng alwaies shall be occasion to give thee the victorie. It hath been\nsometyme of greate importaunce, whilest the faighte continueth, to sowe\nvoices, whiche doe pronounce the capitaine of thenemies to be dedde, or\nto have overcome on the other side of the armie: the whiche many times\nto them that have used it, hath given the victorie. The chivalrie of the\nenemies maie bee easely troubled, either with sightes, or with rumours,\nnot used: as Creso did, whom put Camelles againste the horses of the\nadversaries, and Pirrus sette againste the Romaine horsemen Eliphantes,\nthe sighte of whiche troubled and disordered them. In our time, the\nTurke discomfited the Sophi in Persia, and the Soldane in Surria with no\nother, then with the noise of Harkabuses, the whiche in soche wise, with\ntheir straunge rumours, disturbed the horses of those, that the Turke\nmighte easely overcome them: The Spaniardes to overcome the armie of\nAmilcare, put in the firste fronte Cartes full of towe drawen of oxen,\nand comming to handes, thei kindeled fire to thesame, wherfore the oxen\nto flie from the fire, thrust into the armie of Amilcar, and opened it.\nThei are wonte (as we have saied) to begile the enemie in the faight,\ndrawyng him into their ambusshes, where the Countrie is commodious for\nthe same purpose, but where it were open and large, many have used to\nmake diches, and after have covered them lightly with bowes and yearth,\nand lefte certain spaces whole, to be able betnene those to retire:\nafter, so sone as the faight hath been begunne, retiryng by those, and\nthe enemie folowing them, hath fallen in the pittes. If in the faight\nthere happen thee, any accident that maie feare thy souldiours, it is a\nmoste prudente thyng, to knowe how to desemble it, and to pervert it to\ngood, as Tullo Hostilio did, and Lucius Silla: whom seyng while thei\nfought, how a parte of his men wer gone to the enemies side, and how\nthesame thing had verie moche made afraied his men, he made straighte\nwaie throughout all the armie to be understoode, how all thing proceded,\naccordyng to his order: the whiche not onely did not trouble the armie,\nbut it increased in them so moche stomack, that he remained victorious.\nIt happened also to Silla, that havyng sente certaine souldiours to doe\nsome businesse, and thei beyng slain he saied, to the intent his armie\nshould not be made afraied thereby, that he had with crafte sent theim\ninto the handes of the enemies, for that he had found them nothyng\nfaithfull. Sertorius faightyng a battaile in Spaine, slue one, whom\nsignified unto hym the death of one of his capitaines, for feare that\ntellyng the very same to other, he should make theim afraied. It is a\nmoste difficult thyng, an armie beyng now moved to flie, to staie it,\nand make it to faight. And you have to make this distinccion: either\nthat it is all moved, and then to be impossible to tourne it, or there\nis moved a parte thereof, and then there is some remedie. Many Romain\ncapitaines, with making afore those whiche fled, have caused them to\nstaie, making them ashamed of running awaie, as Lucius Silla did, where\nalredy parte of his Legions beyng tourned to flight, driven awaie by the\nmen of Mithridates, he made afore them with a swearde in his hande\ncriyng: if any aske you, where you left your capitaine, saie, we have\nleft hym in Boecia, where he faighteth. Attillius a consull set againste\nthat ran awaie, them that ranne not awaie, and made them to understande,\nthat if thei would not tourne, thei should be slaine of their frendes,\nand of their enemies. Philip of Macedonia understanding how his men\nfeared the Scithian Souldiours, placed behinde his armie, certaine of\nhis moste trustie horsemen, and gave commission to theim, that thei\nshould kill whom so ever fledde: wherfore, his men mindyng rather to die\nfaightyng, then fliyng, overcame. Many Romaines, not so moche to staie a\nflight, as for to give occasion to their men, to make greater force,\nhave whileste thei have foughte, taken an Ansigne out of their owne\nmennes handes, and throwen it emongeste the enemies, and appoincted\nrewardes to hym that could get it again. I doe not beleve that it is out\nof purpose, to joyne to this reasonyng those thynges, whiche chaunce\nafter the faight, in especially beyng brief thinges, and not to be left\nbehinde, and to this reasonyng conformable inough. Therefore I saie, how\nthe fielde is loste, or els wonne: when it is wonne, the victorie ought\nwith all celeritie to be folowed, and in this case to imitate Cesar, and\nnot Aniball, whom staiyng after that he had discomfited the Romaines at\nCanne, loste the Empire of Rome: The other never rested after the\nvictorie, but folowed the enemie beyng broken, with greater violence and\nfurie, then when he assalted hym whole: but when a capitaine dooeth\nloese, he ought to see, if of the losse there maie growe any utilite\nunto hym, inespecially if there remain any residue of tharmie. The\ncommoditie maie growe of the small advertisment of the enemie, whom\nmoste often times after the victorie, becometh negligent, and giveth\nthee occasion to oppresse hym, as Marcius a Romaine oppressed the armie\nof the Carthaginers, whom having slain the twoo Scipions, and broken\ntheir armie, not estemyng thesame remnaunt of menne, whiche with Marcius\nremained a live, were of hym assaulted and overthrowen: for that it is\nseen, that there is no thing so moche to bee brought to passe, as\nthesame, whiche the enemie thinketh, that thou canst not attempte:\nbicause for the moste parte, men bee hurte moste, where thei doubt\nleaste: therefore a capitain ought when he cannot doe this, to devise at\nleast with diligence, that the losse bee lesse hurtfull, to dooe this,\nit is necessarie for thee to use meanes, that the enemie maie not easely\nfolowe thee, or to give him occasion to make delaie: in the first case,\nsome after thei have been sure to lese, have taken order with their\nheddes, that in divers partes, and by divers waies thei should flie,\nhavyng appoincted wher thei should after assemble together: the which\nmade, that thenemie (fearing to devide the armie) was faine to let go\nsafe either all, or the greatest part of them. In the seconde case, many\nhave cast before the enemie, their dearest thinges, to the entent that\nhe tariyng about the spoile, might give them more laisure to flie. Titus\nDimius used no small policie to hide the losse, whiche he had received\nin the faight, for asmoche as havyng fought untill night, with great\nlosse of his menne, he made in the night to be buried, the greatest part\nof them, wherefore in the mornyng, the enemies seyng so many slaine of\ntheirs, and so fewe of the Romaines, belevyng that thei had the\ndisavauntage, ran awaie. I trust I have thus confusedly, as I saied,\nsatisfied in good part your demaunde: in dede about the facions of the\narmies, there resteth me to tell you, how some tyme, by some Capitaines,\nit hath been used to make theim with the fronte, like unto a wedge,\njudgyng to bee able by soche meane, more easely to open the enemies\narmie. Against this facion, thei have used to make a facion like unto a\npaire of sheres, to be able betwene thesame voide place, to receive that\nwedge, and to compasse it about, and to faight with it on every side:\nwhereupon I will that you take this generall rule, that the greatest\nremedie that is used againste a devise of the enemie, is to dooe\nwillingly thesame, whiche he hath devised that thou shalt dooe perforce:\nbicause that doyng it willingly, thou doest it with order, and with thy\nadvauntage, and his disadvauntage, if thou shouldest doe it beyng\ninforced, it should be thy undoyng: For the provyng whereof, I care not\nto reherse unto you, certain thynges alredy tolde. The adversary maketh\nthe wedge to open thy bandes: if thou gowest with them open, thou\ndisorderest hym, and he disordereth not thee. Aniball set the Elephantes\nin the fronte of his armie, to open with theim the armie of Scipio.\nScipio went with it open, and it was the occasion of his victorie, and\nof the ruine of hym. Asdruball placed his strongest men in the middest\nof the fronte of his armie, to overthrowe Scipios menne: Scipio\ncommaunded, that by them selves thei should retire and he broke theim:\nSo that like devises when thei are foreseen, bee the causes of the\nvictorie of him, against whom thei be prepared. There remaineth me also,\nif I remember my self well, to tell you what respectes a Capitaine ought\nto have, before he leade his men to faight: upon whiche I have to tell\nyou firste, how a capitaine ought never to faight a battaile, except he\nhave advauntage, or be constrained. The vantage groweth of the\nsituacion, of the order, of havyng more, or better menne: the necessitie\ngroweth when thou seest how that not faightyng, thou muste in any wise\nlose, as should bee for lackyng of money, and for this, thy armie to bee\nready all maner of waies to resolve, where famishemente is ready to\nassaulte thee, where the enemie looketh to bee ingrosed with newe men:\nin these cases, thou oughtest alwaies to faight, although with thy\ndisadvauntage: for that it is moche better to attempte fortune, where\nshe maie favour thee, then not attemptyng, to see thy certaine ruine:\nand it is as grevous a faulte in this case, in a capitain not to faight,\nas to have had occasion to overcome, and not to have either knowen it\nthrough ignoraunce, or lefte it through vilenesse. The advauntages some\ntymes the enemie giveth thee, and some tymes thy prudence: Many in\npassyng Rivers have been broken of their enemie, that hath been aware\nthereof, whom hath taried, till the one halfe hath been of the one side,\nand the other halfe on the other, and then hath assaulted them: as Cesar\ndid to the Suizzers, where he destroied the fowerth parte of theim,\nthrough beyng halfe over a river. Some tyme thy enemie is founde wearie,\nfor havyng folowed thee to undescritely, so that findyng thy self freshe\nand lustie, thou oughtest not to let passe soche an occasion: besides\nthis, if the enemie offer unto thee in the mornyng betymes to faight,\nthou maiest a good while deferre to issue out of thy lodgyng, and when\nhe hath stoode long in armour, and that he hath loste that same firste\nheate, with the whiche he came, thou maiest then faight with him. This\nwaie Scipio and Metellus used in Spaine: the one against Asdruball, the\nother against Sertorius. If the enemie be deminished of power, either\nfor havyng devided the armie, as the Scipions in Spain, or for some\nother occasion, thou oughteste to prove chaunce. The greateste parte of\nprudent capitaines, rather receive the violence of the enemies, then go\nwith violence to assalte them: for that the furie is easely withstoode\nof sure and steddie menne, and the furie beyng sustained, converteth\nlightly into vilenesse: Thus Fabius did againste the Sannites, and\nagainst the Galles, and was victorious and his felowe Decius remained\nslain. Some fearing the power of their enemies, have begun the faight a\nlittle before night, to the intent that their men chaunsyng to bee\novercome, might then by the helpe of the darkenesse thereof, save theim\nselves. Some havyng knowen, how the enemies armie beyng taken of\ncertaine supersticion, not to faight in soche a tyme, have chosen\nthesame tyme to faighte, and overcome: The whiche Cesar observed in\nFraunce, againste Arionistus, and Vespasian in Surrie, againste the\nJewes. The greatest and moste importaunte advertismente, that a\ncapitaine ought to have, is to have aboute hym faithfull menne, that are\nwise and moste expert in the warre, with whom he must continually\nconsulte and reason of his men, and of those of the enemies, whiche is\nthe greater nomber, whiche is beste armed, or beste on horsebacke, or\nbest exercised, whiche be moste apte to suffer necessitie, in whom he\ntrusteth moste, either in the footemen, or in the horsemen: after thei\nought to consider the place where thei be, and whether it be more to the\npurpose for thenemie, then for him: which of theim hath victualles moste\ncommodious: whether it be good to deferre the battaile, or to faight it:\nwhat good might bee given hym, or taken awaie by tyme: for that many\ntymes, souldiours seyng the warre to be delaied, are greved, and beyng\nwearie, in the pain and in the tediousnesse therof, wil forsake thee. It\nimporteth above all thyng, to knowe the capitain of the enemies, and\nwhom he hath aboute hym, whether he be rashe, or politike, whether he be\nfearfull, or hardie: to see how thou maiest truste upon the aidyng\nsouldiours. And above all thyng thou oughtest to take hede, not to\nconducte the armie to faight when it feareth, or when in any wise it\nmistrusteth of the victorie: for that the greatest signe to lose, is\nthei beleve not to be able to winne: and therfore in this case, thou\noughtest to avoide the faightyng of the fielde, either with doyng as\nFabius Maximus, whom incampyng in strong places, gave no courage to\nAniball, to goe to finde hym, or when thou shouldest thinke, that the\nenemie also in strong places, would come to finde thee, to departe out\nof the fielde, and to devide the menne into thy tounes to thentent that\ntediousnesse of winnyng them, maie wearie hym.\nZANOBI. Cannot the faightyng of the battaile be otherwise avoided, then\nin devidyng the armie in sunderie partes and placyng the men in tounes?\n[Sidenote: Fabius Maximus.]\nFABRICIO. I beleve that ones alreadie, with some of you I have reasoned,\nhow that he, that is in the field, cannot avoide to faight the battaile,\nwhen he hath an enemie, which will faight with hym in any wise, and he\nhath not, but one remedie, and that is, to place him self with his armie\ndistant fiftie miles at leaste, from his adversarie, to be able betymes\nto avoide him, when he should go to finde hym. For Fabius Maximus never\navoided to faight the battaile with Aniball, but he would have it with\nhis advauntage: and Aniball did not presume to bee able to overcome hym,\ngoyng to finde hym in the places where he incamped: where if he had\npresupposed, to have been able to have overcome, it had been conveniente\nfor Fabius, to have fought the battaile with hym, or to have avoided.\n[Sidenote: Philip king of Macedonia, overcome by the Romaines; How\nCingentorige avoided the faightyng of the fielde with Cesar; The\nignorance of the Venecians; What is to be doen wher soldiours desire to\nfaight, contrary to their capitaines minde; How to incourage souldiers;\nAn advertisment to make the soldiour most obstinately to faight.]\nPhilip Kyng of Macedonia, thesame that was father to Perse, commyng to\nwarre with the Romaines, pitched his campe upon a verie high hill, to\nthe entent not to faight with theim: but the Romaines wente to find hym\non thesame hill, and discomfaited hym. Cingentorige capitain of the\nFrenche menne, for that he would not faight the field with Cesar, whom\ncontrarie to his opinion, had passed a river, got awaie many miles with\nhis men. The Venecians in our tyme, if thei would not have come to have\nfought with the Frenche kyng, thei ought not to have taried till the\nFrenche armie, had passed the River Addus, but to have gotten from them\nas Cingentorige, where thei havyng taried knewe not how to take in the\npassyng of the men, the occasion to faight the battaile, nor to avoide\nit: For that the Frenche men beyng nere unto them, as the Venecians went\nout of their Campe, assaulted theim, and discomfited theim: so it is,\nthat the battaile cannot bee avoided, when the enemie in any wise will\nfaight, nor let no man alledge Fabius, for that so moche in thesame\ncase, he did flie the daie of battaile, as Aniball. It happeneth many\ntymes, that thy souldiours be willyng to faight, and thou knoweste by\nthe nomber, and by the situacion, or for some other occasion to have\ndisadvauntage, and desirest to make them chaunge from this desire: it\nhappeneth also, that necessitie, or occasion, constraineth thee to\nfaight, and that thy souldiours are evill to be trusted, and smally\ndisposed to faight: where it is necessarie in thone case, to make theim\nafraied, and in the other to incourage theim: In the firste case, when\nperswacions suffiseth not, there is no better waie, then to give in\npraie, a part of them unto thenemie, to thintent those that have, and\nthose that have not fought, maie beleve thee: and it may very wel be\ndoen with art, thesame which to Fabius Maximus hapned by chaunce.\nTharmie of Fabius (as you knowe) desired to faight with Aniballs armie:\nthe very same desire had the master of his horses: to Fabius it semed\nnot good, to attempte the faight: so that through soche contrary\nopinions, he was fain to devide the armie: Fabius kept his men in the\ncampe, the other fought, and commyng into great perill, had been\noverthrowen, if Fabius had not rescued him: by the whiche insample the\nmaister of the horse, together with all the armie, knewe how it was a\nwise waie to obeie Fabius. Concernyng to incourage theim to faight, it\nshould be well doen, to make them to disdain the enemies, shewyng how\nthei speake slaunderous woordes of them, to declare to have intelligence\nwith them, and to have corrupted part of them, to incampe in place,\nwhere thei maie see the enemies, and make some light skirmishe with\nthem, for that the thyng that is dailie seen, with more facilitie is\ndespised: to shewe theim to bee unworthie, and with an oracion for the\npurpose, to reprehende them of their cowardnesse, and for to make them\nashamed, to tell theim that you will faight alone, when thei will not\nbeare you companie. And you ought above all thyng to have this\nadvertismente, mindyng to make the Souldiour obstinate to faight, not to\npermitte, that thei maie send home any of their substaunce, or to leave\nit in any place, till the warre bee ended, that thei maie understande,\nthat although fliyng save their life, yet it saveth not theim their\ngoodes, the love whereof, is wonte no lesse then thesame, to make men\nobstinate in defence.\nZANOBI. YOU have tolde, how the souldiours maie be tourned to faight,\nwith speakyng to theim: doe you meane by this, that all the armie must\nbee spoken unto, or to the heddes thereof?\n[Sidenote: It is requisite for excellent Capitaines to bee good orators;\nAlexander Magnus used openly to perswade his armie; The effecteousnes of\nspeking; Souldiours ought to be accustomed to heare their Capitaine\nspeake; How in olde time souldiers were threatened for their faltes;\nEnterprises maie the easelier be brought to passe by meanes of religion;\nSertorius; A policie of Silla; A policie of Charles the seventh king of\nFraunce against the Englishmen; How souldiers maiebee made to esteme\nlittle their enemies; The surest wai to make souldiours moste obstinat\nto faight; By what meanes obstinatenesse to faighte is increased.]\nFABRICIO. TO perswade, or to diswade a thyng unto fewe, is verie easie,\nfor that if woordes suffise not, you maie then use aucthoritie and\nforce: but the difficultie is, to remove from a multitude an evill\nopinion, and that whiche is contrary either to the common profite, or to\nthy opinion, where cannot be used but woordes, the whiche is meete that\nthei be heard of every man, mindyng to perswade them all. Wherfore, it\nwas requisite that the excellente Capitaines were oratours: for that\nwithout knowyng how to speake to al the army, with difficultie maie be\nwrought any good thing: the whiche altogether in this our tyme is laied\naside. Rede the life of Alexander Magnus, and you shall see how many\ntymes it was necessarie for hym to perswade, and to speake publikly to\nhis armie: otherwise he should never have brought theim, beyng become\nriche, and full of spoile, through the desertes of Arabia, and into\nIndia with so moche his disease, and trouble: for that infinite tymes\nthere growe thynges, wherby an armie ruinateth, when the capitain either\nknoweth not, or useth not to speake unto thesame, for that this speakyng\ntaketh awaie feare, in courageth the mindes, increaseth the obstinatenes\nto faight, discovereth the deceiptes, promiseth rewardes, sheweth the\nperilles, and the waie to avoide theim, reprehendeth, praieth,\nthreatened, filleth full of hope, praise, shame, and doeth a11 those\nthynges, by the whiche the humaine passions are extincte or kendled:\nwherefore, that prince, or common weale, whiche should appoincte to make\na newe power, and cause reputacion to their armie, ought to accustome\nthe Souldiours thereof, to heare the capitain to speake, and the\ncapitain to know how to speake unto them. In kepyng desposed the\nsouldiours in old tyme, to faight for their countrie, the religion\navailed moche, and the othes whiche thei gave them, when thei led theim\nto warfare: for as moche as in al their faultes, thei threatned them not\nonely with those punishementes, whiche might be feared of men but with\nthose whiche of God might be looked for: the whiche thyng mingled with\nthe other Religious maners, made many tymes easie to the auncient\ncapitaines all enterprises, and will doe alwaies, where religion shall\nbe feared, and observed. Sertorius prevailed, by declaryng that he spake\nwith a Stagge, the whiche in Goddes parte, promised hym the victorie.\nSilla saied, he spoke with an Image, whiche he had taken out of the\nTemple of Apollo. Many have tolde how God hath appered unto them in\ntheir slepe, whom hath admonished them to faight. In our fathers time,\nCharles the seventh kyng of Fraunce, in the warre whiche he made\nagainste the Englishemen, saied, he counsailed with a maide, sent from\nGod, who was called every where the Damosell of Fraunce, the which was\noccacion of his victorie. There maie be also used meanes, that maie make\nthy men to esteme little the enemie, as Agesilao a Spartaine used, whom\nshewed to his souldiours, certain Persians naked, to the intent that\nseyng their delicate members, thei should not have cause to feare them.\nSome have constrained their men to faight through necessitie, takyng\nawaie from them all hope of savyng theim selves, savyng in overcommyng.\nThe whiche is the strongest, and the beste provision that is made, to\npurpose to make the souldiour obstinate to faight: whiche obstinatenesse\nis increased by the confidence, and love of the Capitaine, or of the\ncountrie. Confidence is caused through the armour, the order the late\nvictorie, and the opinion of the Capitaine. The love of the countrie, is\ncaused of nature: that of the Capitain, through vertue, more then by any\nother benefite: the necessities maie be many, but that is strongest,\nwhiche constraineth thee; either to overcome, or to dye.\nTHE FIVETH BOOKE\n[Sidenote: How the Romaines marched with their armies; How the Romaines\nordered their armie when it happened to be assaulted on the waie; How\nthe main battailes ought to marche; The orderyng of an armie after soche\nsorte, that it maie marche safelie through the enemies countrie and be\nalwaies in a redines to faight; The place in the armie wher the bowmen\nand Harkabutters are appoincted; The place in the armie wher\nthextraordinarie Pikes are appoincted.

This waie beyng well and prudently governed, I\nhave thought meete to imitate, sending afore the light horsemen, as\nexploratours of the Countrie: Then havyng fower maine battailes I would\nmake them to marche in araie, and every one with their carriages\nfolowyng theim. And for that there be twoo sortes of carriages, that is\npartainyng to particulare souldiours, and partainyng to the publike use\nof all the Campe, I would devide the publike Carriages into fower\npartes, and to every maine battaile, I would appoinct his parte,\ndeviding also the artillerie into fower partes, and all the unarmed, so\nthat every nomber of armed menne, should equally have their\nimpedimentes. But bicause it happeneth some times, that thei marche\nthrough the countrie, not onely suspected, but so daungerous, that thou\nfearest every hower to be assaulted, thou art constrained for to go more\nsure, to chaunge the forme of marchyng, and to goe in soche wise\nprepared, that neither the countrie menne, nor any armie, maie hurte\nthee, findyng thee in any parte unprovided. In soche case, the aunciente\ncapitaines were wont, to marche with the armie quadrante, whiche so thei\ncalled this forme, not for that it was altogether quadrante, but for\nthat it was apte to faight of fower partes, and thei saied, that thei\nwente prepared, bothe for the waie, and for the faight: from whiche\nwaie, I will not digresse, and I will ordaine my twoo maine battailes,\nwhiche I have taken for to make an armie of, to this effect. Mindyng\ntherefore, to marche safely through the enemies Countrie, and to bee\nable to aunswere hym on every side, when at unwares the armie might\nchaunce to be assaulted, and intendyng therefore, accordyng to the\nantiquitie, to bryng thesame into a square, I would devise to make a\nquadrant, that the rome therof should be of space on every part Clix.\nyardes, in this maner. First I would put the flanckes, distant the one\nflanck from the other, Clix. yardes, and I would place five battailes\nfor a flancke, in a raie in length, and distant the one from the other,\ntwoo yardes and a quarter: the whiche shall occupie with their spaces,\nevery battaile occupiyng thirtie yardes, Clix. yardes. Then betwen the\nhedde and the taile of these two flanckes, I would place the other tenne\nbattailes, in every parte five, orderyng them after soche sorte, that\nfower should joyne to the hedde of the right flanck, and fower to the\ntaile of the lefte flancke, leaving betwene every one of them, a\ndistance of thre yardes: one should after joyne to the hedde of the\nlefte flancke, and one to the taile of the right flancke: and for that\nthe space that is betwene the one flancke and the other, is Clix.\nyardes, and these battailes whiche are set the one to the side of the\nother by breadth, and not by length, will come to occupie with the\ndistaunces one hundred yardes and a halfe yarde, there shall come\nbetwene theim fower battailes, placed in the fronte on the right\nflancke, and the one placed in thesame on the lefte, to remaine a space\nof fiftie and eighte yardes and a halfe, and the verie same space will\ncome to remaine in the battailes, placed in the hinder parte: nor there\nshall bee no difference, saving that the one space shall come on the\nparte behind towardes the right horne, and thother shall come on the\nparte afore, towardes the lefte home. In the space of the lviii. yardes\nand a halfe before, I would place all the ordinarie Veliti, in thesame\nbehinde, the extraordinarie, which wil come to be a thousande for a\nspace, and mindyng to have the space that ought to be within the armie,\nto be every waie Clix. yardes, it is mete that the five battailes,\nwhiche are placed in the hedde, and those whiche are placed in the\ntaile, occupie not any parte of the space, whiche the flanckes keepe:\nand therefore it shall be convenient, that the five battailes behinde,\ndoe touche with the fronte, the taile of their flanckes, and those\nafore, with the taile to touche he hedde, after soche sorte, that upon\nevery corner of the ame armie, there maie remaine a space, to receive an\nother battaile: and for that there bee fower spaces, I would take fower\nbandes of the extraordinarie Pikes, and in every corner I would place\none, and the twoo Ansignes of the foresaied Pikes, whiche shall remain\noverplus, I would sette in the middest of the rome of this armie, in a\nsquare battaile, on the hedde whereof, should stande the generall\ncapitaine, with his menne about him. And for that these battailes\nordeined thus, marche all one waie, but faight not all one waie, in\nputtyng them together, those sides ought to be ordained to faight,\nwhiche are not defended of thother battailes. And therfore it ought to\nbe considered, that the five battailes that be in the front, have all\ntheir other partes defended, excepte the fronte: and therfore these\nought to bee put together in good order, and with the Pikes afore. The\nfive battailes whiche are behinde, have all their sides defended, except\nthe parte behinde, and therefore those ought to bee put together in\nsoche wise, that the Pikes come behind, as in the place therof we shall\nshewe. The five battailes that bee in the right flancke, have all their\nsides defended, except the right flancke. The five that be on the left\nflanck, have all their partes defended, excepte the lefte flancke: and\ntherefore in orderyng the battailes, thei ought to bee made, that the\nPikes maie tourne on the same flanck, that lieth open: and the\nPeticapitaines to stand on the hedde, and on the taile, so that nedyng\nto faight, all the armour and weapons maie be in their due places, the\nwaie to doe this, is declared where we reasoned of the maner of orderyng\nthe battailes. The artillerie I would devide, and one parte I would\nplace without, on the lefte flancke, and the other on the right. The\nlight horsemen, I would sende afore to discover the countrie. Of the\nmenne of armes, I would place part behinde, on the right home, and parte\non the lefte, distante about thirtie yardes from the battailes: and\nconcerning horse, you have to take this for a general rule in every\ncondicion, where you ordaine an armie, that alwaies thei ought to be\nput, either behinde, or on the flanckes of thesame: he that putteth them\nafore, over against the armie, it behoveth hym to doe one of these twoo\nthinges, either that he put them so moche afore, that beyng repulced,\nthei maie have so moche space, that maie give them tyme, to be able to\ngo a side from thy footemen, and not to runne upon them, or to order\nthem in soche wise, with so many spaces, that the horses by those maie\nenter betwene them, without disorderyng them. Nor let no man esteme\nlittle this remembraunce, for as moche as many capitaines, whom havyng\ntaken no hede thereof, have been ruinated, and by themselves have been\ndisordered, and broken. The carriages and the unarmed menne are placed,\nin the rome that remaineth within the armie, and in soche sorte equally\ndevided, that thei maie give the waie easely, to whom so ever would go,\neither from the one corner to the other, or from the one hedde, to the\nother of the armie. These battailes without the artillerie and the\nhorse, occupie every waie from the utter side, twoo hundred and eleven\nyardes and a halfe of space: and bicause this quadrante is made of twoo\nmain battailes, it is convenient to distinguishe, what part thone maine\nbattaile maketh, and what the other: and for that the main battailes are\ncalled by the nomber, and every of theim hath (as you knowe) tenne\nbattailes, and a generall hed, I would cause that the first main\nbattaile, should set the first v. battailes therof in the front, the\nother five, in the left flanck, and the capitain of the same should\nstande in the left corner of the front. The seconde maine battaile,\nshould then put the firste five battailes therof, in the right flanck,\nand the other five in the taile, and the hedde capitain of thesame,\nshould stande in the right corner, whom should come to dooe the office\nof the Tergiductor. The armie ordained in this maner, ought to be made\nto move, and in the marchyng, to observe all this order, and without\ndoubte, it is sure from all the tumultes of the countrie men. Nor the\ncapitain ought not to make other provision, to the tumultuarie\nassaultes, then to give sometyme Commission to some horse, or Ansigne of\nVeliti, that thei set themselves in order: nor it shall never happen\nthat these tumultuous people, will come to finde thee at the drawyng of\nthe swerd, or pikes poincte: for that men out of order, have feare of\nthose that be in araie: and alwaies it shall bee seen, that with cries\nand rumours, thei will make a greate assaulte, without otherwise commyng\nnere unto thee, like unto barking curres aboute a Mastie. Aniball when\nhe came to the hurte of the Romaines into Italie, he passed through all\nFraunce, and alwaies of the Frenche tumultes, he took small regarde.\nMindyng to marche, it is conveniente to have plainers and labourers\nafore, whom maie make thee the waie plaine, whiche shall bee garded of\nthose horsemen, that are sent afore to viewe the countrie: an armie in\nthis order maie marche tenne mile the daie, and shall have tyme inough\nto incampe, and suppe before Sunne goyng doune, for that ordinarely, an\narmie maie marche twentie mile: if it happen that thou be assaulted, of\nan armie set in order, this assaulte cannot growe sodainly: for that an\narmie in order, commeth with his pace, so that thou maiest have tyme\ninough, to set thy self in order to faight the field, and reduce thy\nmenne quickly into thesame facion, or like to thesame facion of an\narmie, which afore is shewed thee. For that if thou be assaulted, on the\nparte afore, thou needeste not but to cause, that the artillerie that be\non the flanckes, and the horse that be behinde, to come before, and\nplace theimselves in those places, and with those distaunces, as afore\nis declared. The thousande Veliti that bee before, must go out of their\nplace, and be devided into CCCCC. for a parte, and go into their place,\nbetwene the horse and the hornes of tharmy: then in the voide place that\nthei shal leave, the twoo Ansignes of the extraordinarie Pikes muste\nentre, whiche I did set in the middest of the quadrante of the armie.\nThe thousande Veliti, whiche I placed behinde, must departe from thesame\nplace, and devide them selves in the flanckes of the battailes, to the\nfortificacion of those: and by the open place that thei shal leave, all\nthe carriages and unarmed menne must go out, and place themselves on the\nbacke of the battaile. Then the rome in the middeste beyng voided, and\nevery man gone to his place: the five battailes, whiche I placed behinde\non the armie, must make forward in the voide place, that is betwene the\none and the other flanck, and marche towardes the battailes, that stand\nin the hedde, and three of theim, muste stande within thirtie yardes of\nthose, with equall distances, betwene the one and the other, and the\nother twoo shal remain behinde, distaunte other thirtie yardes: the\nwhiche facion maie bee ordained in a sodaine, and commeth almoste to bee\nlike, unto the firste disposicion, whiche of tharmy afore we shewed. And\nthough it come straighter in the fronte, it commeth grosser in the\nflanckes, whiche giveth it no lesse strength: but bicause the five\nbattailes, that be in the taile, have the Pikes on the hinder parte, for\nthe occasion that before we have declared, it is necessarie to make\ntheim to come on the parte afore, mindyng to have theim to make a backe\nto the front of tharmie: and therfore it behoveth either to make them to\ntourne battaile after battaile, as a whole body, or to make them quickly\nto enter betwen thorders of targettes, and conduct them afore, the\nwhiche waie is more spedy, and of lesse disorder, then to make them to\nturn al together: and so thou oughtest to doe of all those, whiche\nremain behind in every condicion of assault, as I shal shewe you. If it\nappere that thenemie come on the part behinde, the first thyng that\nought to bee dooen, is to cause that every man tourne his face where his\nbacke stode, and straight waie tharmie cometh to have made of taile,\nhed, and of hed taile: then al those waies ought to be kept, in orderyng\nthesame fronte, as I tolde afore. If the enemie come to incounter the\nright flancke, the face of thy armie ought to bee made to tourne\ntowardes thesame side: after, make all those thynges in fortificacion of\nthesame hedde, whiche above is saied, so that the horsemen, the Veliti,\nand the artillerie, maie be in places conformable to the hed thereof:\nonely you have this difference, that in variyng the hed of those, which\nare transposed, some have to go more, and some lesse. In deede makyng\nhedde of the right flancke, the Veliti ought to enter in the spaces,\nthat bee betwene the horne of the armie, and those horse, whiche were\nnerest to the lefte flancke, in whose place ought to enter, the twoo\nAnsignes of the extraordinarie Pikes, placed in the middest: But firste\nthe carriages and the unarmed, shall goe out by the open place, avoidyng\nthe rome in the middest, and retiryng themselves behinde the lefte\nflancke, whiche shall come to bee then the taile of the armie: the other\nVeliti that were placed in the taile, accordyng to the principall\norderyng of the armie, in this case, shall not move: Bicause the same\nplace should not remaine open, whiche of taile shall come to be flancke:\nall other thyng ought to bee dooen, as in orderyng of the firste hedde\nis saied: this that is told about the makyng hed of the right flanck,\nmust be understode to be told, havyng nede to make it of the left\nflanck: for that the very same order ought to bee observed. If the\nenemie should come grose, and in order to assaulte thee on twoo sides,\nthose twoo sides, whiche he commeth to assaulte thee on, ought to bee\nmade stronge with the other twoo sides, that are not assaulted, doublyng\nthe orders in eche of theim, and devidyng for bothe partes the\nartillerie, the Veliti, and the horse. If he come on three or on fower\nsides, it is necessarie that either thou or he lacke prudence: for that\nif thou shalt bee wise, thou wilte never putte thy self in place, that\nthe enemie on three or fower sides, with a greate nomber of men, and in\norder, maie assault thee: for that mindyng, safely to hurte thee, it is\nrequisit, that he be so great, that on every side, he maie assault thee,\nwith as many men, as thou haste almoste in al thy army: and if thou be\nso unwise, that thou put thy self in the daunger and force of an enemie,\nwhom hath three tymes more menne ordained then thou, if thou catche\nhurte, thou canste blame no man but thy self: if it happen not through\nthy faulte, but throughe some mischaunce, the hurt shall be without the\nshame, and it shal chaunce unto thee, as unto the Scipions in Spaine,\nand to Asdruball in Italie but if the enemie have not many more men then\nthou, and intende for to disorder thee, to assaulte thee on divers\nsides, it shal be his foolishnesse, and thy good fortune: for as moche\nas to doe so, it is convenient, that he become so thinne in soche wise,\nthat then easely thou maiste overthrow one bande, and withstande an\nother, and in short time ruinate him: this maner of ordering an armie\nagainst an enemie, whiche is not seen, but whiche is feared, is a\nnecessarie and a profitable thing, to accustome thy souldiours, to put\nthemselves together, and to march with soche order, and in marchyng, to\norder theimselves to faight, accordyng to the first hedde, and after to\nretourne in the forme, that thei marched in, then to make hedde of the\ntaile, after, of the flanckes, from these, to retourne into the first\nfacion: the whiche exercises and uses bee necessarie, mindyng to have an\narmie, throughly instructed and practised: in whiche thyng the Princes\nand the capitaines, ought to take paine. Nor the discipline of warre is\nno other, then to knowe how to commaunde, and to execute these thynges.\nNor an instructed armie is no other, then an armie that is wel practised\nin these orders: nor it cannot be possible, that who so ever in this\ntime, should use like disciplin shall ever bee broken. And if this\nquadrante forme whiche I have shewed you, is somewhat difficulte, soche\ndifficultnesse is necessarie, takyng it for an exercise: for as moche as\nknowyng well, how to set theim selves in order, and to maintaine theim\nselves in the same, thei shall knowe after more easely, how to stand in\nthose, whiche should not have so moche difficultie.\nZANOBI. I beleve as you saie, that these orders bee verie necessarie,\nand I for my parte, knowe not what to adde or take from it: true it is,\nthat I desire to know of you twoo thynges, the one, if when you will\nmake of the taile, or of the flancke hedde, and would make them to\ntourne, whether this be commaunded by the voice, or with the sounde:\nthother, whether those that you sende afore, to make plain the waie, for\nthe armie to marche, ought to be of the verie same souldiours of your\nbattailes, or other vile menne appoincted, to like exercise.\n[Sidenote: Commaundementes of Capitaines being not wel understoode, maie\nbe the destruction of an armie; Respect that is to be had in\ncommaundementes made with the sounde of the Trompet; In commaundmentes\nmade with the voice, what respect is to be had; Of Pianars.]\nFABRICIO. Your firste question importeth moche: for that many tymes the\ncommaundementes of Capitaines, beyng not well understoode, or evill\ninterpreted, have disordered their armie: therfore the voices, with the\nwhiche thei commaunde in perilles, ought to bee cleare, and nete. And if\nthou commaunde with the sounde, it is convenient to make, that betwene\nthe one waie and the other, there be so moche difference, that the one\ncannot be chaunged for the other: and if thou commaundest with the\nvoice, thou oughteste to take heede, that thou flie the general voices,\nand to use the particulares, and of the particulars, to flie those,\nwhiche maie be interpreted sinisterly. Many tymes the saiyng backe,\nbacke, hath made to ruinate an armie; therfore this voice ought not to\nbe used, but in steede therof to use, retire you. If you will make theim\nto tourne, for to chaunge the hedde, either to flanck, or to backe, use\nnever to saie tourne you, but saie to the lefte, to the right, to the\nbacke, to the front: thus all the other voices ought to be simple, and\nnete, as thrust on, march, stande stronge, forwarde, retourne you: and\nall those thynges, whiche maie bee dooen with the voice, thei doe, the\nother is dooen with the sounde. Concernyng those menne, that must make\nthe waies plaine for the armie to marche, whiche is your seconde\nquestion, I would cause my owne souldiours to dooe this office, as well\nbicause in the aunciente warfare thei did so, as also for that there\nshould be in the armie, lesser nomber of unarmed men, and lesse\nimpedimentes: and I would choose out of every battaile, thesame nomber\nthat should nede, and I would make theim to take the instrumentes, meete\nto plaine the grounde withall, and their weapons to leave with those\nrankes, that should bee nereste them, who should carrie them, and the\nenemie commyng, thei shall have no other to doe, then to take them\nagain, and to retourne into their araie.\nZANOBI. Who shall carrie thinstrumentes to make the waie plaine withall?\nFABRICIO. The Cartes that are appoincted to carrie the like\ninstrumentes.\nZANOBI. I doubte whether you should ever brynge these our souldiours, to\nlabour with Shovell or Mattocke, after soche sorte.\n[Sidenote: The victualles that thantiquitie made provision of, for their\narmies.]\nFABRICIO. All these thynges shall bee reasoned in the place thereof, but\nnow I will let alone this parte, and reason of the maner of the\nvictualing of the armie: for that me thinketh, havyng so moche\ntraivailed theim, it is tyme to refreshe them, and to comfort them with\nmeate. You have to understande, that a Prince ought to ordaine his\narmie, as expedite as is possible, and take from thesame all those\nthynges, whiche maie cause any trouble or burthen unto it, and make unto\nhym any enterprise difficulte. Emongest those thynges that causeth moste\ndifficultie, is to be constrained to keepe the armie provided of wine,\nand baked bread. The antiquitie cared not for Wine, for that lackyng it,\nthei dranke water, mingeled with a little vinegre, to give it a taste:\nFor whiche cause, emong the municions of victualles for the hoste,\nvineger was one, and not wine. Thei baked not the breade in Ovens, as\nthei use for Citees, but thei provided the Meale, and of thesame, every\nSouldiour after his owne maner, satisfied hym self, havyng for\ncondimente Larde and Baken, the whiche made the breade saverie, that\nthei made, and maintained theim strong, so that the provision of\nvictualles for the armie, was Meale, Vineger, Larde, and Bacon, and for\nthe horses Barley. Thei had ordinarely heardes of greate beastes and\nsmall, whiche folowed the armie, the whiche havyng no nede to bee\ncarried, caused not moche impedimente. Of this order there grewe, that\nan armie in old time, marched somtymes many daies through solitarie\nplaces, and difficulte, without sufferyng disease of victualles: for\nthat thei lived of thyngs, whiche easely thei might convey after them.\nTo the contrarie it happeneth in the armies, that are now a daies,\nwhiche mindyng not to lacke wine, and to eate baked breade in thesame\nmaner, as when thei are at home, whereof beyng not able to make\nprovision long, thei remaine often tymes famished, or though thei be\nprovided, it is dooen with disease, and with moste greate coste:\ntherfore I would reduce my armie to this maner of living: and I would\nnot that thei should eate other bread, then that, which by themselves\nthei should bake. Concernyng wine, I would not prohibite the drinkyng\nthereof, nor yet the commyng of it into the armie, but I would not use\nindevour, nor any labour for to have it, and in the other provisions, I\nwould governe my self altogether, like unto the antiquitie: the whiche\nthing, if you consider well, you shall see how moche difficultie is\ntaken awaie, and how moche trouble and disease, an armie and a capitaine\nis avoided of, and how moche commoditie shall bee given, to what so ever\nenterprise is to bee dooen.\nZANOBI. We have overcome thenemie in the field, marched afterward upon\nhis countrie, reason would, that spoiles be made, tounes sacked,\nprisoners taken, therefore I would knowe how the antiquitie in these\nthynges, governed them selves.\n[Sidenote: The occasions why the warres made nowe adaies, doe\nimpoverishe the conquerors as well as the conquered; The order that the\nRomaines toke, concerning the spoile and the booties that their\nsouldiours gotte; An order that the antiquitie tooke, concernyng their\nsoldiours wages.]\nFABRICIO. Beholde, I will satisfie you. I beleve you have considered,\nfor that once alredie with some of you I have reasoned, howe these\npresent warres, impoverishe as well those lordes that overcome, as those\nthat leese: for that if the one leese his estate, the other leeseth his\nmoney, and his movables: the whiche in olde time was not, for that the\nconquerour of the warre, waxed ritche. This groweth of keepyng no compte\nin these daies of the spoiles, as in olde tyme thei did, but thei leave\nit to the discreacion of the souldiours. This manner maketh twoo moste\ngreat disorders: the one, that whiche I have tolde: the other that the\nsouldiour becometh more covetous to spoyle, and lesse observeth the\norders: and manie times it hath been seen, howe the covetousnesse of the\npraye, hath made those to leese, whome were victorious. Therefore the\nRomaines whiche were princes of armies, provided to the one and to the\nother of these inconvenienses, ordainyng that all the spoyle should\napertaine to the publicke, and that the publicke after should bestowe\nit, as shoulde be thought good: and therfore thei had in tharmie the\nquestours, whom were as we would say, the chamberlaines, to whose charge\nall the spoyle and booties were committed: whereof the consull was\nserved to geve the ordinarie pay to the souldiours, to succour the\nwounded, and the sicke, and for the other businesse of the armie. The\nconsull might well, and he used it often, to graunte a spoyle to\nsoldiours: but this grauntyng, made no disorder: for that the armie\nbeyng broken all the pray was put in the middest, and distributed by\nhedde, accordyng to the qualitee of everie man: the which maner thei\nconstituted, to thintente, that the soldiours should attend to overcome,\nand not to robbe: and the Romaine Legions overcame the enemies, and\nfolowed them not, for that thei never departed from their orders: onely\nthere folowed them, the horsemenne with those that were light armed, and\nif there were any other souldiours then those of the legions, they\nlikewyse pursued the chase. Where if the spoyle shoulde have ben his\nthat gotte it, it had not ben possible nor reasonable, to have kepte the\nlegions steddie, and to withstonde manie perils; hereby grewe therefore,\nthat the common weale inritched, and every Consull carried with his\ntriumphe into the treasurie, muche treasure, whiche all was of booties\nand spoiles. An other thing the antiquetie did upon good consideration,\nthat of the wages, whiche they gave to every souldiour, the thirde parte\nthey woulde shoulde be laied up nexte to him, whome carried the ansigne\nof their bande, whiche never gave it them againe, before the warre was\nended: this thei did, beyng moved of twoo reasons, the first was to\nthintente, that the souldiour should thrive by his wages, because the\ngreatest parte of them beyng yonge men, and carelesse, the more thei\nhave, so muche the more without neede thei spende, the other cause was,\nfor that knowyng, that their movabelles were nexte to the ansigne, thei\nshould be constrained to have more care thereof, and with more\nobstinatenesse to defende it: and this made them stronge and to holde\ntogether: all which thynges is necessarie to observe, purposinge to\nreduce the exercise of armes unto the intier perfection therof.\nZANOBI. I beleeve that it is not possible, that to an armie that\nmarcheth from place to place, there fal not perrilous accidentes, where\nthe industerie of the capitaine is needefull, and the worthinesse of the\nsouldiours, mindyng to avoyde them.

I shall contente you with a good will, beyng inespetially\nnecessarie, intendyng to make of this exercise a perfecte science. The\nCapitaines ought above all other thynges, whileste thei marche with an\narmie, to take heede of ambusshes, wherein they incurre daunger twoo\nwaies, either marchynge thou entrest into them, or thoroughe crafte of\nthe enemie thou arte trained in before thou arte aware. In the first\ncase, mindyng to avoide suche perill, it is necessarie to sende afore\ndouble warde, whome may discover the countrey, and so muche the more\ndilligence ought to be used, the more that the countrey is apte for\nambusshes, as be the woddie or hilly countries, for that alwaies thei be\nlayd either in a wodde, or behind a hille: and as the ambusshe not\nforseene, doeth ruin thee, so forseyng the same, it cannot hurte thee.\nManie tymes birdes or muche duste have discovered the enemie: for that\nalwayes where the enemie cometh to finde thee, he shall make great\nduste, whiche shall signifie unto thee his comyng: so often tymes a\nCapitaine seyng in the places where he ought to passe, Doves to rise, or\nother of those birdes that flie in flockes, and to tourne aboute and not\nto light, hath knowen by the same the ambusshe of the enemies to be\nthere, and sendynge before his men, and sertainely understandyng it,\nhath saved him selfe and hurte his enemie. Concernyng the seconde case,\nto be trained in, (which these our men cal to be drawen to the shot)\nthou ought to take heede, not straight way to beleve those thinges,\nwhich are nothyng reasonable, that thei be as they seeme: as shoulde be,\nif the enemie should set afore thee a praie, thou oughtest to beleeve\nthat in the same is the hooke, and that therin is hid the deceipte. If\nmany enemies be driven away by a fewe of thine, if a fewe enemies\nassaulte manie of thine, if the enemies make a sodeine flight, and not\nstandynge with reason, alwaies thou oughtest in suche cases to feare\ndeceipte, and oughtest never to beleeve that the enemie knoweth not how\nto doe his businesse, but rather intendyng that he may begile thee the\nlesse, and mindyng to stand in lesse peril, the weaker that he is, and\nthe lesse craftier that the enemie is, so muche the more thou oughtest\nto esteeme him: and thou muste in this case use twoo sundrie poinctes,\nfor that thou oughtest to feare him in thy minde and with the order, but\nwith wordes, and with other outewarde demonstracion, to seeme to dispyse\nhim: because this laste way, maketh that the souldiours hope the more to\nhave the victorie: the other maketh thee more warie, and lesse apte to\nbe begyled. And thou hast to understand, that when men marche thoroughe\nthe enemies countrey, they ar in muche more, and greater perils, then in\nfayghtyng the fielde: and therefore the Capitaine in marchyng, ought to\nuse double diligence: and the first thyng that he ought to doo, is to\nget described, and payncted oute all the countrie, thorough the which he\nmust marche, so that he maye know the places, the number, the distances,\nthe waies, the hilles, the rivers, the fennes, and all the quallites of\nthem: and to cause this to bee knowen, it is convenient to have with him\ndiversly, and in sundrie maners such men, as know the places, and to\naske them with diligence, and to se whether their talke agree, and\naccordyng to the agreyng therof, to note: he oughte also to sende afore\nthe horsemen, and with them prudente heddes, not so muche to discover\nthe enemie, as to viewe the countrey, to se whether it agree with the\ndescription, and with the knowledge that they have of the same. Also the\nguydes that are sente, ought to be kepte with hope of rewarde, and feare\nof paine. And above all thynges it ought to be provided, that the armie\nknowe not to what businesse he leadeth them: for that there is nothyng\nin the warre more profitable, then to keepe secret the thynges that is\nto be dooen: and to thintente a suddeine assaulte dooe not trouble thy\nsoldiours, thou oughteste to see them to stande reddie with their\nweapons, because the thynges that ar provided for, offend lesse. Manie\nfor to avoyde the confusion of marchyng, have placed under the\nstanderde, the carriages, and the unarmed, and have commaunded them to\nfolow the same, to the intente that in marchyng needyng to staye, or to\nretire, they might dooe it more easely, which thyng as profitable, I\nalowe very muche. Also in marchyng, advertismente ought to be had, that\nthe one parte of the armie goe not a sunder from the other, or that\nthoroughe some goyng fast, and some softe, the armie become not slender:\nthe whiche thynges, be occation of dissorder: therfore the heddes muste\nbe placed in suche wise, that they may maintaine the pace even, causing\nto goe softe those that goe to fast, and to haste forward the other that\ngoe to sloe, the whiche pace can not bee better ruled, then by the\nstroke of the drumme. The waies ought to be caused to be inlarged, so\nthat alwaies at least a bande of iiii. hundred men may marche in order\nof battaile. The custome and the qualitie of the enemie ought to be\nconsidered, and whether that he wil assaulte thee either in the mornyng,\nor at none or in the evenynge, and whether he be more puisante with\nfotemen or horsemen, and accordyng as thou understandest, to ordeine and\nto provide for thy self. But let us come to some particular accidente.\nIt hapneth sometime, that thou gettyng from the enemie, because thou\njudgest thy selfe inferiour, and therfore mindynge not to faight with\nhim, and he comyng at thy backe, thou arivest at the banke of a river,\npassyng over the which, asketh time, so that the enemie is redie to\novertake thee and to fayght with thee. Some, which chaunsing to bee in\nsuche perill, have inclosed their armie on the hinder parte with a\ndiche, and fillyng the same full of towe, and firyng it, have then\npassed with the armie without beyng able to be letted of the enemie, he\nbeyng by the same fire that was betwene them held backe.\n[Sidenote: Annone of Carthage.]\nZANOBI. I am harde of beliefe, that this fyre coulde stay theim, in\nespecially because I remember that I have harde, howe Annone of\nCarthage, beyng besieged of enemies, inclosed him selfe on the same\nparte, with wodde, which he did set on fire where he purposed to make\neruption. Wherfore the enemies beyng not intentive on the same parte to\nlooke to him, he made his armie to passe over the same flame, causing\nevery man to holde his Target before his face for to defend them from\nthe fire, and smoke.\n[Sidenote: Nabide a spartayne; Quintus Luttatius pollecie to passe over\na river; How to passe a ryver without a bridge; A polecie of Cesar to\npasse a river, where his enemie beyng on the other side therof sought to\nlette hym.]\nFABRICIO. You saye well: but consider you howe I have saied, and howe\nAnnone did: for as muche as I saied that they made a diche, and filled\nit with towe, so that he, that woulde passe over the same, should be\nconstrained to contende with the diche and with fire: Annone made the\nfire, without the diche, and because he intended to passe over it, he\nmade it not great, for that otherwise without the diche, it shoulde have\nletted him. Dooe you not knowe, that Nabide a Spartan beyng besieged in\nSparta of the Romaines, set fire on parte of his towne to let the way to\nthe Romaines, who alredie wer entred in? And by meane of the same flame\nnot onely hindered their way, but drave them oute: but let us turne to\nour matter. Quintus Luttatius a Romaine, havyng at his backe the Cimbri,\nand commyng to a river, to thentente the enemie should give him time to\npasse over, semed to geve time to them to faight with him: and therfore\nhe fained that he would lodge there, and caused trenches to be made, and\ncertaine pavilions to be erected, and sent certayne horsemen into the\ncountrie for forredge: so that the Cimbrise beleevyng, that he incamped,\nthey also incamped, and devided them selves into sundrie partes, to\nprovide for victuals, wherof Luttatius being aware, passed the river\nthey beyng not able to let him. Some for to passe a river havynge no\nbridge, have devided it, and one parte they have turned behynde their\nbackes, and the other then becomynge shalower, with ease they have\npassed it: when the rivers be swift, purposyng to have their footemen to\npasse safely, they place their strongest horses on the higher side, that\nthei may sustain the water, and an other parte be lowe that may succour\nthe men, if any of the river in passyng should be overcome with the\nwater: They passe also rivers, that be verie deepe, with bridges, with\nbotes, and with barrelles: and therfore it is good to have in a\nredinesse in an armie wherewith to be able to make all these thynges. It\nfortuneth sometime that in passyng a river, the enemie standynge agaynst\nthee on the other banke, doeth let thee: to minde to overcome this\ndifficultie, I know not a better insample to folow, then the same of\nCesar, whome havynge his armie on the banke of a river in Fraunce, and\nhis passage beynge letted of Vergintorige a Frenche man, the whiche on\nthe other side of the river had his men, marched many daies a longe the\nriver, and the like did the enemie: wherfore Cesar incamping in a woddie\nplace, apte to hide men, he tooke out of every legion three cohortes,\nand made them to tarie in the same place, commaundynge theim that so\nsoone as he was departed, they shoulde caste over a bridge, and should\nfortefie it, and he with his other menne folowed on the waye: wherfore\nVergintorige seyng the number of the legions, thinkyng that there was\nnot left anie parte of theim behinde, folowed also his way: but Cesar\nwhen he supposed that the bridge was made, tourned backewarde, and\nfindynge all thinges in order, passed the river without difficultee.\nZANOBI. Have ye any rule to know the foordes?\n[Sidenote: How to know the Foordes of a river.]\nFABRICIO. Yea, we have: alwaies the river, in that parte, whiche is\nbetwene the water, that is stilleste, and the water that runneth\nfastest, there is least depth and it is a place more meete to be looked\non, then any other where. For that alwaies in thesame place, the river\nis moste shallowest. The whiche thyng, bicause it hath been proved many\ntymes, is moste true.\nZANOBI.

The remedie is to make hardels of roddes whiche must be placed\nin the bottome of the river, and so to passe upon those: but let us\nfolowe our reasonyng. If it happen that a capitain be led with his\narmie, betwen two hilles, and that he have not but twoo waies to save\nhymself, either that before, or that behinde, and those beyng beset of\nthenemies, he hath for remidie to doe the same, which some have doen\nheretofore: that which have made on their hinder parte a greate trenche,\ndifficult to passe over, and semed to the enemie, to mynde to kepe him\nof, for to be able with al his power, without neding to feare behinde,\nto make force that waie, whiche before remaineth open. The whiche the\nenemies belevyng, have made theim selves stronge, towardes the open\nparte, and have forsaken the inclosed and he then castyng a bridge of\nwoode over the Trenche, for soche an effect prepared, bothe on thesame\nparte, with out any impedimente hath passed, and also delivered hymself\nout of the handes of the enemie. Lucius Minutus a Consul of Rome, was in\nLiguria with an armie, and was of the enemies inclosed, betwene certaine\nhilles, whereby he could not go out: therefore he sente certaine\nsouldiours of Numidia on horsebacke, whiche he had in his armie (whom\nwere evill armed, and upon little leane horses) towardes the places that\nwere kepte of the enemies, whom at the first sight made the enemies, to\norder theim selves together, to defende the passage: but after that thei\nsawe those men ill apoincted, and accordyng to their facion evill\nhorsed, regardyng theim little, enlarged the orders of their warde,\nwherof so sone as the Numidians wer a ware, givyng the spurres to their\nhorses, and runnyng violently upon theim, passed before thei could\nprovide any remedy, whom beyng passed, destroied and spoiled the\ncountrie after soche sorte, that thei constrained the enemies, to leave\nthe passage free to the armie of Lucius. Some capitaine, whiche hath\nperceived hymself to be assaulted of a greate multitude of enemies, hath\ndrawen together his men, and hath given to the enemie commoditie, to\ncompasse hym all about, and then on thesame part, whiche he hath\nperceived to be moste weake, hath made force, and by thesame waie, hath\ncaused to make waie, and saved hymself.\nMarcus Antonius retiryng before the armie of the Parthians, perceived\nhow the enemies every daie before Sunne risyng, when he removed,\nassaulted him, and all the waie troubled hym: in so moch, that he\ndetermined not to departe the nexte daie, before None: so that the\nParthians beleving, that he would not remove that daie, retourned to\ntheir tentes. Whereby Marcus Antonius might then all the reste of the\ndaie, marche without any disquietnesse. This self same man for to avoide\nthe arrowes of the Parthians, commaunded his men, that when the\nParthians came towardes them, thei should knele, and that the second\nranke of the battailes, should cover with their Targaettes, the heddes\nof the firste, the thirde, the seconde, the fowerth the third, and so\nsuccessively, that all the armie came, to be as it were under a\npentehouse, and defended from the shotte of the enemies. This is as\nmoche as is come into my remembraunce, to tell you, which maie happen\nunto an armie marchyng: therefore, if you remember not any thyng els, I\nwill passe to an other parte.\nTHE SIXTHE BOOKE\nZANOBI. I beleve that it is good, seyng the reasonyng must be chaunged,\nthat Baptiste take his office, and I to resigne myne, and wee shall come\nin this case, to imitate the good Capitaines (accordyng as I have nowe\nhere understoode of the gentilman) who place the beste souldiours,\nbefore and behinde the armie, semyng unto theim necessarie to have\nbefore, soche as maie lustely beginne the faight, and soche as behinde\nmaie lustely sustaine it.

Therfore be contente sir, to folowe your reasonyng, and if we\ninterrupte you with this practise of ours, have us excused.\n[Sidenote: How the Grekes incamped; Howe the Romaines incamped; The\nmaner of the incamping of an armie; The lodging for the generall\ncapitaine.]\nFABRICIO. You dooe me, as all readie I have saied, a moste greate\npleasure; for this your interrupting me, taketh not awaie my fantasie,\nbut rather refresheth me. But mindyng to followe our matter I saie, how\nthat it is now tyme, that we lodge this our armie, for that you knowe\nevery thyng desireth reste and saftie, bicause to reste, and not to\nreste safely, is no perfecte reste: I doubte moche, whether it hath not\nbeen desired of you, that I should firste have lodged them, after made\ntheim to marche, and laste of all to faight, and we have doen the\ncontrary: whereunto necessitie hath brought us, for that intendyng to\nshewe, how an armie in going, is reduced from the forme of marching, to\nthesame maner of faightyng, it was necessarie to have firste shewed, how\nthei ordered it to faight. But tournyng to our matter, I saie, that\nminding to have the Campe sure, it is requisite that it be strong, and\nin good order: the industrie of the Capitaine, maketh it in order, the\nsituacion, or the arte, maketh it stronge. The Grekes sought strong\nsituacions, nor thei would never place theim selves, where had not been\neither cave, or bancke of a river, or multitude of trees, or other\nnaturall fortificacion, that might defende theim: but the Romaines not\nso moche incamped safe through the situacion, as through arte, nor thei\nwould never incampe in place, where thei should not have been able to\nhave raunged all their bandes of menne, accordyng to their discipline.\nHereby grewe, that the Romaines might kepe alwaies one forme of\nincamping, for that thei would, that the situacion should bee ruled by\nthem, not thei by the situacion: the which the Grekes could not observe,\nfor that beyng ruled by the situacion, and variyng the situacion and\nforme, it was conveniente, that also thei should varie the maner of\nincampyng, and the facion of their lodgynges. Therefore the Romaines,\nwhere the situacion lacked strength thei supplied thesame with arte, and\nwith industrie. And for that I in this my declaracion, have willed to\nimitate the Romaines, I will not departe from the maner of their\nincamping, yet not observyng altogether their order, but takyng thesame\nparte, whiche semeth unto me, to be mete for this present tyme. I have\ntold you many tymes, how the Romaines had in their consull armies, twoo\nLegions of Romaine men, whiche were aboute a leven thousande footemen,\nand sixe hundred horsemen, and moreover thei had an other leven\nthousande footemen, sente from their frendes in their aide: nor in their\narmie thei had never more souldiers that were straungers, then Romaines,\nexcepte horsemenne, whom thei cared not, though thei were more in nomber\nthen theirs: and in all their doynges, thei did place their Legions in\nthe middeste, and the aiders, on the sides: the whiche maner, thei\nobserved also in incampyng, as by your self you maie rede, in those\naucthoures, that write of their actes: and therefore I purpose not to\nshewe you distinctly how thei incamped, but to tell you onely with what\norder, I at this presente would incampe my armie, whereby you shall then\nknowe, what parte I have taken out of the Romaine maners. You knowe,\nthat in stede of twoo Romaine Legions, I have taken twoo maine battailes\nof footemen, of sixe thousande footemen, and three hundred horsemen,\nprofitable for a maine battaile, and into what battailes, into what\nweapons, into what names I have devided theim: you knowe howe in\norderyng tharmie to marche, and to faight, I have not made mencion of\nother men, but onely have shewed, how that doublyng the men, thei neded\nnot but to double the orders: but mindyng at this presente, to shew you\nthe maner of incampyng, me thinketh good not to stande onely with twoo\nmaine battailes, but to bryng together a juste armie, made like unto the\nRomaines, of twoo maine battailes, and of as many more aidyng men: the\nwhiche I make, to the intent that the forme of the incampyng, maie be\nthe more perfect, by lodgyng a perfecte armie: whiche thyng in the other\ndemonstracions, hath not semed unto me so necessarie. Purposing then, to\nincampe a juste armie, of xxiiii. thousande footemen, and of twoo\nthousande good horsemenne, beeyng devided into fower maine battailes,\ntwoo of our owne menne, and twoo of straungers, I would take this waie.\nThe situacion beyng founde, where I would incampe, I would erecte the\nhed standarde, and aboute it, I would marke out a quadrant, whiche\nshould have every side distante from it xxxvii. yardes and a half, of\nwhiche every one of them should lye, towardes one of the fower regions\nof heaven, as Easte, Weste, Southe, and Northe: betwene the whiche\nspace, I would that the capitaines lodgyng should be appoincted. And\nbicause I beleve that it is wisedom, to devide the armed from the\nunarmed, seyng that so, for the moste parte the Romaines did, I would\ntherefore seperate the menne, that were cumbered with any thing, from\nthe uncombered. I would lodge all, or the greatest parte of the armed,\non the side towardes the Easte, and the unarmed, and the cumbred, on the\nWeste side, makyng Easte the hedde, and Weste the backe of the Campe,\nand Southe, and Northe should be the flanckes: and for to distinguishe\nthe lodgynges of the armed, I would take this waie. I would drawe a line\nfrom the hedde standarde, and lead it towardes the Easte, the space of\nCCCCC.x. yardes and a half: I would after, make two other lines, that\nshould place in the middeste the same, and should bee as longe as that,\nbut distante eche of theim from it a leven yardes and a quarter: in the\nende whereof, I would have the Easte gate, and the space that is betwene\nthe twoo uttermoste lines, should make a waie, that should go from the\ngate, to the capitaines lodging, whiche shall come to be xxii. yardes\nand a halfe broad, and CCCClxxii. yardes and a halfe longe, for the\nxxxvii. yardes and a halfe, the lodgyng of the Capitaine will take up:\nand this shall bee called the Capitaine waie. Then there shall be made\nan other waie, from the Southe gate, to the Northe gate, and shall passe\nby the hedde of the capitaine waie, and leave the Capitaines lodgyng\ntowardes theaste, whiche waie shalbe ix.C.xxxvii. yardes and a halfe\nlong (for the length therof wilbe as moche as the breadth of all the\nlodgynges) and shall likewise be xxii. yardes and a half broad, and\nshalbe called the crosse waie. Then so sone as the Capitaines lodgyng,\nwere appoincted out, and these twoo waies, there shall bee begun to be\nappoincted out, the lodginges of our own two main battailes, one of the\nwhiche, I would lodge on the right hand of the capitaines waie, and the\nother, on the lefte: and therefore passing over the space, that the\nbreadth of the crosse waie taketh, I would place xxxii. lodgynges, on\nthe lefte side of the capitain waie, and xxxii. on the right side,\nleavyng betwene the xvi. and the xvii. lodgyng, a space of xxii. yardes\nand a halfe, the whiche should serve for a waie overthwart, whiche\nshould runne overthwarte, throughout all the lodgynges of the maine\nbattailes as in the distributyng of them shall bee seen.\n[Sidenote: The lodgings for the men of armes, and their Capitaine; Note,\nwhich is breadth and whiche length in the square campe; The lodgings for\nthe lighte horsemen, and their capitain; The lodgings for the footemen\nof twoo ordinary main battailes; The lodgings for the conestables; The\nnomber of footemen appoincted to every lodging; The lodynges for the\nchiefe Capitaines of the maine battayles and for the treasurers,\nmarshals and straungers; Lodginges for the horsemen, of the\nextraordinarie mayne battailes; The lodgynges for the extraordinarie\nPykes and Veliti; How the Artillerie must be placed in the Campe;\nLodgynges for the unarmed men, and the places that are apoineted for the\nimpedimentes of the campe.]\nOf these twoo orders of lodgynges in the beginnyng of the head, whiche\nshall come to joygne to the crosse waye, I would lodge the Capitaine of\nthe men of armes, in the xv. lodgynges, which on everie side foloweth\nnext, their men of armes, where eche main battaile, havyng a CL. men of\narmes, it will come to ten men of armes for a lodgyng. The spaces of the\nCapitaines lodgynges, should be in bredth xxx. and in length vii. yardes\nand a halfe. And note that when so ever I sai bredeth, it signifieth the\nspace of the middest from Southe to Northe, and saiyng length, that\nwhiche is from weste to Easte.

You have noted how I have lodged the CCC.\nhorsemen of everie main battaile with their Capitaines, in xxxii.\nlodgynges placed on the Captaine waie, havynge begun from the crosse\nwaie, and how from the xvi. to the xvii. there remaineth a space of\nxxii. yardes and a halfe, to make awaie overthwarte. Mindyng therefore\nto lodge the xx. battailes, which the twoo ordinarie maine battailes\nhave, I woulde place the lodgyng of everie twoo battailes, behinde the\nlodgynges of the horsemen, everie one of whiche, should have in length\nxi. yardes and a quarter, and in bredeth xxii. yardes and a half as\nthose of the horsemens, and shoulde bee joigned on the hinder parte,\nthat thei shoulde touche the one the other. And in every first lodgyng\non everie side which cometh to lie on the crosse waie, I woulde lodge\nthe Counstable of a battaile, whiche should come to stand even with the\nlodgyng of the Capitayne of the men of armes, and this lodgyng shall\nhave onely of space for bredeth xv. yardes, and for length vii. yardes\nand a halfe. In the other xv. lodgynges, that on everie side followeth\nafter these, even unto the overthwarte way, I would lodge on everie part\na battaile of foote men, whiche beyng iiii. hundred and fiftie, there\nwill come to a lodgyng xxx. The other xv. lodgynges, I woulde place\ncontinually on every side on those of the light horse men, with the\nverie same spaces, where I woulde lodge on everie part, an other\nbattaile of fote men, and in the laste lodgyng, I would place on every\nparte the Conestable of the battaile, whiche will come to joigne with\nthe same of the Capitaine of the lighte horsemen, with the space of vii.\nyardes and a halfe for length, and xv. for bredeth: and so these two\nfirste orders of lodgynges, shal be halfe of horsemen, and halfe of\nfootemen. And for that I woulde (as in the place therof I have tolde\nyou) these horse menne shoulde be all profitable, and for this havynge\nno servauntes whiche in kepyng the horses, or in other necessarie\nthynges might helpe them, I woulde that these footemen, who lodge\nbehynde the horse, should bee bounde to helpe to provide, and to keepe\ntheim for their maisters: and for this to bee exempted from the other\ndoynges of the Campe. The whiche maner, was observed of the Romanies.\nThen leavyng after these lodgynges on everie parte, a space of xxii.\nyardes and a halfe, whiche shoulde make awaye, that shoulde be called\nthe one, the firste waye on the righte hande, and the other the firste\nwaie on the lefte hand, I woulde pitche on everie side an other order of\nxxxii. double lodgynges, whiche should tourne their hinder partes the\none againste the other with the verie same spaces, as those that I have\ntolde you of, and devided after the sixtenth in the verie same maner for\nto make the overthwarte waie, where I would lodge on every side iiii.\nbattailes of footemen, with their constables in bothe endes. Then\nleavyng on every side an other space of xxii. yardes and a halfe, that\nshoulde make a waie, whiche shoulde be called of the one side, the\nseconde waie on the right hande, and on the other syde, the seconde way\non the lefte hande, I would place an other order on everie side of\nxxxii. double lodgynges, with the verie same distance and devisions,\nwhere I would lodge on everie side, other iiii. battailes with their\nConstables: and thus the horesemenne and the bandes of the twoo\nordinarie maine battailes, should come to be lodged in three orders of\nlodgynges, on the one side of the capitaine waie, and in three other\norders of lodgynges on the other side of the Capitaine waie. The twoo\naidyng maine battels (for that I cause them to be made of the verie same\nnation) I woulde lodge them on everie parte of these twoo ordinarie\nmaine battailes, with the very same orders of double lodgynges, pitchyng\nfirst one order of lodgynges, where should lodge halfe the horsemen, and\nhalf the foote men, distance xxii. yardes and a halfe from the other,\nfor to make a way whiche should be called the one, the thirde waie on\nthe right hande, and the other the thirde waie on the lefte hande. And\nafter, I woulde make on everie side, twoo other orders of lodgynges, in\nthe verie same maner destinguesshed and ordeined, as those were of the\nordinarie maine battelles, which shall make twoo other wayes, and they\nall should be called of the numbre, and of the hande, where thei should\nbe placed: in suche wyse, that all this side of the armie, shoulde come\nto be lodged in xii. orders of double lodgynges, and in xiii. waies,\nreckenynge captaine waie, and crosse waie: I would there should remayne\na space from the lodgynges to the Trenche of lxxv. yardes rounde aboute:\nand if you recken al these spaces, you shall see that from the middest\nof the Capitaines lodgyng to the easte gate, there is Dx. yardes. Now\nthere remaineth twoo spaces, whereof one is from the Capitaines lodgyng\nto the Southe gate, the other is from thense to the Northe gate: whiche\ncome to be (either of them measurynge them from the poincte in the\nmiddest) CCCC.lxxvi. yardes. Then takyng out of everie one of these\nspaces xxxvii. yardes and a halfe, whiche the Capitaynes lodgynge\noccupieth, and xxxiiii. yardes everie waie for a market place, and xxii.\nyardes and a halfe for way that devides everie one of the saied spaces\nin the middest, and lxxv. yardes, that is lefte on everie part betweene\nthe lodgynges and the Trenche, there remaineth on every side a space for\nlodginges of CCC. yardes broade, and lxxv. yardes longe, measurynge the\nlength with the space that the Captaines lodgynge taketh up. Devidynge\nthen in the middest the saied lengthe, there woulde be made on every\nhande of the Capitaine xl. lodgynges xxxvii. yardes and a halfe longe,\nand xv. broade, whiche will come to be in all lxxx. lodgynges, wherin\nshall be lodged the heddes of the maine battailes, the Treasurers, the\nMarshalles of the fielde, and all those that shoulde have office in the\narmie, leavyng some voide for straungers that shoulde happen to come,\nand for those that shall serve for good will of the Capitaine. On the\nparte behinde the Capitaines lodgynge, I would have a way from Southe to\nNorthe xxiii. yardes large, and shoulde be called the bed way, whiche\nshall come to be placed a longe by the lxxx. lodgynges aforesayd: for\nthat this waie, and the crosseway, shall come to place in the middest\nbetweene them bothe the Capitaines lodgynge, and the lxxx. lodgynges\nthat be on the sides therof. From this bed waie, and from over agaynst\nthe captaines lodgyng, I would make an other waie, which shoulde goe\nfrom thens to the weste gate, lykewyse broade xxii. yardes and a halfe,\nand should aunswer in situation and in length to the Captaine way, and\nshould be called the market waie. These twoo waies beynge made, I woulde\nordeine the market place, where the market shall bee kepte, whiche I\nwoulde place on the head of the market way over against the capitaines\nlodgynge, and joigned to the head way, and I woulde have it to be\nquadrante, and woulde assigne lxxxx. yardes and three quarters to a\nsquare: and on the right hande and lefte hande, of the saied market\nplace, I would make two orders of lodginges, where everie order shal\nhave eight double lodginges, which shall take up in length, ix. yardes,\nand in bredeth xxii. yardes and a halfe, so that there shall come to be\non every hande of the market place, xvi. lodgynges that shall place the\nsame in the middest which shall be in al xxxii. wherin I woulde lodge\nthose horsemen, which shoulde remaine to the aidyng mayne battailes: and\nwhen these should not suffise, I woulde assigne theim some of those\nlodginges that placeth between them the Capitaines lodgynge, and in\nespecially those, that lie towardes the Trenche. There resteth now to\nlodge the Pikes, and extraordinarie Veliti, that everie main battaile\nhath, which you know accordynge to our order, how everie one hath\nbesides the x. battailes M. extraordinarie Pikes, and five hundreth\nVeliti: so that the twoo cheefe maine battailes, have two thousande\nextraordinarie Pikes, and a thousande extraordinarie Veliti, and the\nayders as many as those, so that yet there remaineth to be lodged, vi.\nM. menne, whome I woulde lodge all on the weste side, and a longe the\nTrenche. Then from the ende of the hed waye, towardes Northe, leavyng\nthe space of lxxv. yardes from them to the trenche, I woulde place an\norder of v. double lodgynges, whiche in all shoulde take up lvi. yardes\nin lengthe, and xxx. in bredeth: so that the bredeth devided, there will\ncome to everie lodgyng xi. yardes and a quarter for lengthe, and for\nbredeth twoo and twentie yardes and a half. And because there shall be\nx. lodgynges, I will lodge three hundred men, apoinctyng to every\nlodging xxx. men: leavyng then a space of three and twentie yardes and a\nquarter, I woulde place in like wise, and with like spaces an other\norder of five double lodgynges, and againe an other, till there were\nfive orders of five double lodgynges: which wil come to be fiftie\nlodgynges placed by right line on the Northe side, every one of them\ndistante from the Trenche lxxv. yardes, which will lodge fifteene\nhundred men. Tournyng after on the lefte hande towardes the weste gate,\nI woulde pitche in all the same tracte, whiche were from them to the\nsaied gate, five other orders of double lodgynges, with the verie same\nspaces, and with the verie same maner: true it is, that from the one\norder to the other, there shall not be more then a xi. yardes and a\nquarter of space: wherin shall be lodged also fifteene hundred men: and\nthus from the Northe gate to the weste, as the Trenche turneth, in a\nhundred lodginges devided in x. rewes of five double lodgynges in a\nrowe, there will be lodged all the Pikes and extraordinarie Veliti of\nthe cheefe maine battayles. And so from the west gate to the Southe, as\nthe Trenche tourneth even in the verie same maner, in other ten rewes of\nten lodgynges in a rewe, there shall be lodged the pikes, and\nextraordinarie Veliti of the aidyng mayne battailes. Their headdes or\ntheir counstables may take those lodgynges, that shal seeme unto them\nmoste commodious, on the parte towardes the trenche. The Artillerie, I\nwoulde dispose throughoute all the Campe, a longe the banke of the\nTrenche: and in all the other space that shoulde remaine towardes weste,\nI woulde lodge all the unarmed, and place all the impedimentes of the\nCampe. And it is to be understoode, that under this name of impedimentes\n(as you know) the antiquitee mente all the same trayne, and all those\nthynges, which are necessarie for an armie, besides the souldiours: as\nare Carpenters, Smithes, Masons, Ingeners, Bombardiers, althoughe that\nthose might be counted in the numbre of the armed, herdemen with their\nherdes of motons and beeves whiche for victuallyng of the armie, are\nrequiset: and moreover maisters of all sciences, together with publicke\ncarriages of the publicke munition, whiche pertaine as well to\nvictuallyng, as to armynge. Nor I would not distinguishe these lodginges\nperticularly, only I would marke out the waies which should not be\noccupied of them: then the other spaces, that betweene the waies shall\nremaine, whiche shall be fower, I woulde appoincte theim generally for\nall the saied impedimentes, that is one for the herdemen, the other for\nartificers and craftes men, the thirde for publicke carriages of\nvictuals, the fowerth for the municion of armour and weapons. The waies\nwhiche I woulde shoulde be lefte without ocupiyng them, shal be the\nmarket waie, the head waye, and more over a waie that shoulde be called\nthe midde waye, whiche should goe from Northe to Southe, and should\npasse thoroughe the middest of the market waie, whiche from the weste\nparte, shoulde serve for the same purpose that the overthwarte way doeth\non the east parte. And besides this, a waye whiche shall goe aboute on\nthe hinder parte, alonge the lodgynges of the Pikes and extraordinarie\nVeliti, and all these wayes shall be twoo and tweentie vardes and a\nhalfe broade. And the Artilerie, I woulde place a longe the Trenche of\nthe Campe, rounde aboute the same.\nBAPTISTE. I confesse that I understand not, nor I beleeve that also to\nsaye so, is any shame unto me, this beyng not my exercise:\nnotwithstandyng, this order pleaseth me muche: onely I woulde that you\nshoulde declare me these doubtes: The one, whie you make the waie, and\nthe spaces aboute so large. The other, that troubleth me more, is these\nspaces, whiche you apoincte oute for the lodgynges, howe they ought to\nbe used.\n[Sidenote: The Campe ought to be all waies of one facion.]\nFABRICIO. You must note, that I make all the waies, xxii. yardes and a\nhalfe broade, to the intente that thorowe them, maie go a battaile of\nmen in araie, where if you remember wel, I tolde you how every bande of\nmenne, taketh in breadth betwene xviii. and xxii. yardes of space to\nmarche or stande in. Nowe where the space that is betwene the trenche,\nand the lodgynges, is lxxv. yardes broade, thesame is moste necessarie,\nto the intent thei maie there order the battailes, and the artillerie,\nbothe to conducte by thesame the praies, and to have space to retire\ntheim selves with newe trenches, and newe fortificacion if neede were:\nThe lodginges also, stande better so farre from the diches, beyng the\nmore out of daunger of fires, and other thynges, whiche the enemie,\nmight throwe to hurte them. Concernyng the seconde demaunde, my intent\nis not that every space, of me marked out, bee covered with a pavilion\nonely, but to be used, as tourneth commodious to soch as lodge there,\neither with more or with lesse Tentes, so that thei go not out of the\nboundes of thesame. And for to marke out these lodginges, there ought to\nbee moste cunnyng menne, and moste excellente Architectours, whom, so\nsone as the Capitaine hath chosen the place, maie knowe how to give it\nthe facion, and to distribute it, distinguishyng the waies, devidyng the\nlodgynges with Coardes and staves, in soche practised wise, that\nstraight waie, thei maie bee ordained, and devided: and to minde that\nthere growe no confusion, it is conveniente to tourne the Campe, alwaies\none waie, to the intente that every manne maie knowe in what waie, in\nwhat space he hath to finde his lodgyng: and this ought to be observed\nin every tyme, in every place, and after soche maner, that it seme a\nmovyng Citee, the whiche where so ever it goweth, carrieth with it the\nverie same waies, the verie same habitacions, and the verie same\naspectes, that it had at the firste: The whiche thing thei cannot\nobserve, whom sekyng strong situacions, must chaunge forme, accordyng to\nthe variacion of the grounde: but the Romaines in the plaine, made\nstronge the place where thei incamped with trenches, and with Rampires,\nbicause thei made a space about the campe, and before thesame a ditche,\nordinary broad fower yardes and a halfe, and depe aboute twoo yardes and\na quarter, the which spaces, thei increased, according as thei intended\nto tarie in a place, and accordyng as thei feared the enemie. I for my\nparte at this presente, would not make the listes, if I intende not to\nWinter in a place: yet I would make the Trenche and the bancke no lesse,\nthen the foresaied, but greater, accordyng to necessitie. Also,\nconsideryng the artellerie, I would intrench upon every corner of the\nCampe, a halfe circle of ground, from whens the artillerie might\nflancke, whom so ever should seke to come over the Trenche. In this\npractise in knowyng how to ordain a campe, the souldiours ought also to\nbe exercised, and to make with them the officers expert, that are\nappoincted to marke it out, and the Souldiours readie to knowe their\nplaces: nor nothyng therein is difficulte, as in the place thereof shall\nbee declared: wherefore, I will goe forewarde at this tyme to the warde\nof the campe, bicause without distribucion of the watche, all the other\npain that hath been taken, should be vain.\nBAPTISTE. Before you passe to the watche, I desire that you would\ndeclare unto me, when one would pitche his campe nere the enemie, what\nwaie is used: for that I knowe not, how a man maie have tyme, to be able\nto ordaine it without perill.\nFABRICIO. You shall understande this, that no Capitaine will lye nere\nthe enemie, except he, that is desposed to faight the fielde, when so\never his adversarie will: and when a capitaine is so disposed, there is\nno perill, but ordinarie: for that the twoo partes of the armie, stande\nalwaies in a redinesse, to faight the battaile, and thother maketh the\nlodginges. The Romaines in this case, gave this order of fortifiyng the\nCampe, unto the Triarii: and the Prencipi, and the Astati, stoode in\narmes. This thei did, for as moche as the Triarii, beyng the last to\nfaight, might have time inough, if the enemie came, to leave the woorke,\nand to take their weapons, and to get them into their places. Therfore,\naccordyng unto the Romaines maner, you ought to cause the Campe to be\nmade of those battailes, whiche you will set in the hinder parte of the\narmie, in the place of the Triarii. But let us tourne to reason of the\nwatche.\n[Sidenote: Theantiquitie used no Scoutes; The watche and warde of the\nCampe.]\nI thinke I have not founde, emongest the antiquitie, that for to warde\nthe campe in the night, thei have kepte watche without the Trenche,\ndistaunte as thei use now a daies, whom thei call Scoutes: the whiche I\nbeleve thei did, thinkyng that the armie might easely bee deceived,\nthrough the difficultie, that is in seeyng them againe, for that thei\nmight bee either corrupted, or oppressed of the enemie: So that to\ntruste either in parte, or altogether on them, thei judged it perillous.\nAnd therefore, all the strength of the watche, was with in the trenche,\nwhiche thei did withall diligence kepe, and with moste greate order,\npunished with death, whom so ever observed not thesame order: the whiche\nhow it was of them ordained, I will tell you no other wise, leaste I\nshould bee tedious unto you, beyng able by your self to see it, if as\nyet you have not seen it: I shall onely briefly tell that, whiche shall\nmake for my purpose, I wold cause to stand ordinarely every night, the\nthirde parte of the armie armed, and of thesame, the fowerth parte\nalwaies on foote, whom I would make to bee destributed, throughout all\nthe banckes, and throughout all the places of the armie, with double\nwarde, placed in every quadrante of thesame: Of whiche, parte should\nstande still, parte continually should go from the one corner of the\nCampe, to the other: and this order, I would observe also in the daie,\nwhen I should have the enemie nere.\n[Sidenote: Dilligence ought to be used, to knowe who lieth oute of the\nCampe, and who they be that cometh of newe; Claudius Nero; The justice\nthat ought to be in a campe. The fauts that the antiquitie punisshed\nwith Death; Where greate punishementes be, there oughte likewise to bee\ngreat rewardes; It was no marvel that the Romaines became mightie\nPrinces; A meane to punishe and execute Justice, without raising\ntumultes; Manlius Capitolinus; Souldiours sworen to kepe the discipline\nof warre.]\nConcernyng the givyng of the watche worde, and renuyng thesame every\nevening, and to doe the other thynges, whiche in like watches is used,\nbicause thei are thynges well inough knowen, I will speake no further of\nthem: onely I shall remember one thyng, for that it is of greate\nimportaunce, and whiche causeth great saulfgarde observyng it, and not\nobservyng it, moche harme: The whiche is, that there be observed greate\ndiligence, to knowe at night, who lodgeth not in the Campe, and who\ncommeth a newe: and this is an easie thing to see who lodgeth, with\nthesame order that wee have appoincted: for as moche as every lodgyng\nhavyng the determined nomber of menne, it is an easie matter to see, if\nthei lacke, or if there be more menne: and when thei come to be absente\nwithout lisence, to punishe them as Fugetives, and if there bee more, to\nunderstande what thei be, what they make there, and of their other\ncondicions. This diligence maketh that the enemie cannot but with\ndifficultie, practise with thy capitaines, and have knowlege of thy\ncounsailes: which thing if of the Romaines, had not been diligently\nobserved, Claudius Nero could not, havyng Aniball nere hym, depart from\nhis Campe, whiche he had in Lucania, and to go and to retourne from\nMarca, without Aniball should have firste heard thereof some thyng. But\nit suffiseth not to make these orders good, excepte thei bee caused to\nbee observed, with a greate severtie: for that there is nothyng that\nwould have more observacion, then is requisite in an armie: therefore\nthe lawes for the maintenaunce of thesame, ought to be sharpe and harde,\nand the executour therof moste harde. The Romaines punished with death\nhim that lacked in the watch, he that forsoke the place that was given\nhym to faight in, he that caried any thynge, hidde out of the Campe, if\nany manne should saie, that he had doen some worthy thing in the faight,\nand had not doen it, if any had fought without the commaundemente of the\nCapitaine, if any had for feare, caste awaie his weapons: and when it\nhappened, that a Cohorte, or a whole Legion, had committed like fault,\nbicause thei would not put to death all, thei yet tooke al their names,\nand did put them in a bagge, and then by lotte, thei drue oute the\ntenthe parte, and so those were put to death: the whiche punishemente,\nwas in soche wise made, that though every man did not feele it every man\nnotwithstandyng feared it: and bicause where be greate punishementes,\nthere ought to be also rewardes, mindyng to have menne at one instant,\nto feare and to hope, thei had appoincted rewardes to every worthie\nacte: as he that faighting, saved the life of one of his Citezeins, to\nhym that firste leapte upon the walle of the enemies Toune, to hym that\nentered firste into the Campe of the enemies, to hym that had in\nfaightyng hurte, or slaine the enemie, he that had stroken him from his\nhorse: and so every vertuous act, was of the Consulles knowen and\nrewarded, and openly of every manne praised: and soche as obtained\ngiftes, for any of these thynges, besides the glorie and fame, whiche\nthei got emongest the souldiours, after when thei returned into their\ncountrie, with solemne pompe, and with greate demonstracion emong their\nfrendes and kinsfolkes, thei shewed them. Therefore it was no marveile,\nthough thesame people gotte so moche dominion, having so moche\nobservacion in punishemente, and rewarde towardes theim, whom either for\ntheir well doyng, or for their ill doyng, should deserve either praise\nor blame: Of whiche thynges it were convenient, to observe the greater\nparte. Nor I thinke not good to kepe secrete, one maner of punishmente\nof theim observed, whiche was, that so sone as the offendour, was before\nthe Tribune, or Consulle convicted, he was of the same lightely stroken\nwith a rodde: after the whiche strikyng, it was lawfull for the\noffendour to flie, and to all the Souldiours to kill hym: so that\nstraight waie, every man threwe at hym either stones, or dartes, or with\nother weapons, stroke hym in soche wise, that he went but little waie a\nlive, and moste fewe escaped, and to those that so escaped, it was not\nlawfull for them to retourne home, but with so many incommodities, and\nsoche greate shame and ignomie, that it should have ben moche better for\nhim to have died. This maner is seen to be almoste observed of the\nSuizzers, who make the condempned to be put to death openly, of thother\nsouldiours, the whiche is well considered, and excellently dooen: for\nthat intendyng, that one be not a defendour of an evill doer, the\ngreateste reamedie that is founde, is to make hym punisher of thesame:\nbicause otherwise, with other respecte he favoureth hym: where when he\nhymself is made execucioner, with other desire, he desireth his\npunishemente, then when the execucion commeth to an other. Therefore\nmindyng, not to have one favored in his faulte of the people, a greate\nremedie it is, to make that the people, maie have hym to judge. For the\ngreater proofe of this, thinsample of Manlius Capitolinus might be\nbrought, who being accused of the Scenate, was defended of the people,\nso longe as thei were not Judge, but becommyng arbitratours in his\ncause, thei condempned hym to death. This is then a waie to punishe,\nwithout raisyng tumultes, and to make justise to be kepte: and for as\nmoche as to bridell armed menne, neither the feare of the Lawes, nor of\nmenne suffise not, the antiquitie joined thereunto the aucthoritie of\nGod: and therefore with moste greate Ceremonies, thei made their\nsouldiours to sweare, to kepe the discipline of warre, so that doyng\ncontrariewise, thei should not onely have to feare the Lawes, and menne,\nbut God: and thei used all diligence, to fill them with Religion.\n[Sidenote: Women and idell games, were not suffered by the antiquitie,\nto bee in their armies.]\nBAPTISTE. Did the Romaines permitte, that women might bee in their\narmies, or that there might be used these idell plaies, whiche thei use\nnow a daies.\nFABRICIO. Thei prohibited the one and thother, and this prohibicion was\nnot moche difficulte: For that there were so many exercises, in the\nwhiche thei kept every daie the souldiours, some whiles particularely,\nsomewhiles generally occupied that thei had no time to thinke, either on\nVenus, or on plaies, nor on any other thyng, whiche sedicious and\nunproffitable souldiours doe.\nBAPTISTE. I am herein satisfied, but tell me, when the armie had to\nremove, what order kepte thei?\n[Sidenote: Ordre in the removing the armie by the soundes of a Trumpet.]\nFABRICIO. The chief Trumpet sounded three tymes, at the firste sound,\nthei toke up the Tentes, and made the packes, at the seconde, thei laded\nthe carriage, at the thirde, thei removed in thesame maner aforsaied,\nwith the impedimentes after every parte of armed men, placyng the\nLegions in the middeste: and therefore you ought to cause after thesame\nsorte, an extraordinarie maine battaile to remove: and after that, the\nparticulare impedimentes therof, and with those, the fowerth part of the\npublike impedimentes, which should bee all those, that were lodged in\none of those partes, whiche a little afore we declared: and therfore it\nis conveniente, to have every one of them, appointed to a maine\nbattaile, to the entente that the armie removyng, every one might knowe\nhis place in marchyng: and thus every maine battaile ought to goe awaie,\nwith their owne impedimentes, and with the fowerth parte of the publike\nimpedimentes, followyng after in soche maner, as wee shewed that the\nRomaines marched.\nBAPTISTE. In pitchyng the Campe, had thei other respectes, then those\nyou have tolde?\n[Sidenote: Respectes to be had for incampyng; How to choose a place to\nincampe; How to avoide diseases from the armie; The wonderfull\ncommoditie of exercise; The provision of victualles that ought alwaies\nto bee in a readinesse in an armie.]\nFABRICIO. I tell you again, that the Romaines when thei encamped, would\nbe able to kepe the accustomed fashion of their maner, the whiche to\nobserve, thei had no other respecte: but concernyng for other\nconsideracions, thei had twoo principall, the one, to incampe theim\nselves in a wholesome place, the other, to place themselves, where\nthenemie could not besiege theim, nor take from them the waie to the\nwater, or victualles. Then for to avoide infirmitie, thei did flie from\nplaces Fennie, or subjecte to hurtfull windes: whiche thei knewe not so\nwell, by the qualitie of the situacion, as by the face of the\ninhabitours: for when thei sawe theim evill coloured, or swollen, or\nfull of other infeccion, thei would not lodge there: concernyng thother\nrespecte to provide not to be besieged, it is requisite to consider the\nnature of the place, where the friendes lye, and thenemies, and of this\nto make a conjecture, if thou maiest be besieged or no: and therefore it\nis meete, that the Capitaine be moste experte, in the knowlege of\nsituacions of countries, and have aboute him divers men, that have the\nverie same expertenes. Thei avoide also diseases, and famishment, with\ncausyng the armie to kepe no misrule, for that to purpose to maintain it\nin health, it is nedefull to provide, that the souldiours maie slepe\nunder tentes, that thei maie lodge where bee Trees, that make shadowe,\nwhere woodde is for to dresse their meate, that thei go not in the\nheate, and therefore thei muste bee drawen out of the campe, before daie\nin Summer, and in Winter, to take hede that thei marche not in the\nSnowe, and in the Froste, without havyng comoditie to make fire, and not\nto lack necessarie aparel, nor to drink naughtie water: those that fall\nsicke by chaunce, make them to bee cured of Phisicions: bicause a\ncapitain hath no reamedie, when he hath to faight with sicknesse, and\nwith an enemie: but nothing is so profitable, to maintaine the armie in\nhealth, as is the exercise: and therfore the antiquitie every daie, made\nthem to exercise: wherby is seen how muche exercise availeth: for that\nin the Campe, it kepeth thee in health, and in the faight victorious.\nConcernyng famishemente, it is necessarie to see, that the enemie hinder\nthee not of thy victualles, but to provide where thou maieste have it,\nand to see that thesame whiche thou haste, bee not loste: and therefore\nit is requisite, that thou have alwaies in provision with the armie,\nsufficiente victuall for a monethe, and then removyng into some strong\nplace, thou muste take order with thy nexte frendes, that daily thei\nmaie provide for thee, and above al thinges bestowe the victual with\ndiligence, givyng every daie to every manne, a reasonable measure, and\nobserve after soche sorte this poincte, that it disorder thee not:\nbicause all other thyng in the warre, maie with tyme be overcome, this\nonely with tyme overcometh thee: nor there shall never any enemie of\nthyne, who maie overcome thee with famishemente, that will seeke to\novercome thee with iron. For that though the victory be not so\nhonourable, yet it is more sure and more certaine: Then, thesame armie\ncannot avoide famishemente, that is not an observer of justice, whiche\nlicenciously consumeth what it liste: bicause the one disorder, maketh\nthat the victualls commeth not unto you, the other, that soche victuall\nas commeth, is unprofitably consumed: therefore thantiquitie ordained,\nthat thei should spende thesame, whiche thei gave, and in thesame tyme\nwhen thei appoincted: for that no souldiour did eate, but when the\nCapitaine did eate: The whiche how moche it is observed of the armies\nnowe adaies, every manne knoweth, and worthely thei can not bee called\nmenne of good order and sober, as the antiquitie, but lasivious and\ndrunkardes.\nBAPTISTE. You saied in the beginnyng of orderynge the Campe, that you\nwoulde not stande onely uppon twoo maine battailes, but woulde take\nfower, for to shewe how a juste armie incamped: therfore I would you\nshoulde tell me twoo thynges, the one, when I shoulde have more or lesse\nmen, howe I ought to incampe them, the other, what numbre of souldiours\nshould suffice you to faight against what so ever enemie that were.\n[Sidenote: Howe to lodge in the Campe more or lesse menne, then the\nordinarie; The nombre of men that an army ought to be made of, to bee\nable to faighte with the puisantest enemie that is; Howe to cause men to\ndo soche a thing as shold bee profitable for thee, and hurtfull to them\nselves; Howe to overcome menne at unwares; How to tourne to commoditie\nthe doynges of soche, as use to advertise thy enemie of thy\nproceadynges; How to order the campe, that the enemie shal not perceive\nwhether the same bee deminished, or increased; A saiyng of Metellus;\nMarcus Crassus; How to understand the secretes of thy enemie; A policie\nof Marius, to understande howe he might truste the Frenchmen; What some\nCapitaines have doen when their countrie have been invaded of enemies;\nTo make the enemie necligente in his doynges; Silla Asdruball; The\npolicie of Aniball, where by he escaped out of the danger of Fabius\nMaximus; A Capitayne muste devise how to devide the force of his\nenemies; How to cause the enemie to have in suspect his most trusty men;\nAniball Coriolanus; Metellus against Jugurte; A practis of the Romayne\noratours, to bryng Aniball out of Credit with Antiochus; Howe to cause\nthe enemie to devide his power; Howe Titus Didius staied his enemies\nthat wer going to incounter a legion of men that were commyng in his\nayde; Howe some have caused the enemie to devide his force; A policie to\nwinne the enemies countrie before he be aware; Howe to reforme sedicion\nand discorde; The benefitte that the reputacion of the Capitaine\ncauseth, which is only gotten by vertue; The chiefe thyng that a\ncapitayne ought to doe; When paie wanteth, punishment is not to be\nexecuted; The inconvenience of not punisshynge; Cesar chaunsynge to\nfall, made the same to be supposed to signifi good lucke; Religion\ntaketh away fantasticall opinions; In what cases a Capitaine ought not\nto faight with his enemie if he may otherwyse choose; A policie of\nFulvius wherby he got and spoyled his enemies Campe; A policie to\ndisorder the enemie; A policie to overcome the enemie; A policie; How to\nbeguile the enemie; Howe Mennonus trained his enemies oute of stronge\nplaces to bee the better able to overcom them.]\nFABRICIO. To the first question I answer you, that if the armie be more\nor lesse, then fower or sixe thousande souldiours, the orders of\nlodgynges, may bee taken awaie or joined, so many as suffiseth: and with\nthis way a man may goe in more, and in lesse, into infinite:\nNotwithstandynge the Romaines, when thei joigned together twoo consull\narmies, thei made twoo campes, and thei tourned the partes of the\nunarmed, thone against thother. Concernyng the second question, I say\nunto you, that the Romaines ordinary armie, was about xxiiii. M.\nsouldiours: but when thei were driven to faight against the greatest\npower that might be, the moste that thei put together, wer L. M. With\nthis number, thei did set against two hundred thousand Frenchemen, whome\nassaulted them after the first warre, that thei had with the\nCarthageners. With this verie same numbre, thei fought againste\nAnniball. And you muste note, that the Romaines, and the Grekes, have\nmade warre with fewe, fortefiyng themselves thorough order, and thorough\narte: the west, and the easte, have made it with multitude: But the one\nof these nacions, doeth serve with naturall furie: as doe the men of the\nwest partes, the other through the great obedience whiche those men have\nto their kyng. But in Grece, and in Italy, beyng no naturall furie, nor\nthe naturall reverence towardes their king, it hath been necessary for\nthem to learne the discipline of warre, the whiche is of so muche force,\nthat it hath made that a fewe, hath been able to overcome the furie, and\nthe naturall obstinatenesse of manie. Therefore I saie, that mindyng to\nimitate the Romaines, and the Grekes, the number of L. M. souldiers\nought not to bee passed, but rather to take lesse: because manie make\nconfucion, nor suffer not the discipline to be observed, and the orders\nlearned, and Pirrus used to saie, that with xv. thousande men he woulde\nassaile the worlde: but let us pas to an other parte. We have made this\nour armie to winne a field and shewed the travailes, that in the same\nfight may happen: we have made it to marche, and declared of what\nimpedimentes in marchyng it may be disturbed: and finally we have lodged\nit: where not only it ought to take a littell reste of the labours\npassed, but also to thinke howe the warre ought to be ended: for that in\nthe lodgynges, is handeled many thynges, inespecially thy enemies as yet\nremainyng in the fielde, and in suspected townes, of whome it is good to\nbe assured, and those that be enemies to overcome them: therfore it is\nnecessarie to come to this demonstracion, and to passe this difficultie\nwith the same glorie, as hitherto we have warred. Therfore comynge to\nparticular matters, I saie that if it shoulde happen, that thou wouldest\nhave manie men, or many people to dooe a thyng, whiche were to thee\nprofittable, and to theim greate hurte, as should be to breake downe the\nwall of their citie, or to sende into exile many of them, it is\nnecessarie for thee, either to beguile them in such wise that everie one\nbeleeve not that it toucheth him: so that succouryng not the one the\nother, thei may finde them selves al to be oppressed without remedie, or\nels unto all to commaunde the same, whiche they ought to dooe in one\nselfe daie, to the intente that every man belevyng to be alone, to whome\nthe commaundement is made, maie thinke to obey and not to remedie it:\nand so withoute tumulte thy commaundement to be of everie man executed.\nIf thou shouldest suspecte the fidelitie of anie people, and woulde\nassure thee, and overcome them at unawares, for to colour thy intente\nmore easelie, thou canst not doe better, then to counsel with them of\nsome purpose of thine, desiryng their aide, and to seeme to intende to\nmake an other enterprise, and to have thy minde farre from thinkyng on\nthem: the whiche will make, that thei shall not think on their owne\ndefence, beleevyng not that thou purposest to hurte them, and thei shal\ngeve thee commoditie, to be able easely to satisfie thy desire. When\nthou shouldest perceive, that there were in thine armie some, that used\nto advertise thy enemie of thy devises, thou canst not doe better,\nmyndynge to take commoditie by their traiterous mindes, then to commen\nwith them of those thynges, that thou wilte not doe, and those that thou\nwilt doe, to kepe secret, and to say to doubte of thynges, that thou\ndoubtest not, and those of whiche thou doubtest, to hide: the which\nshall make thenemie to take some enterprise in hand, beleving to know\nthy devises, where by easly thou maiest beguile and opresse hym. If thou\nshouldest intende (as Claudius Nero did) to deminishe thy armie,\nsendynge helpe to some freende, and that the enemie shoulde not bee\naware therof, it is necessarie not to deminishe the lodgynges, but to\nmaintayne the signes, and the orders whole, makyng the verie same fires,\nand the verye same wardes throughout all the campe, as wer wont to be\nafore. Lykewise if with thy armie there should joigne new men, and\nwouldest that the enemie shoulde not know that thou werte ingrosed, it\nis necessarie not to increase the lodgynges: Because keepyng secrete\ndoynges and devises, hath alwaies been moste profitable. Wherfore\nMetellus beyng with an armie in Hispayne, to one, who asked him what he\nwould doe the nexte daie, answered, that if his sherte knew therof, he\nwould bourne it. Marcus Craussus, unto one, whome asked him, when the\narmie shoulde remove, saied beleevest thou to be alone not to here the\ntrumpet? If thou shouldest desire to understande the secretes of thy\nenemie, and to know his orders, some have used to sende embassadours,\nand with theim in servauntes aparel, moste expertest men in warre: whom\nhavynge taken occasion to se the enemies armie, and to consider his\nstrengthe and weakenesse, it hath geven them oportunitie to overcome\nhim. Some have sente into exile one of their familiars, and by meanes of\nthe same, hath knowen the devises of his adversarie. Also like secrettes\nare understoode of the enemies when for this effecte there were taken\nany prisoners. Marius whiche in the warre that he made with the Cimbrie,\nfor to know the faieth of those Frenchmen, who then inhabited Lombardie,\nand were in leage with the Romaine people, sent them letters open, and\nsealed: and in the open he wrote, that they shoulde not open the sealed,\nbut at a certaine time, and before the same time demaundyng them againe,\nand finding them opened, knew thereby that their faithe was not to be\ntrusted. Some Capitaines, being invaded, have not desired to goe to\nmeete the enemie, but have gone to assaulte his countrey, and\nconstrained him to retorne to defende his owne home: The whiche manie\ntimes hath come wel to passe, for that those soldiours beginnyng to fil\nthem selves with booties, and confidence to overcome, shall sone make\nthe enemies souldiours to wexe afraide, when they supposynge theim\nselves conquerours, shal understand to become losers: So that to him\nthat hath made this diversion, manie times it hath proved well. But\nonely it may be doen by him, whiche hath his countrey stronger then that\nof the enemies, because when it were otherwise, he should goe to leese.\nIt hath been often a profitable thyng to a capitaine, that hath been\nbesieged in his lodgynges by the enemie, to move an intreatie of\nagreemente, and to make truse with him for certaine daies: the which is\nwonte to make the enemies more necligente in all doynges: so that\navaylynge thee of their necligence, thou maiest easely have occacion to\nget thee oute of handes. By this way Silla delivered him selfe twise\nfrom the enemies: and with this verie same deceipte, Asdruball in\nHispayne got oute of the force of Claudious Nero, whome had besieged\nhim. It helpeth also to deliver a man out of the daunger of the enemie,\nto do some thyng beside the forsaied, that may keepe him at a baye: this\nis dooen in two maners, either to assaulte him with parte of thy power,\nso that he beyng attentive to the same faight, may geve commoditie to\nthe reste of thy men to bee able to save theim selves, or to cause to\nrise some newe accidente, which for the strayngenesse of the thynge,\nmaie make him to marvell, and for this occasion to stande doubtefull,\nand still: as you knowe howe Anniball dyd, who beynge inclosed of Fabius\nMaximus, tied in the nighte small Bavens kindeled beetweene the hornes\nof manie Oxen, so that Fabius astonied at the strangenesse of the same\nsight, thought not to lette him at all the passage. A Capitayne oughte\namonge all other of his affaires, with al subtiltie to devise to devide\nthe force of the enemie, either with makyng him to suspecte his owne\nmenne, in whome he trusteth, or to give him occasion, that he maye\nseperate his menne, and therby to be come more weake. The fyrste way is\ndooen with keepyng saulfe the thynges of some of those whiche he hath\naboute him, as to save in the warre their menne and their possessions,\nrenderynge theim their children, or other their necessaries withoute\nraunsome. You know that Anniball havynge burned all the fieldes aboute\nRome, he made onely to bee reserved saulfe those of Fabius Maximus. You\nknow how Coriolanus comyng with an armie to Rome, preserved the\npossessions of the nobilitie, and those of the comminaltie he bourned,\nand sacked. Metellus havinge an armie againste Jugurte, all the\noratours, whiche of Jugurte were sente him, were required of him, that\nthey woulde geve him Jugurte prisoner, and after to the verie same men\nwrityng letters of the verie same matter, wrought in suche wise, that in\nshorte tyme Jugurte havyng in suspecte all his counsellours, in diverse\nmaners put them to death. Anniball beynge fled to Antiochus, the Romaine\noratours practised with him so familiarly, that Antiochus beyng in\nsuspecte of him, trusted not anie more after to his counselles.\nConcernyng to devide the enemies men, there is no more certainer waie,\nthen to cause their countrie to be assaulted to the intente that being\nconstrained to goe to defende the same, they maie forsake the warre.\nThis way Fabius used havynge agaynst his armie the power of the\nFrenchemen, of the Tuscans, Umbries and Sannites. Titus Didius havyng a\nfew men in respecte to those of the enemies, and lookynge for a legion\nfrom Rome, and the enemies purposinge to goe to incounter it, to the\nintente that they should not goe caused to bee noised through all his\narmie, that he intended the nexte daie to faighte the field with the\nenemies: after he used means, that certaine of the prisoners, that he\nhad taken afore, had occasion to runne awaie. Who declaryng the order\nthat the Consull had taken to faighte the nexte daie, by reason wherof\nthe enemies beyng afraide to deminishe their owne strength, went not to\nincounter the same legion, and by this way thei wer conducted safe. The\nwhich means serveth not to devide the force of the enemies, but to\naugmente a mans owne. Some have used to devide the enemies force, by\nlettyng him to enter into their countrie, and in profe have let him take\nmanie townes, to the intente that puttynge in the same garrisons, he\nmight thereby deminishe his power, and by this waie havynge made him\nweake, have assaulted and overcomen him. Some other mindyng to goe into\none province, have made as though they woulde have invaded an other, and\nused so much diligence, that sodenly entryng into the same, where it was\nnot doubted that they woulde enter, they have first wonne it, before the\nennemie coulde have time to succour it: for that thy enemie beynge not\nsure, whether thou purposest to tourne backe, to the place fyrste of\nthee threatned, is constrained not to forsake the one place, to succour\nthe other, and so many times he defendeth neither the one nor the other.\nIt importeth besides the sayde thynges to a Capitaine, if there growe\nsedicion or discorde amonge the souldiours, to knowe with arte howe to\nextynguishe it: The beste waie is to chastise the headdes of the\nfaultes, but it muste be doen in such wise, that thou maiest first have\noppressed them, before they be able to be aware: The way is if they be\ndistante from thee, not onely to call the offenders, but together with\ntheim all the other, to the entente that not beleevynge, that it is for\nany cause to punishe them, they become not contumelius, but geve\ncommoditie to the execution of the punishemente: when thei be present,\nthou oughtest to make thy selfe stronge with those that be not in\nfaulte, and by meane of their helpe to punishe the other. When there\nhapneth discorde amonge them, the beste waye is, to bryng them to the\nperill, the feare whereof is wonte alwaies to make them agree. But that,\nwhich above all other thynge kepeth the armie in unitee, is the\nreputacion of the Capitaine, the whiche onely groweth of his vertue:\nbecause neither bloud, nor authoritie gave it ever without vertue. And\nthe chiefe thyng, whiche of a Capitain is looked for to be doen, is, to\nkeepe his souldiours punisshed, and paied: for that when so ever the\npaie lacketh, it is conveniente that the punisshement lacke: because\nthou canst not correcte a souldiour, that robbeth, if thou doest not\npaie him, nor the same mindynge to live, cannot abstaine from robbynge:\nbut if thou paiest him and punisshest him not, he beecometh in everie\ncondicion insolente: For that thou becomest of small estimacion, where\nthou chaunsest not to bee able to maintaine the dignitie of thy degree,\nand not mainetainyng it, there foloweth of necessitee tumulte, and\ndiscorde, whiche is the ruine of an armie. Olde Capitaines had a\ntroubell, of the which the presente be almoste free, whiche was to\ninterprete to their purpose the sinister auguries: because if there fell\na thunderbolte in an armie, if the sunne were darkened or the Moone, if\nthere came an erthequake, if the Capitaine either in gettyng up, or in\nlightynge of his horse fell, it was of the souldiours interpreted\nsinisterously: And it ingendred in them so moche feare, that comynge to\nfaight the fielde, easely they should have lost it: and therefore the\naunciente Capitaines so sone as a lyke accidente grewe, either they\nshewed the cause of the same, and redused it to a naturall cause, or\nthey interpreted it to their purpose. Cesar fallyng in Africa, in comyng\nof the sea saied, Africa I have taken thee. Moreover manie have declared\nthe cause of the obscuryng of the Moone, and of earthquakes: which thing\nin our time cannot happen, as well because our men be not so\nsupersticious, as also for that our religion taketh away altogether such\nopinions: al be it when they should chaunse, the orders of the\nantiquitie ought to be imitated. When either famishement, or other\nnaturall necessitie, or humaine passion, hath broughte thy enemie to an\nutter desperation, and he driven of the same, cometh to faight with\nthee, thou oughtest to stande within thy campe, and as muche as lieth in\nthy power, to flie the faight. So the Lacedemonians did against the\nMasonians, so Cesar did against Afranio, and Petreio. Fulvius beyng\nConsul, against the Cimbrians, made his horsemen manie daies continually\nto assaulte the enemies, and considered how thei issued out of their\ncampe for to folow them: wherfore he sette an ambusshe behinde the Campe\nof the Cimbrians, and made them to be assaulted of his horsmen, and the\nCimbrians issuyng oute of their campe for to follow them. Fulvio gotte\nit, and sacked it. It hath ben of great utilitie to a Capitaine, havyng\nhis armie nere to the enemies armie, to sende his menne with the enemies\nansignes to robbe, and to burne his owne countrey, whereby the enemies\nbeleevynge those to bee menne, whiche are come in their aide, have also\nrunne to helpe to make them the pray: and for this disorderyng them\nselves, hathe therby given oportunitie to the adversary to overcome\nthem. This waie Alexander of Epirus used againste the Illirans and\nLeptenus of Siracusa against the Carthaginers and bothe to the one and\nto the other, the devise came to passe most happely. Manie have overcome\nthe enemie, gevyng him occasion to eate and to drinke oute of measure,\nfayning to have feared, and leaving their Campes full of wyne and herdes\nof cattell, wherof the enemie beyng filled above all naturall use, have\nthen assaulted him, and with his destruction overthrowen him. So Tamirus\ndid against Cirus, and Tiberius Graccus agaynst the Spaniardes. Some\nhave poysoned the wine, and other thynges to feede on, for to be able\nmore easely to overcome them. I saied a littel afore how I founde not,\nthat the antiquetie kepte in the night Scoutes abroade, and supposed\nthat they did it for to avoide the hurte, whiche might growe therby:\nbecause it is founde, that through no other meane then throughe the\nwatche man, whiche was set in the daie to watche the enemie, hath been\ncause of the ruin of him, that set him there: for that manie times it\nhath hapned, that he beyng taken, hath been made perforce to tell theim\nthe token, whereby they might call his felowes, who commyng to the\ntoken, have been slaine or taken. It helpeth to beguile the enemie\nsometime to varie a custome of thine, whereupon he having grounded him\nself, remaineth ruinated: as a Capitaine did once, whome usinge to cause\nto be made signes to his men for comynge of the enemies in the night\nwith fire, and in the daie with smoke, commaunded that withoute anie\nintermission, they shoulde make smoke and fire, and after commynge upon\nthem the enemie, they should reste, whome beleevyng to come without\nbeynge seen, perceivyng no signe to be made of beyng discovered, caused\n(through goeyng disordered) more easie the victorie to his adversarie.\nMennonus a Rodian mindynge to drawe from stronge places the enemies\narmie, sente one under colour of a fugitive, the whiche affirmed, howe\nhis armie was in discorde, and that the greater parte of them wente\nawaie: and for to make the thynge to be credited, he caused to make in\nsporte, certaine tumultes amonge the lodgynges: whereby the enemie\nthvnkyng thereby to be able to discomfaighte them, assaultynge theim,\nwere overthrowen.\n[Sidenote: The enemie ought not to be brought into extreme desperacion;\nHow Lucullus constrained certaine men that ran awaie from him to his\nenemies, to fayght whether they wold or not.]\nBesides thesaied thynges, regarde ought to be had not to brynge the\nenemie into extreme desperacion: whereunto Cesar had regarde, faightyng\nwith the Duchemen, who opened them the waie, seyng, howe thei beyng not\nable to flie, necessitie made them strong, and would rather take paine\nto followe theim, when thei fled, then the perill to overcome them, when\nthei defended them selves. Lucullus seyng, how certaine Macedonian\nhorsemenne, whiche were with hym, went to the enemies parte, straight\nwaie made to sounde to battaile, and commaunded, that the other men\nshould folowe hym: whereby the enemies beleving, that Lucullus would\nbegin the faight, went to incounter the same Macedonians, with soche\nviolence, that thei were constrained to defende themselves: and so thei\nbecame against their willes, of fugetives, faighters. It importeth also\nto knowe, how to be assured of a toune, when thou doubteste of the\nfidelitie thereof, so sone as thou haste wonne the fielde, or before,\nthe whiche certain old insamples maie teache thee.\n[Sidenote: A policie wher by Pompey got a towne; How Publius Valerius\nassured him self of a towne; A policie that Alexander Magnus used to be\nassured of all Tracia, which Philip kynge of Spaine did practise to be\nasured of England when he wente to sainct Quintens; Examples for\nCapitaines to winne the hartes of the people.]\nPompei doubtyng of the Catinensians, praied them that thei would bee\ncontente, to receive certaine sicke menne, that he had in his armie, and\nsendyng under the habite of sicke persones, most lustie menne, gotte the\ntoune. Publius Valerius, fearyng the fidelitie of the Epidannians,\ncaused to come, as who saieth, a Pardon to a churche without the toune,\nand when al the people wer gone for Pardon, he shutte the gates,\nreceivyng after none in, but those whom he trusted. Alexander Magnus,\nmindyng to goe into Asia, and to assure himself of Thracia, toke with\nhim all the principall of thesame Province, givyng theim provision, and\nhe set over the common people of Thracia, men of lowe degree, and so he\nmade the Princes contented with paiyng theim, and the people quiete,\nhavyng no heddes that should disquiete them: But emong all the thynges,\nwith the whiche the Capitaines, winne the hartes of the people, be the\ninsamples of chastitie and justice, as was thesame of Scipio in Spaine,\nwhen he rendered that yong woman, moste faire of personage to her\nfather, and to her housebande: the whiche made him more, then with force\nof armes to winne Spain.\nCesar having caused that woodde to bee paied for, whiche he had occupied\nfor to make the Listes, about his armie in Fraunce, got so moche a name\nof justice, that he made easier the conquest of thesame province. I\ncannot tell what remaineth me, to speake more upon these accidentes, for\nthat concerning this matter, there is not lefte any parte, that hath not\nbeen of us disputed. Onely there lacketh to tell, of the maner of\nwinnyng, and defendyng a toune: the whiche I am readie to doe willingly,\nif you be not now wearie.\nBAPTISTE. Your humanitie is so moche, that it maketh us to followe our\ndesires, without beyng afraied to be reputed presumptuous, seyng that\nyou liberally offer thesame, whiche we should have been ashamed, to have\nasked you: Therefore, we saie unto you onely this, that to us you cannot\ndooe a greater, nor a more gratefuller benefite, then to finishe this\nreasonyng. But before that you passe to that other matter, declare us a\ndoubte, whether it bee better to continewe the warre, as well in the\nWinter, as thei use now adaies, or to make it onely in the Sommer, and\nto goe home in the Winter, as the antiquitie did.\n[Sidenote: Warre ought not to be made in winter; Rough situacions, colde\nand watrie times, are enemies to the oder of warre; An overthrowe caused\nby winter.]\nFABRICIO. See, that if the prudence of the demaunder were not, there had\nremained behinde a speciall part, that deserveth consideracion. I\nanswere you againe, that the antiquitie did all thynges better, and with\nmore prudence then wee: and if wee in other things commit some erroure,\nin the affaires of warre, wee commit all errour. There is nothing more\nundiscrete, or more perrillous to a Capitayne, then to make warre in the\nWinter, and muche more perrill beareth he, that maketh it, then he that\nabideth it: the reason is this. All the industrie that is used in the\ndiscipline of warre, is used for to bee prepared to fighte a fielde with\nthy enemie, because this is the ende, whereunto a Capitayne oughte to\ngoo or endevour him selfe: For that the foughten field, geveth thee the\nwarre wonne or loste: then he that knoweth best how to order it, and he\nthat hath his army beste instructed, hath moste advauntage in this, and\nmaye beste hope to overcome. On the other side, there is nothing more\nenemie to the orders, and then the rough situacions, or the colde watery\ntime: for that the rough situacions, suffereth thee not to deffende thy\nbandes, according to thee discipline: the coulde and watery times,\nsuffereth thee not to keepe thy men together, nor thou canst not bring\nthem in good order to the enemy: but it is convenient for thee to lodge\nthem a sunder of necessitie, and without order, being constrayned to\nobeye to Castells, to Boroughes, and to the Villages, that maye receyve\nthee, in maner that all thy laboure of thee, used to instructe the army\nis vaine. Nor marvayle you not though now a daies, they warre in the\nWinter, because the armies being without discipline, know not the hurt\nthat it dooth them, in lodging not together, for that it is no griefe to\nthem not to be able to keepe those orders, and to observe that\ndiscipline, which they have not: yet they oughte to see howe much harme,\nthe Camping in the Winter hath caused, and to remember, how the\nFrenchmen in the yeare of oure Lorde God, a thousande five hundred and\nthree, were broken at Gariliano of the Winter, and not of the\nSpaniardes: For as much as I have saide, he that assaulteth, hath more\ndisadvauntage then he that defendeth: because the fowle weather hurteth\nhim not a littell, being in the dominion of others and minding to make\nwarre. For that he is constrayned, either to stande together with his\nmen, and to sustaine the incommoditie of water and colde, or to avoide\nit to devide his power: But he that defendeth, may chuse the place as he\nlisteth, and tary him with his freshe men: and he in a sodayne may set\nhis men in araye, and goo to find a band of the enemies men, who cannot\nresiste the violence of them. So the Frenchemen were discomfited, and so\nthey shall alwayes be discomfited, which will assaulte in the Winter an\nenemye, whoo hath in him prudence. Then he that will that force, that\norders, that discipline and vertue, in anye condition availe him not,\nlet him make warre in the fielde in the winter: and because that the\nRomaines woulde that all these thinges, in which they bestowed so much\ndiligence, should availe them, fleedde no otherwise the Winter, then the\nhighe Alpes, and difficulte places, and whatsoever other thing shoulde\nlet them, for being able to shewe their arte and their vertue. So this\nsuffiseth to your demaund, wherefore we wil come to intreate of the\ndefending and besieging of tounes, and of their situacions and\nedifications.\nTHE SEVENTH BOOKE\n[Sidenote: Tounes and Fortresses maie be strong twoo waies; The place\nthat now a daies is moste sought to fortifie in; How a Toune walle ought\nto bee made; The walle of a toune ought to bee high, and the diche\nwithin, and not without; The thickenes that a Toune walle ought to bee\nof, and the distaunces betwene everie flancker, and of what breadth and\ndeapth the dich ought to bee; How the ordinaunce is planted, for the\ndefence of a toune; The nature of the batterie.]\nYou oughte to knowe, how that tounes and fortresses, maie bee strong\neither by nature, or by industrie; by nature, those bee strong, whiche\nbee compassed aboute with rivers, or with Fennes, as Mantua is and\nFerrara, or whiche bee builded upon a Rocke, or upon a stepe hille, as\nMonaco, and Sanleo: For that those that stande upon hilles, that be not\nmoche difficulct to goe up, be now a daies, consideryng the artillerie\nand the Caves, moste weake. And therfore moste often times in building,\nthei seke now a daies a plain, for to make it stronge with industrie.\nThe firste industrie is, to make the walles crooked, and full of\ntournynges, and of receiptes: the whiche thyng maketh, that thenemie\ncannot come nere to it, bicause he maie be hurte, not onely on the\nfront, but by flancke. If the walles be made high, thei bee to moche\nsubjecte to the blowes of the artillerie: if thei be made lowe, thei bee\nmoste easie to scale. If thou makeste the diches on the out side\nthereof, for to give difficultie to the Ladders, if it happen that the\nenemie fill them up (whiche a great armie maie easely dooe) the wall\nremaineth taken of thenemie. Therefore purposyng to provide to the one\nand thother foresaid inconveniences, I beleve (savyng alwaies better\njudgement) that the walle ought to be made highe, and the Diche within,\nand not without. This is the moste strongeste waie of edificacion, that\nis made, for that it defendeth thee from the artillerie, and from\nLadders, and it giveth not facilitie to the enemie, to fill up the\ndiche: Then the walle ought to be high, of that heighth as shall bee\nthought beste, and no lesse thick, then two yardes and a quarter, for to\nmake it more difficult to ruinate. Moreover it ought to have the toures\nplaced, with distances of CL. yardes betwen thone and thother: the diche\nwithin, ought to be at leaste twoo and twentie yardes and a halfe broad,\nand nine depe, and al the yearth that is digged out, for to make the\ndiche, muste be throwen towardes the Citee, and kepte up of a walle,\nthat muste be raised from the bottome of the diche, and goe so high over\nthe toune, that a man maie bee covered behinde thesame, the whiche thing\nshal make the depth of the diche the greater. In the bottome of the\ndiche, within every hundred and l. yardes, there would be a slaughter\nhouse, which with the ordinaunce, maie hurte whom so ever should goe\ndoune into thesame: the greate artillerie that defende the citee, are\nplanted behinde the walle, that shutteth the diche, bicause for to\ndefende the utter walle, being high, there cannot bee occupied\ncommodiously, other then smalle or meane peeses. If the enemie come to\nscale, the heigth of the firste walle moste easely defendeth thee: if he\ncome with ordinaunce, it is convenient for hym to batter the utter\nwalle: but it beyng battered, for that the nature of the batterie is, to\nmake the walle to fall, towardes the parte battered, the ruine of the\nwalle commeth, finding no diche that receiveth and hideth it, to\nredouble the profunditie of thesame diche: after soche sorte, that to\npasse any further, it is not possible, findyng a ruine that with holdeth\nthee, a diche that letteth thee, and the enemies ordinaunce, that from\nthe walle of the diche, moste safely killeth thee. Onely there is this\nremedie, to fill the diche: the whiche is moste difficulte to dooe, as\nwell bicause the capacitie thereof is greate, as also for the\ndifficultie, that is in commyng nere it, the walle beeyng strong and\nconcaved, betwene the whiche, by the reasons aforesaied, with\ndifficultie maie be entered, havyng after to goe up a breache through a\nruin, whiche giveth thee moste greate difficultie, so that I suppose a\ncitee thus builded, to be altogether invinsible.\nBAPTISTE. When there should bee made besides the diche within, a diche\nalso without, should it not bee stronger?\nFABRICIO. It should be without doubt, but mindyng to make one diche\nonely, myne opinion is, that it standeth better within then without.\nBAPTISTE. Would you, that water should bee in the diches, or would you\nhave them drie?\n[Sidenote: A drie diche is moste sureste.]\nFABRICIO. The opinion of men herein bee divers, bicause the diches full\nof water, saveth thee from mines under grounde, the Diches without\nwater, maketh more difficulte the fillyng of them: but I havyng\nconsidered all, would make them without water, for that thei bee more\nsure: For diches with water, have been seen in the Winter to bee frosen,\nand to make easie the winnyng of a citee, as it happened to Mirandola,\nwhen Pope Julie besieged it: and for to save me from mines, I would make\nit so deepe, that he that would digge lower, should finde water.\n[Sidenote: An advertisemente for the buildyng and defending of a Toune\nor Fortresse; Small fortresses cannot bee defended; A toune of war or\nFortresse, ought not to have in them any retiring places; Cesar Borgia;\nThe causes of the losse of the Fortresse of Furlie, that was thought\ninvincible; Howe the houses that are in a toune of war or Fortresse\nought to be builded.]\nThe Fortresses also, I would builde concernyng the diches and the walles\nin like maner, to the intent thei should have the like difficultie to be\nwonne. One thyng I will earnestly advise hym, that defendeth a Citee:\nand that is, that he make no Bulwarkes without distaunte from the walle\nof thesame: and an other to hym that buildeth the Fortresse, and this\nis, that he make not any refuge place in them, in whiche he that is\nwithin, the firste walle beyng loste, maie retire: That whiche maketh me\nto give the firste counsaile is, that no manne ought to make any thyng,\nby meane wherof, he maie be driven without remedie to lese his firste\nreputacion, the whiche losyng, causeth to be estemed lesse his other\ndoinges, and maketh afraied them, whom have taken upon theim his\ndefence, and alwaies it shall chaunce him this, whiche I saie, when\nthere are made Bulwarkes out of the Toune, that is to bee defended,\nbicause alwaies he shall leese theim, little thynges now a daies, beyng\nnot able to bee defended, when thei be subject to the furie of\nordinance, in soche wise that lesyng them, thei be beginning and cause\nof his ruine. When Genua rebelled againste king Leus of Fraunce, it made\ncertaine Bulwarkes alofte on those hilles, whiche bee about it, the\nwhiche so sone as thei were loste, whiche was sodainly, made also the\ncitee to be loste. Concernyng the second counsaile, I affirme nothyng to\nbe to a Fortresse more perilous, then to be in thesame refuge places, to\nbe able to retire: Bicause the hope that menne have thereby, maketh that\nthei leese the utter warde, when it is assaulted: and that loste, maketh\nto bee loste after, all the Fortresse. For insample there is freshe in\nremembraunce, the losse of the Fortresse of Furly, when Catherin the\nCountesse defended it againste Cesar Borgia, sonne to Pope Alexander the\nvi. who had conducted thether the armie of the king of Fraunce: thesame\nFortresse, was al full of places, to retire out of one into an other:\nfor that there was firste the kepe, from the same to the Fortresse, was\na diche after soche sorte, that thei passed over it by a draw bridge:\nthe fortresse was devided into three partes, and every parte was devided\nfrom the other with diches, and with water, and by Bridges, thei passed\nfrom the one place to the other: wherefore the Duke battered with his\nartillerie, one of the partes of the fortresse, and opened part of the\nwalle: For whiche cause Maister Jhon Casale, whiche was appoincted to\nthat Warde, thought not good to defende that breache, but abandoned it\nfor to retire hymself into the other places: so that the Dukes men\nhaving entered into that parte without incounter, in a sodaine thei\ngotte it all: For that the Dukes menne became lordes of the bridges,\nwhiche went from one place to an other. Thei loste then this Fortresse,\nwhiche was thought invinsible, through two defaultes, the one for havyng\nso many retiryng places, the other, bicause every retiryng place, was\nnot Lorde of the bridge thereof. Therefore, the naughtie builded\nFortresse, and the little wisedome of them that defended it, caused\nshame to the noble enterprise of the countesse, whoe had thought to have\nabidden an armie, whiche neither the kyng of Naples, nor the Duke of\nMilaine would have abidden: and although his inforcementes had no good\nende, yet notwithstandyng he gotte that honoure, whiche his\nvaliauntnesse had deserved: The whiche was testified of many Epigrammes,\nmade in those daies in his praise. Therefore, if I should have to builde\na Fortresse, I would make the walles strong, and the diches in the maner\nas we have reasoned, nor I would not make therein other, then houses to\ninhabite, and those I would make weake and lowe, after soche sorte that\nthei should not let him that should stande in the middest of the Market\nplace, the sight of all the walle, to the intente that the Capitain\nmight see with the iye, where he maie succour: and that every manne\nshould understande, that the walle and the diche beyng lost, the\nfortresse were lost. And yet when I should make any retiryng places, I\nwould make the bridges devided in soche wise, that every parte should be\nLorde of the bridges of his side, ordainyng, that thei should fall upon\npostes, in the middest of the diche.\nBAPTISTE. You have saied that littel thynges now a daies can not bee\ndefended, and it seemed unto me to have understoode the contrarie, that\nthe lesser that a thyng wer, the better it might be defended.\n[Sidenote: The fortifiyng of the entrance of a Toune.]\nFABRICIO. You have not understoode well, because that place cannot be\nnow a daies called stronge, wher he that defendeth it, hath not space to\nretire with new diches, and with new fortificacions, for that the force\nof the ordinance is so much, that he that trusteth uppon the warde of\none wall and of one fortification only, is deceived: and because the\nBulwarkes (mindyng that they passe not their ordinarie measure, for that\nthen they shoulde be townes and Castels) be not made, in suche wise that\nmen maie have space within them to retire, thei are loste straight waie.\nTherefore it is wisdom to let alone those Bulwarkes without, and to\nfortifie thenterance of the toune, and to kever the gates of the same\nwith turnyngs after suche sort, that men cannot goe in nor oute of the\ngate by right line: and from the tournynges to the gate, to make a diche\nwith a bridge. Also they fortifie the gate, with a Percullis, for to bee\nabell to put therin their menne, when they be issued out to faight, and\nhapnyng that the enemies pursue them, to avoide, that in the mingelynge\ntogether, they enter not in with them: and therfore these be used, the\nwhich the antiquitie called Cattarratte, the whiche beyng let fall,\nexclude thenemies, and save the freendes, for that in suche a case, men\ncan do no good neither by bridges nor by a gate, the one and the other\nbeynge ocupied with prease of menne.\nBAPTISTE. I have seene these Perculleses that you speake of, made in\nAlmayne of littell quarters of woodde after the facion of a grate of\nIron, and these percullises of ouers, be made of plankes all massive: I\nwoulde desire to understande whereof groweth this difference, and which\nbe the strongest.\n[Sidenote: Battelments ought to be large and thicke and the flanckers\nlarge within.]\nFABRICIO. I tell you agayne, that the manners and orders of the warre,\nthroughe oute all the worlde, in respecte to those of the antiquitie, be\nextinguesshed, and in Italye they bee altogether loste, for if there bee\na thing somewhat stronger then the ordinarye, it groweth of the insample\nof other countries. You mighte have understoode and these other may\nremember, with howe muche debilitie before, that king Charles of Fraunce\nin the yere of our salvation a thousande CCCC. xciiii. had passed into\nItalie, they made the batelmentes not halfe a yarde thicke, the loopes,\nand the flanckers were made with a litle opening without, and muche\nwithin, and with manye other faultes whiche not to be tedious I will let\npasse: for that easely from thinne battelments the defence is taken\nawaye, the flanckers builded in the same maner, moste easylye are\nopened: Nowe of the Frenchemen is learned to make the battelment large\nand thicke, and the flanckers to bee large on the parte within, and to\ndrawe together in the middeste of the wall, and then agayn to waxe wider\nunto the uttermost parte without: this maketh that the ordinaunce\nhardlye can take away the defence. Therfore the Frenchmen have, manye\nother devises like these, the whiche because they have not beene seene\nof our men, they have not beene considered. Among whiche, is this kinde\nof perculles made like unto a grate, the which is a greate deale better\nthen oures: for that if you have for defence of a gate a massive\nparculles as oures, letting it fall, you shutte in your menne, and you\ncan not though the same hurte the enemie, so that hee with axes, and\nwith fire, maye breake it downe safely: but if it bee made like a grate,\nyou maye, it being let downe, through those holes and through those open\nplaces, defende it with Pikes, with crosbowes, and with all other kinde\nof weapons.\nBAPTISTE. I have seene in Italye an other use after the outelandishe\nfashion, and this is, to make the carriage of the artillery with the\nspokes of the wheele crooked towardes the Axeltree. I woulde knowe why\nthey make them so: seeming unto mee that they bee stronger when they are\nmade straighte as those of oure wheeles.\n[Sidenote: Neither the ditche, wall tillage, nor any kinde of\nedificacion, ought to be within a mile of a toune of warre.]\nFABRICIO. Never beleeve that the thinges that differ from the ordinarie\nwayes, be made by chaunce: and if you shoulde beleeve that they make\nthem so, to shewe fayrer, you are deceaved: because where strength is\nnecessarie, there is made no counte of fayrenesse: but all groweth, for\nthat they be muche surer and muche stronger then ours. The reason is\nthis: the carte when it is laden, either goeth even, or leaning upon the\nrighte, or upon the lefte side: when it goeth even, the wheeles equally\nsustayne the wayght, the which being equallye devided betweene them,\ndoth not burden much, but leaning, it commeth to have all the paise of\nthe cariage on the backe of that wheele upon the which it leaneth. If\nthe spokes of the same be straight they wil soone breake: for that the\nwheele leaning, the spokes come also to leane, and not to sustaine the\npaise by the straightnesse of them, and so when the carte goeth even,\nand when they are least burdened, they come to bee strongest: when the\nCarte goeth awrye, and that they come to have moste paise, they bee\nweakest. Even the contrarie happeneth to the crooked spokes of the\nFrenche Cartes, for that when the carte leaning upon one side poincteth\nuppon them, because they bee ordinary crooked, they come then to bee\nstraight, and to be able to sustayne strongly al the payse, where when\nthe carte goeth even, and that they bee crooked, they sustayne it halfe:\nbut let us tourne to our citie and Fortresse. The Frenchemen use also\nfor more safegarde of the gates of their townes, and for to bee able in\nsieges more easylye to convey and set oute men of them, besides the\nsayde thinges, an other devise, of which I have not seene yet in Italye\nanye insample: and this is, where they rayse on the oute side from the\nende of the drawe bridge twoo postes, and upon either of them they\njoigne a beame, in suche wise that the one halfe of them comes over the\nbridge, the other halfe with oute: then all the same parte that commeth\nwithoute, they joygne together with small quarters of woodde, the whiche\nthey set thicke from one beame to an other like unto a grate, and on the\nparte within, they fasten to the ende of either of the beames a chaine:\nthen when they will shutte the bridge on the oute side, they slacke the\nchaines, and let downe all the same parte like unto a grate, the whiche\ncomming downe, shuttethe the bridge, and when they will open it, they\ndrawe the chaines, and the same commeth to rise up, and they maye raise\nit up so much that a man may passe under it, and not a horse, and so\nmuch that there maye passe horse and man, and shutte it againe at ones,\nfor that it falleth and riseth as a window of a battelment. This devise\nis more sure than the Parculles, because hardely it maye be of the\nenemye lette in such wise, that it fall not downe, falling not by a\nrighte line as the Parculles, which easely may be underpropped. Therfore\nthey which will make a citie oughte to cause to be ordained all the\nsaide things: and moreover aboute the walle, there woulde not bee\nsuffered any grounde to be tilled, within a myle thereof, nor any wall\nmade, but shoulde be all champaine, where should be neither ditch nor\nbanck, neither tree nor house, which might let the fighte, and make\ndefence for the enemie that incampeth.\n[Sidenote: Noote; The provision that is meete to be made for the defence\nof a toune.]\nAnd noote, that a Towne, whiche hathe the ditches withoute, with the\nbanckes higher then the grounde, is moste weake: for as muche as they\nmake defence to the enemye which assaulteth thee, and letteth him not\nhurte thee, because easely they may be opened, and geve place to his\nartillerye: but let us passe into the Towne. I will not loose so muche\ntime in shewing you howe that besides the foresayde thinges, it is\nrequisite to have provision of victualles, and wherewith to fight, for\nthat they be thinges that everye man underdeth, and without them, all\nother provision is vaine: and generally twoo thinges oughte to be done,\nto provide and to take the commoditie from the enemie that he availe not\nby the things of thy countrey: therfore the straw, the beastes, the\ngraine, whiche thou canste not receive into house, ought to be\ndestroied. Also he that defendeth a Towne, oughte to provide that\nnothing bee done tumultuouslye and disordinatelye, and to take suche\norder, that in all accidentes everye man maye knowe what he hath to doo.\n[Sidenote: What incoragethe the enemy most that besiegeth a toune; What\nhe that besiegeth and he that defendeth oughte to doo; Advertisementes\nfor a besieged towne; Howe the Romaines vitaled Casalino besieged of\nAniball; A policie for the besieged.]\nThe order that oughte to be taken is thus, that the women, the olde\nfolkes, the children, and the impotent, be made to keepe within doores,\nthat the Towne maye be left free, to yong and lustie men, whom being\narmed, must be destributed for the defence of the same, appointing part\nof them to the wall, parte to the gates, parte to the principall places\nof the Citie, for to remedie those inconveniences, that might growe\nwithin: an other parte must not be bound to any place, but be ready to\nsuccour all, neede requiring: and the thing beeing ordained thus, with\ndifficultie tumulte can growe, whiche maye disorder thee. Also I will\nthat you note this, in the besieging and defending of a Citie, that\nnothing geveth so muche hoope to the adversarye to be able to winne a\ntowne, as when he knoweth that the same is not accustomed to see the\nenemie: for that many times for feare onely without other experience of\nforce, cities have bene loste: Therefore a man oughte, when he\nassaulteth a like Citie, to make all his ostentacions terrible. On the\nother parte he that is assaulted, oughte to appoincte to the same parte,\nwhiche the enemie fighteth againste, strong men and suche as opinion\nmakethe not afraide, but weapons onely: for that if the first proofe\nturne vaine, it increaseth boldenesse to the besieged, and then the\nenemie is constrained to overcome them within, with vertue and\nreputacion. The instrumentes wherwith the antiquitie defended townes,\nwhere manie: as balistes, onagris, scorpions, Arcubalistes, Fustibals,\nSlinges: and also those were manie with which thei gave assaultes. As\nArrieti, Towers, Musculi Plutei, Viney, Falci, testudeni, in steede of\nwhich thynges be now a daies the ordinance, the whiche serve him that\nbessegeth, and him that defendeth: and therfore I will speake no forther\nof theim: But let us retourne to our reasonyng and let us come to\nparticular offences. They ought to have care not to be taken by famine,\nand not to be overcome through assaultes: concernyng famin, it hath ben\ntolde, that it is requiset before the siege come, to be well provided of\nvitualles. But when a towne throughe longe siege, lacketh victuals, some\ntimes hath ben seen used certaine extraordinarie waies to be provided of\ntheir friendes, whome woulde save them: inespeciall if through the\nmiddest of the besieged Citie there runne a river, as the Romaines\nvittelled their castell called Casalino besieged of Anibal, whom being\nnot able by the river to sende them other victual then Nuttes, wherof\ncastyng in the same great quantitie, the which carried of the river,\nwithout beyng abel to be letted, fedde longe time the Casalinians. Some\nbesieged, for to shew unto the enemie, that they have graine more then\ninough and for to make him to dispaire, that he cannot, by famin\novercome theim, have caste breade oute of the gates, or geven a Bullocke\ngraine to eate, and after have suffered the same to be taken, to the\nintent that kilde and founde full of graine, might shewe that\naboundance, whiche they had not. On the other parte excellent Capitaines\nhave used sundrie waies to werie the enemie.\n[Sidenote: A policie of Fabius in besieging of a toune; A policie of\nDionisius in besiegynge of a toune.]\nFabius suffered them whome he besieged, to sowe their fieldes, to the\nentente that thei should lacke the same corne, whiche they sowed.\nDionisius beynge in Campe at Regio, fained to minde to make an agreement\nwith them, and duryng the practise therof he caused him selfe to be\nprovided of their victuales, and then when he had by this mean got from\nthem their graine, he kepte them straight and famished them.\n[Sidenote: Howe Alexander wanne Leucadia.]\nAlexander Magnus mindyng to winne Leucadia overcame all the Castels\naboute it, and by that means drivyng into the same citie a great\nmultitude of their owne countrie men, famished them.\n[Sidenote: The besieged ought to take heed of the first brunte; The\nremedie that townes men have, when the enemies ar entred into the towne;\nHow to make the townes men yeelde.]\nConcernynge the assaultes, there hath been tolde that chiefely thei\nought to beware of the firste bronte, with whiche the Romaines gotte\noften times manie townes, assaultyng them sodainly, and on every side:\nand thei called it _Aggredi urbem corona_. As Scipio did, when he wanne\nnewe Carthage in Hispayne: the which brunte if of a towne it be\nwithstoode, with difficultie after will bee overcome: and yet thoughe it\nshould happen that the enemie were entred into the citie, by overcomynge\nthe wall, yet the townes men have some remedie, so thei forsake it not:\nfor as much as manie armies through entring into a toune, have ben\nrepulced or slaine: the remedie is, that the townes men doe keepe them\nselves in highe places, and from the houses, and from the towers to\nfaight with them: the whiche thynge, they that have entered into the\ncitie, have devised to overcome in twoo manners: the one with openyng\nthe gates of the citie, and to make the waie for the townes men, that\nthei might safely flie: the other with sendynge foorthe a proclamacion,\nthat signifieth, that none shall be hurte but the armed, and to them\nthat caste their weapons on the grounde, pardon shall be graunted: the\nwhiche thynge hath made easie the victorie of manie cities.\n[Sidenote: How townes or cities are easelie wonne; How duke Valentine\ngot the citie of Urbine; The besieged ought to take heede of the\ndeciptes and policies of the enemie; How Domitio Calvino wan a towne.]\nBesides this, the Citees are easie to bee wonne, if thou come upon them\nunawares: whiche is dooen beyng with thy armie farre of, after soche\nsort, that it be not beleved, either that thou wilte assaulte theim, or\nthat thou canst dooe it, without commyng openly, bicause of the distance\nof the place: wherefore, if thou secretely and spedely assaulte theim,\nalmoste alwaies it shall followe, that thou shalte gette the victorie. I\nreason unwillingly of the thynges succeded in our tyme, for that to me\nand to mine, it should be a burthen, and to reason of other, I cannot\ntel what to saie: notwithstanding, I cannot to this purpose but declare,\nthe insample of Cesar Borgia, called duke Valentine, who beyng at Nocera\nwith his menne, under colour of goyng to besiege Camerino, tourned\ntowardes the state of Urbin, and gotte a state in a daie, and without\nany paine, the whiche an other with moche time and cost, should scante\nhave gotten. It is conveniente also to those, that be besieged, to take\nheede of the deceiptes, and of the policies of the enemie, and therefore\nthe besieged ought not to truste to any thyng, whiche thei see the\nenemie dooe continually, but let theim beleve alwaies, that it is under\ndeceipte, and that he can to their hurte varie it. Domitio Calvino\nbesiegyng a toune, used for a custome to compasse aboute every daie,\nwith a good parte of his menne, the wall of the same: whereby the Tounes\nmenne, belevyng that he did it for exercise, slacked the Ward: whereof\nDomicius beyng aware, assaulted and overcame them.\n[Sidenote: A policie to get a towne.]\nCertaine Capitaines understandyng, that there should come aide to the\nbesieged, have apareled their Souldiours, under the Ansigne of those,\nthat should come, and beyng let in, have gotte the Toune.\n[Sidenote: How Simon of Athens wan a towne; A policie to get a towne;\nHow Scipio gotte certaine castels in Afrike.]\nSimon of Athens set fire in a night on a Temple, whiche was out of the\ntoune, wherefore, the tounes menne goyng to succour it, lefte the toune\nin praie to the enemie. Some have slaine those, whiche from the besieged\nCastle, have gone a foragyng, and have appareled their souldiours, with\nthe apparell of the forragers, whom after have gotte the toune. The\naunciente Capitaines, have also used divers waies, to destroie the\nGarison of the Toune, whiche thei have sought to take. Scipio beyng in\nAfrica, and desiring to gette certaine Castles, in whiche were putte the\nGarrisons of Carthage, he made many tymes, as though he would assaulte\ntheim, albeit, he fained after, not onely to abstaine, but to goe awaie\nfrom them for feare: the whiche Aniball belevyng to bee true, for to\npursue hym with greater force, and for to bee able more easely to\noppresse him, drewe out all the garrisons of theim: The whiche Scipio\nknowyng, sente Massinissa his Capitaine to overcome them.\n[Sidenote: Howe Pirrus wan the chiefe Citie of Sclavonie; A policie to\nget a towne; How the beseiged are made to yelde; Howe to get a towne by\ntreason; A policie of Aniball for the betraiyng of a Castell; How the\nbesieged maie be begiled; How Formion overcame the Calcidensians; What\nthe besieged muste take heede of; Liberalitie maketh enemies frendes;\nThe diligence that the besieged ought to use in their watche and ward.]\nPirrus makyng warre in Sclavonie, to the chiefe citee of the same\ncountrie, where were brought many menne in Garrison, fained to dispaire\nto bee able to winne it, and tourning to other places, made that the\nsame for to succour them, emptied it self of the warde, and became easie\nto bee wonne. Many have corrupted the water, and have tourned the rivers\nan other waie to take Tounes. Also the besieged, are easely made to\nyelde them selves, makyng theim afraied, with signifiyng unto them a\nvictorie gotten, or with new aides, whiche come in their disfavour. The\nold Capitaines have sought to gette Tounes by treason, corruptyng some\nwithin, but thei have used divers meanes. Sum have sente a manne of\ntheirs, whiche under the name of a fugetive, might take aucthoritie and\ntruste with the enemies, who after have used it to their profite. Some\nby this meanes, have understode the maner of the watche, and by meanes\nof the same knowledge, have taken the Toune. Some with a Carte, or with\nBeames under some colour, have letted the gate, that it could not bee\nshutte, and with this waie, made the entrie easie to the enemie. Aniball\nperswaded one, to give him a castle of the Romaines, and that he should\nfain to go a huntyng in the night, makyng as though he could not goe by\ndaie, for feare of the enemies, and tournyng after with the Venison,\nshould put in with hym certaine of his menne, and so killyng the\nwatchmen, should give hym the gate. Also the besieged are beguiled, with\ndrawyng them out of the Toune, and goyng awaie from them, faining to\nflie when thei assault thee. And many (emong whom was Anibal) have for\nno other intente, let their Campe to be taken, but to have occasion to\nget betwene theim and home, and to take their Toune. Also, thei are\nbeguiled with fainyng to departe from them, as Formion of Athens did,\nwho havyng spoiled the countrie of the Calcidensians, received after\ntheir ambassadours, fillyng their Citee with faire promises, and hope of\nsafetie, under the which as simple menne, thei were a little after of\nFormione oppressed. The besieged ought to beware of the men, whiche thei\nhave in suspecte emong them: but some times thei are wont, as well to\nassure them selves with deserte, as with punishemente. Marcellus\nknoweyng how Lucius Bancius a Nolane, was tourned to favour Aniball so\nmoche humanitie and liberalitie, he used towardes him, that of an\nenemie, he made him moste frendely. The besieged ought to use more\ndiligence in the warde, when the enemie is gone from theim, then when he\nis at hande. And thei ought to warde those places, whiche thei thinke,\nthat maie bee hurt least: for that many tounes have been loste, when\nthenemie assaulteth it on thesame part, where thei beleve not possible\nto be assaulted. And this deceipt groweth of twoo causes, either for the\nplace being strong, and to beleve, that it is invinsible, or through\ncraft beyng used of the enemie, in assaltyng theim on one side with\nfained alaroms, and on the other without noise, and with verie assaltes\nin deede: and therefore the besieged, ought to have greate advertisment,\nand above all thynges at all times, and in especially in the night to\nmake good watche to bee kepte on the walles, and not onely to appoincte\nmenne, but Dogges, and soche fiearse Mastives, and lively, the whiche by\ntheir sente maie descrie the enemie, and with barkyng discover him: and\nnot Dogges onely, but Geese have ben seen to have saved a citee, as it\nhappened to Roome, when the Frenchemen besieged the Capitoll.\n[Sidenote: An order of Alcibiades for the dew keping of watch and\nwarde.]\nAlcibiades for to see, whether the warde watched, Athense beeyng\nbesieged of the Spartaines, ordained that when in the night, he should\nlifte up a light, all the ward should lift up likewise, constitutyng\npunishmente to hym that observed it not.\n[Sidenote: The secrete conveighyng of Letters; The defence against a\nbreach; How the antiquitie got tounes by muining under grounde.]\nIsicrates of Athens killed a watchman, which slept, saiyng that he lefte\nhim as he found him. Those that have been besieged, have used divers\nmeanes, to sende advise to their frendes: and mindyng not to send their\nmessage by mouth, thei have written letters in Cifers, and hidden them\nin sundrie wise: the Cifers be according, as pleaseth him that ordaineth\nthem, the maner of hidyng them is divers. Some have written within the\nscaberde of a sweard: Other have put the Letters in an unbaked lofe, and\nafter have baked the same, and given it for meate to hym that caried\ntheim. Certaine have hidden them, in the secreteste place of their\nbodies: other have hidden them in the collor of a Dogge, that is\nfamiliare with hym, whiche carrieth theim: Some have written in a letter\nordinarie thinges, and after betwene thone line and thother, have also\nwritten with water, that wetyng it or warming it after, the letters\nshould appere. This waie hath been moste politikely observed in our\ntime: where some myndyng to signifie to their freendes inhabityng within\na towne, thinges to be kept secret, and mindynge not to truste any\nperson, have sente common matters written, accordyng to the common use\nand enterlined it, as I have saied above, and the same have made to be\nhanged on the gates of the Temples, the whiche by countersignes beyng\nknowen of those, unto whome they have been sente, were taken of and\nredde: the whiche way is moste politique, bicause he that carrieth them\nmaie bee beguiled, and there shall happen hym no perill. There be moste\ninfinite other waies, whiche every manne maie by himself rede and finde:\nbut with more facilitie, the besieged maie bee written unto, then the\nbesieged to their frendes without, for that soche letters cannot be\nsent, but by one, under colour of a fugetive, that commeth out of a\ntoune: the whiche is a daungerous and perilous thing, when thenemie is\nany whit craftie: But those that sende in, he that is sente, maie under\nmany colours, goe into the Campe that besiegeth, and from thens takyng\nconveniente occasion, maie leape into the toune: but lette us come to\nspeake of the present winnyng of tounes. I saie that if it happen, that\nthou bee besieged in thy citee, whiche is not ordained with diches\nwithin, as a little before we shewed, to mynde that thenemie shall not\nenter through the breach of the walle, whiche the artillerie maketh:\nbicause there is no remedie to lette thesame from makyng of a breache,\nit is therefore necessarie for thee, whileste the ordinance battereth,\nto caste a diche within the wall which is battered, and that it be in\nbredth at leaste twoo and twentie yardes and a halfe, and to throwe all\nthesame that is digged towardes the toun, whiche maie make banke, and\nthe diche more deper: and it is convenient for thee, to sollicitate this\nworke in soche wise, that when the walle falleth, the Diche maie be\ndigged at least, fower or five yardes in depth: the whiche diche is\nnecessarie, while it is a digging, to shutte it on every side with a\nslaughter house: and when the wall is so strong, that it giveth thee\ntime to make the diche, and the slaughter houses, that battered parte,\ncommeth to be moche stronger, then the rest of the citee: for that soche\nfortificacion, cometh to have the forme, of the diches which we devised\nwithin: but when the walle is weake, and that it giveth thee not tyme,\nto make like fortificacions, then strengthe and valiauntnesse muste bee\nshewed, settyng againste the enemies armed menne, with all thy force.\nThis maner of fortificacion was observed of the Pisans, when you\nbesieged theim, and thei might doe it, bicause thei had strong walles,\nwhiche gave them time, the yearth beyng softe and moste meete to raise\nup banckes, and to make fortificacions: where if thei had lacked this\ncommoditie, thei should have loste the toune. Therefore it shall bee\nalwaies prudently doen, to provide afore hand, makyng diches within the\ncitee, and through out all the circuite thereof, as a little before wee\ndevised: for that in this case, the enemie maie safely be taried for at\nlaisure, the fortificacions beyng redy made. The antiquitie many tymes\ngotte tounes, with muinyng under ground in twoo maners, either thei made\na waie under grounde secretely, whiche risse in the toune, and by\nthesame entered, in whiche maner the Romaines toke the citee of Veienti,\nor with the muinyng, thei overthrewe a walle, and made it ruinate: this\nlaste waie is now a daies moste stronge, and maketh, that the citees\nplaced high, be most weake, bicause thei maie better bee under muined:\nand puttyng after in a Cave of this Gunne pouder, whiche in a momente\nkindelyng, not onely ruinateth a wall, but it openeth the hilles, and\nutterly dissolveth the strength of them.\n[Sidenote: The reamedie against Caves or undermuinynges; What care the\nbesieged ought to have; What maketh a citee or campe difficulte to bee\ndefended; By what meanes thei that besiege ar made afraied; Honour got\nby constancie.]\nThe remedie for this, is to builde in the plain, and to make the diche\nthat compasseth thy citee, so deepe, that the enemie maie not digge\nlower then thesame, where he shall not finde water, whiche onely is\nenemie to the caves: for if thou be in a toune, which thou defendest on\na high ground, thou canst not remedie it otherwise, then to make within\nthy walles many deepe Welles, the whiche be as drouners to thesame\nCaves, that the enemie is able to ordain against thee. An other remedie\nthere is, to make a cave againste it, when thou shouldeste bee aware\nwhere he muineth, the whiche waie easely hindereth hym, but difficultly\nit is foreseen, beyng besieged of a craftie enemie. He that is besieged,\nought above al thinges to have care, not to bee oppressed in the tyme of\nreste: as is after a battaile fought, after the watche made, whiche is\nin the Mornyng at breake of daie, and in the Evenyng betwen daie and\nnight, and above al, at meale times: in whiche tyme many tounes have\nbeen wonne, and armies have been of them within ruinated: therefore it\nis requisite with diligence on all partes, to stande alwaies garded, and\nin a good part armed. I will not lacke to tell you, how that, whiche\nmaketh a citee or a campe difficult to be defended, is to be driven to\nkepe sundred all the force, that thou haste in theim, for that the\nenemie beyng able to assaulte thee at his pleasure altogether, it is\nconveniente for thee on every side, to garde every place, and so he\nassaulteth thee with all his force, and thou with parte of thine\ndefendest thee. Also, the besieged maie bee overcome altogether, he\nwithout cannot bee, but repulced: wherefore many, whom have been\nbesieged, either in a Campe, or in a Toune, although thei have been\ninferiour of power, have issued out with their men at a sodaine, and\nhave overcome the enemie. This Marcellus of Nola did: this did Cesar in\nFraunce, where his Campe beeyng assaulted of a moste great nomber of\nFrenchmen, and seeyng hymself not able to defende it, beyng constrained\nto devide his force into many partes, and not to bee able standyng\nwithin the Listes, with violence to repulce thenemie: he opened the\ncampe on thone side, and turning towardes thesame parte with all his\npower, made so moche violence against them, and with moche valiantnes,\nthat he vanquisshed and overcame them. The constancie also of the\nbesieged, causeth many tymes displeasure, and maketh afraied them that\ndoe besiege. Pompei beyng against Cesar, and Cesars armie beeyng in\ngreate distresse through famine, there was brought of his bredde to\nPompei, whom seyng it made of grasse, commaunded, that it should not bee\nshewed unto his armie, least it shoulde make them afraide, seyng what\nenemies they had against theim. Nothyng caused so muche honour to the\nRomaines in the warre of Aniball, as their constancie: for as muche as\nin what so ever envious, and adverse fortune thei were troubled, they\nnever demaunded peace, thei never made anie signe of feare, but rather\nwhen Aniball was aboute Rome, thei solde those fieldes, where he had\npitched his campe, dearer then ordinarie in other times shoulde have\nbeen solde: and they stoode in so much obstinacie in their enterprises,\nthat for to defende Rome, thei would not raise their campe from Capua,\nthe whiche in the verie same time that Roome was besieged, the Romaines\ndid besiege.\nI knowe that I have tolde you of manie thynges, the whiche by your selfe\nyou might have understoode, and considered, notwithstandyng I have doen\nit (as to daie also I have tolde you) for to be abell to shewe you\nbetter by meane therof, the qualitie of this armie, and also for to\nsatisfie those, if there be anie, whome have not had the same commoditie\nto understand them as you. Nor me thinkes that there resteth other to\ntell you, then certaine generall rules, the whiche you shal have moste\nfamiliar, which be these.\n[Sidenote: Generall rules of warre.]\nThe same that helpeth the enemie, hurteth thee: and the same that\nhelpeth thee, hurteth the enemie.\nHe that shall be in the warre moste vigilant to observe the devises of\nthe enemie, and shall take moste payne to exercise his armie, shall\nincurre least perilles and maie hope moste of the victorie.\nNever conducte thy men to faight the field, if first them hast not\nconfirmed their mindes and knowest them to be without feare, and to be\nin good order: for thou oughteste never to enterprise any dangerous\nthyng with thy souldiours, but when thou seest, that they hope to\novercome.\nIt is better to conquere the enemie with faminne, then with yron: in the\nvictorie of which, fortune maie doe much more then valiantnesse.\nNo purpose is better then that, whiche is hidde from the enemie untill\nthou have executed it.\nTo know in the warre how to understande occasion, and to take it,\nhelpeth more then anie other thynge.\nNature breedeth few stronge menne, the industrie and the exercise maketh\nmanie.\nDiscipline maie doe more in warre, then furie.\nWhen anie departe from the enemies side for to come to serve thee, when\nthei be faithfull, thei shalbe unto thee alwaies great gaines: for that\nthe power of thadversaries are more deminisshed with the losse of them,\nthat runne awaie, then of those that be slaine, although that the name\nof a fugetive be to new frendes suspected, to olde odius.\nBetter it is in pitchyng the fielde, to reserve behynde the first front\naide inoughe, then to make the fronte bigger to disperse the souldiours.\nHe is difficultely overcome, whiche can know his owne power and the same\nof the enemie.\nThe valiantenesse of the souldiours availeth more then the multitude.\nSome times the situacion helpeth more then the valiantenesse.\nNew and sudden thynges, make armies afrayde.\nSlowe and accustomed thinges, be littell regarded of them. Therfore make\nthy armie to practise and to know with small faightes a new enemie,\nbefore thou come to faight the fielde with him.\nHe that with disorder foloweth the enemie after that he is broken, will\ndoe no other, then to become of a conquerour a loser.\nHe that prepareth not necessarie victualles to live upon, is overcome\nwithout yron.\nHe that trusteth more in horsemen then in footemen, more in footemen\nthen in horsemen, must accommodate him selfe with the situacion.\nWhen thou wilte see if in the daie there be comen anie spie into the\nCampe, cause everie man to goe to his lodgynge.\nChaunge purpose, when thou perceivest that the enemie hath forseene it.\n[Sidenote: How to consulte.]\nConsulte with many of those thinges, which thou oughtest to dooe: the\nsame that thou wilt after dooe, conferre with fewe.\nSouldiours when thei abide at home, are mainteined with feare and\npunishemente, after when thei ar led to the warre with hope and with\nrewarde.\nGood Capitaines come never to faight the fielde, excepte necessitie\nconstraine theim, and occasion call them.\nCause that thenemies know not, how thou wilte order thy armie to faight,\nand in what so ever maner that thou ordainest it, make that the firste\nbande may be received of the seconde and of the thirde.\nIn the faight never occupie a battell to any other thyng, then to the\nsame, for whiche thou haste apoineted it, if thou wilt make no disorder.\nThe sodene accidentes, with difficultie are reamedied: those that are\nthought upon, with facilitie.\n[Sidenote: What thynges are the strength of the warre.]\nMen, yron, money, and bread, be the strengthe of the warre, but of these\nfower, the first twoo be moste necessarie: because men and yron, finde\nmoney and breade: but breade and money fynde not men and yron.\nThe unarmed riche man, is a bootie to the poore souldiour.\nAccustome thy souldiours to dispise delicate livyng and lacivius\naparell.\nThis is as muche as hapneth me generally to remember you, and I know\nthat there might have ben saied manie other thynges in all this my\nreasonynge: as should be, howe and in howe manie kinde of waies the\nantiquitie ordered their bandes, how thei appareled them, and how in\nmanie other thynges they exercised them, and to have joygned hereunto\nmanie other particulars, the whiche I have not judged necessarie to\nshew, as wel for that you your self may se them, as also for that my\nintente hath not been to shew juste how the olde servis of warre was\napoincted, but howe in these daies a servis of warre might be ordained,\nwhiche should have more vertue then the same that is used. Wherfore I\nhave not thought good of the auncient thynges to reason other, then\nthat, which I have judged to suche introduction necessarie. I know also\nthat I might have delated more upon the service on horsebacke, and after\nhave reasoned of the warre on the Sea: for as muche as he that\ndestinguissheth the servis of warre, saieth, how there is an armie on\nthe sea, and of the lande, on foote, and on horsebacke. Of that on the\nsea, I will not presume to speake, for that I have no knowledge therof:\nbut I will let the Genoues, and the Venecians speake therof, whome with\nlike studies have heretofore doen great thinges.\nAlso of horses, I wil speake no other, then as afore I have saied, this\nparte beynge (as I have declared) least corrupted. Besides this, the\nfootemen being wel ordained, which is the puissance of the armie, good\nhorses of necessitie will come to be made.\n[Sidenote: Provisions that maie bee made to fill a Realme full of good\nhorse; The knowledge that a capitaine oughte to have.]\nOnely I counsel him that would ordayne the exercise of armes in his owne\ncountrey, and desireth to fill the same with good horses, that he make\ntwo provisions: the one is, that he destribute Mares of a good race\nthroughe his dominion, and accustome his menne to make choise of coltes,\nas you in this countrie make of Calves and Mules: the other is, that to\nthentente the excepted might finde a byer, I woulde prohibet that no man\nshould kepe a Mule excepte he woulde keepe a horse: so that he that\nwoulde kepe but one beaste to ride on, shoulde be constrained to keepe a\nhorse: and moreover that no man should weare fine cloathe except he\nwhich doeth keepe a horse: this order I under stande hath beene devised\nof certaine princes in our time, whome in short space have therby,\nbrought into their countrey an excellente numbre of good horses. Aboute\nthe other thynges, as much as might be looked for concernynge horse, I\nremit to as much as I have saied to daie, and to that whiche they use.\nPeradventure also you woulde desire to understand what condicions a\nCapitaine ought to have: wherof I shal satisfie you moste breeflie: for\nthat I cannot tell how to chose anie other man then the same, who\nshoulde know howe to doe all those thynges whiche this daie hath ben\nreasoned of by us: the which also should not suffise, when he should not\nknowe howe to devise of him selfe: for that no man without invencion,\nwas ever excellent in anie science: and if invencion causeth honour in\nother thynges, in this above all, it maketh a man honorable: for everie\ninvention is seen, although it were but simple, to be of writers\ncelebrated: as it is seen, where Alexander Magnus is praised, who for to\nremove his Campe moste secretely, gave not warnyng with the Trumpette,\nbut with a hatte upon a Launce. And was praised also for havyng taken\norder that his souldiours in buckelynge with the enemies, shoulde kneele\nwith the lefte legge, to bee able more strongly to withstande their\nviolence: the whiche havyng geven him the victorie, it got him also so\nmuche praise, that all the Images, whiche were erected in his honour,\nstoode after the same facion. But because it is tyme to finishe this\nreasonyng, I wil turne againe to my first purpose, and partly I shall\navoide the same reproche, wherin they use to condempne in this towne,\nsuch as knoweth not when to make an ende.\n[Sidenote: The auctor retorneth to his first purpose and maketh a littel\ndiscorse to make an ende of his reasonyng.]\nIf you remembre Cosimus you tolde me, that I beyng of one side an\nexalter of the antiquitie, and a dispraiser of those, which in waightie\nmatters imitated them not, and of the other side, I havynge not in the\naffaires of war, wherin I have taken paine, imitated them, you coulde\nnot perceive the occasion: wherunto I answered, how that men which wil\ndoo any thing, muste firste prepare to knowe how to doe it, for to be\nable, after to use it, when occasion permitteth: whether I doe know how\nto bryng the servis of warre to the auncient manners or no, I will be\njudged by you, whiche have hearde me upon this matter longe dispute\nwherby you may know, how much time I have consumed in these studies: and\nalso I beleeve that you maie imagen, how much desire is in me to brynge\nit to effecte: the whiche whether I have been able to have doen, or that\never occasion hath been geven me, most easely you maie conjecture: yet\nfor to make you more certaine and for my better justificacion, I will\nalso aledge the occasions: and as much as I have promised, I will\npartely performe, to shew you the difficultie and the facelitie, whiche\nbee at this presente in suche imitacions.\n[Sidenote: A prince may easelie brynge to intiere perfection the servis\nof warre; Two sortes of Capitaines worthie to bee praysed.]\nTherfore I saie, how that no deede that is doen now a daies emong men,\nis more easie to be reduced unto the aunciente maners, then the service\nof Warre: but by them onely that be Princes of so moche state, who can\nat least gather together of their owne subjectes, xv. or twentie\nthousande yong menne: otherwise, no thyng is more difficulte, then this,\nto them whiche have not soche commoditie: and for that you maie the\nbetter understande this parte, you have to knowe, howe that there bee of\ntwoo condicions, Capitaines to bee praised: The one are those, that with\nan armie ordained through the naturalle discipline thereof, have dooen\ngreate thynges: as were the greater parte of the Romaine Citezeins, and\nsuche as have ledde armies, the which have had no other paine, then to\nmaintaine them good, and to se them guided safely: the other are they,\nwhiche not onely have had to overcome the enemie, but before they come\nto the same, have been constrained to make good and well ordered their\narmie: who without doubte deserve muche more praise, then those have\ndeserved, which with olde armies, and good, have valiantely wrought. Of\nthese, such wer Pelopida, and Epaminonda, Tullus Hostillius, Phillip of\nMacedony father of Alexander, Cirus kyng of the Percians, Graccus a\nRomaine: they all were driven first to make their armies good, and after\nto faighte with them: they all coulde doe it, as well throughe their\nprudence, as also for havynge subjectes whome thei might in like\nexercises instruct: nor it shuld never have ben otherwise possible, that\nanie of theim, though they had ben never so good and ful of al\nexcellencie, should have been able in a straunge countrey, full of men\ncorrupted, not used to anie honest obedience, to have brought to passe\nanie laudable worke. It suffiseth not then in Italie, to know how to\ngoverne an army made, but first it is necessarie to know how to make it\nand after to know how to commaunde it: and to do these things it is\nrequisit they bee those princes, whome havyng much dominion, and\nsubjectes inoughe, maie have commoditie to doe it: of whiche I can not\nbee, who never commaunded, nor cannot commaunde, but to armies of\nstraungers, and to men bounde to other, and not to me: in whiche if it\nbe possible, or no, to introduce anie of those thynges that this daie of\nme hath ben reasoned, I will leave it to your judgement.\nAlbeit when coulde I make one of these souldiours which now a daies\npractise, to weare more armur then the ordinarie, and besides the armur,\nto beare their owne meate for two or three daies, with a mattocke: When\ncoulde I make theim to digge, or keepe theim every daie manie howers\narmed, in fained exercises, for to bee able after in the verie thyng in\ndeede to prevaile? When woulde thei abstaine from plaie, from\nlaciviousnesse, from swearynge, from the insolence, whiche everie daie\nthey committe? when would they be reduced into so muche dissepline, into\nso much obedience and reverence, that a tree full of appels in the\nmiddest of their Campe, shoulde be founde there and lefte untouched? As\nis redde, that in the auncient armies manie times hapned. What thynge\nmaye I promis them, by meane wherof thei may have me in reverence to\nlove, or to feare, when the warre beyng ended, they have not anie more\nto doe with me? wher of maie I make them ashamed, whiche be borne and\nbrought up without shame? whie shoulde thei be ruled by me who knowe me\nnot? By what God or by what sainctes may I make them to sweare? By those\nthat thei worship, or by those that they blaspheme? Who they worship I\nknowe not anie: but I knowe well they blaspheme all. How shoulde I\nbeleeve that thei will keepe their promise to them, whome everie hower\nthey dispise? How can they, that dispise God, reverence men? Then what\ngood fashion shoulde that be, whiche might be impressed in this matter?\nAnd if you should aledge unto me that Suyzzers and Spaniardes bee good\nsouldiours, I woulde confesse unto you, how they be farre better then\nthe Italians: but if you note my reasonynge, and the maner of procedyng\nof bothe, you shall see, howe they lacke many thynges to joygne to the\nperfection of the antiquetie. And how the Suyzzers be made good of one\nof their naturall uses caused of that, whiche to daie I tolde you: those\nother are made good by mean of a necessitie: for that servyng in a\nstraunge countrie, and seemyng unto them to be constrained either to\ndie, or to overcome, thei perceivynge to have no place to flie, doe\nbecome good: but it is a goodnesse in manie partes fawtie: for that in\nthe same there is no other good, but that they bee accustomed to tarie\nthe enemie at the Pike and sweardes poincte: nor that, which thei lacke,\nno man should be meete to teache them, and so much the lesse, he that\ncoulde not speake their language.\n[Sidenote: The Auctor excuseth the people of Italie to the great\nreproche of their prynces for their ignorance in the affaires of warre.]\nBut let us turne to the Italians, who for havynge not had wise Princes,\nhave not taken anie good order: and for havyng not had the same\nnecessitie, whiche the Spaniardes have hadde, they have not taken it of\ntheim selves, so that they remaine the shame of the worlde: and the\npeople be not to blame, but onely their princes, who have ben chastised,\nand for their ignorance have ben justely punisshed, leesinge moste\nshamefully their states, without shewing anie vertuous ensample. And if\nyou will see whether this that I say be trew: consider how manie warres\nhave ben in Italie since the departure of kyng Charles to this day,\nwhere the war beyng wonte to make men warlyke and of reputacion, these\nthe greater and fierser that they have been, so muche the more they have\nmade the reputacion of the members and of the headdes therof to bee\nloste. This proveth that it groweth, that the accustomed orders were not\nnor bee not good, and of the newe orders, there is not anie whiche have\nknowen how to take them. Nor never beleeve that reputacion will be\ngotten, by the Italians weapons, but by the same waie that I have\nshewed, and by means of theim, that have great states in Italie: for\nthat this forme maie be impressed in simple rude men, of their owne, and\nnot in malicious, ill brought up, and straungers. Nor there shall never\nbee founde anie good mason, whiche will beleeve to be able to make a\nfaire image of a peece of Marbell ill hewed, but verye well of a rude\npeece.\n[Sidenote: A discription of the folishenesse of the Italian princes;\nCesar and Alexander, were the formoste in battell; The Venecians and the\nduke of Ferare began to have reduced the warfare to the Aunciente\nmaners; He that despiseth the servis of warre, despiseth his own\nwelthe.]\nOur Italian Princes beleved, before thei tasted the blowes of the\noutlandishe warre, that it should suffice a Prince to knowe by\nwritynges, how to make a subtell answere, to write a goodly letter, to\nshewe in saiynges, and in woordes, witte and promptenesse, to knowe how\nto canvas a fraude, to decke theim selves with precious stones and gold,\nto slepe and to eate with greater glorie then other: To keepe many\nlascivious persones aboute them, to governe theim selves with their\nsubjectes, covetuously and proudely: To rotte in idlenesse, to give the\ndegrees of the exercise of warre, for good will, to despise if any\nshould have shewed them any laudable waie, minding that their wordes\nshould bee aunswers of oracles: nor the sely wretches were not aware,\nthat thei prepared theim selves to bee a praie, to whom so ever should\nassaulte theim. Hereby grewe then in the thousande fower hundred nintie\nand fower yere, the greate feares, the sodain flightes, and the\nmarveilous losses: and so three most mightie states which were in\nItalie, have been divers times sacked and destroied. But that which is\nworse, is where those that remaine, continue in the verie same erroure,\nand live in the verie same disorder, and consider not, that those, who\nin old time would kepe their states, caused to be dooen these thynges,\nwhich of me hath been reasoned, and that their studies wer, to prepare\nthe body to diseases, and the minde not to feare perilles. Whereby grewe\nthat Cesar, Alexander, and all those menne and excellente Princes in old\ntyme, were the formoste emongest the faighters, goyng armed on foote:\nand if thei loste their state, thei would loose their life, so that thei\nlived and died vertuously. And if in theim, or in parte of theim, there\nmight bee condempned to muche ambicion to reason of: yet there shall\nnever bee founde, that in theim is condempned any tendernesse or any\nthynge that maketh menne delicate and feable: the whiche thyng, if of\nthese Princes were redde and beleved, it should be impossible, that thei\nshould not change their forme of living, and their provinces not to\nchaunge fortune. And for that you in the beginnyng of this our\nreasonyng, lamented your ordinaunces, I saie unto you, that if you had\nordained it, as I afore have reasoned, and it had given of it self no\ngood experience, you might with reason have been greved therewith: but\nif it bee not so ordained, and exercised, as I have saied, it maie be\ngreeved with you, who have made a counterfaite thereof, and no perfecte\nfigure. The Venecians also, and the Duke of Ferare, beganne it, and\nfollowed it not, the whiche hath been through their faulte, not through\ntheir menne. And therfore I assure you, that who so ever of those,\nwhiche at this daie have states in Italie, shall enter firste into this\nwaie, shall be firste, before any other, Lorde of this Province, and it\nshall happen to his state, as to the kyngdome of the Macedonians, the\nwhich commyng under Philip, who had learned the maner of settyng armies\nin order of Epaminondas a Thebane, became with this order, and with\nthese exercises (whileste the reste of Grece stoode in idlenesse, and\nattended to risite comedes) so puisant, that he was able in few yeres to\npossesse it all, and to leave soche foundacion to his sonne, that he was\nable to make hymself, prince of all the world. He then that despiseth\nthese studies, if he be a Prince, despiseth his Princedome: if he bee a\nCitezein, his Citee. Wherefore, I lamente me of nature, the whiche\neither ought not to have made me a knower of this, or it ought to have\ngiven me power, to have been able to have executed it: For now beyng\nolde, I cannot hope to have any occasion, to bee able so to dooe: In\nconsideracion whereof, I have been liberall with you, who beeyng grave\nyong menne, maie (when the thynges saied of me shall please you) at due\ntymes in favour of your Princes, helpe theim and counsaile them, wherein\nI would have you not to bee afraied, or mistrustfull, bicause this\nProvince seemes to bee altogether given, to raise up againe the thynges\ndedde, as is seen by the perfeccion that poesie, paintyng, and writing,\nis now brought unto: Albeit, as moche as is looked for of me, beyng\nstrooken in yeres, I do mistruste. Where surely, if Fortune had\nheretofore graunted me so moche state, as suffiseth for a like\nenterprise, I would not have doubted, but in moste shorte tyme, to have\nshewed to the worlde, how moche the aunciente orders availe: and without\nperadventure, either I would have increased it with glory, or loste it\nwithout shame.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe ende of the seventh and laste booke of the arte of warre, of\nNicholas Machiavell, Citezein and Secretarie of Florence, translated out\nof Italian into Englishe: By Peter Whitehorne, felow of Graise Inne.\nNICHOLAS MACHIAVEL,\nCITEZEIN AND SECRETARIE OF FLORENCE,\nTO THE READERS\nTo thentente that such as rede this booke maie without difficultie\nunderstande the order of the battailes, or bandes of men, and of the\narmies, and lodgynges in the Campe, accordynge as they in the\ndiscription of theim are apoincted, I thinke it necessarie to shewe you\nthe figure of everie one of them: wherefore it is requiset firste, to\ndeclare unto you, by what poinctes and letters, the footemen, the\nhorsemen, and everie other particuler membre are set foorthe.\nKNOW THERFORE THAT\n.} Signifieth {Targetmen.\n'} {Pikemen.\nc} {a Capitaine of ten men.\nv} {Veliti ordinarie.

MACHIAVEL'S\nPRINCE\nTRANSLATED\nOUT OF ITALIAN INTO ENGLISH BY\nE.D.\nWITH SOME ANIMADVERSIONS\nNOTING AND TAXING\nHIS ERRORS\n1640\nTO THE MOST\nNOBLE AND ILLUSTRIOUS,\nJAMES Duke of Lenox, Earle of March, Baron of Setrington, Darnly,\nTerbanten, and Methuen, Lord Great Chamberlain and Admiral of Scotland,\nKnight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of his Majesties\nmost honourable Privy Counsel in both kingdomes.\nPoysons are not all of that malignant and noxious quality, that as\ndestructives of Nature, they are utterly to be abhord; but we find many,\nnay most of them have their medicinal uses. This book carries its poyson\nand malice in it; yet mee thinks the judicious peruser may honestly make\nuse of it in the actions of his life, with advantage. The Lamprey, they\nsay, hath a venemous string runs all along the back of it; take that\nout, and it is serv'd in for a choyce dish to dainty palates; Epictetus\nthe Philosopher, sayes, Every thing hath two handles, as the fire brand,\nit may be taken up at one end in the bare hand without hurt: the other\nbeing laid hold on, will cleave to the very flesh, and the smart of it\nwill pierce even to the heart. Sin hath the condition of the fiery end;\nthe touch of it is wounding with griefe unto the soule: nay it is worse;\none sin goes not alone but hath many consequences. Your Grace may find\nthe truth of this in your perusal of this Author: your judgement shall\neasily direct you in finding out the good uses of him: I have pointed at\nhis chiefest errors with my best endeavors, and have devoted them to\nyour Graces service: which if you shall accept and protect, I shall\nremain\nYour Graces humble and devoted servant,\nEDWARD DACRES.\nTHE EPISTLE TO THE READER.\nQuestionless some men will blame me for making this Author speak in our\nvulgar tongue. For his Maximes and Tenents are condemnd of all, as\npernicious to all Christian States, and hurtfull to all humane\nSocieties. Herein I shall answer for my self with the Comoedian,\n_Placere studeo bonis quam plurimis, et minim\u00e9 multos l\u00e6dere_: I\nendeavor to give content to the most I can of those that are well\ndisposed, and no scandal to any. I grant, I find him blamed and\ncondemned: I do no less my self. Reader, either do thou read him without\na prejudicate opinion, and out of thy own judgement taxe his errors; or\nat least, if thou canst stoop so low, make use of my pains to help thee;\nI will promise thee this reward for thy labor: if thou consider well the\nactions of the world, thou shalt find him much practised by those that\ncondemn him; who willingly would walk as theeves do with close lanternes\nin the night, that they being undescried, and yet seeing all, might\nsurprise the unwary in the dark. Surely this book will infect no man:\nout of the wicked treasure of a mans own wicked heart, he drawes his\nmalice and mischief. From the same flower the Bee sucks honey, from\nwhence the Spider hath his poyson. And he that means well, shall be here\nwarnd, where the deceitfull man learnes to set his snares. A judge who\nhath often used to examine theeves, becomes the more expert to sift out\ntheir tricks. If mischief come hereupon, blame not me, nor blame my\nAuthor: lay the saddle on the right horse: but _Hony soit qui mal y\npense_: let shame light on him that hatcht the mischief.\nTHE PRINCE\nNICHOLAS MACHIAVELLI,\nto the Magnificent LAURENCE sonne\nto PETER OF MEDICIS health.\nThey that desire to ingratiate themselves with a Prince, commonly use to\noffer themselves to his view, with things of that nature as such persons\ntake most pleasure and delight in: whereupon we see they are many times\npresented with Horses and Armes, cloth of gold, pretious stones, and\nsuch like ornaments, worthy of their greatness. Having then a mind to\noffer up my self to your Magnificence, with some testimony of my service\nto you, I found nothing in my whole inventory, that I think better of,\nor more esteeme, than the knowlege of great mens actions, which I have\nlearned by a long experience of modern affairs, and a continual reading\nof those of the ancients. Which, now that I have with great diligence\nlong workt it out, and throughly sifted, I commend to your Magnificence.\nAnd, however I may well think this work unworthy of your view; yet such\nis your humanity, that I doubt not but it shall find acceptance,\nconsidering, that for my part I am not able to tender a greater gift,\nthan to present you with the means, whereby in a very short time you may\nbe able to understand all that, which I, in the space of many years, and\nwith many sufferances and dangers, have made proof and gaind the\nknowledge of. And this work I have not set forth either with elegancy of\ndiscourse or stile, nor with any other ornament whereby to captivate the\nreader, as others use, because I would not have it gain its esteem from\nelsewhere than from the truth of the matter, and the gravity of the\nsubject. Nor can this be thought presumption, if a man of humble and low\ncondition venture to dilate and discourse upon the governments of\nPrinces; for even as they that with their pensils designe out countreys,\nget themselves into the plains below to consider the nature of the\nmountains, and other high places above; and again to consider the plains\nbelow, they get up to the tops of the mountains; in like manner to\nunderstand the nature of the people, it is fit to be a Prince; and to\nknow well the dispositions of Princes, sutes best with the understanding\nof a subject. Your Magnificence then may be pleased, to receive this\nsmall present, with the same mind that I send it; which if you shall\nthroughly peruse and consider, you shall perceive therein that I\nexceedingly wish, that you may attain to that greatness, which your own\nfortune, and your excellent endowments promise you: and if your\nMagnificence from the very point of your Highness shall sometime cast\nyour eyes upon these inferior places, you shall see how undeservedly I\nundergoe an extream and continual despight of Fortune.\nTHE TABLE OF THE CHAPTERS\nCHAP. 1.\nHow many sorts of Principalities there are, and how many wayes they are\nattained to, 263\nCHAP. 2.\nOf hereditary Principalities, 264\nCHAP. 3.\nOf mixt Principalities, 265\nCHAP. 4.\nWherefore Darius his Kingdome, taken by Alexander, rebelled not against\nhis successors after Alexanders death, 273\nCHAP. 5.\nIn what manner Cities and Principalities are to be governed, which\nbefore they were conquered, lived under their own laws, 276\nCHAP. 6.\nOf new Principalities that are conquered by ones own armes and valor,\n277\nCHAP. 7.\nOf new Principalities gotten by fortune and other mens forces, 281\nCHAP. 8.\nConcerning those who by wicked means have attaind to a Principality, 289\nCHAP. 9.\nOf the Civil Principality, 293\nCHAP. 10.\nIn what manner the forces of all Principalities ought to be measured,\n297\nCHAP. 11.\nConcerning Ecclesiastical Principalities, 299\nCHAP. 12.\nHow many sorts of Military discipline there be; and touching mercenary\nsoldiers, 302\nCHAP. 13.\nOf Auxiliary Soldiers, mixt and natives, 307\nCHAP. 14.\nWhat belongs to the Prince touching military discipline, 310\nCHAP. 15.\nOf those things in respect whereof men, and especially Princes are\nprais'd or disprais'd, 313\nCHAP. 16.\nOf Liberality and Miserableness, 315\nCHAP. 17.\nOf Cruelty and Clemency, and whether it is better to be belov'd or\nfeared, 318\nCHAP. 18.\nIn what manner Princes ought to keep their word, 321\nCHAP. 19.\nThat Princes should take a care not to incur contempt or hatred, 325\nCHAP. 20.\nWhether the Citadels and many other things, which Princes make use of,\nare profitable or dammageable, 335\nCHAP. 21.\nHow a Prince ought to behave himself to gain reputation, 339\nCHAP. 22.\nTouching Princes Secretaries, 343\nCHAP. 23.\nThat Flatterers are to be avoyded, 344\nCHAP. 24.\nWherefore the Princes of Italy have lost their States, 347\nCHAP. 25.\nHow great power Fortune hath in humane affairs, and what means there is\nto resist it, 349\nCHAP. 26.\nAn exhortation to free Italy from the Barbarions, 353\nTHE PRINCE\nWritten by\nNICHOLAS MACHIAVELLI,\nSecretary and Citizen of Florence.\nCHAP. I\nHow many sorts of Principalities there are, and how many wayes they are\nattained to.\nAll States, all Dominions that have had, or now have rule over men, have\nbeen and are, either Republiques or Principalities. Principalities are\neither hereditary, whereof they of the blood of the Lord thereof have\nlong time been Princes; or else they are new; and those that are new,\nare either all new, as was the Dutchy of Millan to Francis Sforce; or\nare as members adjoyned to the hereditary State of the Prince that gains\nit; as the Kingdom of Naples is to the King of Spain. These Dominions so\ngotten, are accustomed either to live under a Prince, or to enjoy their\nliberty; and are made conquest of, either with others forces, or ones\nown, either by fortune, or by valor.\nCHAP. II\nOf Hereditary Principalities.\nI will not here discourse of Republiques, because I have other where\ntreated of them at large: I will apply my self only to a Principality,\nand proceed, while I weave this web, by arguing thereupon, how these\nPrincipallities can be governed and maintained. I say then that in\nStates of inheritance, and accustomed to the blood of their Princes,\nthere are far fewer difficulties to keep them, than in the new: for it\nsuffices only not to transgress the course his Ancestors took, and so\nafterward to temporise with those accidents that can happen; that if\nsuch a Prince be but of ordinary industry, he shall allwaies be able to\nmaintain himself in his State, unless by some extraordinary or excessive\npower he be deprived thereof; and when he had lost it, upon the least\nsinister chance that befalls the usurper, he recovers it again. We have\nin Italy the Duke of Ferrara for example hereof, who was of ability to\nresist the Venetians, in the year 84, and to withstand Pope Julius in\nthe tenth for no other reason, than because he had of old continued in\nthat rule; for the natural Prince hath fewer occasions, and less heed to\ngive offence, whereupon of necessity he must be more beloved; and unless\nit be that some extravagant vices of his bring him into hatred, it is\nagreeable to reason, that naturally he should be well beloved by his own\nsubjects: and in the antiquity and continuation of the Dominion, the\nremembrances and occasions of innovations are quite extinguished: for\nevermore one change leaves a kind of breach or dent, to fasten the\nbuilding of another.\nCHAP. III\nOf mixt Principalities.\nBut the difficulties consist in the new Principality; and first, if it\nbe not all new, but as a member, so that it may be termed altogether as\nmixt; and the variations thereof proceed in the first place from a\nnatural difficulty, which we commonly finde in all new Principalities;\nfor men do willingly change their Lord, beleeving to better their\ncondition; and this beliefe causes them to take armes against him that\nrules over them, whereby they deceive themselves, because they find\nafter by experience, they have made it worse: which depends upon another\nnatural and ordinary necessity, forcing him alwaies to offend those,\nwhose Prince he newly becomes, as well by his soldiers he is put to\nentertain upon them as by many other injuries, which a new conquest\ndraws along with it; in such manner as thou findest all those thine\nenemies, whom thou hast endammaged in the seizing of that Principality,\nand afterwards canst not keep them thy friends that have seated thee in\nit, for not being able to satisfie them according to their expectations,\nnor put in practice strong remedies against them, being obliged to them.\nFor however one be very well provided with strong armies, yet hath he\nalwaies need of the favor of the inhabitants in the Countrey, to enter\nthereinto. For these reasons, Lewis the twelfth, King of France,\nsuddenly took Milan, and as soon lost it; and the first time Lodwick his\nown forces served well enough to wrest it out of his hands; for those\npeople that had opened him the gates, finding themselves deceived of\ntheir opinion, and of that future good which they had promised\nthemselves, could not endure the distastes the new Prince gave them.\nTrue it is, that Countreys that have rebelled again the second time,\nbeing recovered, are harder lost; for their Lord, taking occasion from\ntheir rebellion, is less respective of persons, but cares only to secure\nhimself, by punishing the delinquents, to clear all suspicions, and to\nprovide for himself where he thinks he is weakest: so that if to make\nFrance lose Milan the first time, it was enough for Duke Lodwick to make\nsome small stir only upon the confines; yet afterwards, before they\ncould make him lose it the second time, they had need of the whole world\ntogether against him, and that all his armies should be wasted and\ndriven out of Italy; which proceeded from the forenamed causes: however\nthough both the first and second time it was taken from him. The\ngenerall causes of the first we have treated of; it remains now that we\nsee those of the second; and set down the remedies that he had, or any\none else can have that should chance to be in those termes he was,\nwhereby he might be able to maintain himself better in his conquest than\nthe King of France did. I say therefore, that these States which by\nConquest are annexed to the ancient states of their conqueror, are\neither of the same province and the same language, or otherwise; and\nwhen they are, it is very easy to hold them, especially when they are\nnot used to live free; and to enjoy them securely, it is enough to have\nextinguished the Princes line who ruled over them: For in other matters,\nallowing them their ancient conditions, and there being not much\ndifference of manners betwixt them, men ordinarily live quiet enough; as\nwe have seen that Burgundy did, Britany, Gascony, and Normandy, which so\nlong time continued with France: for however there be some difference of\nlanguage between them, yet can they easily comport one with another; and\nwhosoever makes the conquest of them, meaning to hold them, must have\ntwo regards; the first, that the race of their former Prince be quite\nextinguished; the other, that he change nothing, neither in their lawes\nnor taxes, so that in a very short time they become one entire body with\ntheir ancient Principality. But when any States are gaind in a Province\ndisagreeing in language, manners, and orders, here are the difficulties,\nand here is there need of good fortune, and great industry to maintain\nthem; and it would be one of the best and livelyest remedies, for the\nConqueror to goe in person and dwell there; this would make the\npossession hereof more secure and durable; as the Turk hath done in\nGreece, who among all the other courses taken by him for to hold that\nState, had he not gone thither himself in person to dwell, it had never\nbeen possible for him to have kept it: for abiding there, he sees the\ndisorders growing in their beginnings, and forthwith can remedy them;\nwhereas being not there present, they are heard of when they are grown\nto some height, and then is there no help for them. Moreover, the\nProvince is not pillaged by the officers thou sendest thither: the\nsubjects are much satisfied of having recourse to the Prince near at\nhand, whereupon have they more reason to love him, if they mean to be\ngood; and intending to do otherwise, to fear him: and forrein Princes\nwill be well aware how they invade that State; insomuch, that making his\nabode there, he can very hardly lose it. Another remedy, which is also a\nbetter, is to send Colonies into one or two places, which may be as it\nwere the keys of that State; for it is necessary either to do this, or\nto maintain there many horse and foot. In these colonies the Prince\nmakes no great expence, and either without his charge, or at a very\nsmall rate, he may both send and maintain them; and gives offence only\nto them from whom he takes their fields and houses, to bestow them on\nthose new inhabitants who are but a very small part of that State; and\nthose that he offends, remaining dispersed and poore, can never hurt\nhim: and all the rest on one part, have no offence given them, and\ntherefore a small matter keeps them in quiet: on the other side, they\nare wary not to erre, for fear it befalls not them, as it did those that\nwere dispoild. I conclude then, that those colonies that are not\nchargeable, are the more trusty, give the less offence; and they that\nare offended, being but poor and scattered, can do but little harme, as\nI have said; for it is to be noted, that men must either be dallyed and\nflattered withall, or else be quite crusht; for they revenge themselves\nof small dammages; but of great ones they are not able; so that when\nwrong is done to any man, it ought so to be done, that it need fear no\nreturn of revenge again. But in lieu of Colonies, by maintaining\nsoldiers there, the expence is great; for the whole revenues of that\nState are to be spent in the keeping of it; so the conquest proves but a\nloss to him that hath got it, and endammages him rather; for it hurts\nthat whole State to remove the army from place to place, of which\nannoyance every one hath a feeling, and so becomes enemie to thee; as\nthey are enemies, I wis, who are outraged by thee in their own houses,\nwhensoever they are able to do thee mischief. Every way then is this\nguard unprofitable. Besides, he that is in a different Province, (as it\nis said) should make himself Head and defender of his less powerfull\nneighbors, and devise alwaies to weaken those that are more mighty\ntherein, and take care that upon no chance there enter not any foreiner\nas mighty as himself; for it will alwaies come to pass, that they shall\nbe brought in by those that are discontented, either upon ambition, or\nfear; as the Etolians brought the Romans into Greece; and they were\nbrought into every countrey they came, by the Natives; and the course of\nthe matter is, that so soon as a powerfull Stranger enters a countrey,\nall those that are the less powerfull there, cleave to him, provoked by\nan envy they beare him that is more mighty than they; so that for these\nof the weaker sort, he may easily gain them without any pains: for\npresently all of them together very willingly make one lump with that he\nhath gotten: He hath only to beware that these increase not their\nstrengths, nor their authorities, and so he shall easily be able by his\nown forces, and their assistances, to take down those that are mighty,\nand remain himself absolute arbitre of that Countrey. And he that playes\nnot well this part, shall quickly lose what he hath gotten; and while he\nholds it, shall find therein a great many troubles and vexations. The\nRomans in the Provinces they seiz'd on, observed well these points, sent\ncolonies thither, entertained the weaker sort, without augmenting any\nthing their power, abated the forces of those that were mighty, and\npermitted not any powerfull forreiner to gain too much reputation there.\nAnd I will content my self only with the countrey of Greece for example\nhereof. The Achayans and Etolians were entertained by them, the Macedons\nkingdome was brought low, Antiochus was driven thence, nor ever did the\nAchayans or Etolians deserts prevail so far for them, that they would\never promise to enlarge their State, nor the perswasions of Philip\ninduce them ever to be his friends, without bringing him lower; nor yet\ncould Antiochus his power make them ever consent that he should hold any\nState in that countrey: for the Romans did in these cases that which all\njudicious Princes ought to do, who are not only to have regard unto all\npresent mischiefs, but also to the future, and to provide for those with\nall industry; for by taking order for those when they are afarre off, it\nis easie to prevent them; but by delaying till they come near hand to\nthee, the remedy comes too late; for this malignity is grown incurable:\nand it befalls this, as the physicians say of the hectick feaver, that\nin the beginning it is easily cur'd, but hardly known; but in the course\nof time, not having been known in the beginning, nor cured, it becomes\neasie to know, but hard to cure. Even so falls it out in matters of\nState; for by knowing it aloof off (which is given only to a wise man to\ndo) the mischiefs that then spring up, are quickly helped; but when, for\nnot having been perceived, they are suffered to increase, so that every\none sees them, there is then no cure for them: therefore the Romans,\nseeing these inconvenients afar off, alwaies prevented them, and never\nsufferd them to follow; for to escape a war, because they knew that a\nwar is not undertaken, but deferred for anothers advantage; therefore\nwould they rather make a war with Philip and Antiochus in Greece, to the\nend it should not afterwards be made with them in Italy, though for that\ntime they were able to avoid both the one and the other, which they\nthought not good to do: nor did they approve of that saying that is\nordinarily in the mouthes of the Sages of our dayes, _to enjoy the\nbenefits of the present time_; but that rather, to take the benefit of\ntheir valor and wisdome; for time drives forward everything, and may\nbring with it as well good as evil, and evil as good. But let us return\nto France, and examine if any of the things prescribed have been done by\nthem: and we will speak of Lewis, and not of Charles, as of whom by\nreason of the long possession he held in Italy we better knew the wayes\nhe went: and you shall see he did the clean contrary to what should have\nbeen done by him that would maintain a State of different Language and\nconditions. King Lewis was brought into Italy by the Venetians ambition,\nwho would have gotten for their shares half the State of Lombardy: I\nwill not blame his comming, or the course he took, because he had a mind\nto begin to set a foot in Italy; but having not any friends in the\ncountry, all gates being barred against him, by reason of King Charles\nhis carriage there, he was constrained to joyn friendship with those he\ncould; and this consideration well taken, would have proved lucky to\nhim, when in the rest of his courses he had not committed any error. The\nKing then having conquered Lombardy, recovered presently all that\nreputation that Charles had lost him; Genua yeelded to him, the\nFlorentines became friends with him; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of\nFerrara, the Bentivolti, the Lady of Furli, the Lord of Faenza, Pesaro\nRimino, Camerino, and Piombino, the Lucheses, Pisans and Sienses, every\none came and offered him friendship: then might the Venetians consider\nthe rashness of the course they had taken, who, only to get into their\nhands two Townes in Lombardy, made the King Lord of two thirds in Italy.\nLet any man now consider with how small difficulty could the King have\nmaintained his reputation in Italy, if he had followed these aforenamed\nrules, and secured and defended those his friends, who because their\nnumber was great, and they weak and fearful, some of the Church, and\nothers of the Venetians were alwaies forced to hold with him, and by\ntheir means he might easily have been able to secure himself against\nthose that were mightiest: but he was no sooner got into Milan, than he\ntook a quite wrong course, by giving ayd to Pope Alexander, to seize\nupon Romania, and perceiv'd not that by this resolution he weakned\nhimself, ruining his own friends, and those had cast themselves into his\nbosom, making the Church puissant, by adding to their Spiritual power,\nthey gaind their authority, and so much temporal estate. And having once\ngot out of the way, he was constrained to go on forward; insomuch as to\nstop Alexanders ambition, and that he should not become Lord of all\nTuscany, of force he was to come into Italy: and this sufficed him not,\nto have made the Church mighty, and taken away his own friends; but for\nthe desire he had to get the Kingdome of Naples, he divided it with the\nKing of Spain: and where before he was the sole arbitre of Italy, he\nbrought in a competitor, to the end that all the ambitious persons of\nthat country, and all that were ill affected to him, might have\notherwhere to make their recourse: and whereas he might have left in\nthat Kingdome some Vice-King of his own, he took him from thence, to\nplace another there, that might afterward chace him thence. It is a\nthing indeed very natural and ordinary, to desire to be of the getting\nhand: and alwaies when men undertake it, if they can effect it, they\nshall be prais'd for it, or at least not blam'd: but when they are not\nable, and yet will undertake it, here lies the blame, here is the error\ncommitted. If France then was able with her own power to assail the\nKingdome of Naples, she might well have done it; but not being able, she\nshould not have divided it: and if the division she made of Lombardy\nwith the Venetians, deserv'd some excuse, thereby to set one foot in\nItaly; yet this merits blame, for not being excused by that necessity.\nLewis then committed these five faults; extinguisht the feebler ones,\naugmented the State of another that was already powerful in Italy,\nbrought thereinto a very puissant forreiner, came not thither himself to\ndwell there, nor planted any colonies there: which faults while he\nliv'd, he could not but be the worse for; yet all could not have gone so\nill, had he not committed the sixt, to take from the Venetians their\nState; for if he had not enlarg'd the Churches territories nor brought\nthe Spaniard into Italy, it had bin necessary to take them lower; but\nhaving first taken those other courses, he should never have given way\nto their destruction; for while they had been strong, they would alwaies\nhave kept the others off from venturing on the conquest of Lombardy. For\nthe Venetians would never have given their consents thereto, unless they\nshould have been made Lords of it themselves; and the others would never\nhave taken it from France, to give it them: and then they would never\nhave dar'd to go and set upon them both together. And if any one should\nsay, that King Lewis yeelded Romania to Alexander, and the Kingdome of\nNaples to Spain, to avoid a war; I answer with the reasons above\nalledged, that one should never suffer any disorder to follow, for\navoiding of a war; for that war is not sav'd, but put off to thy\ndisadvantage. And if any others argue, that the King had given his word\nto the Pope, to do that exploit for him, for dissolving of his marriage,\nand for giving the Cardinals Cap to him of Roan; I answer with that\nwhich hereafter I shall say touching Princes words, how they ought to be\nkept. King Lewis then lost Lombardy, for not having observ'd some of\nthose termes which others us'd, who have possessed themselves of\ncountries, and desir'd to keep them. Nor is this any strange thing, but\nvery ordinary and reasonable: and to this purpose I spake at Nantes with\nthat French Cardinal, when Valentine (for so ordinarily was C\u00e6sar Borgia\nPope Alexanders son call'd) made himself master of Romania; for when the\nCardinal said to me, that the Italians understood not the feats of war;\nI answered, the Frenchmen understood not matters of State: for had they\nbeen well vers'd therein, they would never have suffer'd the Church to\nhave grown to that greatness. And by experience we have seen it, that\nthe power hereof in Italy, and that of Spain also, was caused by France,\nand their own ruine proceeded from themselves. From whence a general\nrule may be taken, which never, or very seldom fails, _That he that\ngives the means to another to become powerful, ruines himself_; for that\npower is caus'd by him either with his industry, or with his force; and\nas well the one as the other of these two is suspected by him that is\ngrown puissant.\nCHAP. IV\nWherefore Darius his Kingdome taken by Alexander, rebelled not against\nAlexanders Successors after his death.\nThe difficulties being consider'd, which a man hath in the maintaining\nof a State new gotten, some might marvaile how it came to pass, that\nAlexander the great subdued all Asia in a few years; and having hardly\npossessed himself of it, died; whereupon it seemed probable that all\nthat State should have rebelled; nevertheless his Successors kept the\npossession of it, nor found they other difficulty in holding it, than\nwhat arose among themselves through their own ambition. I answer, that\nall the Principalities whereof we have memory left us, have been\ngoverned in two several manners; either by a Prince, and all the rest\nVassals, who as ministers by his favor and allowance, do help to govern\nthat Kingdom; or by a Prince and by Barons, who not by their Princes\nfavor, but by the antiquity of blood hold that degree. And these kinds\nof Barons have both states of their own, and Vassals who acknowledge\nthem for their Lords; and bare them a true natural affection. Those\nStates that are govern'd by a Prince and by Vassals, have their Prince\nruling over them with more authority; for in all his countrey, there is\nnone acknowledged for superior, but himself: and if they yeeld obedience\nto any one else, it is but as to his minister and officer, nor beare\nthey him any particular good will. The examples of these two different\nGovernments now in our dayes, are, the Turk, and the King of France. The\nTurks whole Monarchy is govern'd by one Lord, and the rest are all his\nVassals; and dividing his whole Kingdom into divers Sangiacques or\nGovernments, he sends several thither, and those he chops and changes,\nas he pleases. But the King of France is seated in the midst of a\nmultitude of Lords, who of old have been acknowledg'd for such by their\nsubjects, and being belov'd by them, enjoy their preheminencies; nor can\nthe King take their States from them without danger. He then that\nconsiders the one and the other of these two States, shall find\ndifficulty in the conquest of the Turks State; but when once it is\nsubdu'd, great facility to hold it. The reasons of these difficulties in\ntaking of the Turks Kingdom from him, are, because the Invader cannot be\ncalled in by the Princes of that Kingdom, nor hope by the rebellion of\nthose which he hath about him, to be able to facilitate his enterprize:\nwhich proceeds from the reasons aforesaid; for they being all his\nslaves, and oblig'd to him, can more hardly be corrupted; and put case\nthey were corrupted, little profit could he get by it, they not being\nable to draw after them any people, for the reasons we have shewed:\nwhereupon he that assails the Turk, must think to find him united; and\nmust rather relie upon his own forces, than in the others disorders: but\nwhen once he is overcome and broken in the field, so that he cannot\nrepair his armies, there is nothing else to be doubted than the Royal\nblood, which being once quite out, there is none else left to be feard,\nnone of the others having any credit with the people. And as the\nconqueror before the victory could not hope in them; so after it, ought\nhe not to fear them. The contrary falls out in Kingdoms governed as is\nthat of France: for it is easie to be enterd by the gaining of any Baron\nin the Kingdom; for there are alwaies some malecontents to be found, and\nthose that are glad of innovation. Those for the reasons alledg'd are\nable to open thee a way into that State, and to further thy victory,\nwhich afterwards to make good to thee, draws with it exceeding many\ndifficulties, as well with those that have ayded thee, as those thou\nhast supprest. Nor is it enough for thee to root out the Princes race:\nfor there remaine still those Lords who quickly will be the ring-leaders\nof new changes; and in case thou art not able to content these, nor\nextinguish them, thou losest that State, whensoever the occasion is\nofferd. Now if thou shalt consider what sort of government that of\nDarius was, thou shalt find it like to the Turks dominion, and therefore\nAlexander was necessitated first to defeat him utterly, and drive him\nout of the field; after which victory Darius being dead, that State was\nleft secure to Alexander, for the reasons we treated of before: and his\nsuccessors, had they continued in amity, might have enjoy'd it at ease:\nnor ever arose there in that Kingdome other tumults, than those they\nthemselves stir'd up. But of the States that are order'd and grounded as\nthat of France, it is impossible to become master at such ease: and from\nhence grew the frequent rebellions of Spain, France, and Greece against\nthe Romans, by reason of the many Principalities those States had:\nwhereof while the memory lasted, the Romans were alwayes doubtfull of\nthe possession of them; but the memory of them being quite wip't out, by\nthe power and continuance of the Empire, at length they enjoy'd it\nsecurely; and they also were able afterwards fighting one with another,\neach of one them to draw after them the greater part of those provinces,\naccording as their authority had gain'd them credit therein: and that\nbecause the blood of their ancient Lords was quite spent, they\nacknowledg'd no other but the Romans. By the consideration then of these\nthings, no man will marvaile that Alexander had so little trouble to\nkeep together the State of Asia; and that others have had such great\ndifficulties to maintain their conquest, as Pyrrhus, and many others;\nwhich proceeds not from the small or great valour of the conquerour, but\nfrom the difference of the subject.\nCHAP. V\nIn what manner Cities and Principalities are to be govern'd, which,\nbefore they were conquer'd, liv'd under their own Laws.\nWhen those States that are conquered, as it is said, have been\naccustomed to live under their own Laws, and in liberty, there are three\nwayes for a man to hold them. The first is to demolish all their strong\nplaces; the other, personally to goe and dwell there; the third, to\nsuffer them to live under their own Laws, drawing from them some\ntribute, and creating therein an Oligarchy, that may continue it in thy\nservice: for that State being created by that Prince, knowes it cannot\nconsist without his aid and force, who is like to doe all he can to\nmaintain it; and with more facility is a City kept by meanes of her own\nCitizens, which hath been us'd before to live free, than by any other\nway of keeping. We have for example the Spartans and the Romans; the\nSpartans held Athens and Thebes, creating there an Oligarchy: yet they\nlost it. The Romans to be sure of Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,\ndismantell'd them quite, and so lost them not: they would have kept\nGreece as the Spartans had held them, leaving them free, and letting\nthem enjoy their own Laws; and it prospered not with them: so that they\nwere forc'd to deface many Cities of that province to hold it. For in\ntruth there is not a surer way to keep them under, than by\ndemolishments; and whoever becomes master of a City us'd to live free,\nand dismantells it not, let him look himselfe to bee ruin'd by it; for\nit alwayes in time of rebellion takes the name of liberty for refuge,\nand the ancient orders it had; which neither by length of time, nor for\nany favours afforded them, are ever forgotten; and for any thing that\ncan be done, or order'd, unlesse the inhabitants be disunited and\ndispers'd, that name is never forgotten, nor those customes: but\npresently in every chance recourse is thither made: as Pisa did after so\nmany yeeres that she had been subdu'd by the Florentines. But when the\nCities or the Provinces are accustomed to live under a Prince, and that\nwhole race is quite extirpated: on one part being us'd to obey; on the\nother, not having their old Prince; they agree not to make one from\namong themselves: they know not how to live in liberty, in such manner\nthat they are much slower to take armes; and with more facility may a\nPrince gaine them, and secure himselfe of them. But in Republiques there\nis more life in them, more violent hatred, more earnest desire of\nrevenge; nor does the remembrance of the ancient liberty ever leave\nthem, or suffer them to rest; so that the safest way, is, either to\nruine them, or dwell among them.\nCHAP. VI\nOf new Principalities, that are conquer'd by ones own armes and valour.\nLet no man marvaile, if in the discourse I shall make of new\nPrincipalities, both touching a Prince, and touching a State, I shall\nalledge very famous examples: for seeing men almost alwayes walk in the\npathes beaten by others, and proceed in their actions by imitation; and\nbeing that others wayes cannot bee exactly follow'd, nor their vertues,\nwhose patterne thou set'st before thee, attain'd unto; a wise man ought\nalwayes to tread the footsteps of the worthiest persons, and imitate\nthose that have been the most excellent: to the end that if his vertue\narrive not thereto, at least it may yeeld some favour thereof, and doe\nas good Archers use, who thinking the place they intend to hit, too\nfarre distant, and knowing how farr the strength of their bow will\ncarry, they lay their ayme a great deale higher than the mark; not for\nto hit so high with their arrow, but to bee able with the help of so\nhigh an aime to reach the place they shoot at. I say, that in\nPrincipalities wholly new, where there is a new Prince, there is more\nand lesse difficulty in maintaining them, as the vertue of their\nConquerour is greater or lesser. And because this successe, to become a\nPrince of a private man, presupposes either vertue, or fortune; mee\nthinks the one and other of these two things in part should mitigate\nmany difficulties; however he that hath lesse stood upon fortune, hath\nmaintain'd himselfe the better. Moreover it somewhat facilitates the\nmatter in that the Prince is constrain'd, because he hath not other\ndominions, in person to come and dwell there. But to come to these who\nby their own vertues, and not by fortune, attain'd to be Princes; the\nexcellentest of these are Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like;\nand though of Moses we are not to reason, he onely executing the things\nthat were commanded him by God; yet merits he well to be admir'd, were\nit only for that grace that made him worthy to converse with God. But\nconsidering Cyrus, and the others, who either got or founded Kingdomes,\nwe shall find them all admirable; and if there particular actions and\nLawes be throughly weigh'd, they will not appeare much differing from\nthose of Moyses, which he receiv'd from so Sovraigne an instructer. And\nexamining their lives and actions, it will not appeare, that they had\nother help of fortune, than the occasion, which presented them with the\nmatter wherein they might introduce what forme they then pleas'd; and\nwithout that occasion, the vertue of their mind had been extinguish'd;\nand without that vertue, the occasion had been offer'd in vaine. It was\nthen necessary for Moses to find the people of Israel slaves in \u00c6gypt,\nand oppress'd by the \u00c6gyptians, to the end that they to get out of their\nthraldome, should bee willing to follow him. It was fit that Romulus\nshould not be kept in Albia, but expos'd presently after his birth, that\nhe might become King of Rome, and founder of that City. There was need\nthat Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the Medes\ngovernment, and the Medes delicate and effeminate through their long\npeace. Theseus could not make proof his vertue, had not he found the\nAthenians dispers'd. These occasions therefore made these men happy, and\ntheir excellent vertue made the occasion be taken notice of, whereby\ntheir countrey became enobled, and exceeding fortunate. They, who by\nvertuous waies, like unto these, become Princes, attain the Principality\nwith difficulty, but hold it with much ease; and the difficulties they\nfind in gaining the Principality, arise partly from the new orders and\ncourses they are forc'd to bring in, to lay the foundation of their\nState, and work their own security. And it is to be consider'd, how\nthere is not any thing harder to take in hand, nor doubtfuller to\nsucceed, nor more dangerous to mannage, than to be the chief in bringing\nin new orders; for this Chief finds all those his enemies, that thrive\nupon the old orders; and hath but luke warme defenders of all those that\nwould do well upon the new orders, which luke-warme temper proceeds\npartly from fear of the opposers who have the laws to their advantage;\npartly from the incredulity of the men who truly beleeve not a new\nthing, unless there be some certain proof given them thereof. Whereupon\nit arises, that whensoever they that are adversaries, take the occasion\nto assayle, they do it factiously; and these others defend but cooly, so\nthat their whole party altogether runs a hazzard. Therefore it is\nnecessary, being we intend throughly to discourse this part, to examine\nif these innovators stand of themselves, or if they depend upon others;\nthat is, if to bring their work to effect, it be necessary they should\nintreat, or be able to constrain; in the first case they allwayes\nsucceed ill, and bring nothing to pass; but when they depend of\nthemselves, and are able to force, then seldom it is that they hazzard.\nHence came it that all the prophets that were arm'd, prevail'd; but\nthose that were unarm'd, were too weak: for besides what we have\nalledg'd, the nature of the people is changeable, and easie to be\nperswaded to a matter; but it is hard also to settle them in that\nperswasion. And therefore it behoves a man to be so provided, that when\nthey beleeve no longer, he may be able to compel them thereto by force.\nMoses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus would never have been able to cause\ntheir Laws to be obey'd, had they been disarm'd; as in our times it\nbefel Fryer Jerome Savanarola, who perished in his new constitutions,\nwhen the multitude began not to beleeve him; neither had he the means to\nkeep them firme, that had beleev'd; not to force beleefe in them that\nhad not beleev'd him. Wherefore such men as these, in their proceedings\nfind great difficulty, and all their dangers are in the way, and these\nthey must surmount by their vertue; but having once master'd them, and\nbeginning to be honored by all, when they have rooted those out that\nenvi'd their dignities, they remain powerful, secure, honorable, and\nhappy. To these choice examples, I will add one of less remark; but it\nshall hold some proportion with them, and this shall suffice me for all\nothers of this kind, which is Hiero the Siracusan. He of a private man,\nbecame Prince of Siracusa, nor knew he any other ayd of fortune than the\noccasion: for the Siracusans being oppress'd, made choyce of him for\ntheir Captain, whereupon he deserv'd to be made their Prince: and he was\nof such vertue even in his private fortune, that he who writes of him,\nsayes, he wanted nothing of reigning, but a Kingdom; this man\nextinguish'd all the old soldiery, ordaind the new; left the old\nallyances, entertained new; and as he had friendship, and soldiers that\nwere his own, upon that ground he was able to build any edifice; so that\nhe indured much trouble in gaining, and suffered but little in\nmaintaining.\nCHAP. VII\nOf new Principalities, gotten by fortune, and other mens forces.\nThey who by fortune only become Princes of private men, with small pains\nattain to it, but have much ado to maintain themselves in it; and find\nno difficulty at all in the way, because they are carried thither with\nwings: but all the difficulties arise there, after they are plac'd in\nthem. And of such sort are those who have an estate given them for\nmoney, by the favor of some one that grants it them: as it befell many\nin Greece, in the cities of Jonia, and Hellespont; where divers Princes\nwere made by Darius, as well for his own safety as his glory; as also\nthem that were made Emperors; who from private men by corrupting the\nsoldiers, attaind to the Empire. These subsist meerly upon the will, and\nfortune of those that have advanced them; which are two voluble and\nunsteady things; and they neither know how, nor are able to continue in\nthat dignity: they know not how, because unless it be a man of great\nunderstanding and vertue, it is not probable that he who hath always\nliv'd a private life, can know how to command: neither are they able,\nbecause they have not any forces that can be friendly or faithful to\nthem. Moreover those States that suddenly fall into a mans hands, as all\nother things in nature that spring and grow quickly, cannot well have\ntaken root, nor have made their correspondencies so firm, but that the\nfirst storm that takes them, ruines them; in case these, who (as it is\nsaid) are thus on a sudden clambred up to be Princes, are not of that\nworth and vertue as to know how to prepare themselves to maintain that\nwhich chance hath cast into their bosoms, and can afterwards lay those\nfoundations, which others have cast before they were Princes. For the\none and the other of these wayes about the attaining to be a Prince, by\nVertue, or by Fortune, I will alledge you two examples which have been\nin the dayes of our memory. These were Francis Sforza, and C\u00e6sar Borgia;\nFrancis by just means and with a great deal of vertue, of a private man\ngot to be Duke of Millan; and that which with much pains he had gaind,\nhe kept with small ado. On the other side C\u00e6esar Borgia (commonly termed\nDuke Valentine) got his state by his Fathers fortune, and with the same\nlost it; however that for his own part no pains was spar'd, nor any\nthing omitted, which by a discreet and valorus man ought to have been\ndone, to fasten his roots in those Estates, which others armes or\nfortune had bestowed on him; for (as it was formerly said) he that lays\nnot the foundations first, yet might be able by means of his\nextraordinary vertues to lay them afterwards, however it be with the\ngreat trouble of the architect, and danger of the edifice. If therefore\nwe consider all the Dukes progresses, we may perceive how great\nfoundations he had cast for his future power, which I judge a matter not\nsuperfluous to run over; because I should not well know, what better\nrules I might give to a new Prince, than the pattern of his actions; and\nhowever the courses he took, availd him not, yet was it not his fault,\nbut it proceeded from an extraordinary and extream malignity of fortune.\nPope Alexander the sixt, desiring to make the Duke his son a great man,\nhad a great many difficulties, present and future: first he saw no way\nthere was whereby he might be able to make him Lord of any State, that\nwas not the Churches; and if he turnd to take that from the Church, he\nknew that the Duke of Milan, and the Venetians would never agree to it;\nfor Faenza and Riminum were under the Venetians protection. Moreover, he\nsaw that the armes of Italy, and those whereof in particular he might\nhave been able to make some use, were in their hands, who ought to fear\nthe Popes greatness; and therefore could not any wayes rely upon them:\nbeing all in the Orsins and Colonies hands, and those of their faction.\nIt was necessary then, that those matters thus appointed by them should\nbe disturbed, and the States of Italy disordered, to be able safely to\nmaster part of them, which he then found easie to do, seeing the\nVenetians upon three considerations had us'd the means to bring the\nFrench men back again into Italy: which he not only did not withstand,\nbut furthered, with a resolution of King Lewis his ancient marriage. The\nKing then past into Italy with the Venetians ayd, and Alexanders\nconsent; nor was he sooner arrived in Milan, than the Pope had soldiers\nfrom him for the service of Romania, which was quickly yeelded up to him\nupon the reputation of the Kings forces. The Duke then having made\nhimself master of Romania, and beaten the Colonies, desiring to hold it,\nand proceed forward, two things hindered him: the one, his own soldiers,\nwhich he thought were not true to him; the other, the French mens good\nwills; that is to say, he feared that the Princes soldiers, whereof he\nhad served himself, would fail him, and not only hinder his conquest,\nbut take from him what he had gotten; and that the King also would serve\nhim the same turn. He had experience of the Orsini upon an occasion,\nwhen after the taking of Faenza he assaulted Bolonia, to which assault\nhe saw them go very cold. And touching the King, he discovered his mind,\nwhen having taken the Dutchy of Urbin, he invaded Tuscany; from which\naction the King made him retire; whereupon the Duke resolved to depend\nno more upon fortune, and other mens armes. And the first thing he did,\nwas, to weaken the Orsini, and Colonnies factions in Rome: for he gain'd\nall their adherents that were gentlemen, giving them large allowances,\nand honoring them according to their qualities with charges and\ngovernments; so that in a few months the good will they bare to the\nparties was quite extinguisht, and wholly bent to the Duke. After this,\nhe waited an occasion to root out the Orsini, having before dispersed\nthose of the family of Colonnia, which fell out well to his hand; and he\nus'd it better. For the Orsini being too late aware, that the Dukes and\nthe Churches greatness was their destruction, held a Council together in\na dwelling house of theirs in the country adjoyning to Perusia. From\nthence grew the rebellion of Urbin, and the troubles of Romania, and\nmany other dangers befell the Duke, which he overcame all with the help\nof the French: and having regained his reputation, trusting neither\nFrance, nor any forrein forces, to the end he might not be put to make\ntrial of them again, he betook himself to his sleghts; and he knew so\nwell to disguise his intention, that the Orsins, by the mediation of\nPaul Orsine, were reconciled to him, to whom the Duke was no way wanting\nin all manner of courtesies whereby to bring them into security, giving\nthem rich garments, money, and horses, til their own simplicities led\nthem all to Sinigallia, into his hands. These heads being then pluck'd\noff, and their partisans made his friends; the Duke had laid very good\nfoundations, to build his own greatness on, having in his power all\nRomania with the Dutchy of Urbin, and gained the hearts of those people,\nby beginning to give them some relish of their well being. And because\nthis part is worthy to be taken notice of, and to be imitated by others,\nI will not let it escape. The Duke, when he had taken Romania, finding\nit had been under the hands of poor Lords who had rather pillag'd their\nsubjects, than chastis'd or amended them, giving them more cause of\ndiscord, than of peace and union, so that the whole countrey was fraught\nwith robberies, quarrels, and other sorts of insolencies; thought the\nbest way to reduce them to termes of pacification, and obedience to a\nPrincely power, was, to give them some good government: and therefore he\nset over them one Remiro D'Orco, a cruel hasty man, to whom he gave an\nabsolute power. This man in a very short time setled peace and union\namongst them with very great reputation. Afterwards the Duke thought\nsuch excessive authority serv'd not so well to his purpose, and doubting\nit would grow odious, he erected a civil Judicature in the midst of the\ncountrey, where one excellent Judge did Preside, and thither every City\nsent their Advocate: and because he knew the rigors past had bred some\nhatred against him, to purge the minds of those people, and to gain them\nwholly to himself, he purpos'd to shew, that if there was any cruelty\nused, it proceeded not from any order of his, but from the harsh\ndisposition of his Officers. Whereupon laying hold on him, at this\noccasion, he caus'd his head to be struck off one morning early in the\nmarket place at Cesena, where he was left upon a gibbet, with a bloody\nsword by his side; the cruelty of which spectacle for a while satisfied\nand amaz'd those people. But to return from whence we have digressd: I\nsay, that the Duke finding himself very strong, and in part out of doubt\nof the present dangers, because he was arm'd after his own manner, and\nhad in some good measure suppress'd those forces, which, because of\ntheir vicinity, were able to annoy him, he wanted nothing else to go on\nwith his Conquest, but the consideration of France: for he knew, that\nthe King, who now, though late, was advis'd of his error, would never\nsuffer him: and hereupon he began to seek after new allyances, and to\nwaver with France, when the French came towards Naples against the\nSpaniards, who then besieged Gagetta; and his design was only to be out\nof their danger, which had been effected for him, had Pope Alexander\nlived. And thus were his businesses carried touching his present estate.\nAs for the future, he had reason to doubt lest the new successor to the\nPapacy would not be his friend, and would endeavor to take that from him\nthat Alexander had bestowed on him; and he thought to provide for this\nfoure waies: First by rooting out the races of all those Lords he had\ndispoyled, whereby to take those occasions from the Pope. Secondly, by\ngaining all the gentlemen of Rome, whereby he might be able with those\nto keep the Pope in some awe. Thirdly, to make the Colledge of Cardinals\nas much at his devotion as possibly might be. Fourthly, by making of so\nlarge Conquests, before the Popes death, as that he might be able of\nhimself to withstand the first fury of his enemies. Three of these fowre\nat Pope Alexanders death he had effected, and the fourth he had neare\nbrought to a point. For of those Lords he had stript, he put to death as\nmany as he could come at, and very few escap'd him: he gaind him the\nRoman Gentlemen: and in the Colledge he had made a great faction. And\ntouching his new Conquest, he had a designe to become Lord of Tuscany.\nAnd he had possessed himself already of Perusia, and Pombin, and taken\nprotection of Pisa: and so soon as he should have cast off his respect\nto France (which now he meant to hold no longer) being the French were\nnow driven out of the Kingdome of Naples by the Spaniards, so that each\nof them was forc'd to buy his friendship at any termes; he was then to\nleap into Pisa. After this Lucca and Siena were presently to fall to\nhim, partly for envy to the Florentines, and partly for fear. The\nFlorentines had no way to escape him: all which, had it succeeded with\nhim, as without question it had, the very same year that Alexander dy'd,\nhe had made himself master of so great forces, and such reputation, that\nhe would have been able to have stood upon his own bottom, without any\ndependance of fortune, or resting upon others helps, but only upon his\nown strength and valor. But Alexander dy'd five years after that he had\nbegun to draw forth his sword: and left him setled only in the State of\nRomania, with all his other designes in the ayre, sick unto death,\nbetween two very strong armies of his enemies; and yet was there in this\nDuke such a spirit and courage; and he understood so well, how men are\nto be gaind, and how to be lost, and so firm were the grounds he had\nlaid in a short time, that, had he not had those armies upon his back,\nor had been in health, he would have carried through his purpose in\nspight of all opposition; and that the foundations he grounded upon were\ngood, it appeard in that Romania held for him above a moneth, and he\nremained secure in Rome, though even at deaths doore: and however the\nBaglioni, Vitelli, and Orsini came into Rome; yet found they none would\ntake their parts against him. And this he was able to have effected,\nthat if he could not have made him Pope whom be would, he could have\nhindred him that he would not should be Pope. But had he been in health\nwhen Alexander dy'd, every thing had gone easily with him; and he told\nme on that day that Julius the second was created Pope, that he had\nfore-thought on all that which could happen, in case his father chanc'd\nto dye, and for every thing provided its remedy, this onely excepted,\nthat he foresaw not that he should at the same time be brought unto\ndeaths dore also. Having then collected all the Dukes actions, me thinks\nI could not well blame him, but rather (as I have here done) set him as\na pattern to be followed by all those who by fortune and others armes\nhave been exalted to an Empire. For he being of great courage, and\nhaving lofty designes, could not carry himself otherwise; and the only\nobstacle of his purposes was the brevity of Alexanders life, and his own\nsickness. Whoever therefore deemes it necessary in his entrance into a\nnew Principality, to secure himself of his enemies, and gain him\nfriends, to overcome either by force or by cunning, to make himself\nbeloved, or feared of his people, be followed and reverenced by his\nsoldiers, to root out those that can, or owe thee any hurt, to change\nthe ancient orders with new wayes, to be severe, and yet acceptable,\nmagnanimous, and liberall; to extinguish the unfaithfull soldiery, and\ncreate new; to maintain to himself the armities of Kings and Princes, so\nthat they shall either with favor benefit thee, or be wary how to offend\nthee; cannot find more fresh and lively examples than the actions of\nthis man. He deserves to be found fault withall for the creation of\nJulius the second, wherein an evil choice was made for him: for, as it\nis said, not being able to make a Pope to his mind, he could have\nwithheld any one from being Pope; and should never have consented that\nany one of those Cardinals should have got the Papacy, whom he had ever\ndone harme to; or who having attaind the Pontificate were likely to be\nafraid of him: because men ordinarily do hurt either for fear, or\nhatred. Those whom he had offended, were among others, he who had the\ntitle of St. Peter ad Vincula, Colonna, St. George, and Ascanius; all\nthe others that were in possibility of the Popedome, were such as might\nhave feard him rather, except the Cardinal of Roan, and the Spaniards;\nthese by reason of their allyance and obligation with him, the other\nbecause of the power they had, having the Kingdome of France on their\nparty; wherefore the Duke above all things should have created a\nSpanyard Pope, and in case he could not have done that, he should have\nagreed that Roan should have been, and not St. Peter ad Vincula. And\nwhoever beleeves, that with great personages new benefits blot on the\nremembrance of old injuries, is much deceiv'd. The Duke therefore in\nthis election, was the cause of his own ruine at last.\nTill wee come to this seaventh Chapter, I find not any thing\nmuch blame-worthy, unlesse it be on ground he layes in the\nsecond Chapter; whereupon hee builds most of this Fabrick, viz.\nThat Subjects must either be dallyed or flatterd withall, or\nquite crusht. Whereby our Author advises his Prince to support\nhis authority with two Cardinall Vertues, Dissimulation, and\nCruelty. He considers not herein that the head is but a member\nof the body, though the principall; and the end of the parts is\nthe good of the whole. And here he goes against himselfe in the\ntwenty sixt Chapter of his Rep. 1. 1. where hee blames Philip of\nMacedon for such courses, terming them very cruell, and against\nall Christian manner of living; and that every man should refuse\nto be a King, and desire rather to live a private life, than to\nreigne so much to the ruine of mankind. The life of C\u00e6sar\nBorgia, which is here given as a paterne to new Princes, we\nshall find to have been nothing else but a cunning carriage of\nthings so, that he might thereby first deceive and inveigle, and\nthen suppresse all those that could oppose or hinder his\nambition. For if you runne over his life, you shall see the\nFather Pope Alexander the sixt and him, both imbarqued for his\nadvancement, wherein they engag'd the Papall authority, and\nreputation of Religion; for faith and conscience these men never\nknew, though they exacted it of others: there was never promise\nmade, but it was only so farre kept as servd for advantage;\nLiberality was made use of: Clemency and Cruelty, all alike, as\nthey might serve to worke with their purposes. All was\nsacrific'd to ambition; no friendship could tye these men, nor\nany religion: and no marvell: for ambition made them forget both\nGod and man. But see the end of all this cunning: though this\nC\u00e6sar Borgia contrived all his businesse so warily, that our\nAuthor much commends him, and hee had attaind neere the pitch of\nhis hopes, and had provided for each misadventure could befall\nhim its remedy; Policy shewd it selefe short-sighted; for hee\nforesaw not at the time of his Fathers death, he himself should\nbee brought unto deaths doore also. And me thinks this Example\nmight have given occasion to our Author to confesse, that surely\nthere is a God that ruleth the earth. And many times God cutts\noff those cunning and mighty men in the hight of their purposes,\nwhen they think they have neare surmounted all dangers and\ndifficulties. 'To the intent that the living may know, that the\nmost high ruleth in the Kingdome of men, and giveth it to\nwhomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.'\nDaniel. 4. 17.\nCHAP. VIII\nConcerning those who by wicked meanes have attaind to a Principality.\nBut because a man becomes a Prince of a private man two wayes, which\ncannot wholly be attributed either to Fortune or Vertue, I think not fit\nto let them passe me: howbeit the one of them may be more largely\ndiscoursed upon, where the Republicks are treated of. These are, when by\nsome wicked and unlawfull meanes a man rises to the Principality; or\nwhen a private person by the favour of his fellow Citizens becomes\nPrince of his countrey. And speaking of the first manner, it shall be\nmade evident by two Examples, the one ancient, the other moderne,\nwithout entring otherwise into the justice or merit of this part; for I\ntake it that these are sufficient for any body that is forc'd to follow\nthem. Agathocles the Sicilian, not of a private man onely, but from a\nbase and abject fortune, got to be King of Siracusa. This man borne but\nof a Potter, continued alwayes a wicked life throughout all the degrees\nof this fortune: neverthelesse he accompanied his lewdnesse with such a\ncourage and resolution, that applying himselfe to military affaires, by\nthe degrees thereof he attained to bee Pr\u00e6tour of Siracusa, and being\nsetled in that degree, and having determined that he would become\nPrince, and hold that by violence and without obligation to any other,\nwhich by consent had been granted him: and to this purpose haveing had\nsome private intelligence touching his designe with Amilcar the\nCarthaginian, who was imployd with his army in Sicily, one morining\ngatherd the people together and the Senate of Syracusa, as if he had\nsome what to advise with them of matters belonging to the Commonwealth,\nand upon a signe given, caus'd his souldiers to kill his Senatours, and\nthe richest of the people; who being slaine, he usurp'd the Principality\nof that City without any civill strife: and however he was twice broken\nby the Carthaginians, and at last besieged, was able not onely to defend\nhis own City, but leaving part of his own army at the defence thereof,\nwith the other invaded Affrique, and in a short time freed Siracusa from\nthe siege, and brought the Carthaginians into extreme necessity, who\nwere constraind to accord with him, be contented with the possession of\nAffrique, and quitt Sicily to Agathocles. He then that should consider\nthe actions and valour of this man, would not see any, or very few\nthings to be attributed unto Fortune; seeing that as is formerly sayd,\nnot by any ones favour, but by the degrees of service in warre with many\nsufferings and dangers, to which he had risen, he came to the\nPrincipality; and that hee maintained afterwards with so many resolute\nand hazardous undertakings. Yet cannot this be term'd vertue or valour\nto slay his own Citizens, betray his friends, to be without faith,\nwithout pitty, without religion, which wayes are of force to gaine\ndominion, but not glory: for if Agathocles his valour bee well weighd,\nin his enturing upon, and comming off from dangers, and the greatnesse\nof his courage, in supporting and mastering of adversities, no man can\nsee why he should be thought any way inferiour even to the ablest\nCaptaines. Notwithstanding his beastly cruelty and inhumanity with\ninnumerable wickednesses, allow not that he should be celebrated among\nthe most excellent men. That cannot then be attributed to Fortune or\nVertue, which without the one or the other was attaind to by him. In our\ndayes, while Alexander the sixth held the sea, Oliverotte of Fermo, who\nsome few yeeres before had been left young by his parents, was brought\nup under the care of an uncle of his on the mothers side, called John\nFoliani, and in the beginning of his youth given, by him to serve in the\nwarres under Paulo Vitelli: to the end that being well instructed in\nthat discipline, he might rise to some worthy degree in the warrs.\nAfterwards when Paulo was dead, he served under Vitellozzo his brother,\nand in very short time, being ingenious, of a good personage, and brave\ncourage, he became one of the prime men among the troops he served in:\nbut thinking it but servile to depend upon another, he plotted by the\nayd of some Citizens of Fermo (who lik'd rather the thraldome of their\nCity than the liberty of it) and by the favour of the Vitelli, to make\nhimselfe master of Fermo; and writ to John Foliani, that having been\nmany yeeres from home, he had a mind to come and see him and the City,\nand in some part take notice of his own patrimony; and because he had\nnot imployd himselfe but to purchase honour, to the end his Citizens\nmight perceive, that he had not vainely spent his time, he had a desire\nto come in good equipage and accompanied with a hundred horse of his\nfriends and servants; and he intreated him that he would be pleasd so to\ntake order, that he might be honourably received by the inhabitants of\nFermo, which turnd as well to his honor that was his uncle, as his that\nwas the nephew. In this, John faild not in any office of courtesie due\nto his nephew: and caused him to be well receivd by them of Fermo, and\nlodged him in his own house: where having passed some dayes, and stayd\nto put in order somewhat that was necessary for his intended villany, he\nmade a very solemne feast, whether he invited John Foliani, and all the\nprime men of Fermo: and when all their chear was ended, and all their\nother entertainments, as in such feasts it is customary, Oliverotto of\npurpose mov'd some grave discourses; speaking of the greatnesse of Pope\nAlexander, and C\u00e6sar his son, and their undertakings; where unto John\nand the others making answer, he of a sudden stood up, saying, that\nthose were things to be spoken of in a more secret place, and so retir'd\ninto a chamber, whether John and all the other Citizens followd him; nor\nwere they sooner set downe there, than from some secret place therein\ncamp forth diverse souldiers, who slew John and all the others: after\nwhich homicide Oliverotto got a horsebacke and ravaged the whole towne,\nand besieged the supreme Magistrate in the palace, so that for feare\nthey were all constraind to obey him, and to settle a government,\nwhereof hee made himselfe Prince; and they being all dead who, had they\nbeen discontented with him, could have hurt him; he strengthned himselfe\nwith new civill and military orders, so that in the space of a yeer that\nhe held the Principality, he was not only secure in the City of Fermo,\nbut became fearefull to all his neighbours; and the conquest of him\nwould have prov'd difficult, as that of Agathocles, had he not let\nhimselfe been deceivd by C\u00e6sar Borgia, when at Sinigallia, as before was\nsaid, he took the Orsini and Vitelli: where he also being taken a yeere\nafter he had committed the parricide, was strangled together with\nVitellozzo (whome he had had for master both of his vertues and vices.)\nSome man might doubt from whence it should proceed, that Agathocles, and\nsuch like, after many treacheries and crueltyes, could possibly live\nlong secure in his own countrey, and defend himselfe from his forrein\nenemies, and that never any of his own Citizens conspir'd against him,\nseeing that by means of cruelty, many others have never been able even\nin peaceable times to maintaine their States, much lesse in the\ndoubtfull times of warre. I beleeve that this proceeds from the well, or\nill using of those cruelties: they may bee termd well us'd (if it bee\nlawfull to say well of evill) that are put in practice only once of\nnecessity for securities sake, not insisting therein afterwards; but\nthere is use made of them for the subjects profit, as much as may be.\nBut those that are ill us'd, are such as though they bee but few in the\nbeginning, yet they multiply rather in time, than diminish. They that\ntake that first way, may with the help of God, and mens care, find some\nremedy for their State, as Agathocles did: for the others, it is\nimpossible they should continue. Whereupon it is to be noted, that in\nthe laying hold of a State, the usurper thereof ought to runne over and\nexecute all his cruelties at once, that he be not forced often to\nreturne to them, and that he may be able, by not renewing of them, to\ngive men some security, and gaine their affections by doing them some\ncourtesies. Hee that carries it otherwise, either for fearefullnesse, or\nupon evill advice, is alwayes constraind to hold his sword drawne in his\nhand; nor ever can hee rely upon his subjects, there being no\npossibility for them, because of his daily and continuall injuries, to\nlive in any safety: for his injuries should bee done altogether, that\nbeing seldomer tasted, they might lesse offend; his favours should bee\nbestowd by little, and little to the end they might keep their taste the\nbetter; and above all things a Prince must live with his subjects in\nsuch sort, that no accident either of good or evill can make him vary:\nfor necessity comming upon him by reason of adversities, thou hast not\ntime given thee to make advantage of thy cruelties; and the favours\nwhich then thou bestowest, will little help thee, being taken as if they\ncame from thee perforce, and so yeeld no returne of thanks.\nCHAP. IX\nOf the Civill Principality.\nBut comming to the other part, when a principall Citizen, not by\nvillany, or any other insufferable violence, but by the favour of his\nfellow-citizens becomes Prince of his native countrey: which we may\nterme a Civill Principality; nor to attaine hereunto is Vertue wholly or\nFortune wholly necessary, but rather a fortunate cunning: I say, this\nPrincipality is climb'd up to, either by the peoples help, or the great\nmens. For, in every City we finde these two humours differ; and they\nspring from this, that the people desire not to be commanded nor\noppressed by the great ones, and the great ones are desirous to command\nand oppresse the people: and from these two several appetites, arise in\nthe City one of these three effects, either a Principality, or Liberty,\nor Tumultuary licentiousnesse. The Principality is caused either by the\npeople, or the great ones, according as the one or other of these\nfactions have the occasion offerd; for the great ones seeing themselves\nnot able to resist the people, begin to turne the whole reputation to\none among them, and make him Prince, whereby they may under his shadow\nvent their spleenes. The people also, not being able to support the\ngreat mens insolencies, converting the whole reputation to one man,\ncreate him their Prince, to be protected by his authority. He that comes\nto the Principality by the assistance of the great ones, subsists with\nmore difficulty, than he that attaines to it by the peoples favour; for\nhe being made Prince, hath many about him, who account themselves his\nequalls, and therefore cannot dispose nor command them at his pleasure.\nBut he that gaines the Principality by the peoples favor, finds himselfe\nalone in his throne, and hath none or very few neare him that are not\nvery supple to bend: besides this, the great ones cannot upon easie\ntermes be satisfied, or without doing of wrong to others, where as a\nsmall matter contents the people: for the end which the people propound\nto themselves, is more honest than that of the great men, these desiring\nto oppresse, they only not to be oppressed. To this may be added also,\nthat the Prince which is the peoples enemy, can never well secure\nhimselfe of them, because of their multitude; well may hee bee sure of\nthe Nobles, they being but a few. The worst that a Prince can look for\nof the people become his enemy, is to be abandoned by them: but when the\ngreat ones once grow his enemies, he is not only to feare their\nabandoning of him, but their making of a party against him also: for\nthere being in them more forecast and craft, they alwayes take time by\nthe forelocks whereby to save themselves, and seeke credit with him who\nthey hope shall get the mastery. The Prince likewise is necessitated\nalwayes to live with the same people, but can doe well enough without\nthe same great men; he being able to create new ones, and destroy them\nagain every day, and to take from them, and give them credit as he\npleases: and to cleare this part, I say, that great men ought to be\nconsiderd two wayes principally, that is, if they take thy proceedings\nso much to heart, as to engage their fortunes wholly in thine, in case\nthey lye not alwayes catching at spoyle, they ought to be well honourd\nand esteem'd: those that bind themselves not to thy fortune, are to be\nconsiderd also two wayes; either they doe it for lack of courage, and\nnaturall want of spirit, and then shouldst thou serve thy selfe of them,\nand of them especially that are men of good advice; for if thy affaires\nprosper, thou dost thy selfe honour thereby; if crost, thou needst not\nfeare them: but when they oblige not themselves to thee of purpose, and\nupon occasion of ambition, it is a signe they think more of themselves\nthan of thee: and of these the Prince ought to beware, and account of\nthem as his discoverd enemyes: for alwayes in thy adversity they will\ngive a hand too to ruine thee. Therefore ought hee that comes to be\nPrince by the peoples favour, keepe them his friends: which he may\neasily doe, they desiring only to live free from oppression: but he that\nbecomes Prince by the great mens favour, against the will of the people,\nought above all things to gaine the people to him, which he may easily\neffect, when he takes upon him their protection: And because men when\nthey find good, where they look for evill, are thereby more endered to\ntheir benefactour, therefore growes the people so pliant in their\nsubjection to him, as if by their favours he had attaind his dignity.\nAnd the Prince is able to gaine them to his side by many wayes, which\nbecause they vary according to the subject, no certaine rule can be\ngiven thereupon; wherefore we shall let them passe I will only conclude,\nthat it is necessary for a Prince to have the people his friend;\notherwise in his adversities he hath no helpe. Nabis Prince of the\nSpartans supported the siege of all Greece, and an exceeding victorious\narmy of the Romans, and against those defended his native countrey and\nState, and this suffic'd him alone, that as the danger came upon him, he\nsecur'd himself of a fewer; whereas if the people had been his enemy,\nthis had nothing availd him. And let no man think to overthrow this my\nopinion with that common proverb, that He who relyes upon the people,\nlayes his foundation in the dirt; for that is true where a private\nCitizen grounds upon them, making his account that the people shall free\nhim, when either his enemyes or the Magistrates oppresse him: In this\ncase he should find himself often deceiv'd, as it befell the Gracchyes\nin Rome, and in Florence George Scali: but he being a Prince that\ngrounds thereupon, who can command, and is a man of courage, who hath\nhis wits about him in his adversityes, and wants not other preparations,\nand holds together the whole multitude animated with his valour and\norders, shall not prove deceiv'd by them, and shall find he hath layd\ngood foundations. These Principalityes are wont to be upon the point of\nfalling when they goe about to skip from the civil order to the\nabsolute: for these Princes either command of themselves, or by the\nMagistrate; in this last case their State is more weak and dangerous,\nbecause they stand wholly at the will and pleasure of these Citizens,\nwho then are set over the Magistrates, who especially in adverse times\nare able with facility to take their State from them either by rising up\nagainst them, or by not obeying them; and then the Prince is not at hand\nin those dangers to take the absolute authority upon him: for the\nCitizens and subjects that are accustomed to receive the commands from\nthe Magistrates, are not like in those fractions to obey his: and in\ndoubtfull times he shall alwayes have greatest penury of whom he may\ntrust; for such a Prince cannot ground upon that which he sees in\npeaceable times, when the Citizens have need of the State; for then\nevery one runs, and every one promises, and every one will venture his\nlife for him, where there is no danger neare; but in times of hazzard,\nwhen the State hath need of Citizens, there are but few of them then,\nand so much the more is this experience dangerous, in that it can be but\nonce made. Therefore a prudent Prince ought to devise a way whereby his\nCitizens alwayes and in any case and quality of time may have need of\nhis government, and they shall alwaies after prove faithfull to him.\nCHAP. X\nIn what manner the Forces of all Principalities ought to be measured.\nIt is requisite in examining the quality of those Principalities, to\nhave another consideration of them, that is, if a Prince have such\ndominions, that he is able in case of necessity to subsist of himself,\nor else whether he hath alwaies need of another to defend him. And to\ncleer this point the better, I judge them able to stand of themselves,\nwho are of power either for their multitudes of men, or quantity of\nmoney, to bring into the field a compleat armie, and joyn battel with\nwhoever comes to assail them: and so I think those alwaies to stand in\nneed of others help, who are not able to appear in the field against the\nenemy, but are forc'd to retire within their walls and guard them.\nTouching the first case, we have treated already, and shall adde somwhat\nthereto as occasion shall require. In the second case, we cannot say\nother, save only to encourage such Princes to fortifie and guard their\nown Capital city, and of the countrey about, not to hold much account;\nand whoever shall have well fortified that town, and touching other\nmatters of governments shall have behaved himself towards his subjects,\nas hath been formerly said, and hereafter shall be, shall never be\nassaild but with great regard; for men willingly undertake not\nenterprises, where they see difficulty to work them through; nor can\nmuch facility be there found, where one assails him, who hath his town\nstrong and wel guarded, and is not hated of his people. The cities of\nGermany are very free; they have but very little of the countrey about\nthem belonging to them; and they obey the Emperor, when they please, and\nthey stand not in fear, neither of him nor any other Potentate about\nthem: for they are in such a manner fortified, that every one thinks the\nsiege of any of them would prove hard and tedious: for all of them have\nditches, and rampires, and good store of Artillery, and alwaies have\ntheir publick cellars well provided with meat and drink and firing for a\nyeer: besides this, whereby to feed the common people, and without any\nloss to the publick, they have alwaies in common whereby they are able\nfor a year to imploy them in the labor of those trades that are the\nsinews and the life of that city, and of that industry whereby the\ncommons ordinarily supported themselves: they hold up also the military\nexercises in repute, and hereupon have they many orders to maintain\nthem. A Prince then that is master of a good strong city, and causeth\nnot himself to be hated, cannot be assaulted; and in case he were, he\nthat should assail him, would be fain to quit him with shame: for the\naffairs of the world are so various, that it is almost impossible that\nan army can lie incampt before a town for the space of a whole yeer: and\nif any should reply, that the people having their possessions abroad, in\ncase they should see them a fire, would not have patience, and the\ntedious siege and their love to themselves would make them forget their\nPrince: I answer that a Prince puissant and couragious, will easily\nmaster those difficulties, now giving his subjects hope, that the\nmischief will not be of durance; sometimes affright them with the\ncruelty of their enemies, and other whiles cunningly securing himself of\nthose whom he thinks too forward to run to the enemy. Besides this by\nordinary reason the enemy should burne and waste their countrey, upon\nhis arrival, and at those times while mens minds are yet warme, and\nresolute in their defence: and therefore so much the less ought a Prince\ndoubt: for after some few dayes, that their courages grow coole, the\ndammages are all done, and mischiefs received, and there is no help for\nit, and then have they more occasion to cleave faster to their Prince,\nthinking he is now more bound to them, their houses having for his\ndefence been fired, and their possessions wasted; and mens nature is as\nwell to hold themselves oblig'd for the kindnesses they do, as for those\nthey receive; whereupon if all be well weigh'd, a wise Prince shall not\nfind much difficulty to keep sure and true to him his Citizens hearts at\nthe beginning and latter end of the siege, when he hath no want of\nprovision for food and ammunition.\nCHAP. XI\nConcerning Ecclesiastical Principalities.\nThere remains now only that we treat of the Ecclesiastical\nPrincipalities, about which all the difficulties are before they are\ngotten: for they are attained to either by vertue, or Fortune; and\nwithout the one or the other they are held: for they are maintaind by\norders inveterated in the religion, all which are so powerfull and of\nsuch nature, that they maintain their Princes in their dominions in what\nmanner soever they proceed and live. These only have an Estate and\ndefend it not; have subjects and govern them not; and yet their States\nbecause undefended, are not taken from them; nor their subjects, though\nnot govern'd, care not, think not, neither are able to aliene themselves\nfrom them. These Principalities then are only happy and secure: but they\nbeing sustained by superior causes, whereunto humane understanding\nreaches not, I will not meddle with them: for being set up and\nmaintained by God, it would be the part of a presumptuous and rash man\nto enter into discourse of them. Yet if any man should ask me whence it\nproceeds, that the Church in temporal power hath attaind to such\ngreatness, seeing that till the time of Alexander the sixt, the Italian\nPotentates, and not only they who are entituled the potentates, but\nevery Baron and Lord though of the meanest condition in regard of the\ntemporality, made but small account of it; and now a King of France\ntrembles at the power thereof; and it hath been able to drive him out of\nItaly, and ruine the Venetians; and however this be well known, me\nthinks it is not superstitious in some part to recall it to memory.\nBefore that Charles King of France past into Italy, this countrey was\nunder the rule of the Pope, Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of\nMilan, and the Florentines. These Potentates took two things principally\nto their care; the one, that no forreiner should invade Italy; the other\nthat no one of them should inlarge their State. They, against whom this\ncare was most taken, were the Pope and the Venetians; and to restrain\nthe Venetians, there needed the union of all the rest, as it was in the\ndefence of Ferrara; and to keep the Pope low, they served themselves of\nthe Barons of Rome, who being divided into two factions, the Orsini and\nColonnesi, there was alwaies occasion of offence between them, who\nstanding ready with their armes in hand in the view of the Pope, held\nthe Popedome weak and feeble: and however sometimes there arose a\ncouragious Pope, as was Sextus; yet either his fortune, or his wisdome\nwas not able to free him of these incommodities, and the brevity of\ntheir lives was the cause thereof; for in ten years, which time, one\nwith another, Popes ordinarily liv'd, with much ado could they bring low\none of the factions. And if, as we may say, one had near put out the\nColonnesi, there arose another enemy to the Orsini, who made them grow\nagain, so that there was never time quite to root them out. This then\nwas the cause, why the Popes temporal power was of small esteem in\nItaly; there arose afterwards Pope Alexander the sixt, who of all the\nPopes that ever were, shewed what a Pope was able to do with money and\nforces: and he effected, by means of his instrument, Duke Valentine, and\nby the ocasion of the French mens passage, all those things which I have\nformerly discoursed upon in the Dukes actions: and however his purpose\nwas nothing at all to inlarge the Church dominions, but to make the Duke\ngreat; yet what he did, turnd to the Churches advantage, which after his\ndeath when the Duke was taken away, was the heir of all his pains.\nAfterwards succeeded Pope Julius, and found the Church great, having all\nRomania, and all the Barons of Rome being quite rooted out, and by\nAlexanders persecutions, all their factions worne down; he found also\nthe way open for the heaping up of moneys, never practised before\nAlexanders time; which things Julius not only follow'd, but augmented;\nand thought to make himself master of Bolonia, and extinguish the\nVenetians, and chase the French men out of Italy: and these designes of\nhis prov'd all lucky to him, and so much the more to his praise in that\nhe did all for the good of the Church, and in no private regard: he kept\nalso the factions of the Orsins and Colonnesi, in the same State he\nfound them: and though there were among them some head whereby to cause\nan alteration; yet two things have held them quiet; the one the power of\nthe Church, which somewhat affrights them; the other because they have\nno Cardinals of their factions, who are the primary causes of all the\ntroubles amongst them: nor shall these parties ever be at rest, while\nthey have Cardinals; because they nourish the factions both in Rome, and\nabroad; and the Barons then are forced to undertake the defence of them:\nand thus from the Prelates ambitions arise the discords and tumults\namong the Barons. And now hath Pope Leo his Holiness found the Popedome\nexceeding puissant, of whom it is hoped, that if they amplified it by\narmes, he by his goodness, and infinite other vertues, will much more\nadvantage and dignifie it.\nCHAP. XII\nHow many sorts of Military discipline there are and touching Mercenary\nsoldiers.\nHaving treated particularly of the qualities of those Principalities,\nwhich in the beginning I propounded to discourse upon, and considered in\nsome part the reasons of their well and ill being, and shewd the waies\nwhereby many have sought to gain, and hold them, it remains now that I\nspeak in general of the offences and defences, that may chance in each\nof the forenamed. We have formerly said that it is necessary for a\nPrince to have good foundations laid; otherwise it must needs be that he\ngo to wrack. The Principal foundations that all States have, as well\nnew, as old, or mixt, are good laws, and good armes; and because there\ncannot be good laws, where there are not good armes; and where there are\ngood armes, there must needs be good laws, I will omit to discourse of\nthe laws, and speak of armes. I say then that the armes, wherewithall a\nPrince defends his State, either are his own, or mercenary, or\nauxiliary, or mixt. Those that are mercenary and auxiliar, are\nunprofitable, and dangerous, and if any one holds his State founded upon\nmercenary armes, he shall never be quiet, nor secure, because they are\nnever well united, ambitious, and without discipline, treacherous, among\ntheir friends stour, among their enemies cowardly; they have no fear of\nGod, nor keep any faith with men; and so long only defer they the doing\nof mischief, till the enemy comes to assul thee; and in time of peace\nthou art despoyled by them, in war by thy enemies: the reason hereof is,\nbecause they have no other love, nor other cause to keep them in the\nfield, but only a small stipend, which is not of force to make them\nwilling to hazard their lives for thee: they are willing indeed to be\nthy soldiers, till thou goest to fight; but then they fly, or run away;\nwhich thing would cost me but small pains to perswade; for the ruine of\nItaly hath not had any other cause now a dayes, than for that it hath\nthese many years rely'd upon mercenary armes; which a good while since\nperhaps may have done some man some service, and among themselves they\nmay have been thought valiant: but so soon as any forrein enemy\nappeared, they quickly shewed what they were. Whereupon Charles the King\nof France, without opposition, made himself master of all Italy: and he\nthat said, that the causes thereof were our faults, said true; but these\nwere not those they beleeved, but what I have told; and because they\nwere the Princes faults, they also have suffered the punishment. I will\nfuller shew the infelicity of these armes. The mercenary Captains are\neither very able men, or not: if they be, thou canst not repose any\ntrust in them: for they will alwaies aspire unto their own proper\nadvancements, either by suppressing of thee that art their Lord, or by\nsuppressing of some one else quite out of thy purpose: but if the\nCaptain be not valorous, he ordinarily ruines thee: and in case it be\nanswered, that whoever shall have his armes in his hands, whether\nmercenary or not, will do so: I would reply, that armes are to be\nimployed either by a Prince, or Common-wealth. The Prince ought to go in\nperson, and performe the office of a commander: the Republick is to send\nforth her Citizens: and when she sends forth one that proves not of\nabilities, she ought to change him then; and when he does prove\nvalorous, to bridle him so by the laws, that he exceed not his\ncommission. And by experience we see, that Princes and Republiques of\nthemselves alone, make very great conquests; but that mercenary armes\nnever do other than harme; and more hardly falls a Republick armed with\nher own armes under the obedience of one of her own Citizens, than one\nthat is armed by forrein armes. Rome and Sparta subsisted many ages\narmed and free. The Swissers are exceedingly well armed, and yet very\nfree. Touching mercenary armes that were of old, we have an example of\nthe Carthagians, who near upon were oppress'd by their own mercenary\nsoldiers, when the first war with the Romans was finished; however the\nCarthagians had their own Citizens for their Captains. Philip of Macedon\nwas made by the Thebans after Epaminondas his death, General of their\nArmies; and after the victory, he took from them liberty. The Milaneses\nwhen Duke Philip was dead, entertaind Francis Sforza into their pay\nagainst the Venetians, who having vanquisht their enemie at Caravaggio,\nafterwards joyned with them, where by to usurp upon the Milaneses his\nMasters. Sforza his father, being in Joan the Queen of Naples pay, left\nher on a sudden disarmed; whereupon she, to save her Kingdom, was\nconstraind to cast her self into the King of Arrragon's bosome. And in\ncase the Venetians and the Florentines have formerly augmented their\nState with these kind of armes, and their own Captains, and yet none of\nthem have ever made themselves their Princes, but rather defended them:\nI answer, that the Florentines in this case have had fortune much their\nfriend: for of valorous Captains, which they might any way fear, some\nhave not been victors, some have had opposition, and others have laid\nthe aim of their ambitions another way. He who overcame not, was John\nAouto, of whose faith there could no proof be made, being he vanquisht\nnot; but every one will acknowledge, that, had he vanquisht, the\nFlorentines were at his discretion. Sforza had alwaies the Bracceschi\nfor his adversaries, so that they were as a guard one upon another.\nFrancis converted all his ambition against Lombardy. Braccio against the\nChurch, and the Kingdome of Naples. But let us come to that which\nfollowed a while agoe. The Florentines made Paul Vitelli their General,\na throughly advis'd man, and who from a private fortune had rose to very\ngreat reputation: had he taken Pisa, no man will deny but that the\nFlorentines must have held fast with him; for had he been entertained in\ntheir enemies pay, they had no remedy; and they themselves holding of\nhim, of force were to obey him. The Venetians, if we consider their\nproceedings, we shall see wrought both warily and gloriously, while\nthemselves made war, which was before their undertakings by land, where\nthe gentlemen with their own Commons in armes behav'd themselves\nbravely: but when they began to fight by land, they lost their valor,\nand follow'd the customes of Italy; and in the beginning of their\nenlargement by land, because they had not much territory, and yet were\nof great reputation, they had not much cause to fear their Captains; but\nas they began to extend their bounds, which was under their Commander\nCarminiola, they had a taste of this error: for perceiving he was\nexceeding valorous, having under his conduct beaten the Duke of Milan;\nand knowing on the other side, how he was cold in the war, they judg'd\nthat they could not make any great conquest with him; and because they\nneither would, nor could cashier him, that they might not lose what they\nhad gotten, they were forced for their own safeties to put him to death.\nSince they have had for their General Bartholomew of Berganio, Robert of\nSt. Severin, the Count of Petilian, and such like: whereby they were to\nfear their losses, as well as to hope for gain: as it fell out\nafterwards at Vayla, where in one day they lost that, which with so much\npains they had gotten in eight hundred years: for from these kind of\narmes grow slack and slow and weak gains; but sudden and wonderfull\nlosses: And because I am now come with these examples into Italy, which\nnow these many years, have been governd by mercenary armes, I will\nsearch deeper into them, to the end that their course and progress being\nbetter discoverd, they may be the better amended. You have to\nunderstand, that so soon as in these later times the yoak of the Italian\nEmpire began to be shaken off, and the Pope had gotten reputation in the\ntemporality, Italy was divided into several States: for many of the\ngreat cities took armes against their Nobility; who under the Emperors\nprotection had held them in oppression; and the Pope favored these,\nwhereby he might get himself reputation, in the temporality; of many\nothers, their Citizens became Princes, so that hereupon Italy being come\ninto the Churches hands as it were, and some few Republicks, those\nPriests and Citizens not accustomed to the use of armes, began to take\nstrangers to their pay. The first that gave reputation to these soldiers\nwas Alberick of Como in Romania. From his discipline among others\ndescended Brachio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbitres of\nItaly; after these followed all others, who even till our dayes have\ncommanded the armes of Italy; and the success of their valor hath been,\nthat it was overrun by Charles, pillaged by Lewis, forc'd by Ferdinand,\nand disgrac'd by the Swissers. The order which they have held, hath\nbeen, first whereby to give reputation to their own armes to take away\nthe credit of the Infantry. This they did, because they having no State\nof their own, but living upon their industry, their few foot gave them\nno reputation, and many they were not able to maintain; whereupon they\nreduc'd themselves to cavalery, and so with a supportable number they\nwere entertained and honored: and matters were brought to such termes,\nthat in an army of twenty thousand soldiers you should not find two\nthousand foot. They had moreover us'd all industry to free themselves\nand their soldiers of all pains and fear, in their skirmishes, not\nkilling, but taking one another prisoners, and without ransome for their\nfreedom; they repaired not all to their tents by night, nor made\npalizado or trench thereabout, nor lay in the field in the summer: and\nall these things were thus contrived and agreed of among them in their\nmilitary orders, whereby (as is said) to avoid pains and dangers,\ninsomuch as they have brought Italy into slavery and disgrace.\nCHAP. XIII\nOf Auxiliary Soldiers, mixt, and native.\nThe Auxiliary forces, being the other kind of unprofitable armes, are,\nwhen any puissant one is called in, who with his forces comes to assist\nand defend thee; such as in these later times did Pope Julius use, who\nhaving seen the evil proof of his mercenary soldiers in the enterprize\nof Ferrara, applied himself to the Auxiliaries, and agreed with\nFerdinand King of Spain, that with his Forces he should aid him. These\narmes may be profitable and advantagious for themselves; but for him\nthat calls them in, hurtfull; because in losing, thou art left defeated;\nand conquering, thou becomest their prisoner. And however that of these\nexamples the ancient stories are full fraught; yet will I not part from\nthis of Pope Julius the second, which is as yet fresh: whose course\ncould not have been more inconsiderate, for the desire he had to get\nFerrara, putting himself wholly into strangers hands: but his good\nfortune caused another cause to arise, that hindred him from receiving\nthe fruit of his evil choice; for his Auxiliaries being broken at\nRavenna, and the Swissers thereupon arriving, who put the Conquerors to\nflight beyond all opinion, even their own and others, he chanced not to\nremain his enemies prisoner, they being put to flight, nor prisoner to\nhis Auxiliaries, having vanquished by other forces than theirs. The\nFlorentines being wholly disarmed, brought ten thousand French to Pisa\nfor to take it: by which course they ran more hazzard, than in any time\nof their troubles. The Emperor of Constantinople, to oppress his\nneighbors, brought into Greece ten thousand Turks, who when the war was\nended, could not be got out thence, which was the beginning of Greeces\nservitude under the Infidels. He then that will in no case be able to\novercome, let him serve himself of these armes; for they are much more\ndangerous than the mercenaries; for by those thy ruine is more suddenly\nexecuted; for they are all united, and all bent to the obedience of\nanother. But for the mercenaries to hurt thee, when they have\nvanquished, there is no more need of time, and greater occasion, they\nnot being all united in a body, and being found out and paid by thee,\nwherein a third that thou mak'st their head, cannot suddenly gaine so\ngreat authority, that he can endammage thee. In summe, in the\nmercenaries their sloth and lazinesse to fight is more dangerous: in the\nauxiliaries their valour. Wherefore a wise Prince hath alwayes avoyded\nthese kind of armes, and betaken himselfe to his owne, and desired\nrather to loss with his owne, than conquer with anothers, accounting\nthat not a true victorie which was gotten with others armes. I will not\ndoubt to alleadge C\u00e6sar Borgia, and his actions. This Duke entred into\nRomania with auxiliarie armes, bringing with him all French souldiers:\nbut afterwards not accounting those armes secure, bent himselfe to\nmercenaries, judging lesse danger to be in those, and tooke in pay the\nOrsini and the Vitelli, which afterwards in the proof of them, finding\nwavering, unfaithful, and dangerous, he extinguishd, and betook himselfe\nto his owne; and it may easily be perceiv'd what difference there is\nbetween the one and the other of these armes, considering the difference\nthat was between the Dukes reputation, when he had the French men alone,\nand when he had the Orsini and Vitelli; but when he remaind with his\nown, and stood of himselfe, we shall find it was much augmented: nor\never was it of grate esteeme, but when every one saw, that he wholly\npossessed his owne armes. I thought not to have parted from the Italian\nexamples of late memory; but that I must not let passe that of Hiero the\nSiracusan, being one of those I formerly nam'd. This man (as I said\nbefore) being made general of the Siracusans forces, knew presently that\nmercenary souldiery was nothing for their profit in that they were\nhirelings, as our Italians are; and finding no way either to hold, or\ncashier them made them all bee cut to peeces, and afterwards waged warre\nwith his owne men, and none others. I will also call to memory a figure\nof the old Testament serving just to this purpose. When David presented\nhimselfe before Saul to goe to fight with Goliah the Philistins\nChampion, Saul to encourage him, clad him with his owne armes, which\nDavid when he had them upon back, refused, saying, he was not able to\nmake any proofe of himself therein, and therefore would goe meet the\nenemy with his own sling and sword. In summe, others armes either fall\nfrom thy shoulders, or cumber or streighten thee. Charls the seventh,\nFather of Lewis the eleventh, having by his good fortune and valour set\nFrance at liberty from the English, knew well this necessity of being\narm'd with his owne armes, and settled in his Kingdome the ordinances of\nmen at armes, and infantry. Afterwards King Lewis his sonne abolisht\nthose of the infantry, and began to take the Swissers to pay; which\nerrour follow'd by the others, is (as now indeed it appeares) the cause\nof that Kingdomes dangers. For having given reputation to the Swissers,\nthey have renderd all their own armes contemptible; for this hath wholly\nruind their foot, and oblig'd their men at armes to forrein armes: for\nbeing accustomed to serve with the Swissers, they think they are not\nable to overcome without them. From whence it comes that the French are\nnot of force against the Swissers, and without them also against others\nthey use not to adventure. Therefore are the French armies mixt, part\nmercenaries, and part natives, which armes are farre better than the\nsimple mercenaries or simple auxiliaries, and much inferiour to the\nnatives; and let the said example suffice for that: for the Kingdome of\nFrance would have been unconquerable, if Charles his order had been\naugmented and maintaind: but men in their small wisdome begin a thing,\nwhich then because it hath some favour of good, discovers not the poyson\nthat lurkes thereunder, as I before said of the hectick feavers.\nWherefore that Prince which perceives not mischiefes, but as they grow\nup, is not truely wise; and this is given but to few: and if we consider\nthe first ruine of the Romane Empire, we shall find it was from taking\nthe Goths first into their pay; for from that beginning the forces of\nthe Romane Empire began to grow weak, and all the valour that was taken\nhence was given to them. I conclude then that without having armes of\ntheir owne, no Principality can be secure, or rather is wholly oblig'd\nto fortune, not having valour to shelter it in adversity. And it was\nalwayes the opinion and saying of wise men, that nothing is so weak and\nunsetled, as is the reputation of power not founded upon ones owne\nproper forces: which are those that are composed of thy subjects, or\nCitizens, or servants; all the rest are mercenary or auxiliary; and the\nmanner how to order those well, is easie to find out, if those orders\nabove nam'd by me, shall be but run over, and if it shall be but\nconsider'd, how Philip Alexander the Great his Father, and in what\nmanner many Republicks and Princes have armd and appointed themselves,\nto which appointments I referre my selfe wholly.\nCHAP. XIV\nWhat belongs to the Prince touching military Discipline.\nA prince then ought to have no other ayme, nor other thought, nor take\nany thing else for his proper art, but warr, and the orders and\ndiscipline thereof: for that is the sole arte which belongs to him that\ncommands, and is of so great excellency, that not only those that are\nborne Princes, it maintains so; but many times raises men from a private\nfortune to that dignity. And it is seene by the contrary, that when\nPrinces have given themselves more to their delights, than to the\nwarres, they have lost their States; and the first cause that makes thee\nlose it, is the neglect of that arte; and the cause that makes thee\ngaine it, is that thou art experienc'd and approvd in that arte. Francis\nSforza by being a man at armes, of a private man became Duke of Milan;\nand his sons by excusing themselves of the troubles and paines belonging\nto those imployments of Princes, became private men. For among other\nmischiefes thy neglect of armes brings upon thee, it causes thee to be\ncontemnd, which is one of those disgraces, from which a Prince ought to\nkeepe himselfe, as hereafter shall be sayd: for from one that is disarmd\nto one that is armd there is no proportion; and reason will not, that he\nwho is in armes, should willingly yeeld obedience to him that is\nunfurnishd of them, and that he that is disarmd should be in security\namong his armed vassalls; for there being disdaine in the one, and\nsuspicion in the other, it is impossible these should ever well\ncooperate. And therefore a Prince who is quite unexperienced in matter\nof warre, besides the other infelicities belonging to him, as is said,\ncannot be had in any esteeme among his souldiers, nor yet trust in them.\nWherefore he ought never to neglect the practice of the arte of warre,\nand in time of peace should he exercise it more than in the warre; which\nhe may be able to doe two wayes; the one practically, and in his labours\nand recreations of his body, the other theoretically. And touching the\npractick part, he ought besides the keeping of his own subjects well\ntraind up in the discipline and exercise of armes, give himselfe much to\nthe chase, whereby to accustome his body to paines, and partly to\nunderstand the manner of situations, and to know how the mountaines\narise, which way the vallyes open themselves, and how the plaines are\ndistended flat abroad, and to conceive well the nature of the rivers,\nand marrish ground, and herein to bestow very much care, which knowledge\nis profitable in two kinds: first he learnes thereby to know his own\ncountrey, and is the better enabled to understand the defence thereof,\nand afterwards by meanes of this knowledge and experience in these\nsituations, easily comprehends any other situation, which a new he hath\nneed to view, for the little hillocks, vallies, plaines, rivers, and\nmarrish places. For example, they in Tuscany are like unto those of\nother countries: so that from the knowledge of the site of one country,\nit is easie to attain to know that of others. And that Prince that wants\nthis skill, failes of the principall part a Commander should be furnisht\nwith; for this shows the way how to discover the enemy, to pitch the\ncamp, to lead their armies, to order their battells, and also to besiege\na town at thy best advantage, Philopomenes Prince of the Achayans, among\nother praises Writers give him, they say, that in time of peace, he\nthought not upon any thing so much as the practise of warre; and\nwhensoever he was abroad in the field to disport himselfe with his\nfriends, would often stand still, and discourse with them, in case the\nenemies were upon the top of that hill, and we here with our army,\nwhether of us two should have the advantage, and how might we safely goe\nto find them, keeping still our orders; and if we would retire our\nselves, what course should we take if they retir'd, how should we follow\nthem? and thus on the way, propounded them all such accidents could\nbefall in any army; would heare their opinions, and tell his owne, and\nconfirme it by argument; so that by his continuall thought hereupon,\nwhen ever he led any army no chance could happen, for which he had not a\nremedy. But touching the exercise of the mind, a Prince ought to read\nHistories, and in them consider the actions of the worthiest men, marke\nhow they have behav'd themselves in the warrs, examine the occasions of\ntheir victories, and their losses; wherby they may be able to avoyd\nthese, and obtaine those; and above all, doe as formerly some excellent\nman hath done, who hath taken upon him to imitate, if any one that hath\ngone before him hath left his memory glorious; the course he took, and\nkept alwaies near unto him the remembrances of his actions and worthy\ndeeds: as it is said, that Alexander the great imitated Achilles; C\u00e6sar\nAlexander, and Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus,\nwritten by Xenophon, may easily perceive afterwards in Scipio's life how\nmuch glory his imitation gaind him, and how much Scipio did conforme\nhimselfe in his chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality with\nthose things, that are written by Xenophon of Cyrus. Such like wayes\nought a wise Prince to take, nor ever be idle in quiet times, but by his\npaines then, as it were provide himself of store, whereof he may make\nsome use in his adversity, the end that when the times change, he may be\nable to resist the stormes of his hard fortune.\nCHAP. XV\nOf those things, in respect whereof, men, and especially Princes, are\npraised, or dispraised.\nIt now remaines that we consider what the conditions of a Prince ought\nto be, and his termes of government over his subjects, and towards his\nfriends. And because I know that many have written hereupon; I doubt,\nlest I venturing also to treat thereof, may be branded with presumption,\nespecially seeing I am like enough to deliver an opinion different from\nothers. But my intent being to write for the advantage of him that\nunderstands me, I thought it fitter to follow the effectuall truth of\nthe matter, than the imagination thereof; And many Principalities and\nRepubliques, have been in imagination, which neither have been seen nor\nknowne to be indeed: for there is such a distance between how men doe\nlive, and how men ought to live; that he who leaves that which is done,\nfor that which ought to be done, learnes sooner his ruine than his\npreservation; for that man who will professe honesty in all his actions,\nmust needs goe to ruine among so many that are dishonest. Whereupon it\nis necessary for a Prince, desiring to preserve himselfe, to be able to\nmake use of that honestie, and to lay it aside againe, as need shall\nrequire. Passing by then things that are only in imagination belonging\nto a Prince, to discourse upon those that are really true; I say that\nall men, whensoever mention is made of them, and especially Princes,\nbecause they are placed aloft in the view of all, are taken notice of\nfor some of these qualities, which procure them either commendations or\nblame: and this is that some one is held liberal, some miserable,\n(miserable I say, nor covetous; for the covetous desire to have, though\nit were by rapine; but a miserable man is he, that too much for bears to\nmake use of his owne) some free givers, others extortioners; some\ncruell, others pitious; the one a Leaguebreaker, another faithfull; the\none effeminate and of small courage, the other fierce and couragious;\nthe one courteous, the other proud; the one lascivious, the other\nchaste; the one of faire dealing, the other wily and crafty; the one\nhard, the other easie; the one grave, the other light; the one\nreligious, the other incredulous, and such like. I know that every one\nwill confesse, it were exceedingly praise worthy for a Prince to be\nadorned with all these above nam'd qualities that are good: but because\nthis is not possible, nor doe humane conditions admit such perfection in\nvertues, it is necessary for him to be so discret, that he know how to\navoid the infamie of those vices which would thrust him out of his\nState; and if it be possible, beware of those also which are not able to\nremove him thence; but where it cannot be, let them passe with lesse\nregard. And yet, let him not stand much upon it, though he incurre the\ninfamie of those vices, without which he can very hardly save his State:\nfor if all be throughly considerd, some thing we shall find which will\nhave the colour and very face of Vertue, and following them, they will\nlead the to thy destruction; whereas some others that shall as much\nseeme vice, if we take the course they lead us, shall discover unto us\nthe way to our safety and well-being.\nThe second blemish in this our Authours book, I find in his\nfifteenth Chapter: where he instructs his Prince to use such an\nambidexterity as that he may serve himselfe either of vertue, or\nvice, according to his advantage, which in true pollicy is\nneither good in attaining the Principality nor in securing it\nwhen it is attaind. For Politicks, presuppose Ethiques, which\nwill never allow this rule: as that a man might make this small\ndifference between vertue, and vice, that he may indifferently\nlay aside, or take up the one or the other, and put it in\npractise as best conduceth to the end he propounds himselfe. I\ndoubt our Authour would have blamd Davids regard to Saul when 1\nSam. 24. in the cave he cut off the lap of Sauls garment, and\nspared his head; and afterwards in the 26. when he forbad\nAbishai to strike him as he lay sleeping. Worthy of a Princes\nconsideration is that saying of Abigal to David 1 Sam. 25. 30.\n'It shall come to passe when the Lord shall have done to my Lord\naccording to all that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall\nhave appointed thee Ruler over Israel, that this shall be no\ngrief to thee, nor offence of heart unto my Lord, that thou hast\nforborne to shed blood, etc.'\nFor surely the conscience of this evill ground whereupon they\nhave either built, or underpropped their tyranny, causes men, as\nwell _metus_ as _spes in longum projicere_, which sets them a\nwork on further mischiefe.\nCHAP. XVI\nOf Liberality, and Miserablenesse.\nBeginning then at the first of the above mentioned qualities, I say that\nit would be very well to be accounted liberall: neverthelesse,\nliberality used in such a manner, as to make thee be accounted so,\nwrongs thee: for in case it be used vertuously, and as it ought to be,\nit shall never come to be taken notice of, so as to free thee from the\ninfamie of its contrary. And therefore for one to hold the name of\nliberal among men, it were needfull not to omit any sumptuous quality,\ninsomuch that a Prince alwayes so dispos'd, shall waste all his\nrevenues, and at the end shall be forc'd, if he will still maintaine\nthat reputation of liberality, heavily to burthen his subjects, and\nbecome a great exactour; and put in practise all those things that can\nbe done to get mony: Which begins to make him hatefull to his subjects,\nand fall into every ones contempt, growing necessitous: so that having\nwith this liberality wrong'd many, and imparted of his bounty but to a\nfew; he feels every first mischance, and runs a hazard of every first\ndanger: Which he knowing, and desiring to withdraw himself from, incurs\npresently the disgrace of being termed miserable. A Prince therefore not\nbeing able to use this vertue of liberality, without his own damage, in\nsuch a sort, that it may be taken notice of, ought, if he be wise, not\nto regard the name of Miserable; for in time he shall alwaies be\nesteemed the more liberal, seeing that by his parsimony his own revenues\nare sufficient for him; as also he can defend himself against whoever\nmakes war against him, and can do some exploits without grieving his\nsubjects: so that he comes to use his liberality to all those, from whom\nhe takes nothing, who are infinite in number; and his miserableness\ntowards those to whom he gives nothing, who are but a few. In our dayes\nwe have not seen any, but those who have been held miserable, do any\ngreat matters; but the others all quite ruin'd. Pope Julius the second,\nhowever he serv'd himself of the name of Liberal, to get the Papacy, yet\nnever intended he to continue it, to the end he might be able to make\nwar against the King of France: and he made so many wars without\nimposing any extraordinary tax, because his long thrift supplyed his\nlarge expences. This present King of Spain could never have undertaken,\nnor gone through with so many exploits, had he been accounted liberal.\nWherefore a Prince ought little to regard (that he may not be driven to\npillage his subjects, that he may be able to defend himself, that he may\nnot fall into poverty and contempt, that he be not forced to become an\nextortioner) though he incurre the name of miserable; for this is one of\nthose vices, which does not pluck him from his throne. And if any one\nshould say, C\u00e6sar by his liberality obtained the Empire, and many others\n(because they both were, and were esteemd liberal) attaind to exceeding\ngreat dignities. I answer, either thou art already come to be a Prince,\nor thou art in the way to it; in the first case, this liberality is\nhurtful; in the second, it is necessary to be accounted so; and C\u00e6sar\nwas one of those that aspired to the Principality of Rome. But if after\nhe had gotten it, he had survived, and not forborne those expences, he\nwould quite have ruined that Empire. And if any one should reply; many\nhave been Princes, and with their armies have done great exploits, who\nhave been held very liberal. I answer, either the Prince spends of his\nown and his subjects, or that which belongs to others: in the first, he\nought to be sparing; in the second, he should not omit any part of\nliberality. And that Prince that goes abroad with his army, and feeds\nupon prey, and spoyle, and tributes, and hath the disposing of that\nwhich belongs to others, necessarily should use this liberality;\notherwise would his soldiers never follow him; and of that which is\nneither thine, nor thy subjects, thou mayest well be a free giver, as\nwere Cyrus, C\u00e6sar and Alexander; for the spending of that which is\nanothers, takes not away thy reputation, but rather adds to it, only the\nwasting of that which is thine own hurts thee; nor is there any thing\nconsumes itself so much as liberality, which whilest thou usest, thou\nlosest the means to make use of it, and becomest poore and abject; or to\navoid this poverty, an extortioner and hatefull person. And among all\nthose things which a Prince ought to beware of is, to be dispised, and\nodious; to one and the other of which, liberality brings thee. Wherefore\nthere is more discretion to hold the stile of Miserable, which begets an\ninfamy without hatred, than to desire that of Liberal, whereby to\nincurre the necessity of being thought an extortioner, which procures an\ninfamy with hatred.\nCHAP. XVII\nOf Cruelty, and Clemency, and whether it is better to be belov'd, or\nfeard.\nDescending afterwards unto the other fore-alledged qualities, I say,\nthat every Prince should desire to be held pitiful, and not cruel.\nNevertheless ought he beware that he ill uses not this pitty. C\u00e6sar\nBorgia was accounted cruel, yet had his cruelty redrest the disorders in\nRomania, setled it in union, and restored it to peace, and fidelity:\nwhich, if it be well weighed, we shall see was an act of more pitty,\nthan that of the people of Florence, who to avoyd the terme of cruelty,\nsuffered Pistoya to fall to destruction. Wherefore a Prince ought not to\nregard the infamy of cruelty, for to hold his subjects united and\nfaithfull: for by giving a very few proofes of himself the other way, he\nshall be held more pittiful than they, who through their too much pitty,\nsuffer disorders to follow, from whence arise murthers and rapines: for\nthese are wont to hurt an intire universality, whereas the executions\npractised by a Prince, hurt only some particular. And among all sorts of\nPrinces, it is impossible for a new Prince to avoyd the name of cruel,\nbecause all new States are full of dangers: whereupon Virgil by the\nmouth of Dido excuses the inhumanity of her Kingdom, saying,\n_Res dura et Regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMoliri et lat\u00e8 fines custode tenere._\nMy hard plight and new State force me to guard\nMy confines all about with watch and ward.\nNevertheless ought he to be judicious in his giving belief to any thing,\nor moving himself thereat, nor make his people extreamly afraid of him;\nbut proceed in a moderate way with wisdome, and humanity, that his too\nmuch confidence make him not unwary, and his too much distrust\nintolerable; from hence arises a dispute, whether it is better to be\nbelov'd or feard: I answer, a man would wish he might be the one and the\nother: but because hardly can they subsist both together, it is much\nsafer to be feard, than be loved; being that one of the two must needs\nfail; for touching men, we may say this in general, they are unthankful,\nunconstant, dissemblers, they avoyd dangers, and are covetous of gain;\nand whilest thou doest them good, they are wholly thine; their blood,\ntheir fortunes, lives and children are at thy service, as is said\nbefore, when the danger is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt.\nAnd that Prince who wholly relies upon their words, unfurnished of all\nother preparations, goes to wrack: for the friendships that are gotten\nwith rewards, and not by the magnificence and worth of the mind, are\ndearly bought indeed; but they will neither keep long, nor serve well in\ntime of need: and men do less regard to offend one that is supported by\nlove, than by fear. For love is held by a certainty of obligation, which\nbecause men are mischievous, is broken upon any occasion of their own\nprofit. But fear restrains with a dread of punishment which never\nforsakes a man. Yet ought a Prince cause himself to be belov'd in such a\nmanner, that if he gains not love, he may avoid hatred: for it may well\nstand together, that a man may be feard and not hated; which shall never\nfail, if he abstain from his subjects goods, and their wives; and\nwhensoever he should be forc'd to proceed against any of their lives, do\nit when it is to be done upon a just cause, and apparent conviction; but\nabove all things forbeare to lay his hands on other mens goods; for men\nforget sooner the death of their father, than the loss of their\npatrimony. Moreover the occasions of taking from men their goods, do\nnever fail: and alwaies he that begins to live by rapine, finds occasion\nto lay hold upon other mens goods: but against mens lives, they are\nseldome found, and sooner fail. But where a Prince is abroad in the\nfield with his army, and hath a multitude of soldiers under his\ngovernment, then is it necessary that he stands not much upon it, though\nhe be termed cruel: for unless he be so, he shall never have his\nsoldiers live in accord one with another, nor ever well disposed to any\nbrave piece of service. Among Hannibals actions of mervail, this is\nreckoned for one, that having a very huge army, gathered out of several\nnations, and all led to serve in a strange countrey, there was never any\ndissention neither amongst themselves, nor against their General, as\nwell in their bad fortune as their good. Which could not proceed from\nany thing else than from that barbarous cruelty of his, which together\nwith his exceeding many vertues, rendred him to his soldiers both\nvenerable and terrible; without which, to that effect his other vertues\nhad served him to little purpose: and some writers though not of the\nbest advised, on one side admire these his worthy actions, and on the\notherside, condemn the principal causes thereof. And that it is true,\nthat his other vertues would not have suffic'd him, we may consider in\nScipio, the rarest man not only in the dayes he liv'd, but even in the\nmemory of man; from whom his army rebel'd in Spain: which grew only upon\nhis too much clemency, which had given way to his soldiers to become\nmore licentious, than was well tollerable by military discipline: for\nwhich he was reprov'd by Fabius Maximus in the Senate, who termed him\nthe corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrensians having been\ndestroyed by a Lieutenant of Scipio's, were never reveng'd by him, nor\nthe insolence of that Lieutenant punisht; all this arising from his\neasie nature: so that one desiring to excuse him in the Senate, said,\nthat there were many men knew better how to keep themselves from faults,\nthan to correct the faults of other men: which disposition of his in\ntime would have wrong'd Scipio's reputation and glory, had he therewith\ncontinu'd in his commands: but living under the government of the\nSenate, this quality of his that would have disgrac'd him not only was\nconceal'd, but prov'd to the advancement of his glory. I conclude then,\nreturning to the purpose of being feard, and belov'd; insomuch as men\nlove at their own pleasure, and to serve their own turne, and their fear\ndepends upon the Princes pleasure, every wise Prince ought to ground\nupon that which is of himself, and not upon that which is of another:\nonly this, he ought to use his best wits to avoid hatred, as was said.\nCHAP. XVIII\nIn what manner Princes ought to keep their words.\nHow commendable in a Prince it is to keep his word, and live with\nintegrity, not making use of cunning and subtlety, every one knows well:\nyet we see by experience in these our dayes, that those Princes have\neffected great matters, who have made small reckoning of keeping their\nwords, and have known by their craft to turne and wind men about, and in\nthe end, have overcome those who have grounded upon the truth. You must\nthen know, there are two kinds of combating or fighting; the one by\nright of the laws, the other meerly by force. That first way is proper\nto men, the other is also common to beasts: but because the first many\ntimes suffices not, there is a necessity to make recourse to the second;\nwherefore it behooves a Prince to know how to make good use of that part\nwhich belongs to a beast, as well as that which is proper to a man. This\npart hath been covertly shew'd to Princes by ancient writers; who say\nthat Achilles and many others of those ancient Princes were intrusted to\nChiron the Senator, to be brought up under his discipline: the moral of\nthis, having for their teacher one that was half a beast and half a man,\nwas nothing else, but that it was needful for a Prince to understand how\nto make his advantage of the one and the other nature, because neither\ncould subsist without the other. A Prince then being necessitated to\nknow how to make use of that part belonging to a beast, ought to serve\nhimself of the conditions of the Fox and the Lion; for the Lion cannot\nkeep himself from snares, nor the Fox defend himself against the Wolves.\nHe had need then be a Fox, that he may beware of the snares, and a Lion\nthat he may scare the wolves. Those that stand wholly upon the Lion,\nunderstand not well themselves. And therefore a wise Prince cannot, nor\nought not keep his faith given when the observance thereof turnes to\ndisadvantage, and the occasions that made him promise, are past. For if\nmen were all good, this rule would not be allowable; but being they are\nfull of mischief, and would not make it good to thee, neither art thou\ntyed to keep it with them: nor shall a Prince ever want lawfull\noccasions to give colour to this breach. Very many modern examples\nhereof might be alledg'd, wherein might be shewed how many peaces\nconcluded, and how many promises made, have been violated and broken by\nthe infidelity of Princes; and ordinarily things have best succeeded\nwith him that hath been nearest the Fox in condition. But it is\nnecessary to understand how to set a good colour upon this disposition,\nand to be able to fain and dissemble throughly; and men are so simple,\nand yeeld so much to the present necessities, that he who hath a mind to\ndeceive, shall alwaies find another that will be deceivd. I will not\nconceal any one of the examples that have been of late. Alexander the\nsixth, never did any thing else than deceive men, and never meant\notherwise, and alwaies found whom to work upon; yet never was there man\nwould protest more effectually, nor aver any thing with more solemn\noaths, and observe them less than he; nevertheless, his cousenages all\nthriv'd well with him; for he knew how to play this part cunningly.\nTherefore is there no necessity for a Prince to be endued with all above\nwritten qualities, but it behooveth well that he seem to be so; or\nrather I will boldly say this, that having these qualities, and alwaies\nregulating himself by them, they are hurtfull; but seeming to have them,\nthey are advantageous; as to seem pittiful, faithful, mild, religious,\nand of integrity, and indeed to be so; provided withall thou beest of\nsuch a composition, that if need require to use the contrary, thou\ncanst, and knowest how to apply thy self thereto. And it suffices to\nconceive this, that a Prince, and especially a new Prince, cannot\nobserve all those things, for which men are held good; he being often\nforc'd, for the maintenance of his State, to do contrary to his faith,\ncharity, humanity, and religion: and therefore it behooves him to have a\nmind so disposd, as to turne and take the advantage of all winds and\nfortunes; and as formerly I said, not forsake the good, while he can;\nbut to know how to make use of the evil upon necessity. A Prince then\nought to have a special care, that he never let fall any words, but what\nare all season'd with the five above written qualities, and let him seem\nto him that sees and hears him, all pitty, all faith, all integrity, all\nhumanity, all religion; nor is there any thing more necessary for him to\nseem to have, than this last quality: for all men in general judge\nthereof, rather by the sight, than by the touch; for every man may come\nto the sight of him, few come to the touch and feeling of him; yvery man\nmay come to see what thou seemest, few come to perceive and understand\nwhat thou art; and those few dare not oppose the opinion of many, who\nhave the majesty of State to protect them: And in all mens actions,\nespecially those of Princes wherein there is no judgement to appeale\nunto men, forbeare to give their censures, till the events and ends of\nthings. Let a Prince therefore take the surest courses he can to\nmaintain his life and State: the means shall alwaies be thought\nhonorable, and commended by every one; for the vulgar is over-taken with\nthe appearance and event of a thing: and for the most part of people,\nthey are but the vulgar: the others that are but few, take place where\nthe vulgar have no subsisteance. A Prince there is in these dayes, whom\nI shall not do well to name, that preaches nothing else but peace and\nfaith; but had he kept the one and the other, several times had they\ntaken from him his state and reputation.\nIn the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth Chap, our Author\ndescends to particulars, perswading his Prince in his sixteenth\nto such a suppleness of disposition, as that upon occasion he\ncan make use either of liberality or miserableness, as need\nshall require. But that of liberality is to last no longer than\nwhile he is in the way to some designe: which if he well weigh,\nis not really a reward of vertue, how ere it seems; but a bait\nand lure to bring birds to the net. In the seventeenth Chap, he\ntreats of clemency and cruelty, neither of which are to be\nexercis'd by him as acts of mercy or justice; but as they may\nserve to advantage his further purposes. And lest the Prince\nshould incline too much to clemency, our Author allows rather\nthe restraint by fear, than by love. The contrary to which all\nstories shew us. I will say this only, cruelty may cut of the\npower of some, but causes the hatred of all, and gives a will to\nmost to take the first occasion offerd for revenge. In the\neighteenth Chap, our Author discourses how Princes ought to\ngovern themselves in keeping their promises made: whereof he\nsayes they ought to make such small reckoning, as that rather\nthey should know by their craft how to turne and wind men about,\nwhereby to take advantage of all winds and fortunes. To this I\nwould oppose that in the fifteenth Psal. v. 5. He that sweareth\nto his neighbor, and disappointeth him not, though it were to\nhis own hindrance. It was a King that writ it, and me thinks the\nrule he gave, should well befit both King and Subject: and\nsurely this perswades against all taking of advantages. A man\nmay reduce all the causes of faith-breaking to three heads. One\nmay be, because he that promised, had no intention to keep his\nword; and this is a wicked and malitious way of dealing. A\nsecond may bee, because hee that promisd, repents of his promise\nmade; and that is grounded on unconstancy, and lightness in that\nhe would not be well resolved before he entred into covenant.\nThe third may be, when it so falls out, that it lyes not in his\npower that made the promise to performe it. In which case a man\nought to imitate the good debter, who having not wherewithall to\npay, hides not himself, but presents his person to his creditor,\nwillingly suffering imprisonment. The first and second are very\nvitious and unworthy of a Prince: in the third, men might well\nbe directed by the examples of those two famous Romans, Regulus\nand Posthumius. I shall close this with the answer of Charles\nthe fifth, when he was pressed to break his word with Luther for\nhis safe return from Wormes; _Fides rerum promissarum etsi toto\nmundo exulet, tamen apud imperatorem cam consistere oportet_.\nThough truth be banisht out of the whole world, yet should it\nalwaies find harbour in an Emperors breast.\n[Sidenote: _Gulielmus Xenocarus_ in vit. Car. Quinti.]\nCHAP. XIX\nThat Princes should take a care, not to incurre contempt or hatred.\nBut because among the qualities, whereof formerly mention is made, I\nhave spoken of those of most importance, I will treat of the others more\nbriefly under these qualityes that a Prince is to beware, as in part is\nabove-said, and that he fly those things which cause him to be odious or\nvile: and when ever he shall avoid this, he shall fully have plaid his\npart, and in the other disgraces he shall find no danger at all. There\nis nothing makes him so odious, as I said, as his extortion of his\nsubjects goods, and abuse of their women, from which he ought to\nforbear; and so long as he wrongs not his whole people, neither in their\ngoods, nor honors, they live content, and he hath only to strive with\nthe Ambition of some few: which many waies and easily too, is\nrestrain'd. To be held various, light, effeminate, faint-hearted,\nunresolv'd, these make him be contemnd and thought base, which a Prince\nshould shun like rocks, and take a care that in all his actions there\nappear magnanimity, courage, gravity, and valor; and that in all the\nprivate affairs of his subjects, he orders it so, that his word stand\nirrevocable: and maintain himself in such repute, that no man may think\neither to deceive or wind and turn him about: that Prince that gives\nsuch an opinion of himself, is much esteemed, and against him who is so\nwell esteemed, hardly are any conspiracies made by his subjects, or by\nforreiners any invasion, when once notice is taken of his worth, and how\nmuch he is reverenced by his subjects: For a Prince ought to have two\nfears, the one from within, in regard of his subjects; the other from\nabroad, in regard of his mighty neighbors; from these he defends himself\nby good armes and good friends; and alwayes he shall have good friends,\nif he have good armes; and all things shall alwaies stand sure at home,\nwhen those abroad are firme, in case some conspiracy have not disturbed\nthem; and however the forrein matters stand but ticklishly; yet if he\nhave taken such courses at home, and liv'd as we have prescribed, he\nshall never be able (in case he forsake not himself) to resist all\npossibility, force and violence, as I said Nabis the Spartan did: but\ntouching his subjects, even when his affairs abroad are setled, it is to\nbe fear'd they may conspire privily; from which a Prince sufficiently\nsecure himself by shunning to be hated or contemned, and keeping himself\nin his peoples good opinion, which it is necessary for him to compass,\nas formerly we treated at large. And one of the powerfullest remedies a\nPrince can have against conspiracies, is, not to be hated nor dispised\nby the universality; for alwaies he that conspires, beleeves the Princes\ndeath is acceptable to the subject: but when he thinks it displeases\nthem, he hath not the heart to venture on such a matter; for the\ndifficulties that are on the conspirators side, are infinite. By\nexperience it is plain, that many times plots have been laid, but few of\nthem have succeeded luckily; for he that conspires, cannot be alone, nor\ncan he take the company of any, but of those, who he beleeves are\nmalecontents; and so soon as thou hast discover'd thy self to a\nmalecontent, thou givest him means to work his own content: for by\nrevealing thy treason, he may well hope for all manner of favour: so\nthat seeing his gain certain of one side; and on the other, finding only\ndoubt and danger, either he had need be a rare friend, or that he be an\nexceeding obstinate enemy to the Prince, if he keeps his word with thee.\nAnd to reduce this matter into short termes: I say, there is nothing but\njealousie, fear, and suspect of punishment on the conspirators part to\naffright him; but on the Princes part, there is the majesty of the\nprincipality, the laws, the defences of his friends and the State, which\ndo so guard him, that to all these things the peoples good wills being\nadded, it is unpossible any one should be so head-strong as to conspire;\nfor ordinarily where a traytor is to feare before the execution of his\nmischiefe, in this case he is also to feare afterwards, having the\npeople for his enemy when the fact is commited, and therefore for this\ncause, not being able to hope for any refuge. Touching this matter, many\nexamples might be brought; but I will content my selfe to name one which\nfell out in the memory of our Fathers. Annibal Bentivolii, grand Father\nof this Annibal who now lives, that was Prince in Bolonia, being slaine\nby the Canneschi that conspir'd against him, none of his race being\nleft, but this John, who was then in swadling clouts; presently the\npeople rose upon this murder, and slew all the Canneschi which proceeded\nfrom the popular affection, which the family of the Bentivolii held then\nin Bolonia: which was so great, that being there remain'd not any, now\nAnniball was dead, that was able to manage the State; and having notice\nthat in Florence there was one borne of the Bentivolii, who till then\nwas taken for a Smiths sonne: the citizens of Bolonia went to Florence\nfor him, and gave the government of their City to him, which was rul'd\nby him, untill John was of fit yeares to governe. I conclude then, that\na Prince ought to make small account of treasons, whiles he hath the\npeople to friend: but if they be his enemies and hate him, he may well\nfeare every thing, and every one. And well ordered States, and discreet\nPrinces have taken care withall diligence, not to cause their great men\nto fall into desperation, and to content the people, and so to maintaine\nthem: for this is one of the most important businesses belonging to a\nPrince. Among the Kingdomes that are well orderd and governd in our\ndayes, is that of France, and therein are found exceeding many good\norders, whereupon the Kings liberty and security depends: of which the\nchiefe is the Parliament, and the authority thereof: for he that founded\nthat Kingdome, knowing the great mens ambition and insolence; and\njudgeing it necessary there should be a bridle to curbe them; and on the\nother side knowing the hatred of the Commonalty against the great ones,\ngrounded upon feare, intending to secure them, would not lay this care\nwholly upon the King, but take this trouble from him, which he might\nhave with the great men, in case he favourd the Commonalty; or with the\nCommonalty, in case he favourd the great men; and thereupon set up a\nthird judge, which was that, to the end it should keep under the great\nones, and favour the meaner sort, without any imputation to the King. It\nwas not possible to take a better, nor wiser course then this; nor a\nsurer way to secure the King, and the Kingdome. From whence we may draw\nanother conclusion worthie of note, that Princes ought to cause others\nto take upon them the matters of blame and imputation; and upon\nthemselves to take only those of grace and favour. Here againe I\nconclude, that a Prince ought to make good esteeme of his Nobility; but\nnot thereby to incur the Commons hatred: It would seeme perhaps to many,\nconsidering the life and death of many Romane Emperours, that they were\nexamples contrary to my opinion, finding that some have liv'd worthily,\nand shewd many rare vertues of the minde, and yet have lost the Empire,\nand been put to death by their owne subjects, conspiring against them.\nIntending then to answer these objections, I shall discourse upon the\nqualities of some Emperours, declaring the occasions of their ruine, not\ndisagreeing from that which I have alledgd; and part thereof I will\nbestow on the consideration of these things, which are worthy to be\nnoted by him that reads the actions of those times: and it shall suffice\nme to take all those Emperours that succeeded in the Empire from Marcus\nthe Philosopher to Maximinus, who were Mercus and Commodus his sonne,\nPertinax, Julian, Severus, Antonius, Caracalla his sonne, Macrinus,\nHeliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximin. And first it is to be noted, that\nwhere in the other Principalities, they are to contend only with the\nambition of the Nobles, and the insolence of the people; the Romane\nEmperours had a third difficulty, having to support the cruelty and\ncovetousnesse of the souldiers, which was so hard a thing, that it\ncaused the ruine of many, being hard to satisfy the souldiers, and the\npeople; for the people love their quiet, and therefore affect modest\nPrinces; and the souldiers love a Prince of a warlike courage, that is\ninsolent, cruell, and plucking from every one: which things they would\nhave them exercise upon the people, whereby they might be able to double\ntheir stipends, and satisfie their avarice and cruelty: whence it\nproceeds, that those Emperours who either by Nature or by Art, had not\nsuch a reputation, as therewith they could curbe the one and the other,\nwere alwayes ruind: and the most of them, specially those who as new men\ncame to the principality, finding the difficulty of those two different\nhumours, applyed themselves to content the souldiers, making small\naccount of wronging the people, which was a course then necessary; for\nthe Princes not being able to escape the hatred of every one, ought\nfirst endeavour that they incurre not the hatred of any whole\nuniversality; and when they cannot attaine thereunto, they are to\nprovide with all industry, to avoyd the hatred of those universalities\nthat are the most mighty. And therefore those Emperors, who because they\nwere but newly call'd to the Empire, had need of extraordinary favours,\nmore willingly stuck to the soldiers, than to the people; which\nneverthelesse turnd to their advantage, or otherwise, according as that\nPrince knew how to maintaine his repute with them. From these causes\naforesayd proceeded it, that Marcus Pertinax, and Alexander, though all\nliving modestly, being lovers of justice, and enemies of cruelty,\ncourteous and bountifull, had all from Marcus on ward, miserable ends;\nMarcus only liv'd and dy'd exceedingly honoured: for he came to the\nEmpire by inheritance, and was not to acknowledge it either from the\nsoldiers, nor from the people: afterwards being accompanyed with many\nvertues, which made him venerable, he held alwayes whilst he liv'd the\none and the other order within their limits, and was never either hated,\nor contemnd. But Pertinax was created Emperour against the soldiers\nwills, who being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could\nnot endure that honest course that Pertinax sought to reduce them to:\nWhereupon having gotten himself hatred, and to this hatred added\ncontempt, in that he was old, was ruind in the very beginning of his\ngovernment. Whence it ought to be observed, that hatred is gaind as well\nby good deeds as bad; and therefore as I formerly said, when a Prince\nwould maintaine the State, he is often forced not to be good: for when\nthat generality, whether it be the people, or soldiers, or Nobility,\nwhereof thou thinkst thou standst in need to maintain thee, is\ncorrupted, it behoves thee to follow their humour, and content them, and\nthen all good deeds are thy adversaries. But let us come to Alexander\nwho was of that goodnesse, that among the prayses given him, had this\nfor one, that in fourteen yeers wherein he held the Empire, he never put\nany man to death, but by course of justice; neverthelesse being held\neffeminate, and a man that suffered himselfe to be ruled by his mother,\nand thereupon fallen into contempt, the army conspird against him. Now\non the contrary discoursing upon the qualities of Commodus, Severus,\nAntonius, Caracalla, and Maximinus, you shall find them exceeding\ncruell, and ravinous, who to satisfie their soldiers, forbeare no kinde\nof injury that could be done upon the people; and all of them, except\nSeverus, came to evill ends: for in Severus, there was such\nextraordinary valour, that while he held the soldiers his freinds,\nhowever the people were much burthend by him, he might alwayes reigne\nhappily: for his valour rendred him so admirable in the souldiers and\npeoples sights; that these in a manner stood amazd and astonishd, and\nthose others reverencing and honoring him. And because the actions of\nthis man were exceeding great, being in a new Prince, I will briefly\nshew how well he knew to act the Foxes and the Lions parts; the\nconditions of which two, I say, as before, are very necessary for a\nPrince to imitate. Severus having had experience of Julian the Emperours\nsloth, perswaded his army (whereof he was commander in Sclavonia) that\nthey should doe well to goe to Rome to revenge Pertinax his death, who\nwas put to death by the Imperiall guard; and under this pretence, not\nmaking any shew that he aspird unto the Empire, set his army in march\ndirectly towards Rome, and was sooner come into Italy, than it was\nknowne he had mov'd from his station. Being ariv'd at Rome, he was by\nthe Senate chosen Emperour for feare, and Julian slaine. After this\nbeginning, two difficulties yet remaind to Severus, before he could make\nhimselfe Lord of the whole State; the one in Asia, where Niger the\nGenerall of those armies had gotten the title of Emperour, the other in\nthe West with Albinus, who also aspird to the Empire: and because he\nthought there might be some danger to discover himselfe enemy to them\nboth, he purposed to set upon Niger, and cozen Albinus, to whom he writ,\nthat being elected Emperour by the Senate, he would willingly\ncommunicate it with him; and thereupon sent him the title of C\u00e6sar, and\nby resolution of the Senate, tooke him to him for his Colleague; which\nthings were taken by Albinus in true meaning. But afterwards when\nSeverus had overcome and slaine Niger, and pacified the affaires and in\nthe East, being returned to Rome, he complaind in the Senate of Albinus,\nhow little weighing the benefits received from him, he had sought to\nslay him by treason, and therefore was he forc'd to goe punish his\ningratitude: afterwards he went into France, where he bereft him both of\nhis State and life, whoever then shall in particular examine his\nactions, shall finde he was a very cruell Lion, and as crafty a Fox: and\nshall see that he was alwayes feard and reverenc'd by every one, and by\nthe armies not hated; and shall nothing marvell that he being a new man,\nwas able to hold together such a great Empire: for his extraordinary\nreputation defended him alwayes from that hatred, which the people for\nhis extortions might have conceiv'd against him. But Antonius his sonne,\nwas also an exceeding brave man, and endued with most excellent\nqualities, which causd him to be admird by the people, and acceptable to\nthe souldiers, because he was a warlike man, enduring all kind of\ntravell and paines, despising all delicate food, and all kinde of\neffeminacy, which gaind him the love of all the armies: neverthelesse\nhis fiercenesse and cruelty were such, and so hideous, having upon many\nparticular occasions put to death a great part of the people of Rome,\nand all those of Alexandria, that he grew odious to the world, and began\nto be feard by those also that were neare about him; so that he was\nslaine by a Centurion in the very midst of his army. Where it is to be\nnoted, that these kinde of deaths, which follow upon the deliberation of\na resolv'd and obstinate minde, cannot by a Prince be avoyded: for every\none that feares not to dye, is able to doe it; but a Prince ought to be\nlesse afraid of it because it very seldome falls out. Only should he\nbeware not to doe any extreame injury to any of those of whom he serves\nhimself, or that he hath near about him in any imployment of his\nPrincipality, as Antonius did: who had reproachfully slaine a brother of\nthat Centurion; also threatned him every day, and neverthelesse\nentertaind him still as one of the guards of his body, which was a rash\ncourse taken, and the way to destruction, as befell him. But let us come\nto Commodus for whom it was very easie to hold the Empire, by reason it\ndescended upon him by inheritance, being Marcus his sonne, and it had\nbeen enough for him to follow his fathers footsteps, and then had he\ncontented both the people and the soldiers: but being of a cruell and\nsavage disposition, whereby to exercise his actions upon the people, he\ngave himselfe to entertaine armies, and those in all licentiousnesse. On\nthe other part not maintaining his dignity, but often descending upon\nthe stages to combate with fencers, and doing such other like base\nthings, little worthy of the Imperiall majesty, he became contemptible\nin the soldiers sight; and being hated of one part, and despisd of the\nother, he was conspird against, and slaine. It remaines now, that we\ndeclare Maximinus his conditions, who was a very warlike man; and the\narmies loathing Alexanders effeminacy, whereof I spake before, when they\nhad slain him, chose this man Emperour, who not long continued so,\nbecause two things there were that brought him into hatred and contempt;\nthe one because he was very base, having kept cattell in Thrace, which\nwas well knowne to every one, and made them to scorne him; the other,\nbecause in the beginning of his Principality having delayd to goe to\nRome, and enter into possession of the Imperiall throne, he had gaind\nthe infamy of being thought exceeding cruell, having by his Prefects in\nRome, and in every place of the Empire, exercisd many cruelties,\ninsomuch that the whole world being provok'd against him to contempt for\nthe basenesse of his blood; on the other side upon the hatred conceiv'd\nagainst him for feare of his crulty; first Affrica, afterwards the\nSenate, with all the people of Rome and all Italy, conspired against\nhim, with whom his own army took part; which incamping before Aquileya,\nand finding some difficulty to take the town, being weary of his\ncruelties, and because they saw he had so many enemies, fearing him the\nlesse, slew him. I purpose not to say any thing either of Heliogabalus,\nMacrinus, or Julian, who because they were throughly base, were sudenly\nextinguished: but I will come to the conclusion of this discourse; and I\nsay, that the Princes of our times have lesse of this difficulty to\nsatisfie the Soldiers extraordinarily in their government; for\nnotwithstanding that there be some considerations to be had of them, yet\npresently are those armies dissolved, because none of these Princes do\nuse to maintaine any armies together, which are annex'd and inveterated\nwith the governments of the provinces, as were the armies of the Romane\nEmpire. And therefore if then it was necessary rather to content the\nsoldiers than the people, it was because the soldiers were more\npowerfull than the people: now is it more necessary for all Princes,\n(except the Turk and the Souldan) to satisfie their people than their\nsoldiers, because the people are more mighty than they; wherein I except\nthe Turk, he alwayes maintaining about his person 12000 foot, and 15000\nhorse, upon which depends the safety and strength of his Kingdome; and\nit is necessary that laying aside all other regard of his people, he\nmaintaine these his friends. The Souldans Kingdome is like hereunto,\nwhich being wholy in the souldiers power, he must also without respect\nof his people keep them his friends. And you are to consider, that this\nState of the Souldans differs much from all the other Principalities:\nFor it is very like the Papacy, which cannot be termd an hereditary\nPrincipality: nor a new Principality: for the sons of the deceasd Prince\nare not heires and Lords thereof, but he that is chosen receives that\ndignity from those who have the authority in them. And this order being\nof antiquity, cannot be termd a new Principality, because therein are\nnone of those difficulties that are in new ones: for though the Prince\nbe new, yet are the orders of that state ancient, and ordaind to receive\nhim, as if he were their hereditary Prince. But let us returne to our\nmatter; whosoever shall consider our discourse before, shall perceive\nthat either hatred, or contempt have caus'd the ruine of the afore-named\nEmperors; and shall know also, from it came that part of them proceeding\none way, and part a contrary; yet in any of them the one had a happy\nsuccess, and the others unhappy: for it was of no availe, but rather\nhurtful for Pertinax and Alexander, because they were new Princes, to\ndesire to imitate Marcus, who by inheritance came to the Principality:\nand in like manner it was a wrong to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximus,\nto imitate Severus, because none of them were endued with so great valor\nas to follow his steps therein. Wherefore a new Prince in his\nPrincipality cannot well imitate Marcus his actions; nor yet is it\nnecessary to follow those of Severus: but he ought make choyce of those\nparts in Severus which are necessary for the founding of a State; and to\ntake from Marcus those that are fit and glorious to preserve a State\nwhich is already established and setled.\nCHAP. XX\nWhether the Citadels and many other things which Princes often make use\nof, are profitable or dammageable.\nSome Princes, whereby they might safely keep their State, have disarmed\ntheir subjects; some others have held the towns under their dominion,\ndivided into factions; others have maintain'd enmities against\nthemselves; others have appli'd themselves to gain them, where they have\nsuspected at their entrance into the government; others have built\nFortresses; and others again have ruined and demolished them: and\nhowever that upon all these things, a man cannot well pass a determinate\nsentence, unless one comes to the particulars of these States, where\nsome such like determinations were to be taken; yet I shall speak of\nthem in so large a manner, as the matter of it self will bear. It was\nnever then that a new Prince would disarme his own subjects; but rather\nwhen he hath found them disarmed, he hath alwaies arm'd them. For being\nbelov'd, those armes become thine; those become faithful, which thou\nhadst in suspicion; and those which were faithful, are maintaind so; and\nthy subjects are made thy partisans; and because all thy subjects cannot\nbe put in armes, when thou bestowest favors on those thou armest, with\nthe others thou canst deal more for thy safety; and that difference of\nproceeding which they know among them, obliges them to thee; those\nothers excuse thee, judgeing it necessary that they have deservd more,\nwho have undergone more danger, and so have greater obligation: but when\nthou disarmst them, thou beginst to offend them, that thou distrustest\nthem, either for cowardise, or small faith; and the one or the other of\nthose two opinions provokes their hatred against thee; and because thou\ncanst not stand disarmed, thou must then turn thy self to mercenary\nSoldiery, whereof we have formerly spoken what it is, and when it is\ngood; it can never be so much as to defend thee from powerful enemies,\nand suspected subjects; therefore as I have said, a new Prince in a new\nPrincipality hath alwaies ordaind them armes. Of examples to this\npurpose, Histories are full. But when a Prince gains a new State, which\nas a member he adds to his ancient dominions, then it is necessary to\ndisarme that State, unless it be those whom thou hast discoverd to have\nassisted thee in the conquest thereof; and these also in time and upon\noccasions, it is necessary to render delicate and effeminate, and so\norder them, that all the arms of thy State be in the hands of thy own\nSoldiers, who live in thy ancient State near unto thee. Our ancestors\nand they that were accounted Sages, were wont to say that it was\nnecessary to hold Pistoya in factions, and Pisa with Fortresses; and for\nthis cause maintaind some towns subject to them in differences, whereby\nto hold it more easily. This, at what time Italy was ballanc'd in a\ncertain manner, might be well done; but mee thinks it cannot now a dayes\nbe well given for a precept; for I do not beleeve, that divisions made\ncan do any good; rather it must needs be, that when the enemy approaches\nthem, Cities divided are presently lost; for alwaies the weaker part\nwill cleave to the forrein power, and the other not be able to subsist.\nThe Venetians (as I think) mov'd by the aforesaid reasons, maintaind the\nfactions of the Guelfes and Gibellins, in their townes; and however they\nnever suffered them to spill one anothers blood, yet they nourish'd\nthese differences among them, to the end that the citizens imployd in\nthese quarrels, should not plot any thing against them: which as it\nproved, never serv'd them to any great purpose: for being defeated at\nVayla, presently one of those two factions took courage and seizd upon\ntheir whole State. Therefore such like waies argue the Princes weakness;\nfor in a strong principality they never will suffer such divisions; for\nthey shew them some kind of profit in time of peace, being they are able\nby means thereof more easily to mannage their subjects: but war comming,\nsuch like orders discover their fallacy. Without doubt, Princes become\ngreat, when they overcome the difficulties and oppositions that are made\nagainst them; and therefore Fortune especially when she hath to make any\nnew Prince great, who hath more need to gain reputation than an\nhereditary Prince, causes enemies to rise against him, and him to\nundertake against them: to the end he may have occasion to master them,\nand know that ladder, which his enemies have set him upon, whereby to\nrise yet higher. And therefore many think, that a wise Prince when he\nhath the occasion, ought cunningly to nourish some enmity, that by the\nsuppressing thereof, his greatness may grow thereupon. Princes,\nespecially those that are new, have found more faith and profit in those\nmen, who in the beginning of their State, have been held suspected, than\nin those who at their entrance have been their confidents. Pandulphus\nPetrucci, Prince of Siena, governd his State, more with them that had\nbeen suspected by him, than with the others. But of this matter we\ncannot speak at large, because it varies according to the subject; I\nwill only say this, that those men, who in the beginning of a\nPrincipality were once enemies, if they be of quality so that to\nmaintain themselves they have need of support, the Prince might alwaies\nwith the greatest facility gain for his; and they are the rather forced\nto serve him faithfully, insomuch as they know it is more necessary for\nthem by their deeds to cancel that sinister opinion, which was once held\nof them; and so the Prince ever draws from these more advantage, than\nfrom those, who serving him too supinely, neglect his affairs. And seing\nthe matter requires it, I will not omit to put a Prince in mind, who\nhath anew made himself master of a State, by means of the inward helps\nhe had from thence that he consider well the cause that mov'd them that\nfavor'd him to favor him, if it be not a natural affection towards him;\nfor if it be only because they were not content with their former\ngovernment, with much pains and difficulties shall he be able to keep\nthem long his friends, because it will be impossible for him to content\nthem. By these examples then which are drawn out of ancient and modern\naffaires, searching into the cause hereof, we shall find it much more\neasie to gain those men for friends, who formerly were contented with\nthe State, and therefore were his enemies: than those, who because they\nwere not contented therewith, became his fiends, and favor'd him in\ngetting the mastery of it. It hath been the custome of Princes, whereby\nto hold their States more securely, to build Citadels, which might be\nbridles and curbs to those that should purpose any thing against them,\nand so to have a secure retreat from the first violences. I commend this\ncourse, because it hath been used of old; notwithstanding Nicholas\nVitelli in our dayes hath been known to demolish two Citadels in the\ntown of Castello, the better to keep the State; Guidubaldo Duke of Urbin\nbeing to return into his State, out of which he was driven by C\u00e6sar\nBorgia, raz'd all the Fortresses of that Countrey, and thought he should\nhardlyer lose that State again without them. The Bentivolii returning\ninto Bolonia, used the like courses. Citadels then are profitable, or\nnot, according to the times; and if they advantage thee in one part,\nthey do thee harme in another; and this part may be argued thus. That\nPrince who stands more in fear of his own people than of strangers,\nought to build Fortresses: but he that is more afraid of strangers than\nof his people, should let them alone. Against the house of Sforza, the\nCastle of Milan, which Francis Sforza built, hath and will make more\nwar, than any other disorder in that State: and therefore the best\nCitadel that may be, is not to incurre the peoples hatred; for however\nthou holdest a Fortress, and the people hate thee, thou canst hardly\nscape them; for people, when once they have taken armes, never want the\nhelp of strangers at their need to take ther parts. In our dayes we\nnever saw that they ever profited any Prince, unless it were the\nCountess of Furli, when Count Hieronymo of Furli her husband was slain;\nfor by means thereof she escap'd the peoples rage, and attended aid from\nMilan, and so recover'd her State: and then such were the times that the\nstranger could not assist the people: but afterwards they serv'd her to\nlittle purpose, when C\u00e6sar Borgia assaild her, and that the people which\nwas her enemy, sided with the stranger. Therefore both then, and at\nfirst, it would have been more for her safety, not to have been odious\nto the people, than to have held the Fortresses. These things being well\nweigh'd then, I will commend those that shall build up Fortresses, and\nhim also that shall not; and I will blame him, howsoever he be, that\nrelying upon those, shall make small account of being hated by his\npeople.\nCHAP. XXI\nHow a Prince ought to behave himself to gain reputation.\nThere is nothing gains a Prince such repute as great exploits, and rare\ntryals of himself in Heroick actions. We have now in our dayes Ferdinand\nKing of Arragon the present King of Spain: he in a manner may be termed\na new Prince; for from a very weak King, he is now become for fame and\nglory, the first King of Christendome, and if you shall wel consider his\nactions, you shall find them all illustrious, and every one of them\nextraordinary. He in the beginning of his reign assaild Granada, and\nthat exploit was the ground of his State. At first he made that war in\nsecurity, and without suspicion he should be any waies hindred, and\ntherein held the Barons of Castiglias minds busied, who thinking upon\nthat war, never minded any innovation; in this while he gaind credit and\nauthority with them, they not being aware of it; was able to maintain\nwith the Church and the peoples money all his soldiers, and to lay a\nfoundation for his military ordinances with that long war, which\nafterwards gaind him exceeding much honor. Besides this, to the end he\nmight be able hereamong to undertake greater matters, serving himself\nalwaies of the colour of religion, he gave himself to a kind of\nreligious cruelty, chasing and dispoyling those Jewes out of the\nKingdome; nor can this example be more admirable and rare: under the\nsame cloke he invaded Affrick and went through with his exploit in\nItaly: and last of all hath he assaild France, and so alwaies proceeded\non forwards contriving of great matters, which alwaies have held his\nsubjects minds in peace and admiration, and busied in attending the\nevent, what it should be: and these his actions have thus grown, one\nupon another, that they have never given leisure to men so to rest, as\nthey might ever plot any thing against them. Moreover it much avails a\nPrince to give extraordinary proofes of himself touching the government\nwithin, such as those we have heard of Bernard of Milan, whensoever\noccasion is given by any one, that may effectuate some great thing\neither of good or evil, in the civil government; and to find out some\nway either to reward or punish it, whereof in the world much notice may\nbe taken. And above all things a Prince ought to endeavor in all his\nactions to spread abroad a fame of his magnificence and worthiness. A\nPrince also is well esteemed, when he is a true friend, or a true enemy;\nwhen without any regard he discovers himself in favor of one against\nanother; which course shall be alwaies more profit, than to stand\nneuter: for if two mighty ones that are thy neighbors, come to fall out,\nor are of such quality, that one of them vanquishing, thou art like to\nbe in fear of the vanquisher, or not; in either of these two cases, it\nwill ever prove more for thy profit, to discover thy self, and make a\ngood war of it: for in the first case, if thou discoverest not thy\nselfe, thou shalt alwaies be a prey to him that overcomes, to the\ncontentment and satisfaction of the vanquisht; neither shalt thou have\nreason on thy side, nor any thing else to defend or receive thee. For he\nthat overcomes, will not have any suspected friends that give him no\nassistance in his necessity: and he that loses, receives thee not,\nbecause thou wouldest not with thy armes in hand run the hazzard of his\nfortune. Antiochus passed into Greece, thereunto induc'd by the\nEtolians, to chace the Romans thence: and sent his Ambassadors to the\nAchayans, who were the Romans friends, to perswade them to stand\nneuters; on the other side the Romans moved them to joyne armes with\ntheirs: this matter came to be deliberated on in the council of the\nAchayans, where Antiochus his Ambassador encouraged them to stand\nneuters, whereunto the Romans Ambassador answerd; Touching the course,\nthat is commended to you, as best and profitablest for your State, to\nwit, not to intermeddle in the war between us, nothing can be more\nagainst you: because, not taking either part, you shall remain without\nthanks, and without reputation a prey to the conqueror. And it will\nalwaies come to pass that he who is not thy friend, will requite thy\nneutrality; and he that is thy friend, will urge thee to discover thy\nself by taking arms for him: and evil advised Princes; to avoyd the\npresent dangers, folow often times that way of neutrality, and most\ncommonly go to ruine: but when a Prince discovers himself strongly in\nfavor of a party; if he to whom thou cleavest, overcomes; however that\nhe be puissant, and thou remainest at his disposing, he is oblig'd to\nthee, and there is a contract of friendship made; and men are never so\nopenly dishonest, as with such a notorious example of dishonesty to\noppress thee. Besides victories are never so prosperous, that the\nconqueror is like neglect all respects, and especially of justice. But\nif he to whom thou stickst, loses, thou art received by him; and, while\nhe is able, he aydes thee, and so thou becomest partner of a fortune\nthat may arise again; the second case, when they that enter into the\nlists together, are of such quality, that thou needest not fear him that\nvanquisheth, so much the more is it discretion in thee to stick to him;\nfor thou goest to ruine one with his assistance, who ought to do the\nbest he could to save him, if he were well advised; and he overcomming,\nis left at thy discretion; and it is unpossible but with thy ayd he must\novercome. And here it is to be noted, that a Prince should be well aware\nnever to joyn with any one more powerfull than himself, to offend\nanother, unless upon necessity, as formerly is said. For when he\novercomes, thou art left at his discretion, and Princes ought avoid as\nmuch as they are able, to stand at anothers discretion. The Venetians\ntook part with France against the Duke of Milan, and yet could have\navoided that partaking, from which proceeded their ruine. But when it\ncannot be avoyded, as it befel the Florentines when the Pope and the\nKing of Spain went both with their armies to Lombardy, there the Prince\nought to side with them for the reasons aforesaid. Nor let any State\nthink they are able to make such sure parties, but rather that they are\nall doubtfull; for in the order of things we find it alwaies, that\nwhensoever a man seeks to avoid one inconvenient, he incurs another. But\nthe principal point of judgement, is in discerning between the qualities\nof inconvenients, and not taking the bad for the good. Moreover a Prince\nought to shew himself a lover of vertue, and that he honors those that\nexcel in every Art. Afterwards ought he encourage his Citizens, whereby\nthey may be enabled quickly to exercise their faculties as well in\nmerchandise, and husbandry, as in any other kind of traffick, to the end\nthat no man forbear to adorne and cultivate his possessions for fear\nthat he be despoyled of them; or any other to open the commerce upon the\ndanger of heavy impositions: but rather to provide rewards for those\nthat shall set these matters afoot, or for any one else that shall any\nway amplifie his City or State. Besides he ought in the fit times of the\nyear entertain the people with Feasts and Maskes; and because every City\nis devided into Companies, and arts, and Tribes, he ought to take\nspecial notice of those bodies, and some times afford them a meeting,\nand give them some proof of his humanity, and magnificence; yet withall\nholding firme the majestie of his State; for this must never fail in any\ncase.\nCHAP.   XXII\nTouching Princes Secretaries.\nIt is no small importance to a Prince, the choyce he makes, of servants\nbeing ordinarily good or bad, as his wisdome is. And the first\nconjecture one gives of a great man, and of his understanding, is, upon\nthe sight of his followers and servants he hath about him, when they\nprove able and faithful, and then may he alwaies be reputed wise because\nhe hath known how to discern those that are able, and to keep them true\nto him. But when they are otherwise, there can be no good conjecture\nmade of him; for the first error he commits, is in this choyce. There\nwas no man that had any knowledge of Antonio of Vanafro, the servant of\nPandulfus Petrucci Prince of Sicily, who did not esteem Pandulfus for a\nvery discreet man, having him for his servant. And because there are\nthree kinds of understandings; the one that is advised by it self; the\nother that understands when it is informed by another; the third that\nneither is advised by it self nor by the demonstration of another; the\nfirst is best, the second is good, and the last quite unprofitable.\nTherefore it was of necessity, that if Pandulfus attaind not the first\ndegree, yet he got to the second; for whenever any one hath the\njudgement to discerne between the good and the evil, that he does and\nsayes, however that he hath not his distinction from himself, yet still\ncomes he to take notice of the good or evil actions of that servant; and\nthose he cherishes, and these he suppresses; insomuch that the servant\nfinding no means to deceive his master, keeps himself upright and\nhonest. But how a Prince may throughly understand his servant, here is\nthe way that never fails. When thou seest the servant study more for his\nown advantage than thine, and that in all his actions, he searches most\nafter his own profit; this man thus qualified, shall never prove good\nservant, nor canst thou ever relie upon him: for he that holds the\nSterne of the State in hand, ought never call home his cares to his own\nparticular, but give himself wholly over to his Princes service, nor\never put him in minde of any thing not appertaining to him. And on the\nother side the Prince to keep him good to him, ought to take a care for\nhis servant, honoring him, enriching, and obliging him to him, giving\nhim part both of dignities and offices, to the end that the many honors\nand much wealth bestowed on him, may restrain his desires from other\nhonors, and other wealth, and that those many charges cause him to fear\nchanges that may fall, knowing he is not able to stand without his\nmaster. And when both the Princes and the servants are thus disposed,\nthey may rely the one upon the other: when otherwise, the end will ever\nprove hurtfull for the one as well as for the other.\nCHAP. XXIII\nThat Flatterers are to be avoyded.\nI will not omit one principle of great inportance, being an errour from\nwhich Princes with much difficulty defend themselves, unlesse they be\nvery discreet, and make a very good choice; and this is concerning\nflatterers; whereof all writings are full: and that because men please\nthemselves so much in their own things, and therein cozen themselves,\nthat very hardly can they escape this pestilence; and desiring to escape\nit, there is danger of falling into contempt; for there is no other way\nto be secure from flattery, but to let men know, that they displease\nthee not in telling thee truth: but when every one hath this leave, thou\nlosest thy reverence. Therefore ought a wise Prince take a third course,\nmaking choyce of some understanding men in his State, and give only to\nthem a free liberty of speaking to him the truth; and touching those\nthings only which he inquires of, and nothing else; but he ought to be\ninquisitive of every thing, and hear their opinions, and then afterwards\nadvise himself after his own manner; and in these deliberations, and\nwith every one of them so carrie himself, that they all know, that the\nmore freely they shall speak, the better they shall be liked of: and\nbesides those, not give eare to any one; and thus pursue the thing\nresolved on, and thence continue obstinate in the resolution taken. He\nwho does otherwise, either falls upon flatterers, or often changes upon\nthe varying of opinions, from whence proceeds it that men conceive but\nslightly of him. To this purpose I will alledge you a moderne example.\nPeter Lucas a servant of Maximilians the present Emperor, speaking of\nhis Majesty, said that he never advised with any body, nor never did any\nthing after his own way: which was because he took a contrary course to\nwhat we have now said: for the Emperor is a close man, who communicates\nhis secrets to none, nor takes counsel of any one; but as they come to\nbe put in practise, they begin to be discovered and known, and so\ncontradicted by those that are near about him; and he as being an easy\nman, is quickly wrought from them. Whence it comes that what he does to\nday, he undoes on the morrow; and that he never understands himself what\nhe would, nor what he purposes, and that there is no grounding upon any\nof his resolutions. A Prince therefore ought alwayes to take counsell,\nbut at his owne pleasure, and not at other mens; or rather should take\naway any mans courage to advise him of any thing, but what he askes: but\nhe ought well to aske at large, and then touching the things inquird of,\nbe a patient hearer of the truth; and perceiving that for some respect\nthe truth were conceald from him, be displeased thereat. And because\nsome men have thought that a Prince that gaines the opinion to bee wise,\nmay bee held so, not by his owne naturall indowments, but by the good\ncounsells he hath about him; without question they are deceivd; for this\nis a generall rule and never failes, that a Prince who of himselfe is\nnot wise, can never be well advised, unlesse he should light upon one\nalone, wholly to direct and govern him, who himself were a very wise\nman. In this case it is possible he may be well governd: but this would\nlast but little: for that governor in a short time would deprive him of\nhis State; but a Prince not having any parts of nature, being advised of\nmore then one, shall never be able to unite these counsels: of himself\nshall he never know how to unite them; and each one of the Counsellers,\nprobably will follow that which is most properly his owne; and he shall\nnever find the meanes to amend or discerne these things; nor can they\nfall out otherwise, because men alwayes prove mischievous, unlesse upon\nsome necessity they be forc'd to become good: we conclude therefore,\nthat counsells from whencesoever they proceed, must needs take their\nbeginning from the Princes wisdome, and not the wisdome of the Prince\nfrom good counsells.\nIn this Chapter our Authour prescribes some rules how to avoyd\nflattery, and not to fall into contempt. The extent of these two\nextreames is so large on both sides, that there is left but a\nvery narrow path for the right temper to walke between them\nboth: and happy were that Prince, who could light on so good a\nPilote as to bring him to Port between those rocks and those\nquicksands. Where Majesty becomes familiar, unlesse endued with\na super-eminent vertue, it loses all awfull regards: as the\nlight of the Sunne, because so ordinary, because so common, we\nshould little value, were it not that all Creatures feele\nthemselves quickned by the rayes thereof. On the other side,\n_Omnis insipiens arroganti\u00e2 et plausibus capitur_, Every foole\nis taken with his owne pride and others flatteryes: and this\nfoole keeps company so much with all great wise men, that hardly\nwith a candle and lantern can they be discernd betwixt. The\ngreatest men are more subject to grosse and palpable flatteries;\nand especially the greatest of men, who are Kings and Princes:\nfor many seek the Rulers favour. _Prov._ 28. 26. For there are\ndivers meanes whereby private men are instructed; Princes have\nnot that good hap: but they whose instruction is of most\nimportance, so soone as they have taken the government upon\nthem, no longer suffer any reproovers: for but few have accesse\nunto them, and they who familiary converse with them, doe and\nsay all for favour. Isocrat, to Nicocles, All are afraid to give\nhim occasion of displeasure, though by telling him truth. To\nthis purpose therefore sayes one; a Prince excells in learning\nto ride the great horse, rather than in any other exercise,\nbecause his horse being no flatterer, will shew him he makes no\ndifference between him and another man, and unlesse he keepe his\nseate well, will lay him on the ground. This is plaine dealing.\nMen are more subtile, more double-hearted, they have a heart and\na heart neither is their tongue their hearts true interpreter.\nCounsell in the heart of man is like deepe waters; but a man of\nunderstanding will draw it out. _Prov._ 20. 5. This\nunderstanding is most requisite in a Prince, inasmuch as the\nwhole Globe is in his hand, and the inferiour Orbes are swayed\nby the motion of the highest. And therefore surely it is the\nhonour of a King to search out such a secret: _Prov._ 25. 2. His\ncounsellours are his eyes and eares; as they ought to be dear to\nhim, so they ought to be true to him, and make him the true\nreport of things without disguise. If they prove false eyes, let\nhim pluck them out; he may as they use glasse eyes, take them\nforth without paine, and see never a whit the worse for it. The\nwisdome of a Princes Counsellours is a great argument of the\nPrinces wisdome. And being the choyce of them imports the\nPrinces credit and safety, our Authour will make him amends for\nhis other errours by his good advice in his 22 Chap. whether I\nreferre him.\nCHAP. XXIV\nWherefore the Princes of Italy have lost their States.\nWhen these things above said are well observ'd, they make a new Prince\nseeme as if he had been of old, and presently render him more secure and\nfirme in the State, than if he had already grown ancient therein: for a\nnew Prince is much more observd in his action, than a Prince by\ninheritance; and when they are known to bee vertuous, men are much more\ngaind and oblig'd to them thereby, than by the antiquity of their blood:\nfor men are much more taken by things present, than by things past, and\nwhen in the present they find good, they content themselves therein, and\nseeke no further; or rather they undertake the defence of him to their\nutmost, when the Prince is not wanting in other matters to himself; and\nso shall he gaine double glory to have given a beginning to a new\nPrincipality, adornd, and strengthnd it with good lawes, good arms, good\nfriends, and good examples; as he shall have double shame, that is born\na Prince, and by reason of his small discretion hath lost it. And if we\nshall consider those Lords, that in Italy have lost their States in our\ndayes, as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others; first we\nshall find in them a common defect, touching their armes, for the\nreasons which have been above discoursd at length. Afterwards we shall\nsee some of them, that either shall have had the people for their\nenemies; or be it they had the people to friend, could never know how to\nassure themselves of the great ones: for without such defects as these,\nStates are not lost, which have so many nerves, that they are able to\nmaintaine an army in the feld. Philip of Macedon, not the father of\nAlexander the Great, but he that was vanquished by Titus Quintius, had\nnot much State in regard of the greatnesse of the Romanes and of Greece\nthat assail'd him; neverthelesse in that he was a warlike man and knew\nhow to entertaine the people, and assure himself of the Nobles, for many\nyeares he made the warre good against them: and though at last some town\nperhaps were taken from him, yet the Kingdome remaind in his hands\nstill. Wherefore these our Princes who for many yeares had continued in\ntheir Principalities, for having afterwards lost them, let them not\nblame Fortune, but their own sloth; because they never having thought\nduring the time of quiet, that they could suffer a change (which is the\ncommon fault of men, while faire weather lasts, not to provide for the\ntempest) when afterwards mischiefes came upon them, thought rather upon\nflying from them, than upon their defence, and hop'd that the people,\nweary of the vanquishers insolence, would recall them: which course when\nthe others faile, is good: but very ill is it to leave the other\nremedies for that: for a man wou'd never go to fall, beleeving another\nwould come to take him up: which may either not come to passe, or if it\ndoes, it is not for thy security, because that defence of his is vile,\nand depends not upon thee; but those defences only are good, certaine,\nand durable, which depend upon thy owne selfe, and thy owne vertues.\nCHAP. XXV\nHow great power Fortune hath in humane affaires, and what meanes there\nis to resist it.\nIt is not unknown unto me, how that many have held opinion, and still\nhold it, that the affaires of the world are so governd by fortune, and\nby God, that men by their wisdome cannot amend or alter them; or rather\nthat there is no remedy for them: and hereupon they would think that it\nwere of no availe to take much paines in any thing, but leave all to be\ngovernd by chance. This opinion hath gain'd the more credit in our\ndayes, by reason of the great alteration of things, which we have of\nlate seen, and do every day see, beyond all humane conjecture: upon\nwhich, I sometimes thinking, am in some parte inclind to their opinion:\nneverthelesse not to extinguish quite our owne free will, I think it may\nbe true, that Fortune is the mistrisse of one halfe of our actions; but\nyet that she lets us have rule of the other half, or little lesse. And I\nliken her to a precipitous torrent, which when it rages, over-flows the\nplaines, overthrowes the trees, and buildings, removes the earth from\none side, and laies it on another, every one flyes before it, every one\nyeelds to the fury thereof, as unable to withstand it; and yet however\nit be thus, when the times are calmer, men are able to make provision\nagainst these excesses, with banks and fences so, that afterwards when\nit swels again, it shall all passe smoothly along, within its channell,\nor else the violence thereof shall not prove so licentious and hurtfull.\nIn like manner befals it us with fortune, which there shewes her power\nwhere vertue is not ordeind to resist her, and thither turnes she all\nher forces, where she perceives that no provisions nor resistances are\nmade to uphold her. And if you shall consider Italy, which is the seat\nof these changes, and that which hath given them their motions, you\nshall see it to be a plaine field, without any trench or bank; which had\nit been fenc'd with convenient vertue as was Germany, Spain or France;\nthis inundation would never have causd these great alterations it hath,\nor else would it not have reach'd to us: and this shall suffice to have\nsaid, touching the opposing of fortune in generall. But restraining my\nselfe more to particulars, I say that to day we see a Prince prosper and\nflourish and to morrow utterly go to ruine; not seeing that he hath\nalterd any condition or quality; which I beleeve arises first from the\ncauses which we have long since run over, that is because that Prince\nthat relies wholly upon fortune, runnes as her wheele turnes. I beleeve\nalso, that he proves the fortunate man, whose manner of proceeding meets\nwith the quality of the time; and so likewise he unfortunate from whose\ncourse of proceeding the times differ: for we see that men, in the\nthings that induce them to the end, (which every one propounds to\nhimselfe, as glory and riches) proceed therein diversly; some with\nrespects, others more bold, and rashly; one with violence, and th'other\nwith cunning; the one with patience, th'other with its contrary; and\nevery one of severall wayes may attaine thereto; we see also two very\nrespective and wary men, the one come to his purpose, and th'other not;\nand in like maner two equally prosper, taking divers course; the one\nbeing wary the other head-strong; which proceeds from nothing else, but\nfrom the quality of the times, which agree, or not, with their\nproceedings. From hence arises that which I said, that two working\ndiversly, produce the same effect: and two equaly working, the one\nattains his end, the other not. Hereupon depends the alteration of the\ngood; for if to one that behaves himself with warinesse and patience,\ntimes and affaires turne so favourably, that the carriage of his\nbusinesse prove well, he prospers; but if the times and affaires chance,\nhe is ruind, because he changes not his manner of proceeding: nor is\nthere any man so wise, that can frame himselfe hereunto; as well because\nhe cannot go out of the way, from that whereunto Nature inclines him: as\nalso, for that one having alwayes prosperd, walking such a way, cannot\nbe perswaded to leave it; and therefore the respective and wary man,\nwhen it is fit time for him to use violence and force, knows not how to\nput it in practice, whereupon he is ruind: but if he could change his\ndisposition with the times and the affaires, he should not change his\nfortune. Pope Julius the second proceeded in all his actions with very\ngreat violence, and found the times and things so conformable to that\nhis manner of proceeding that in all of them he had happy successe.\nConsider the first exploit he did at Bolonia, even while John Bentivolio\nlived: the Venetians were not well contented therewith; the King of\nSpaine likewise with the French, had treated of that enterprise; and\nnotwithstanding al this, he stirrd up by his own rage and fiercenesse,\npersonally undertook that expedition: which action of his put in\nsuspence and stopt Spaine and the Venetians; those for feare, and the\nothers for desire to recover the Kingdome of Naples; and on the other\npart drew after him the King of France; for that King seeing him already\nin motion, and desiring to hold him his friend, whereby to humble the\nVenetians, thought he could no way deny him his souldiers, without doing\nhim an open injury. Julius then effected that with his violent and heady\nmotion, which no other Pope with all humane wisdome could ever have\ndone; for if he had expected to part from Rome with his conclusions\nsettled, and all his affaires ordered before hand, as any other Pope\nwould have done, he had never brought it to passe: For the King of\nFrance would have devised a thousand excuses, and others would have put\nhim in as many feares. I will let passe his other actions, for all of\nthem were alike, and all of them prov'd lucky to him; and the brevity of\nhis life never sufferd him to feele the contrary: for had he litt upon\nsuch times afterwards, that it had been necessary for him to proceed\nwith respects, there had been his utter ruine; for he would never have\nleft those wayes, to which he had been naturally inclind. I conclude\nthen, fortune varying, and men continuing still obstinate to their own\nwayes, prove happy, while these accord together: and as they disagree,\nprove unhappy: and I think it true, that it is better to be heady than\nwary; because Fortune is a mistresse; and it is necessary, to keep her\nin obedience to ruffle and force her: and we see, that she suffers her\nself rather to be masterd by those, than by others that proceed coldly.\nAnd therefore, as a mistresse, shee is a friend to young men, because\nthey are lesse respective, more rough, and command her with more\nboldnesse.\nI have considered the 25 Chapter, as representing me a full view\nof humane policy and cunning: yet me thinks it cannot satisfie a\nChristian in the causes of the good and bad successe of things.\nThe life of man is like a game at Tables; skill availes much I\ngrant, but that's not all: play thy game well, but that will not\nwinne: the chance thou throwest must accord with thy play.\nExamine this; play never so surely, play never so probably,\nunlesse the chance thou castest, lead thee forward to advantage,\nall hazards are losses, and thy sure play leaves thee in the\nlurch. The sum of this is set down in Ecclesiastes chap. 9. v.\n11. The race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong:\nneither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of\nunderstanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and\nchance hapeneth to them all. Our cunning Author for all his\nexact rules he delivere in his books, could not fence against\nthe despight of Fortune, as he complaines in his Epistle to this\nbooke. Nor that great example of policy, Duke Valentine, whome\nour Author commends to Princes for his crafts-master, could so\nruffle or force his mistresse Fortune, that he could keep her in\nobedience. Man can contribute no more to his actions than vertue\nand wisdome: but the successe depends upon a power above. Surely\nthere is the finger of god; or as Prov. 16. v. 33. 'The lot is\ncast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the\nLord.' It was not Josephs wisdome made all things thrive under\nhis hand; but because the Lord was with him; and that which he\ndid, the Lord made it to prosper, Gen. 39. Surely this is a\nblessing proceeding from the divine providence, which beyond\nhumane capacity so cooperateth with the causes, as that their\neffects prove answerable, and sometimes (that we may know there\nis something above the ordinary causes) the success returns with\nsuch a supereminency of worth, that it far exceeds the vertue of\nthe ordinary causes.\nCHAP. XXVI\nAn Exhortation to free Italy from the Barbarians.\nHaving then weighed all things above discours'd, and devising with my\nself, whether at this present in Italy the time might serve to honor a\nnew Prince, and whether there were matter that might minister occasion\nto a wise and valorous Prince, to introduce such a forme, that might do\nhonor to him, and good to the whole generality of the people in the\ncountrey: me thinks so many things concurre in favor of a new Prince,\nthat I know not whether there were ever any time more proper for this\npurpose. And if as I said, it was necessary, desiring to see Moses his\nvertue, that the children of Israel should be inthrald in \u00c6gypt; and to\nhave experience of the magnanimity of Cyrus his mind, that the Persians\nshould be oppress'd by the Medes; and to set forth the excellency of\nTheseus, that the Athenians should be dispersed; so at this present now\nwe are desirous to know the valor of an Italian spirit, it were\nnecessary Italy should be reduc'd to the same termes it is now in, and\nwere in more slavery than the Hebrews were; more subject than the\nPersians, more scatterd than the Athenians; without head, without order,\nbattered, pillaged, rent asunder, overrun, and had undergone all kind of\ndestruction. And however even in these later dayes, we have had some\nkind of shew of hope in some one, whereby we might have conjectur'd,\nthat he had been ordained for the deliverance hereof, yet it prov'd\nafterwards, that in the very height of all his actions he was curb'd by\nfortune, insomuch that this poore countrey remaining as it were without\nlife, attends still for him that shall heal her wounds, give an end to\nall those pillagings and sackings of Lombardy, to those robberies and\ntaxations of the Kingdome, and of Tuscany, and heal them of their soars,\nnow this long time gangren'd. We see how she makes her prayers to God,\nthat he send some one to redeem her from these Barbarous cruelties and\ninsolencies. We see her also wholly ready and disposed to follow any\ncolours, provided there be any one take them up. Nor do we see at this\npresent, that she can look for other, than your Illustrious Family, to\nbecome Cheiftain of this deliverance, which hath now by its own vertue\nand Fortune been so much exalted, and favored by God and the Church,\nwhereof it now holds the Principality: and this shall not be very hard\nfor you to do, if you shall call to mind the former actions, and lives\nof those that are above named. And though those men were very rare and\nadmirable, yet were they men, and every one of them began upon less\noccasion than this; for neither was their enterprize more just than\nthis, nor more easie; nor was God more their friend, than yours. Here is\nvery great justice: for that war is just, that is necessary; and those\narmes are religious, when there is no hope left otherwhere, but in them.\nHere is an exceeding good disposition thereto: nor can there be, where\nthere is a good disposition, a giant difficulty, provided that use be\nmade of those orders, which I propounded for aim and direction to you.\nBesides this, here we see extraordinary things without example effected\nby God; the sea was opened, a cloud guided the way, devotion poured\nforth the waters, and it rain'd down Manna; all these things have\nconcurred in your greatness, the rest is left for you to do. God will\nnot do every thing himself, that he may not take from us our free will,\nand of that glory that belongs to us. Neither is it a marvel, if any of\nthe aforenamed Italians have not been able to compass that, which we may\nhope your illustrious family shall: though in so many revolutions of\nItaly, and so many feats of war, it may seem that the whole military\nvertue therein be quite extinguisht; for this arises from that the\nancient orders thereof were not good; and there hath since been none\nthat hath known how to invent new ones. Nothing can so much honor a man\nrising anew, as new laws and new ordinances devised by him: these things\nwhen they have a good foundation given them, and contain in them their\ndue greatness, gain him reverence and admiration; and in Italy their\nwants not the matter wherein to introduce any forme. Here is great\nvertue in the members, were it not wanting in the heads. Consider in the\nsingle fights that have been, and duels, how much the Italians have\nexcel'd in their strength, activity and address; but when they come to\narmies, they appear not, and all proceeds from the weakness of the\nChieftaines; for they that understand the managing of these matters, are\nnot obeyed; and every one presumes to understand; hitherto there having\nnot been any one so highly raised either by fortune or vertue, as that\nothers would submit unto him. From hence proceeds it, that in so long\ntime, and in so many battels fought for these last past 20 years, when\nthere hath been an army wholly Italian, it alwaies hath had evil\nsuccess; whereof the river Tarus first was witness, afterwards\nAlexandria, Capua, Genua, Vayla, Bolonia, Mestri. Your Illustrious\nfamily then being desirous to tread the footsteps of these Worthyes who\nredeem'd their countreys, must above all things as the very foundation\nof the whole fabrick, be furnished with soldiers of your own natives:\nbecause you cannot have more faithful, true, nor better soldiers; and\nthough every one of them be good, all together they will become better\nwhen they shall find themselves entertained, commanded, and honored by\ntheir own Prince. Wherefore it is necessary to provide for those armes,\nwhereby to be able with the Italian valor to make a defence against\nforreiners. And however the Swisse infantry and Spanish be accounted\nterrible; yet is there defect in both of them, by which a third order\nmight not only oppose them, but may be confident to vanquish them: for\nthe Spaniards are not able to indure the Horse, and the Swisse are to\nfeare the foot, when they incounter with them, as resolute in the fight\nas they; whereupon it hath been seen, and upon experience shall be\ncertain, that the Spaniards are not able to beare up against the French\nCavalery, and the Swisses have been routed by the Spanish Foot. And\nthough touching this last, there hath not been any entire experience\nhad, yet was there some proof thereof given in the battel of Ravenna,\nwhen the Spanish Foot affronted the Dutch battalions, which keep the\nsame rank the Swisses do, where the Spaniards with their nimbleness of\nbody, and the help of their targets entred in under their Pikes, and\nthere stood safe to offend them, the Dutch men having no remedy: and had\nit not been for the Cavalery that rusht in upon them, they had quite\ndefeated them. There may then (the defect of the one and other of these\ntwo infantries being discoverd) another kind of them be anew ordained,\nwhich may be able to make resistance against the Horse, and not fear the\nFoot, which shall not be a new sort of armes, but change of orders. And\nthese are some of those things which ordained a new, gain reputation and\ngreatness to a new Prince. Therefore this occasion should not be let\npass, to the end that Italy after so long a time may see some one\nredeemer of hers appear. Nor can I express with what dearness of\naffection he would be received in all those countreys which have\nsuffered by those forrein scums, with what thirst of revenge, with what\nresolution of fidelity, with what piety, with what tears. Would any\ngates be shut again him? Any people deny him obedience? Any envy oppose\nhim? Would not every Italian fully consent with him? This government of\nthe Barbarians stinks in every ones nostrils. Let your Illustrious\nFamily then undertake this worthy exployt with that courage and those\nhopes wherewith such just actions are to be attempted; to the end that\nunder your colours, this countrey may be enabled, and under the\nprotection of your fortune that saying of Petrarch be verifyed.\n_Virt\u00f9 contr' al fuore\nPrendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto:\nChe l'antico valore\nNe gli Italici cor non \u00e8 morto._\nVertue against fury shall advance the fight,\nAnd it i' th' combate soon shall put to flight:\nFor th' old Roman valor is not dead,\nNor in th' Italians brests extinguished.\nFINIS", "source": "art_of_war.txt"}

Of the beginnings of Cities in general, and in particular of that of\nRome\nII. Of the various kinds of Government; and to which of them the Roman\nCommonwealth belonged\nIII. Of the accidents which led in Rome to the creation of Tribunes of\nthe People, whereby the Republic was made more perfect\nIV. That the dissensions between the Senate and Commons of Rome made\nRome free and powerful\nV. Whether the guardianship of public freedom is safer in the hands of\nthe Commons or of the Nobles; and whether those who seek to acquire\npower, or they who seek to maintain it, are the greater cause of\ncommotions\nVI. Whether it was possible in Rome to contrive such a Government as\nwould have composed the differences between the Commons and the Senate\nVII. That to preserve liberty in a State, there must exist the right to\naccuse\nVIII. That calumny is as hurtful in a Commonwealth as the power to\naccuse is useful\nIX. That to give new institutions to a Commonwealth, or to reconstruct\nold institutions on an entirely new basis, must be the work of one Man\nX. That in proportion as the founder of a Kingdom or Commonwealth\nmerits praise, he who founds a Tyranny deserves blame\nXI. Of the Religion of the Romans\nXII. That it is of much moment to make account of Religion; and that\nItaly, through the Roman Church, being wanting therein, has been ruined\nXIII. Of the use the Romans made of Religion in giving institutions to\ntheir City; in carrying out their enterprises; and in quelling tumults\nXIV. That the Romans interpreted the auspices to meet the occasion; and\nmade a prudent show of observing the rites of Religion even when forced\nto disregard them; and any who rashly slighted Religion they punished\nXV. How the Samnites, as a last resource in their broken fortunes, had\nrecourse to Religion\nXVI. That a People accustomed to live under a Prince, if by any\naccident it become free, can hardly preserve that freedom\nXVII. That a corrupt People obtaining freedom can hardly preserve it\nXVIII. How a free Government existing in a corrupt City may be\npreserved, or not existing may be created\nXIX. After a strong Prince a weak Prince may maintain himself: but\nafter one weak Prince no Kingdom can stand a second\nXX. That the consecutive reigns of two valiant Princes produce great\nresults: and that well-ordered Commonwealths are assured of a\nsuccession of valiant Rulers by whom their power and growth are rapidly\nextended\nXXI. That it is a great reproach to a Prince or to a Commonwealth to be\nwithout a National Army\nXXII. What is to be noted in the combat of the three Roman Horatii and\nthe three Alban Curiatii\nXXIII. That we should never hazard our whole fortunes, where we put not\nforth our entire strength; for which reason to guard a defile is often\nhurtful\nXXIV. That well-ordered States always provide rewards and punishments\nfor their Citizens; and never set off deserts against misdeeds\nXXV. That he who would reform the institutions of a free State, must\nretain at least the semblance of old ways\nXXVI. That a new Prince in a city or province of which he has taken\npossession, ought to make everything new\nXXVII. That Men seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly bad\nXXVIII. Whence it came that the Romans were less ungrateful to their\ncitizens than were the Athenians\nXXIX. Whether a People or a Prince is the more ungrateful\nXXX. How Princes and Commonwealths may avoid the vice of ingratitude;\nand how a Captain or Citizen may escape being undone by it\nXXXI. That the Roman Captains were never punished with extreme severity\nfor misconduct; and where loss resulted to the Republic merely through\ntheir ignorance or want of judgment, were not punished at all\nXXXII. That a Prince or Commonwealth should not defer benefits until\nthey are forced to yield them\nXXXIII. When a mischief has grown up in, or against a State, it is\nsafer to temporize with it than to meet it with violence\nXXXIV. That the authority of the Dictator did good and not harm to the\nRoman Republic; and that it is, not those powers which are given by the\nfree suffrages of the People, but those which ambitious Citizens usurp\nfor themselves that are pernicious to a State\nXXXV. Why the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, although brought\nabout by the free and open suffrage of the Citizens, was hurtful to the\nliberties of that Republic\nXXXVI. That Citizens who have held the higher offices of a Commonwealth\nshould not disdain the lower\nXXXVII. Of the mischief bred in Rome by the Agrarian Law: and how it is\na great source of disorder in a Commonwealth to pass a law opposed to\nancient usage with stringent retrospective effect\nXXXVIII. That weak Republics are irresolute and undecided; and that the\ncourse they may take depends more on Necessity than Choice\nXXXIX. That often the same accidents are seen to befall different\nNations\nXL. Of the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, and what therein is to\nbe noted. Wherein among other matters it is shown how the same causes\nmay lead to the safety or to the ruin of a Commonwealth\nXLI. That it is unwise to pass at a bound from leniency to severity, or\nto a haughty bearing from a humble\nXLII. How easily men become corrupted\nXLIII. That men fighting in their own cause make good and resolute\nSoldiers\nXLIV. That the Multitude is helpless without a head: and that we should\nnot with the same breath threaten and ask leave\nXLV. That it is of evil example, especially in the maker of a law, not\nto observe the law when made: and that daily to renew acts of severity\nin a City is most hurtful to the Governor\nXLVI. That men climb from one step of ambition to another, seeking at\nfirst to escape injury, and then to injure others\nXLVII. That though men deceive themselves in generalities, in\nparticulars they judge truly\nXLVIII. He who would not have an office bestowed on some worthless or\nwicked person, should contrive that it be solicited by one who is\nutterly worthless and wicked, or else by one who is in the highest\ndegree noble and good\nXLIX. That if Cities which, like Rome, had their beginning in freedom,\nhave had difficulty in framing such laws as would preserve their\nfreedom, Cities which at the first have been in subjection will find\nthis almost impossible\nL. That neither any Council nor any Magistrate should have power to\nbring the Government of a City to a stay\nLI. What a Prince or Republic does of necessity, should seem to be done\nby choice\nLII. That to check the arrogance of a Citizen who is growing too\npowerful in a State, there is no safer method, nor less open to\nobjection, than to forestall him in those ways whereby he seeks to\nadvance himself\nLIII. That the People, deceived by a false show of advantage, often\ndesire what would be their ruin; and that large hopes and brave\npromises easily move them\nLIV. Of the boundless authority which a great man may use to restrain\nan excited Multitude\nLV. That the Government is easily carried on in a City wherein the body\nof the People is not corrupted: and that a Princedom is impossible\nwhere equality prevails, and a Republic where it does not\nLVI. That when great calamities are about to befall a City or Country,\nsigns are seen to presage, and seers arise who foretell them\nLVII. That the People are strong collectively, but individually weak\nLVIII. That a People is wiser and more constant than a Prince\nLIX. To what Leagues or Alliances we may most trust, whether those we\nmake with Commonwealths or those we make with Princes\nLX. That the Consulship and all the other Magistracies in Rome were\ngiven without respect to Age\nBOOK II.\nPREFACE\nI. Whether the Empire acquired by the Romans was more due to Valour or\nto Fortune\nII. With what Nations the Romans had to contend, and how stubborn these\nwere in defending their Freedom\nIII. That Rome became great by destroying the Cities which lay round\nabout her, and by readily admitting Strangers to the rights of\nCitizenship\nIV. That Commonwealths have followed three methods for extending their\npower\nV. That changes in Sects and Tongues, and the happening of Floods and\nPestilences, obliterate the memory of the past\nVI. Of the methods followed by the Romans in making War\nVII. Of the quantity of land assigned by the Romans to each colonist\nVIII. Why certain Nations leave their ancestral seats and overflow the\nCountries of others\nIX. Of the Causes which commonly give rise to wars between States\nX. That contrary to the vulgar opinion, Money is not the sinews of War\nXI. That it were unwise to ally yourself with a Prince who has\nreputation rather than strength\nXII. Whether when Invasion is imminent it is better to anticipate or to\nawait it\nXIII. That Men rise from humble to high fortunes rather by Fraud than\nby Force\nXIV. That Men often err in thinking they can subdue Pride by Humility\nXV. That weak States are always dubious in their resolves; and that\ntardy resolves are always hurtful\nXVI. That the Soldiers of our days depart widely from the methods of\nancient Warfare\nXVII. What importance the Armies of the present day should allow to\nArtillery; and whether the commonly received opinion concerning it be\njust\nXVIII. That the authority of the Romans and the example of ancient\nwarfare should make us hold Foot Soldiers of more account than Horse\nXIX. That conquests made by ill governed States and such as follow not\nthe valiant methods of the Romans, lend rather to their ruin than to\ntheir aggrandizement\nXX. Of the dangers incurred by Princes or Republics who resort to\nAuxiliary or Mercenary Arms\nXXI. That Capua was the first City to which the Romans sent a Pr\u00e6tor;\nnor there, until four hundred years after they began to make war\nXXII. That in matters of moment Men often judge amiss\nXXIII. That in chastising their Subjects when circumstances required it\nthe Romans always avoided half measures\nXXIV. That, commonly, Fortresses do much more harm than good\nXXV. That he who attacks a City divided against itself, must not think\nto get possession of it through its divisions\nXXVI. That Taunts and Abuse breed hatred against him who uses them,\nwithout yielding him any advantage\nXXVII. That prudent Princes and Republics should be content to have\nobtained a victory; for, commonly, when they are not, their victory\nturns to defeat\nXXVIII. That to neglect the redress of Grievances, whether public or\nprivate, is dangerous for a Prince or Commonwealth\nXXIX. That Fortune obscures the minds of Men when she would not have\nthem hinder her designs\nXXX. That really powerful Princes and Commonwealths do not buy\nFriendships with money, but with their valour and the fame of their\nprowess\nXXXI. Of the danger of trusting banished men\nXXXII. In how many ways the Romans gained possession of Towns\nXXXIII. That the Romans entrusted the Captains of their Armies with the\nfullest Powers\nBOOK III.\nI. For a Sect or Commonwealth to last long, it must often be brought\nback to its beginnings\nII. That on occasion it is wise to feign folly\nIII. That to preserve a newly acquired freedom we must slay the Sons of\nBrutus\nIV. That an Usurper is never safe in his Princedom while those live\nwhom he has deprived of it\nV. How an Hereditary King may come to lose his Kingdom\nVI. Of Conspiracies\nVII. Why it is that changes from Freedom to Servitude, and from\nServitude to Freedom, are sometimes made without bloodshed, but at\nother times reek with blood\nVIII. That he who would effect changes in a Commonwealth, must give\nheed to its character and condition\nIX. That to enjoy constant good fortune we must change with the times\nX. That a Captain cannot escape battle when his Enemy forces it on him\nat all hazards\nXI. That one who has to contend with many, though he be weaker than\nthey, will prevail if he can withstand their first onset\nXII. A prudent Captain will do what he can to make it necessary for his\nown Soldiers to fight, and to relieve his Enemy from that necessity\nXIII. Whether we may trust more to a valiant Captain with a weak Army,\nor to a valiant Army with a weak Captain\nXIV. Of the effect produced in Battle by strange and unexpected Sights\nor Sounds\nXV. That one and not many should head an Army; and why it is\ndisadvantageous to have more leaders than one\nXVI. That in times of difficulty true Worth is sought after whereas in\nquiet times it is not the most deserving but those who are recommended\nby wealth or connection who are most in favour\nXVII. That we are not to offend a Man, and then send him to fill an\nimportant Office or Command\nXVIII. That it is the highest quality of a Captain to be able to\nforestall the designs of his adversary\nXIX. Whether indulgence or severity be more necessary for controlling a\nMultitude\nXX. How one humane act availed more with the men of Falerii than all\nthe might of the Roman Arms\nXXI. How it happened that Hannibal pursuing a course contrary to that\ntaken by Scipio, wrought the same results in Italy which the other\nachieved in Spain\nXXII. That the severity of Manlius Torquatus and the gentleness of\nValerius Corvinus won for both the same Glory\nXXIII. Why Camillus was banished from Rome\nXXIV. That prolonged Commands brought Rome to Servitude\nXXV. Of the Poverty of Cincinnatus and of many other Roman Citizens\nXXVI. How women are a cause of the ruin of States\nXXVII. How a divided City may be reunited; and how it is a false\nopinion that to hold Cities in subjection they must be kept divided\nXXVIII. That a Republic must keep an eye on what its Citizens are\nabout; since often the seeds of a Tyranny lie hidden under a semblance\nof generous deeds\nXXIX. That the faults of a People are due to its Prince\nXXX. That a Citizen who seeks by his personal influence to render\nsignal service to his Country, must first stand clear of Envy. How a\nCity should prepare for its defence on the approach of an Enemy\nXXXI That strong Republics and valiant Men preserve through every\nchange the same spirit and bearing\nXXXII. Of the methods which some have used to make Peace impossible\nXXXIII. That to insure victory in battle, you must inspire your\nsoldiers with confidence in one another and in you\nXXXIV. By what reports, rumours, or surmises the Citizens of a Republic\nare led to favour a fellow-citizen: and whether the Magistracies are\nbestowed with better judgment by a People or by a Prince\nXXXV. Of the danger incurred in being the first to recommend new\nmeasures; and that the more unusual the measures, the greater the\ndanger\nXXXVI. Why it has been and still may be affirmed of the Gauls, that at\nthe beginning of a fray they are more than Men, but afterwards less\nthan Women\nXXXVII. Whether a general engagement should be preceded by skirmishes;\nand how, avoiding these, we may get knowledge of a new Enemy\nXXXVIII. Of the Qualities of a Captain in whom his Soldiers can confide\nXXXIX. That a Captain should have good knowledge of Places\nXL. That Fraud is fair in War\nXLI. That our Country is to be defended by Honour or by Dishonour, and\nin either way is well defended\nXLII. That Promises made on compulsion are not to be observed\nXLIII. That Men born in the same Province retain through all times\nnearly the same character\nXLIV. That where ordinary methods fail, Hardihood and Daring often\nsucceed\nXLV. Whether in battle it is better to await and repel the enemy\u2019s\nattack, or to anticipate it by an impetuous onset\nXLVI. How the Characteristics of Families come to be perpetuated\nXLVII. That love of his Country should lead a good Citizen to forget\nprivate wrongs\nXLVIII. That on finding an Enemy make what seems a grave blunder we\nshould suspect some fraud to lurk behind\nXLIX. That a Commonwealth to preserve its Freedom has constant need of\nnew Ordinances. Of the services in respect of which Quintius Fabius\nreceived the surname of Maximus\nNICCOL\u00d2 MACHIAVELLI\nTO\nZANOBI BUONDELMONTI AND COSIMO RUCELLAI\nHEALTH.\nI send you a gift, which if it answers ill the obligations I owe you,\nis at any rate the greatest which Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli has it in his\npower to offer. For in it I have expressed whatever I have learned, or\nhave observed for myself during a long experience and constant study of\nhuman affairs. And since neither you nor any other can expect more at\nmy hands, you cannot complain if I have not given you more.\nYou may indeed lament the poverty of my wit, since what I have to say\nis but poorly said; and tax the weakness of my judgment, which on many\npoints may have erred in its conclusions. But granting all this, I know\nnot which of us is less beholden to the other: I to you, who have\nforced me to write what of myself I never should have written; or you\nto me, who have written what can give you no content.\nTake this, however, in the spirit in which all that comes from a friend\nshould be taken, in respect whereof we always look more to the\nintention of the giver than to the quality of the gift. And, believe\nme, that in one thing only I find satisfaction, namely, in knowing that\nwhile in many matters I may have made mistakes, at least I have not\nbeen mistaken in choosing you before all others as the persons to whom\nI dedicate these Discourses; both because I seem to myself, in doing\nso, to have shown a little gratitude for kindness received, and at the\nsame time to have departed from the hackneyed custom which leads many\nauthors to inscribe their works to some Prince, and blinded by hopes of\nfavour or reward, to praise him as possessed of every virtue; whereas\nwith more reason they might reproach him as contaminated with every\nshameful vice.\nTo avoid which error I have chosen, not those who are but those who\nfrom their infinite merits deserve to be Princes; not such persons as\nhave it in their power to load me with honours, wealth, and preferment,\nbut such as though they lack the power, have all the will to do so. For\nmen, if they would judge justly, should esteem those who are, and not\nthose whose means enable them to be generous; and in like manner those\nwho know how to govern kingdoms, rather than those who possess the\ngovernment without such knowledge. For Historians award higher praise\nto Hiero of Syracuse when in a private station than to Perseus the\nMacedonian when a King affirming that while the former lacked nothing\nthat a Prince should have save the name, the latter had nothing of the\nKing but the kingdom.\nMake the most, therefore, of this good or this evil, as you may esteem\nit, which you have brought upon yourselves; and should you persist in\nthe mistake of thinking my opinions worthy your attention, I shall not\nfail to proceed with the rest of the History in the manner promised in\nmy Preface. _Farewell_.\nDISCOURSES\nON THE FIRST DECADE OF\nTITUS LIVIUS.\nBOOK I.\nPREFACE.\nAlbeit the jealous temper of mankind, ever more disposed to censure\nthan to praise the work of others, has constantly made the pursuit of\nnew methods and systems no less perilous than the search after unknown\nlands and seas; nevertheless, prompted by that desire which nature has\nimplanted in me, fearlessly to undertake whatsoever I think offers a\ncommon benefit to all, I enter on a path which, being hitherto\nuntrodden by any, though it involve me in trouble and fatigue, may yet\nwin me thanks from those who judge my efforts in a friendly spirit. And\nalthough my feeble discernment, my slender experience of current\naffairs, and imperfect knowledge of ancient events, render these\nefforts of mine defective and of no great utility, they may at least\nopen the way to some other, who, with better parts and sounder\nreasoning and judgment, shall carry out my design; whereby, if I gain\nno credit, at all events I ought to incur no blame.\nWhen I see antiquity held in such reverence, that to omit other\ninstances, the mere fragment of some ancient statue is often bought at\na great price, in order that the purchaser may keep it by him to adorn\nhis house, or to have it copied by those who take delight in this art;\nand how these, again, strive with all their skill to imitate it in\ntheir various works; and when, on the other hand, I find those noble\nlabours which history shows to have been wrought on behalf of the\nmonarchies and republics of old times, by kings, captains, citizens,\nlawgivers, and others who have toiled for the good of their country,\nrather admired than followed, nay, so absolutely renounced by every one\nthat not a trace of that antique worth is now left among us, I cannot\nbut at once marvel and grieve; at this inconsistency; and all the more\nbecause I perceive that, in civil disputes between citizens, and in the\nbodily disorders into which men fall, recourse is always had to the\ndecisions and remedies, pronounced or prescribed by the ancients.\nFor the civil law is no more than the opinions delivered by the ancient\njurisconsults, which, being reduced to a system, teach the\njurisconsults of our own times how to determine; while the healing art\nis simply the recorded experience of the old physicians, on which our\nmodern physicians found their practice. And yet, in giving laws to a\ncommonwealth, in maintaining States and governing kingdoms, in\norganizing armies and conducting wars, in dealing with subject nations,\nand in extending a State\u2019s dominions, we find no prince, no republic,\nno captain, and no citizen who resorts to the example of the ancients.\nThis I persuade myself is due, not so much to the feebleness to which\nthe present methods of education have brought the world, or to the\ninjury which a pervading apathy has wrought in many provinces and\ncities of Christendom, as to the want of a right intelligence of\nHistory, which renders men incapable in reading it to extract its true\nmeaning or to relish its flavour. Whence it happens that by far the\ngreater number of those who read History, take pleasure in following\nthe variety of incidents which it presents, without a thought to\nimitate them; judging such imitation to be not only difficult but\nimpossible; as though the heavens, the sun, the elements, and man\nhimself were no longer the same as they formerly were as regards\nmotion, order, and power.\nDesiring to rescue men from this error, I have thought fit to note down\nwith respect to all those books of Titus Livius which have escaped the\nmalignity of Time, whatever seems to me essential to a right\nunderstanding of ancient and modern affairs; so that any who shall read\nthese remarks of mine, may reap from them that profit for the sake of\nwhich a knowledge of History is to be sought. And although the task be\narduous, still, with the help of those at whose instance I assumed the\nburthen, I hope to carry it forward so far, that another shall have no\nlong way to go to bring it to its destination.\nCHAPTER I.\u2014_Of the Beginnings of Cities in general, and in particular\nof that of Rome._\nNo one who reads how the city of Rome had its beginning, who were its\nfounders, and what its ordinances and laws, will marvel that so much\nexcellence was maintained in it through many ages, or that it grew\nafterwards to be so great an Empire.\nAnd, first, as touching its origin, I say, that all cities have been\nfounded either by the people of the country in which they stand, or by\nstrangers. Cities have their origins in the former of these two ways\nwhen the inhabitants of a country find that they cannot live securely\nif they live dispersed in many and small societies, each of them\nunable, whether from its situation or its slender numbers, to stand\nalone against the attacks of its enemies; on whose approach there is no\ntime left to unite for defence without abandoning many strongholds, and\nthus becoming an easy prey to the invader. To escape which dangers,\nwhether of their own motion or at the instance of some of greater\nauthority among them, they restrict themselves to dwell together in\ncertain places, which they think will be more convenient to live in and\neasier to defend.\nAmong many cities taking their origin in this way were Athens and\nVenice; the former of which, for reasons like those just now mentioned,\nwas built by a scattered population under the direction of Theseus. To\nescape the wars which, on the decay of the Roman Empire daily renewed\nin Italy by the arrival of fresh hordes of Barbarians, numerous\nrefugees, sheltering in certain little islands in a corner of the\nAdriatic Sea, gave beginning to Venice; where, without any recognized\nleader to direct them, they agreed to live together under such laws as\nthey thought best suited to maintain them. And by reason of the\nprolonged tranquility which their position secured, they being\nprotected by the narrow sea and by the circumstance that the tribes who\nthen harassed Italy had no ships wherewith to molest them, they were\nable from very small beginnings to attain to that greatness they now\nenjoy.\nIn the second case, namely of a city being founded by strangers, the\nsettlers are either wholly independent, or they are controlled by\nothers, as where colonies are sent forth either by a prince or by a\nrepublic, to relieve their countries of an excessive population, or to\ndefend newly acquired territories which it is sought to secure at small\ncost. Of this sort many cities were settled by the Romans, and in all\nparts of their dominions. It may also happen that such cities are\nfounded by a prince merely to add to his renown, without any intention\non his part to dwell there, as Alexandria was built by Alexander the\nGreat. Cities like these, not having had their beginning in freedom,\nseldom make such progress as to rank among the chief towns of kingdoms.\nThe city of Florence belongs to that class of towns which has not been\nindependent from the first; for whether we ascribe its origin to the\nsoldiers of Sylla, or, as some have conjectured, to the mountaineers of\nFiesole (who, emboldened by the long peace which prevailed throughout\nthe world during the reign of Octavianus, came down to occupy the plain\non the banks of the Arno), in either case, it was founded under the\nauspices of Rome nor could, at first, make other progress than was\npermitted by the grace of the sovereign State.\nThe origin of cities may be said to be independent when a people,\neither by themselves or under some prince, are constrained by famine,\npestilence, or war to leave their native land and seek a new\nhabitation. Settlers of this sort either establish themselves in cities\nwhich they find ready to their hand in the countries of which they take\npossession, as did Moses; or they build new ones, as did \u00c6neas. It is\nin this last case that the merits of a founder and the good fortune of\nthe city founded are best seen; and this good fortune will be more or\nless remarkable according to the greater or less capacity of him who\ngives the city its beginning.\nThe capacity of a founder is known in two ways: by his choice of a\nsite, or by the laws which he frames. And since men act either of\nnecessity or from choice, and merit may seem greater where choice is\nmore restricted, we have to consider whether it may not be well to\nchoose a sterile district as the site of a new city, in order that the\ninhabitants, being constrained to industry, and less corrupted by ease,\nmay live in closer union, finding less cause for division in the\npoverty of their land; as was the case in Ragusa, and in many other\ncities built in similar situations. Such a choice were certainly the\nwisest and the most advantageous, could men be content to enjoy what is\ntheir own without seeking to lord it over others. But since to be safe\nthey must be strong, they are compelled avoid these barren districts,\nand to plant themselves in more fertile regions; where, the\nfruitfulness of the soil enabling them to increase and multiply, they\nmay defend themselves against any who attack them, and overthrow any\nwho would withstand their power.\nAnd as for that languor which the situation might breed, care must be\nhad that hardships which the site does not enforce, shall be enforced\nby the laws; and that the example of those wise nations be imitated,\nwho, inhabiting most fruitful and delightful countries, and such as\nwere likely to rear a listless and effeminate race, unfit for all manly\nexercises, in order to obviate the mischief wrought by the amenity and\nrelaxing influence of the soil and climate, subjected all who were to\nserve as soldiers to the severest training; whence it came that better\nsoldiers were raised in these countries than in others by nature rugged\nand barren. Such, of old, was the kingdom of the Egyptians, which,\nthough of all lands the most bountiful, yet, by the severe training\nwhich its laws enforced, produced most valiant soldiers, who, had their\nnames not been lost in antiquity, might be thought to deserve more\npraise than Alexander the Great and many besides, whose memory is still\nfresh in men\u2019s minds. And even in recent times, any one contemplating\nthe kingdom of the Soldan, and the military order of the Mamelukes\nbefore they were destroyed by Selim the Grand Turk, must have seen how\ncarefully they trained their soldiers in every kind of warlike\nexercise; showing thereby how much they dreaded that indolence to which\ntheir genial soil and climate might have disposed them, unless\nneutralized by strenuous laws. I say, then, that it is a prudent choice\nto found your city in a fertile region when the effects of that\nfertility are duly balanced by the restraint of the laws.\nWhen Alexander the Great thought to add to his renown by founding a\ncity, Dinocrates the architect came and showed him how he might build\nit on Mount Athos, which not only offered a strong position, but could\nbe handled that the city built there might present a semblance of the\nhuman form, which would be a thing strange and striking, and worthy of\nso great a monarch. But on Alexander asking how the inhabitants were to\nlive, Dinocrates answered that he had not thought of that. Whereupon,\nAlexander laughed, and leaving Mount Athos as it stood, built\nAlexandria; where, the fruitfulness of the soil, and the vicinity of\nthe Nile and the sea, might attract many to take up their abode.\nTo him, therefore, who inquires into the origin of Rome, if he assign\nits beginning to \u00c6neas, it will seem to be of those cities which were\nfounded by strangers if to Romulus, then of those founded by the\nnatives of the country. But in whichever class we place it, it will be\nseen to have had its beginning in freedom, and not in subjection to\nanother State. It will be seen, too, as hereafter shall be noted, how\nstrict was the discipline which the laws instituted by Romulus, Numa,\nand its other founders made compulsory upon it; so that neither its\nfertility, the proximity of the sea, the number of its victories, nor\nthe extent of its dominion, could for many centuries corrupt it, but,\non the contrary, maintained it replete with such virtues as were never\nmatched in any other commonwealth.\nAnd because the things done by Rome, and which Titus Livius has\ncelebrated, were effected at home or abroad by public or by private\nwisdom, I shall begin by treating, and noting the consequences of those\nthings done at home in accordance with the public voice, which seem\nmost to merit attention; and to this object the whole of this first\nBook or first Part of my Discourses, shall be directed.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014Of the various kinds of Government; and to which of them\nthe Roman Commonwealth belonged.\nI forego all discussion concerning those cities which at the outset\nhave been dependent upon others, and shall speak only of those which\nfrom their earliest beginnings have stood entirely clear of all foreign\ncontrol, being governed from the first as pleased themselves, whether\nas republics or as princedoms.\nThese as they have had different origins, so likewise have had\ndifferent laws and institutions. For to some at their very first\ncommencement, or not long after, laws have been given by a single\nlegislator, and all at one time; like those given by Lycurgus to the\nSpartans; while to others they have been given at different times, as\nneed rose or accident determined; as in the case of Rome. That\nrepublic, indeed, may be called happy, whose lot has been to have a\nfounder so prudent as to provide for it laws under which it can\ncontinue to live securely, without need to amend them; as we find\nSparta preserving hers for eight hundred years, without deterioration\nand without any dangerous disturbance. On the other hand, some measure\nof unhappiness attaches to the State which, not having yielded itself\nonce for all into the hands of a single wise legislator, is obliged to\nrecast its institutions for itself; and of such States, by far the most\nunhappy is that which is furthest removed from a sound system of\ngovernment, by which I mean that its institutions lie wholly outside\nthe path which might lead it to a true and perfect end. For it is\nscarcely possible that a State in this position can ever, by any\nchance, set itself to rights, whereas another whose institutions are\nimperfect, if it have made a good beginning and such as admits of its\namendment, may in the course of events arrive at perfection. It is\ncertain, however, that such States can never be reformed without great\nrisk; for, as a rule, men will accept no new law altering the\ninstitutions of their State, unless the necessity for such a change be\ndemonstrated; and since this necessity cannot arise without danger, the\nState may easily be overthrown before the new order of things is\nestablished. In proof whereof we may instance the republic of Florence,\nwhich was reformed in the year 1502, in consequence of the affair of\nArezzo, but was ruined in 1512, in consequence of the affair of Prato.\nDesiring, therefore, to discuss the nature of the government of Rome,\nand to ascertain the accidental circumstances which brought it to its\nperfection, I say, as has been said before by many who have written of\nGovernments, that of these there are three forms, known by the names\nMonarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, and that those who give its\ninstitutions to a State have recourse to one or other of these three,\naccording as it suits their purpose. Other, and, as many have thought,\nwiser teachers, will have it, that there are altogether six forms of\ngovernment, three of them utterly bad, the other three good in\nthemselves, but so readily corrupted that they too are apt to become\nhurtful. The good are the three above named; the bad, three others\ndependent upon these, and each so like that to which it is related,\nthat it is easy to pass imperceptibly from the one to the other. For a\nMonarchy readily becomes a Tyranny, an Aristocracy an Oligarchy, while\na Democracy tends to degenerate into Anarchy. So that if the founder of\na State should establish any one of these three forms of Government, he\nestablishes it for a short time only, since no precaution he may take\ncan prevent it from sliding into its contrary, by reason of the close\nresemblance which, in this case, the virtue bears to the vice.\nThese diversities in the form of Government spring up among men by\nchance. For in the beginning of the world, its inhabitants, being few\nin number, for a time lived scattered after the fashion of beasts; but\nafterwards, as they increased and multiplied, gathered themselves into\nsocieties, and, the better to protect themselves, began to seek who\namong them was the strongest and of the highest courage, to whom,\nmaking him their head, they tendered obedience. Next arose the\nknowledge of such things as are honourable and good, as opposed to\nthose which are bad and shameful. For observing that when a man wronged\nhis benefactor, hatred was universally felt for the one and sympathy\nfor the other, and that the ungrateful were blamed, while those who\nshowed gratitude were honoured, and reflecting that the wrongs they saw\ndone to others might be done to themselves, to escape these they\nresorted to making laws and fixing punishments against any who should\ntransgress them; and in this way grew the recognition of Justice.\nWhence it came that afterwards, in choosing their rulers, men no longer\nlooked about for the strongest, but for him who was the most prudent\nand the most just.\nBut, presently, when sovereignty grew to be hereditary and no longer\nelective, hereditary sovereigns began to degenerate from their\nancestors, and, quitting worthy courses, took up the notion that\nprinces had nothing to do but to surpass the rest of the world in\nsumptuous display and wantonness, and whatever else ministers to\npleasure so that the prince coming to be hated, and therefore to feel\nfear, and passing from fear to infliction of injuries, a tyranny soon\nsprang up. Forthwith there began movements to overthrow the prince, and\nplots and conspiracies against him undertaken not by those who were\nweak, or afraid for themselves, but by such as being conspicuous for\ntheir birth, courage, wealth, and station, could not tolerate the\nshameful life of the tyrant. The multitude, following the lead of these\npowerful men, took up arms against the prince and, he being got rid of,\nobeyed these others as their liberators; who, on their part, holding in\nhatred the name of sole ruler, formed themselves into a government and\nat first, while the recollection of past tyranny was still fresh,\nobserved the laws they themselves made, and postponing personal\nadvantage to the common welfare, administered affairs both publicly and\nprivately with the utmost diligence and zeal. But this government\npassing, afterwards, to their descendants who, never having been taught\nin the school of Adversity, knew nothing of the vicissitudes of\nFortune, these not choosing to rest content with mere civil equality,\nbut abandoning themselves to avarice, ambition, and lust, converted,\nwithout respect to civil rights what had been a government of the best\ninto a government of the few; and so very soon met with the same fate\nas the tyrant.\nFor the multitude loathing its rulers, lent itself to any who ventured,\nin whatever way, to attack them; when some one man speedily arose who\nwith the aid of the people overthrew them. But the recollection of the\ntyrant and of the wrongs suffered at his hands being still fresh in the\nminds of the people, who therefore felt no desire to restore the\nmonarchy, they had recourse to a popular government, which they\nestablished on such a footing that neither king nor nobles had any\nplace in it. And because all governments inspire respect at the first,\nthis government also lasted for a while, but not for long, and seldom\nafter the generation which brought it into existence had died out. For,\nsuddenly, liberty passed into license, wherein neither private worth\nnor public authority was respected, but, every one living as he liked,\na thousand wrongs were done daily. Whereupon, whether driven by\nnecessity, or on the suggestion of some wiser man among them and to\nescape anarchy, the people reverted to a monarchy, from which, step by\nstep, in the manner and for the causes already assigned, they came\nround once more to license. For this is the circle revolving within\nwhich all States are and have been governed; although in the same State\nthe same forms of Government rarely repeat themselves, because hardly\nany State can have such vitality as to pass through such a cycle more\nthan once, and still together. For it may be expected that in some sea\nof disaster, when a State must always be wanting prudent counsels and\nin strength, it will become subject to some neighbouring and\nbetter-governed State; though assuming this not to happen, it might\nwell pass for an indefinite period from one of these forms of\ngovernment to another.\nI say, then, that all these six forms of government are pernicious\u2014the\nthree good kinds, from their brief duration the three bad, from their\ninherent badness. Wise legislators therefore, knowing these defects,\nand avoiding each of these forms in its simplicity, have made choice of\na form which shares in the qualities of all the first three, and which\nthey judge to be more stable and lasting than any of these separately.\nFor where we have a monarchy, an aristocracy, and a democracy existing\ntogether in the same city, each of the three serves as a check upon the\nother.\nAmong those who have earned special praise by devising a constitution\nof this nature, was Lycurgus, who so framed the laws of Sparta as to\nassign their proper functions to kings, nobles, and commons; and in\nthis way established a government, which, to his great glory and to the\npeace and tranquility of his country, lasted for more than eight\nhundred years. The contrary, however, happened in the case of Solon;\nwho by the turn he gave to the institutions of Athens, created there a\npurely democratic government, of such brief duration, that he himself\nlived to witness the beginning of the despotism of Pisistratus. And\nalthough, forty years later, the heirs of Pisistratus were driven out,\nand Athens recovered her freedom, nevertheless because she reverted to\nthe same form government as had been established by Solon, she could\nmaintain it for only a hundred years more; for though to preserve it,\nmany ordinances were passed for repressing the ambition of the great\nand the turbulence of the people, against which Solon had not provided,\nstill, since neither the monarchic nor the aristocratic element was\ngiven a place in her constitution, Athens, as compared with Sparta, had\nbut a short life.\nBut let us now turn to Rome, which city, although she had no Lycurgus\nto give her from the first such a constitution as would preserve her\nlong in freedom, through a series of accidents, caused by the contests\nbetween the commons and the senate, obtained by chance what the\nforesight of her founders failed to provide. So that Fortune, if she\nbestowed not her first favours on Rome, bestowed her second; because,\nalthough the original institutions of this city were defective, still\nthey lay not outside the true path which could bring them to\nperfection. For Romulus and the other kings made many and good laws,\nand such as were not incompatible with freedom; but because they sought\nto found a kingdom and not a commonwealth, when the city became free\nmany things were found wanting which in the interest of liberty it was\nnecessary to supply, since these kings had not supplied them. And\nalthough the kings of Rome lost their sovereignty, in the manner and\nfor the causes mentioned above, nevertheless those who drove them out,\nby at once creating two consuls to take their place, preserved in Rome\nthe regal authority while banishing from it the regal throne, so that\nas both senate and consuls were included in that republic, it in fact\npossessed two of the elements above enumerated, to wit, the monarchic\nand the aristocratic.\nIt then only remained to assign its place to the popular element, and\nthe Roman nobles growing insolent from causes which shall be noticed\nhereafter, the commons against them, when, not to lose the whole of\ntheir power, they were forced to concede a share to the people; while\nwith the share which remained, the senate and consuls retained so much\nauthority that they still held their own place in the republic. In this\nway the tribunes of the people came to be created, after whose creation\nthe stability of the State was much augmented, since each the three\nforms of government had now its due influence allowed it. And such was\nthe good fortune of Rome that although her government passed from the\nkings to the nobles, and from these to the people, by the steps and for\nthe reasons noticed above, still the entire authority of the kingly\nelement was not sacrificed to strengthen the authority of the nobles,\nnor were the nobles divested of their authority to bestow it on the\ncommons; but three, blending together, made up a perfect State; which\nperfection, as shall be fully shown in the next two Chapters, was\nreached through the dissensions of the commons and the senate.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014Of the Accidents which led in Rome to the creation of\nTribunes of the People; whereby the Republic was made more perfect.\nThey who lay the foundations of a State and furnish it with laws must,\nas is shown by all who have treated of civil government, and by\nexamples of which history is full, assume that \u2018all men are bad, and\nwill always, when they have free field, give loose to their evil\ninclinations; and that if these for a while remain hidden, it is owing\nto some secret cause, which, from our having no contrary experience, we\ndo not recognize at once, but which is afterwards revealed by Time, of\nwhom we speak as the father of all truth.\nIn Rome, after the expulsion of the Tarquins, it seemed as though the\nclosest union prevailed between the senate and the commons, and that\nthe nobles, laying aside their natural arrogance, had learned so to\nsympathize with the people as to have become supportable by all, even\nof the humblest rank. This dissimulation remained undetected, and its\ncauses concealed, while the Tarquins lived; for the nobles dreading the\nTarquins, and fearing that the people, if they used them ill, might\ntake part against them, treated them with kindness. But no sooner were\nthe Tarquins got rid of, and the nobles thus relieved of their fears,\nwhen they began to spit forth against the commons all the venom which\nbefore they had kept in their breasts, offending and insulting them in\nevery way they could; confirming what I have observed already, that men\nnever behave well unless compelled, and that whenever they are free to\nact as they please, and are under no restraint everything falls at once\ninto confusion and disorder. Wherefore it has been said that as poverty\nand hunger are needed to make men industrious, so laws are needed to\nmake them good. When we do well without laws, laws are not needed; but\nwhen good customs are absent, laws are at once required.\nOn the extinction of the Tarquins, therefore, the dread of whom had\nkept the nobles in check, some new safeguard had to be contrived, which\nshould effect the same result as had been effected by the Tarquins\nwhile they lived. Accordingly, after much uproar and confusion, and\nmuch danger of violence ensuing between the commons and the nobles, to\ninsure the safety of the former, tribunes were created, and were\ninvested with such station and authority as always afterwards enabled\nthem to stand between the people and the senate, and to resist the\ninsolence of the nobles.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014That the Dissensions between the Senate and Commons of\nRome, made Rome free and powerful.\nTouching those tumults which prevailed in Rome from the extinction of\nthe Tarquins to the creation of the tribunes the discussion of which I\nhave no wish to avoid, and as to certain other matters of a like\nnature, I desire to say something in opposition to the opinion of many\nwho assert that Rome was a turbulent city, and had fallen into utter\ndisorder, that had not her good fortune and military prowess made\namends for other defects, she would have been inferior to every other\nrepublic.\nI cannot indeed deny that the good fortune and the armies of Rome were\nthe causes of her empire; yet it certainly seems to me that those\nholding this opinion fail to perceive, that in a State where there are\ngood soldiers there must be good order, and, generally speaking, good\nfortune. And looking to the other circumstances of this city, I affirm\nthat those who condemn these dissensions between the nobles and the\ncommons, condemn what was the prime cause of Rome becoming free; and\ngive more heed to the tumult and uproar wherewith these dissensions\nwere attended, than to the good results which followed from them; not\nreflecting that while in every republic there are two conflicting\nfactions, that of the people and that of the nobles, it is in this\nconflict that all laws favourable to freedom have their origin, as may\nreadily be seen to have been the case in Rome. For from the time of the\nTarquins to that of the Gracchi, a period of over three hundred years,\nthe tumults in Rome seldom gave occasion to punishment by exile, and\nvery seldom to bloodshed. So that we cannot truly declare those tumults\nto have been disastrous, or that republic to have been disorderly,\nwhich during all that time, on account of her internal broils, banished\nno more than eight or ten of her citizens, put very few to death, and\nrarely inflicted money penalties. Nor can we reasonably pronounce that\ncity ill-governed wherein we find so many instances of virtue; for\nvirtuous actions have their origin in right training, right training in\nwise laws, and wise laws in these very tumults which many would\nthoughtlessly condemn. For he who looks well to the results of these\ntumults will find that they did not lead to banishments, nor to\nviolence hurtful to the common good, but to laws and ordinances\nbeneficial to the public liberty. And should any object that the\nbehaviour of the Romans was extravagant and outrageous; that for the\nassembled people to be heard shouting against the senate, the senate\nagainst the people; for the whole commons to be seen rushing wildly\nthrough the streets, closing their shops, and quitting the town, were\nthings which might well affright him even who only reads of them; it\nmay be answered, that the inhabitants of all cities, more especially of\ncities which seek to make use of the people in matters of importance,\nhave their own ways of giving expression to their wishes; among which\nthe city of Rome had the custom, that when its people sought to have a\nlaw passed they followed one or another of those courses mentioned\nabove, or else refused to be enrolled as soldiers when, to pacify them,\nsomething of their demands had to be conceded. But the demands of a\nfree people are hurtful to freedom, since they originate either in\nbeing oppressed, or in the fear that they are about to be so. When this\nfear is groundless, it finds its remedy in public meetings, wherein\nsome worthy person may come forward and show the people by argument\nthat they are deceiving themselves. For though they be ignorant, the\npeople are not therefore, as Cicero says, incapable of being taught the\ntruth, but are readily convinced when it is told them by one in whose\nhonesty they can trust.\nWe should, therefore, be careful how we censure the government of Rome,\nand should reflect that all the great results effected by that\nrepublic, could not have come about without good cause. And if the\npopular tumults led the creation of the tribunes, they merit all\npraise; since these magistrates not only gave its due influence to the\npopular voice in the government, but also acted as the guardians of\nRoman freedom, as shall be clearly shown in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\u2014_Whether the Guardianship of public Freedom is safer in the\nhands of the Commons or of the Nobles; and whether those who seek to\nacquire Power or they who seek to maintain it are the greater cause of\nCommotions._\nOf the provisions made by wise founders of republics, one of the most\nnecessary is for the creation of a guardianship of liberty; for\naccording as this is placed in good or bad hands, the freedom of the\nState will be more or less lasting. And because in every republic we\nfind the two parties of nobles and commons, the question arises, to\nwhich of these two this guardianship can most safely be entrusted.\nAmong the Laced\u00e6monians of old, as now with the Venetians, it was\nplaced in the hands of the nobles, but with the Romans it was vested in\nthe commons. We have, therefore, to determine which of these States\nmade the wiser choice. If we look to reasons, something is to be said\non both sides of the question; though were we to look to results, we\nshould have to pronounce in favour of the nobles, inasmuch as the\nliberty of Sparta and Venice has had a longer life than that of Rome.\nAs touching reasons, it may be pleaded for the Roman method, that they\nare most fit to have charge of a thing, who least desire to pervert it\nto their own ends. And, doubtless, if we examine the aims which the\nnobles and the commons respectively set before them, we shall find in\nthe former a great desire to dominate, in the latter merely a desire\nnot to be dominated over, and hence a greater attachment to freedom,\nsince they have less to gain than the others by destroying it.\nWherefore, when the commons are put forward as the defenders of\nliberty, they may be expected to take better care of it, and, as they\nhave no desire to tamper with it themselves, to be less apt to suffer\nothers to do so.\nOn the other hand, he who defends the method followed by the Spartans\nand Venetians, may urge, that by confiding this guardianship to the\nnobles, two desirable ends are served: first, that from being allowed\nto retain in their own hands a weapon which makes them the stronger\nparty in the State, the ambition of this class is more fully satisfied;\nand, second, that an authority is withdrawn from the unstable multitude\nwhich as used by them is likely to lead to endless disputes and\ntumults, and to drive the nobles into dangerous and desperate courses.\nIn instance whereof might be cited the case of Rome itself, wherein the\ntribunes of the people being vested with this authority, not content to\nhave one consul a plebeian, insisted on having both; and afterwards\nlaid claim to the censorship, the pr\u00e6torship and all the other\nmagistracies in the city. Nor was this enough for them, but, carried\naway by the same factious spirit, they began after a time to pay court\nto such men as they thought able to attack the nobility, and so gave\noccasion to the rise of Marius and the overthrow of Rome.\nWherefore one who weighs both sides of the question well, might\nhesitate which party he should choose as the guardian of public\nliberty, being uncertain which class is more mischievous in a\ncommonwealth, that which would acquire what it has not, or that which\nwould keep the authority which it has already. But, on the whole, on a\ncareful balance of arguments we may sum up thus:\u2014Either we have to deal\nwith a republic eager like Rome to extend its power, or with one\ncontent merely to maintain itself; in the former case it is necessary\nto do in all things as Rome did; in the latter, for the reasons and in\nthe manner to be shown in the following Chapter, we may imitate Venice\nand Sparta.\nBut reverting to the question which class of citizens is more\nmischievous in a republic, those who seek to acquire or those who fear\nto lose what they have acquired already, I note that when Marcus\nMenenius and Marcus Fulvius, both of them men of plebeian birth, were\nmade the one dictator, the other master of the knights, that they might\ninquire into certain plots against Rome contrived in Capua, they had at\nthe same time authority given them by the people to investigate\nwhether, in Rome itself, irregular and corrupt practices had been used\nto obtain the consulship and other honours of the city. The nobles\nsuspecting that the powers thus conferred were to be turned against\nthem, everywhere gave out that if honours had been sought by any by\nirregular and unworthy means, it was not by them, but by the plebeians,\nwho, with neither birth nor merit to recommend them, had need to resort\nto corruption. And more particularly they accused the dictator himself.\nAnd so telling was the effect of these charges, that Menenius, after\nharanguing the people and complaining to them of the calumnies\ncirculated against him, laid down his dictatorship, and submitted\nhimself to whatever judgment might be passed upon him. When his cause\ncame to be tried he was acquitted; but at the hearing it was much\ndebated, whether he who would retain power or he who would acquire it,\nis the more dangerous citizen; the desires of both being likely to lead\nto the greatest disorders.\nNevertheless, I believe that, as a rule, disorders are more commonly\noccasioned by those seeking to preserve power, because in them the fear\nof loss breeds the same passions as are felt by those seeking to\nacquire; since men never think they hold what they have securely,\nunless when they are gaining something new from others. It is also to\nbe said that their position enables them to operate changes with less\neffort and greater efficacy. Further, it may be added, that their\ncorrupt and insolent behaviour inflames the minds of those who have\nnothing, with the desire to have; either for the sake of punishing\ntheir adversaries by despoiling them, or to obtain for themselves a\nshare of those riches and honours which they see the others abuse.\nCHAPTER VI.\u2014_Whether it was possible in Rome to contrive such a\nGovernment as would have composed the Differences between the Commons\nand the Senate._\nI have spoken above of the effects produced in Rome by the\ncontroversies between the commons and the senate. Now, as these lasted\ndown to the time of the Gracchi, when they brought about the overthrow\nof freedom, some may think it matter for regret that Rome should not\nhave achieved the great things she did, without being torn by such\ndisputes. Wherefore, it seems to me worth while to consider whether the\ngovernment of Rome could ever have been constituted in such a way as to\nprevent like controversies.\nIn making this inquiry we must first look to those republics which have\nenjoyed freedom for a great while, undisturbed by any violent\ncontentions or tumults, and see what their government was, and whether\nit would have been possible to introduce it into Rome. Of such\nrepublics we have an example in ancient times in Sparta, in modern\ntimes in Venice, of both which States I have already made mention.\nSparta created for herself a government consisting of a king and a\nlimited senate. Venice has made no distinction in the titles of her\nrulers, all qualified to take part in her government being classed\nunder the one designation of \u201cGentlemen,\u201d an arrangement due rather to\nchance than to the foresight of those who gave this State its\nconstitution. For many persons, from causes already noticed, seeking\nshelter on these rocks on which Venice now stands, after they had so\nmultiplied that if they were to continue to live together it became\nnecessary for them to frame laws, established a form of government; and\nassembling often in their councils to consult for the interests of\ntheir city, when it seemed to them that their numbers were sufficient\nfor political existence, they closed the entrance to civil rights\nagainst all who came afterwards to live there, not allowing them to\ntake any part in the management of affairs. And when in course of time\nthere came to be many citizens excluded from the government, to add to\nthe importance of the governing body, they named these \u201cGentlemen\u201d\n(_gentiluomini_), the others \u201cPlebeians\u201d (_popolani_). And this\ndistinction could grow up and maintain itself without causing\ndisturbance; for as at the time of its origin, whosoever then lived in\nVenice was made one of the governing body, none had reason to complain;\nwhile those who came to live there afterwards, finding the government\nin a completed form, had neither ground nor opportunity to object. No\nground, because nothing was taken from them; and no opportunity,\nbecause those in authority kept them under control, and never employed\nthem in affairs in which they could acquire importance. Besides which,\nthey who came later to dwell in Venice were not so numerous as to\ndestroy all proportion between the governors and the governed; the\nnumber of the \u201cGentlemen\u201d being as great as, or greater than that of\nthe \u201cPlebeians.\u201d For these reasons, therefore, it was possible for\nVenice to make her constitution what it is, and to maintain it without\ndivisions.\nSparta, again, being governed, as I have said, by a king and a limited\nsenate, was able to maintain herself for the long period she did,\nbecause, from the country being thinly inhabited and further influx of\npopulation forbidden, and from the laws of Lycurgus (the observance\nwhereof removed all ground of disturbance) being held in high esteem,\nthe citizens were able to continue long in unity. For Lycurgus having\nby his laws established in Sparta great equality as to property, but\nless equality as to rank, there prevailed there an equal poverty; and\nthe commons were less ambitious, because the offices of the State,\nwhich were held to their exclusion, were confined to a few; and because\nthe nobles never by harsh treatment aroused in them any desire to usurp\nthese offices. And this was due to the Spartan kings, who, being\nappointed to that dignity for life, and placed in the midst of this\nnobility, had no stronger support to their authority than in defending\nthe people against injustice. Whence it resulted that as the people\nneither feared nor coveted the power which they did not possess, the\nconflicts which might have arisen between them and the nobles were\nescaped, together with the causes which would have led to them; and in\nthis way they were able to live long united. But of this unity in\nSparta there were two chief causes: one, the fewness of its\ninhabitants, which allowed of their being governed by a few; the other,\nthat by denying foreigners admission into their country, the people had\nless occasion to become corrupted, and never so increased in numbers as\nto prove troublesome to their few rulers.\nWeighing all which circumstances, we see that to have kept Rome in the\nsame tranquility wherein these republics were kept, one of two courses\nmust have been followed by her legislators; for either, like the\nVenetians, they must have refrained from employing the commons in war,\nor else, like the Spartans, they must have closed their country to\nforeigners. Whereas, in both particulars, they did the opposite, arming\nthe commons and increasing their number, and thus affording endless\noccasions for disorder. And had the Roman commonwealth grown to be more\ntranquil, this inconvenience would have resulted, that it must at the\nsame time have grown weaker, since the road would have been closed to\nthat greatness to which it came, for in removing the causes of her\ntumults, Rome must have interfered with the causes of her growth.\nAnd he who looks carefully into the matter will find, that in all human\naffairs, we cannot rid ourselves of one inconvenience without running\ninto another. So that if you would have your people numerous and\nwarlike, to the end that with their aid you may establish a great\nempire, you will have them of such a sort as you cannot afterwards\ncontrol at your pleasure; while should you keep them few and unwarlike,\nto the end that you may govern them easily, you will be unable, should\nyou extend your dominions, to preserve them, and will become so\ncontemptible as to be the prey of any who attack you. For which reason\nin all our deliberations we ought to consider where we are likely to\nencounter least inconvenience, and accept that as the course to be\npreferred, since we shall never find any line of action entirely free\nfrom disadvantage.\nRome might, therefore, following the example of Sparta, have created a\nking for life and a senate of limited numbers, but desiring to become a\ngreat empire, she could not, like Sparta, have restricted the number of\nher citizens. So that to have created a king for life and a limited\nsenate had been of little service to her.\nWere any one, therefore, about to found a wholly new republic, he would\nhave to consider whether he desired it to increase as Rome did in\nterritory and dominion, or to continue within narrow limits. In the\nformer case he would have to shape its constitution as nearly as\npossible on the pattern of the Roman, leaving room for dissensions and\npopular tumults, for without a great and warlike population no republic\ncan ever increase, or increasing maintain itself. In the second case he\nmight give his republic a constitution like that of Venice or Sparta;\nbut since extension is the ruin of such republics, the legislator would\nhave to provide in every possible way against the State which he had\nfounded making any additions to its territories. For these, when\nsuperimposed upon a feeble republic, are sure to be fatal to it: as we\nsee to have been the case with Sparta and Venice, the former of which,\nafter subjugating nearly all Greece, on sustaining a trifling reverse,\nbetrayed the insufficiency of her foundations, for when, after the\nrevolt of Thebes under Pelopidas, other cities also rebelled, the\nSpartan kingdom was utterly overthrown. Venice in like manner, after\ngaining possession of a great portion of Italy (most of it not by her\narms but by her wealth and subtlety), when her strength was put to the\nproof, lost all in one pitched battle.\nI can well believe, then, that to found a republic which shall long\nendure, the best plan may be to give it internal institutions like\nthose of Sparta or Venice; placing it in a naturally strong situation,\nand so fortifying it that none can expect to get the better of it\neasily, yet, at the same time, not making it so great as to be\nformidable to its neighbours; since by taking these precautions, it\nmight long enjoy its independence. For there are two causes which lead\nto wars being made against a republic; one, your desire to be its\nmaster, the other the fear lest it should master you; both of which\ndangers the precaution indicated will go far to remove. For if, as we\nare to assume, this republic be well prepared for defence, and\nconsequently difficult of attack, it will seldom or never happen that\nany one will form the design to attack it, and while it keeps within\nits own boundaries, and is seen from experience not to be influenced by\nambition, no one will be led, out of fear for himself, to make war upon\nit, more particularly when its laws and constitution forbid its\nextension. And were it possible to maintain things in this equilibrium,\nI veritably believe that herein would be found the true form of\npolitical life, and the true tranquility of a republic. But all human\naffairs being in movement, and incapable of remaining as they are, they\nmust either rise or fall; and to many conclusions to which we are not\nled by reason, we are brought by necessity. So that when we have given\ninstitutions to a State on the footing that it is to maintain itself\nwithout enlargement, should necessity require its enlargement, its\nfoundations will be cut from below it, and its downfall quickly ensue.\nOn the other hand, were a republic so favoured by Heaven as to lie\nunder no necessity of making war, the result of this ease would be to\nmake it effeminate and divided which two evils together, and each by\nitself, would insure its ruin. And since it is impossible, as I\nbelieve, to bring about an equilibrium, or to adhere strictly to the\nmean path, we must, in arranging our republic, consider what is the\nmore honourable course for it to take, and so contrive that even if\nnecessity compel its enlargement, it may be able to keep what it gains.\nBut returning to the point first raised, I believe it necessary for us\nto follow the method of the Romans and not that of the other republics,\nfor I know of no middle way. We must, consequently, put up with those\ndissensions which arise between commons and senate, looking on them as\nevils which cannot be escaped if we would arrive at the greatness of\nRome.\nIn connection with the arguments here used to prove that the authority\nof the tribunes was essential in Rome to the guardianship of freedom,\nwe may naturally go on to show what advantages result to a republic\nfrom the power of impeachment; which, together with others, was\nconferred upon the tribunes; a subject to be noticed in the following\nChapter.\nCHAPTER VII.\u2014_That to preserve Liberty in a State there must exist the\nRight to accuse._\nTo those set forward in a commonwealth as guardians of public freedom,\nno more useful or necessary authority can be given than the power to\naccuse, either before the people, or before some council or tribunal,\nthose citizens who in any way have offended against the liberty of\ntheir country.\nA law of this kind has two effects most beneficial to a State: _first,_\nthat the citizens from fear of being accused, do not engage in attempts\nhurtful to the State, or doing so, are put down at once and without\nrespect of persons: and _next,_ that a vent is given for the escape of\nall those evil humours which, from whatever cause, gather in cities\nagainst particular citizens; for unless an outlet be duly provided for\nthese by the laws, they flow into irregular channels and overwhelm the\nState. There is nothing, therefore, which contributes so much to the\nstability and permanence of a State, as to take care that the\nfermentation of these disturbing humours be supplied by operation of\nlaw with a recognized outlet. This might be shown by many examples, but\nby none so clearly as by that of Coriolanus related by Livius, where he\ntells us, that at a time when the Roman nobles were angry with the\nplebeians (thinking that the appointment of tribunes for their\nprotection had made them too powerful), it happened that Rome was\nvisited by a grievous famine, to meet which the senate sent to Sicily\nfor corn. But Coriolanus, hating the commons, sought to persuade the\nsenate that now was the time to punish them, and to deprive them of the\nauthority which they had usurped to the prejudice of the nobles, by\nwithholding the distribution of corn, and so suffering them to perish\nof hunger. Which advice of his coming to the ears of the people,\nkindled them to such fury against him, that they would have slain him\nas he left the Senate House, had not the tribunes cited him to appear\nand answer before them to a formal charge.\nIn respect of this incident I repeat what I have just now said, how\nuseful and necessary it is for republics to provide by their laws a\nchannel by which the displeasure of the multitude against a single\ncitizen may find a vent. For when none such is regularly provided,\nrecourse will be had to irregular channels, and these will assuredly\nlead to much worse results. For when a citizen is borne down by the\noperation of the ordinary laws, even though he be wronged, little or no\ndisturbance is occasioned to the state: the injury he suffers not being\nwrought by private violence, nor by foreign force, which are the causes\nof the overthrow of free institutions, but by public authority and in\naccordance with public ordinances, which, having definite limits set\nthem, are not likely to pass beyond these so as to endanger the\ncommonwealth. For proof of which I am content to rest on this old\nexample of Coriolanus, since all may see what a disaster it would have\nbeen for Rome had he been violently put to death by the people. For, as\nbetween citizen and citizen, a wrong would have been done affording\nground for fear, fear would have sought defence, defence have led to\nfaction, faction to divisions in the State, and these to its ruin. But\nthe matter being taken up by those whose office it was to deal with it,\nall the evils which must have followed had it been left in private\nhands were escaped.\nIn Florence, on the other hand, and in our own days, we have seen what\nviolent commotions follow when the people cannot show their displeasure\nagainst particular citizens in a form recognized by the laws, in the\ninstance of Francesco Valori, at one time looked upon as the foremost\ncitizen of our republic. But many thinking him ambitious, and likely\nfrom his high spirit and daring to overstep the limits of civil\nfreedom, and there being no way to oppose him save by setting up an\nadverse faction, the result was, that, apprehending irregular attacks,\nhe sought to gain partisans for his support; while his opponents, on\ntheir side, having no course open to them of which the laws approved,\nresorted to courses of which the laws did not approve, and, at last, to\nopen violence. And as his influence had to be attacked by unlawful\nmethods, these were attended by injury not to him only, but to many\nother noble citizens; whereas, could he have been met by constitutional\nrestraints, his power might have been broken without injury to any save\nhimself. I might also cite from our Florentine history the fall of\nPiero Soderini, which had no other cause than there not being in our\nrepublic any law under which powerful and ambitious citizens can be\nimpeached. For to form a tribunal by which a powerful citizen is to be\ntried, eight judges only are not enough; the judges must be numerous,\nbecause a few will always do the will of a few. But had there been\nproper methods for obtaining redress, either the people would have\nimpeached Piero if he was guilty, and thus have given vent to their\ndispleasure without calling in the Spanish army; or if he was innocent,\nwould not have ventured, through fear of being accused themselves, to\nhave taken proceedings against him. So that in either case the bitter\nspirit which was the cause of all the disorder would have had an end.\nWherefore, when we find one of the parties in a State calling in a\nforeign power, we may safely conclude that it is because the defective\nlaws of that State provide no escape for those malignant humours which\nare natural to men; which can best be done by arranging for an\nimpeachment before a sufficient number of judges, and by giving\ncountenance to this procedure. This was so well contrived in Rome that\nin spite of the perpetual struggle maintained between the commons and\nthe senate, neither the senate nor the commons, nor any single citizen,\never sought redress at the hands of a foreign power; for having a\nremedy at home, there was no need to seek one abroad.\nAlthough the examples above cited be proof sufficient of what I affirm,\nI desire to adduce one other, recorded by Titus Livius in his history,\nwhere he relates that a sister of Aruns having been violated by a\nLucumo of Clusium, the chief of the Etruscan towns, Aruns being unable,\nfrom the interest of her ravisher, to avenge her, betook himself to the\nGauls who ruled in the province we now name Lombardy, and besought them\nto come with an armed force to Clusium; showing them how with advantage\nto themselves they might avenge his wrongs. Now, had Aruns seen that he\ncould have had redress through the laws of his country, he never would\nhave resorted to these Barbarians for help.\nBut as the right to accuse is beneficial in a republic, so calumny, on\nthe other hand, is useless and hurtful, as in the following Chapter I\nshall proceed to show.\nCHAPTER VIII.\u2014_That Calumny is as hurtful in a Commonwealth as the\npower to accuse is useful._\nSuch were the services rendered to Rome by Furius Camillus in rescuing\nher from the oppression of the Gauls, that no Roman, however high his\ndegree or station, held it derogatory to yield place to him, save only\nManlius Capitolinus, who could not brook such glory and distinction\nbeing given to another. For he thought that in saving the Capitol, he\nhad himself done as much as Camillus to preserve Rome, and that in\nrespect of his other warlike achievements he was no whit behind him. So\nthat, bursting with jealousy, and unable to remain at rest by reason of\nthe other\u2019s renown, and seeing no way to sow discord among the Fathers,\nhe set himself to spread abroad sinister reports among the commons;\nthrowing out, among other charges, that the treasure collected to be\ngiven to the Gauls, but which, afterwards, was withheld, had been\nembezzled by certain citizens, and if recovered might be turned to\npublic uses in relieving the people from taxes or from private debts.\nThese assertions so prevailed with the commons that they began to hold\nmeetings and to raise what tumults they liked throughout the city. But\nthis displeasing the senate, and the matter appearing to them grave and\ndangerous, they appointed a dictator to inquire into it, and to\nrestrain the attacks of Manlius. The dictator, forthwith, caused\nManlius to be cited before him; and these two were thus brought face to\nface in the presence of the whole city, the dictator surrounded by the\nnobles, and Manlius by the commons. The latter, being desired to say\nwith whom the treasure of which he had spoken was to be found, since\nthe senate were as anxious to know this as the commons, made no direct\nreply, but answered evasively that it was needless to tell them what\nthey already knew. Whereupon the dictator ordered him to prison.\nIn this passage we are taught how hateful a thing is calumny in all\nfree States, as, indeed, in every society, and how we must neglect no\nmeans which may serve to check it. And there can be no more effectual\nmeans for checking calumny than by affording ample facilities for\nimpeachment, which is as useful in a commonwealth as the other is\npernicious. And between them there is this difference, that calumny\nneeds neither witness, nor circumstantial proof to establish it, so\nthat any man may be calumniated by any other; but not impeached; since\nimpeachment demands that there be substantive charges made, and\ntrustworthy evidence to support them. Again, it is before the\nmagistrates, the people, or the courts of justice that men are\nimpeached; but in the streets and market places that they are\ncalumniated. Calumny, therefore, is most rife in that State wherein\nimpeachment is least practised, and the laws least favour it. For which\nreasons the legislator should so shape the laws of his State that it\nshall be possible therein to impeach any of its citizens without fear\nor favour; and, after duly providing for this, should visit\ncalumniators with the sharpest punishments. Those punished will have no\ncause to complain, since it was in their power to have impeached openly\nwhere they have secretly calumniated. Where this is not seen to, grave\ndisorders will always ensue. For calumnies sting without disabling; and\nthose who are stung being more moved by hatred of their detractors than\nby fear of the things they say against them, seek revenge.\nThis matter, as we have said, was well arranged for in Rome, but has\nalways been badly regulated in our city of Florence. And as the Roman\nordinances with regard to it were productive of much good, so the want\nof them in Florence has bred much mischief. For any one reading the\nhistory of our city may perceive, how many calumnies have at all times\nbeen aimed against those of its citizens who have taken a leading part\nin its affairs. Thus, of one it would be said that he had plundered the\npublic treasury, of another, that he had failed in some enterprise\nbecause he had been bribed; of a third, that this or the other disaster\nhad originated in his ambition. Hence hatred sprung up on every side,\nand hatred growing to division, these led to factions, and these again\nto ruin. But had there existed in Florence some procedure whereby\ncitizens might have been impeached, and calumniators punished,\nnumberless disorders which have taken there would have been prevented.\nFor citizens who were impeached, whether condemned or acquitted, would\nhave had no power to injure the State; and they would have been\nimpeached far seldomer than they have been calumniated; for calumny, as\nI have said already, is an easier matter than impeachment.\nSome, indeed, have made use of calumny as a means for raising\nthemselves to power, and have found their advantage in traducing\neminent citizens who withstood their designs; for by taking the part of\nthe people, and confirming them in their ill-opinion of these great\nmen, they made them their friends. Of this, though I could give many\ninstances, I shall content myself with one. At the siege of Lucca the\nFlorentine army was commanded by Messer Giovanni Guicciardini, as its\ncommissary, through whose bad generalship or ill-fortune the town was\nnot taken. But whatever the cause of this failure, Messer Giovanni had\nthe blame; and the rumour ran that he had been bribed by the people of\nLucca. Which calumny being fostered by his enemies, brought Messer\nGiovanni to very verge of despair; and though to clear himself he would\nwillingly have given himself up to the Captain of Justice he found he\ncould not, there being no provision in the laws of the republic which\nallowed of his doing so. Hence arose the bitterest hostility between\nthe friends of Messer Giovanni, who were mostly of the old nobility\n(_grandi_), and those who sought to reform the government of Florence;\nand from this and the like causes, the affair grew to such dimensions\nas to bring about the downfall of our republic.\nManlius Capitolinus, then, was a calumniator, not an accuser; and in\ntheir treatment of him the Romans showed how calumniators should be\ndealt with; by which I mean, that they should be forced to become\naccusers; and if their accusation be proved true, should be rewarded,\nor at least not punished, but if proved false should be punished as\nManlius was.\nCHAPTER IX.\u2014_That to give new Institutions to a Commonwealth, or to\nreconstruct old Institutions on an entirely new basis, must be the work\nof one Man_.\nIt may perhaps be thought that I should not have got so far into the\nhistory of Rome, without some mention of those who gave that city its\ninstitutions, and saying something of these institutions themselves, so\nfar as they relate to religion and war. As I have no wish to keep those\nwho would know my views on these matters in suspense, I say at once,\nthat to many it might seem of evil omen that the founder of a civil\ngovernment like Romulus, should first have slain his brother, and\nafterwards have consented to the death of Titus Tatius the Sabine, whom\nhe had chosen to be his colleague in the kingship; since his\ncountrymen, if moved by ambition and lust of power to inflict like\ninjuries on any who opposed their designs, might plead the example of\ntheir prince. This view would be a reasonable one were we to disregard\nthe object which led Romulus to put those men to death. But we must\ntake it as a rule to which there are very few if any exceptions, that\nno commonwealth or kingdom ever has salutary institutions given it from\nthe first or has its institutions recast in an entirely new mould,\nunless by a single person. On the contrary, it must be from one man\nthat it receives its institutions at first, and upon one man that all\nsimilar reconstruction must depend. For this reason the wise founder of\na commonwealth who seeks to benefit not himself only, or the line of\nhis descendants, but his State and country, must endeavour to acquire\nan absolute and undivided authority. And none who is wise will ever\nblame any action, however extraordinary and irregular, which serves to\nlay the foundation of a kingdom or to establish a republic. For\nalthough the act condemn the doer, the end may justify him; and when,\nas in the case of Romulus, the end is good, it will always excuse the\nmeans; since it is he who does violence with intent to injure, not he\nwho does it with the design to secure tranquility, who merits blame.\nSuch a person ought however to be so prudent and moderate as to avoid\ntransmitting the absolute authority he acquires, as an inheritance to\nanother; for as men are, by nature, more prone to evil than to good, a\nsuccessor may turn to ambitious ends the power which his predecessor\nhas used to promote worthy ends. Moreover, though it be one man that\nmust give a State its institutions, once given they are not so likely\nto last long resting for support on the shoulders of one man only, as\nwhen entrusted to the care of many, and when it is the business of many\nto maintain them. For though the multitude be unfit to set a State in\norder, since they cannot, by reason of the divisions which prevail\namong them, agree wherein the true well-being of the State lies, yet\nwhen they have once been taught the truth, they never will consent to\nabandon it. And that Romulus, though he put his brother to death, is\nyet of those who are to be pardoned, since what he did was done for the\ncommon good and not from personal ambition, is shown by his at once\ncreating a senate, with whom he took counsel, and in accordance with\nwhose voice he determined. And whosoever shall well examine the\nauthority which Romulus reserved to himself, will find that he reserved\nnothing beyond the command of the army when war was resolved on, and\nthe right to assemble the senate. This is seen later, on Rome becoming\nfree by the expulsion of the Tarquins, when the Romans altered none of\ntheir ancient institutions save in appointing two consuls for a year\ninstead of a king for life; for this proves that all the original\ninstitutions of that city were more in conformity with a free and\nconstitutional government, than with an absolute and despotic one.\nIn support of what has been said above, I might cite innumerable\ninstances, as of Moses, Lycurgus, Solon, and other founders of kingdoms\nand commonwealths, who, from the full powers given them, were enabled\nto shape their laws to the public advantage; but passing over these\nexamples, as of common notoriety, I take one, not indeed so famous, but\nwhich merits the attention of all who desire to frame wise laws. Agis,\nKing of Sparta, desiring to bring back his countrymen to those limits\nwithin which the laws of Lycurgus had held them, because he thought\nthat, from having somewhat deviated from them, his city had lost much\nof its ancient virtue and, consequently much of its strength and power,\nwas, at the very outset of his attempts, slain by the Spartan Ephori,\nas one who sought to make himself a tyrant. But Cleomenes coming after\nhim in the kingdom, and, on reading the notes and writings which he\nfound of Agis wherein his designs and intentions were explained, being\nstirred by the same desire, perceived that he could not confer this\nbenefit on his country unless he obtained sole power. For he saw that\nthe ambition of others made it impossible for him to do what was useful\nfor many against the will of a few. Wherefore, finding fit occasion, he\ncaused the Ephori and all others likely to throw obstacles in his way,\nto be put to death; after which, he completely renewed the laws of\nLycurgus. And the result of his measures would have been to give fresh\nlife to Sparta, and to gain for himself a renown not inferior to that\nof Lycurgus, had it not been for the power of the Macedonians and the\nweakness of the other Greek States. For while engaged with these\nreforms, he was attacked by the Macedonians, and being by himself no\nmatch for them, and having none to whom he could turn for help, he was\noverpowered; and his plans, though wise and praiseworthy, were never\nbrought to perfection.\nAll which circumstances considered, I conclude that he who gives new\ninstitutions to a State must stand alone; and that for the deaths of\nRemus and Tatius, Romulus is to be excused rather than blamed.\nCHAPTER X.\u2014_That in proportion as the Founder of a Kingdom or\nCommonwealth merits Praise, he who founds a Tyranny deserves Blame._\nOf all who are praised they are praised the most, who are the authors\nand founders of religions. After whom come the founders of kingdoms and\ncommonwealths. Next to these, they have the greatest name who as\ncommanders of armies have added to their own dominions or those of\ntheir country. After these, again, are ranked men of letters, who being\nof various shades of merit are celebrated each in his degree. To all\nothers, whose number is infinite, is ascribed that measure of praise to\nwhich his profession or occupation entitles him. And, conversely, all\nwho contribute to the overthrow of religion, or to the ruin of kingdoms\nand commonwealths, all who are foes to letters and to the arts which\nconfer honour and benefit on the human race (among whom I reckon the\nimpious, the cruel, the ignorant, the indolent, the base and the\nworthless), are held in infamy and detestation.\nNo one, whether he be wise or foolish, bad or good, if asked to choose\nbetween these two kinds of men, will ever be found to withhold praise\nfrom what deserves praise, or blame from what is to be blamed. And yet\nalmost all, deceived by a false good and a false glory, allow\nthemselves either ignorantly or wilfully to follow in the footsteps\nsuch as deserve blame rather than praise; and, have it in their power\nto establish, to their lasting renown, a commonwealth or kingdom, turn\naside to create a tyranny without a thought how much they thereby lose\nin name, fame, security, tranquility, and peace of mind; and into how\nmuch infamy, scorn, danger, and disquiet they run. But were they to\nread history, and turn to profit the lessons of the past, it seems\nimpossible that those living in a republic as private citizens, should\nnot prefer, in their native city, to play the part of Scipio rather of\nC\u00e6sar; or that those who by good fortune or merit have risen to be\nrulers, should not seek rather to resemble Agesilaus, Timoleon, and\nDion, than to Nabis, Phalaris and Dionysius; since they would see how\nthe latter are loaded with infamy, while the former have been extolled\nbeyond bounds. They would see, too, how Timoleon and others like him,\nhad as great authority in their country as Dionysius or Phalaris in\ntheirs, while enjoying far greater security. Nor let any one finding\nC\u00e6sar celebrated by a crowd of writers, be misled by his glory; for\nthose who praise him have been corrupted by his good fortune, and\noverawed by the greatness of that empire which, being governed in his\nname, would not suffer any to speak their minds openly concerning him.\nBut let him who desires to know how historians would have written of\nC\u00e6sar had they been free to declare their thoughts mark what they say\nof Catiline, than whom C\u00e6sar is more hateful, in proportion as he who\ndoes is more to be condemned than he who only desires to do evil. Let\nhim see also what praises they lavish upon Brutus, because being\nunable, out of respect for his power, to reproach C\u00e6sar, they magnify\nhis enemy. And if he who has become prince in any State will but\nreflect, how, after Rome was made an empire, far greater praise was\nearned those emperors who lived within the laws, and worthily, than by\nthose who lived in the contrary way, he will see that Titus, Nerva,\nTrajan, Hadrian, Antoninus and Marcus had no need of pr\u00e6torian cohorts,\nor of countless legions to guard them, but were defended by their own\ngood lives, the good-will of their subjects, and the attachment of the\nsenate. In like manner he will perceive in the case of Caligula, Nero,\nVitellius, and ever so many more of those evil emperors, that all the\narmies of the east and of the west were of no avail to protect them\nfrom the enemies whom their bad and depraved lives raised up against\nthem. And were the history of these emperors rightly studied, it would\nbe a sufficient lesson to any prince how to distinguish the paths which\nlead to honour and safety from those which end in shame and insecurity.\nFor of the twenty-six emperors from C\u00e6sar to Maximinus, sixteen came to\na violent, ten only to a natural death; and though one or two of those\nwho died by violence may have been good princes, as Galba or Pertinax,\nthey met their fate in consequence of that corruption which their\npredecessors had left behind in the army. And if among those who died a\nnatural death, there be found some bad emperors, like Severus, it is to\nbe ascribed to their signal good fortune and to their great abilities,\nadvantages seldom found united in the same man. From the study of this\nhistory we may also learn how a good government is to be established;\nfor while all the emperors who succeeded to the throne by birth, except\nTitus, were bad, all were good who succeeded by adoption; as in the\ncase of the five from Nerva to Marcus. But so soon as the empire fell\nonce more to the heirs by birth, its ruin recommenced.\nLet a prince therefore look to that period which extends from Nerva to\nMarcus, and contrast it with that which went before and that which came\nafter, and then let him say in which of them he would wish to have been\nborn or to have reigned. For during these times in which good men\ngoverned, he will see the prince secure in the midst of happy subjects,\nand the whole world filled with peace and justice. He will find the\nsenate maintaining its authority, the magistrates enjoying their\nhonours, rich citizens their wealth, rank and merit held in respect,\nease and content everywhere prevailing, rancour, licence, corruption\nand ambition everywhere quenched, and that golden age restored in which\nevery one might hold and support what opinions he pleased. He will see,\nin short, the world triumphing, the sovereign honoured and revered, the\npeople animated with love, and rejoicing in their security. But should\nhe turn to examine the times of the other emperors, he will find them\nwasted by battles, torn by seditions, cruel alike in war and peace;\nmany princes perishing by the sword; many wars foreign and domestic;\nItaly overwhelmed with unheard-of disasters; her towns destroyed and\nplundered; Rome burned; the Capitol razed to the ground by Roman\ncitizens; the ancient temples desolated; the ceremonies of religion\ncorrupted; the cities rank with adultery; the seas covered with exiles\nand the islands polluted with blood. He will see outrage follow\noutrage; rank, riches, honours, and, above all, virtue imputed as\nmortal crimes; informers rewarded; slaves bribed to betray their\nmasters, freedmen their patrons, and those who were without enemies\nbrought to destruction by their friends; and then he will know the true\nnature of the debt which Rome, Italy, and the world owe to C\u00e6sar; and\nif he possess a spark of human feeling, will turn from the example of\nthose evil times, and kindle with a consuming passion to imitate those\nwhich were good.\nAnd in truth the prince who seeks for worldly glory should desire to be\nthe ruler of a corrupt city; not that, like C\u00e6sar, he may destroy it,\nbut that, like Romulus, he may restore it; since man cannot hope for,\nnor Heaven offer any better opportunity of fame. Were it indeed\nnecessary in giving a constitution to a State to forfeit its\nsovereignty, the prince who, to retain his station, should withhold a\nconstitution, might plead excuse; but for him who in giving a\nconstitution can still retain his sovereignty, no excuse is to be made.\nLet those therefore to whom Heaven has afforded this opportunity,\nremember that two courses lie open to them; one which will render them\nsecure while they live and glorious when they die; another which\nexposes them to continual difficulties in life, and condemns them to\neternal infamy after death.\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014_Of the Religion of the Romans._\nThough Rome had Romulus for her first founder, and as a daughter owed\nhim her being and nurture, nevertheless, when the institutions of\nRomulus were seen by Heaven to be insufficient for so great a State,\nthe Roman senate were moved to choose Numa Pompilius as his successor,\nthat he might look to all matters which Romulus had neglected. He\nfinding the people fierce and turbulent, and desiring with the help of\nthe peaceful arts to bring them to order and obedience, called in the\naid of religion as essential to the maintenance of civil society, and\ngave it such a form, that for many ages God was nowhere so much feared\nas in that republic. The effect of this was to render easy any\nenterprise in which the senate or great men of Rome thought fit to\nengage. And whosoever pays heed to an infinity of actions performed,\nsometimes by the Roman people collectively, often by single citizens,\nwill see, that esteeming the power of God beyond that of man, they\ndreaded far more to violate their oath than to transgress the laws; as\nis clearly shown by the examples of Scipio and of Manlius Torquatus.\nFor after the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal at Cann\u00e6, many citizens\nmeeting together, resolved, in their terror and dismay, to abandon\nItaly and seek refuge in Sicily. But Scipio, getting word of this, went\namong them, and menacing them with his naked sword, made them swear\nnever to abandon their country. Again, when Lucius Manlius was accused\nby the tribune Marcus Pomponius, before the day fixed for trial, Titus\nManlius, afterwards named Torquatus, son to Lucius, went to seek this\nMarcus, and threatening him with death if he did not withdraw the\ncharge against his father, compelled him to swear compliance; and he,\nthrough fear, having sworn, kept his oath. In the first of these two\ninstances, therefore, citizens whom love of their country and its laws\ncould not have retained in Italy, were kept there by the oath forced\nupon them; and in the second, the tribune Marcus, to keep his oath,\nlaid aside the hatred he bore the father, and overlooked the injury\ndone him by the son, and his own dishonour. And this from no other\ncause than the religion which Numa had impressed upon this city.\nAnd it will be plain to any one who carefully studies Roman History,\nhow much religion helped in disciplining the army, in uniting the\npeople, in keeping good men good, and putting bad men to shame; so that\nhad it to be decided to which prince, Romulus or Numa, Rome owed the\ngreater debt, I think the balance must turn in favour of Numa; for when\nreligion is once established you may readily bring in arms; but where\nyou have arms without religion it is not easy afterwards to bring in\nreligion. We see, too, that while Romulus in order to create a senate,\nand to establish his other ordinances civil and military, needed no\nsupport from Divine authority, this was very necessary to Numa, who\nfeigned to have intercourse with a Nymph by whose advice he was guided\nin counselling the people. And this, because desiring to introduce in\nRome new and untried institutions, he feared that his own authority\nmight not effect his end. Nor, indeed, has any attempt ever been made\nto introduce unusual laws among a people, without resorting to Divine\nauthority, since without such sanction they never would have been\naccepted. For the wise recognize many things to be good which do not\nbear such reasons on the face of them as command their acceptance by\nothers; wherefore, wise men who would obviate these difficulties, have\nrecourse to Divine aid. Thus did Lycurgus, thus Solon, and thus have\ndone many besides who have had the same end in view.\nThe Romans, accordingly, admiring the prudence and virtues of Numa,\nassented to all the measures which he recommended. This, however, is to\nbe said, that the circumstance of these times being deeply tinctured\nwith religious feeling, and of the men with whom he had to deal being\nrude and ignorant, gave Numa better facility to carry out his plans, as\nenabling him to mould his subjects readily to any new impression. And,\ndoubtless, he who should seek at the present day to form a new\ncommonwealth, would find the task easier among a race of simple\nmountaineers, than among the dwellers in cities where society is\ncorrupt; as the sculptor can more easily carve a fair statue from a\nrough block, than from the block which has been badly shaped out by\nanother. But taking all this into account, I maintain that the religion\nintroduced by Numa was one of the chief causes of the prosperity of\nRome, since it gave rise to good ordinances, which in turn brought with\nthem good fortune, and with good fortune, happy issues to whatsoever\nwas undertaken.\nAnd as the observance of the ordinances of religion is the cause of the\ngreatness of a State, so their neglect is the occasion of its decline;\nsince a kingdom without the fear of God must either fall to pieces, or\nmust be maintained by the fear of some prince who supplies that\ninfluence not supplied by religion. But since the lives of princes are\nshort, the life of this prince, also, and with it his influence, must\nsoon come to an end; whence it happens that a kingdom which rests\nwholly on the qualities of its prince, lasts for a brief time only;\nbecause these qualities, terminating with his life, are rarely renewed\nin his successor. For as Dante wisely says:\u2014\n\u201cSeldom through the boughs\nDoth human worth renew itself; for such\nThe will of Him who gives it, that to Him\nWe may ascribe it.\u201d[1]\n[1] Rade volta risurge per li rami\nL\u2019umana probitate: e questo vuole\nQuei che la d\u00e0, perch\u00e8 da lui si chiami.\n_Purg_. vii. 121-123.]\nIt follows, therefore, that the safety of a commonwealth or kingdom\nlies, not in its having a ruler who governs it prudently while he\nlives, but in having one who so orders things, that when he dies, the\nState may still maintain itself. And though it be easier to impose new\ninstitutions or a new faith on rude and simple men, it is not therefore\nimpossible to persuade their adoption by men who are civilized, and who\ndo not think themselves rude. The people of Florence do not esteem\nthemselves rude or ignorant, and yet were persuaded by the Friar\nGirolamo Savonarola that he spoke with God. Whether in this he said\ntruth or no, I take not on me to pronounce, since of so great a man we\nmust speak with reverence; but this I do say, that very many believed\nhim without having witnessed anything extraordinary to warrant their\nbelief; his life, his doctrines, the matter whereof he treated, being\nsufficient to enlist their faith.\nLet no man, therefore, lose heart from thinking that he cannot do what\nothers have done before him; for, as I said in my Preface, men are\nborn, and live, and die, always in accordance with the same rules.\nCHAPTER XII.\u2014That it is of much moment to make account of Religion; and\nthat Italy, through the Roman Church, being wanting therein, has been\nruined.\nPrinces and commonwealths that would save themselves from growing\ncorrupted, should before all things keep uncorrupted the rites and\nceremonies of religion, and always hold them in reverence; since we can\nhave no surer sign of the decay of a province than to see Divine\nworship held therein in contempt. This is easily understood when it is\nseen on what foundation that religion rests in which a man is born. For\nevery religion has its root in certain fundamental ordinances peculiar\nto itself.\nThe religion of the Gentiles had its beginning in the responses of the\noracles and in the prognostics of the augurs and soothsayers. All their\nother ceremonies and observances depended upon these; because men\nnaturally believed that the God who could forecast their future weal or\nwoe, could also bring them to pass. Wherefore the temples, the prayers,\nthe sacrifices, and all the other rites of their worship, had their\norigin in this, that the oracles of Delos, of Dodona, and others\ncelebrated in antiquity, held the world admiring and devout. But,\nafterwards, when these oracles began to shape their answers to suit the\ninterests of powerful men, and their impostures to be seen through by\nthe multitude, men grew incredulous and ready to overturn every sacred\ninstitution. For which reason, the rulers of kingdoms and commonwealths\nshould maintain the foundations of the faith which they hold; since\nthus it will be easy for them to keep their country religious, and,\nconsequently, virtuous and united. To which end they should countenance\nand further whatsoever tells in favour of religion, even should they\nthink it untrue; and the wiser they are, and the better they are\nacquainted with natural causes, the more ought they to do so. It is\nfrom this course having been followed by the wise, that the miracles\ncelebrated even in false religions, have come to be held in repute; for\nfrom whatever source they spring, discreet men will extol them, whose\nauthority afterwards gives them currency everywhere.\nThese miracles were common enough in Rome, and among others this was\nbelieved, that when the Roman soldiers were sacking the city of Veii,\ncertain of them entered the temple of Juno and spoke to the statue of\nthe goddess, saying, \u201c_Wilt thou come with us to Rome?_\u201d when to some\nit seemed that she inclined her head in assent, and to others that they\nheard her answer, \u201c_Yea_.\u201d For these men being filled with religious\nawe (which Titus Livius shows us by the circumstance that, in entering\nthe temple, they entered devoutly, reverently, and without tumult),\npersuaded themselves they heard that answer to their question, which,\nperhaps, they had formed beforehand in their minds. But their faith and\nbelief were wholly approved of and confirmed by Camillus and by the\nother chief men of the city.\nHad religion been maintained among the princes of Christendom on the\nfooting on which it was established by its Founder, the Christian\nStates and republics had been far more united and far more prosperous\nthan they now are; nor can we have surer proof of its decay than in\nwitnessing how those countries which are the nearest neighbours of the\nRoman Church, the head of our faith, have less devoutness than any\nothers; so that any one who considers its earliest beginnings and\nobserves how widely different is its present practice, might well\nbelieve its ruin or its chastisement to be close at hand.\nBut since some are of opinion that the welfare of Italy depends upon\nthe Church of Rome, I desire to put forward certain arguments which\noccur to me against that view, and shall adduce two very strong ones,\nwhich, to my mind, admit of no answer. The first is, that, through the\nill example of the Roman Court, the country has lost all religious\nfeeling and devoutness, a loss which draws after it infinite mischiefs\nand disorders; for as the presence of religion implies every\nexcellence, so the contrary is involved in its absence. To the Church,\ntherefore, and to the priests, we Italians owe this first debt, that\nthrough them we have become wicked and irreligious. And a still greater\ndebt we owe them for what is the immediate cause of our ruin, namely,\nthat by the Church our country is kept divided. For no country was ever\nunited or prosperous which did not yield obedience to some one prince\nor commonwealth, as has been the case with France and Spain. And the\nChurch is the sole cause why Italy stands on a different footing, and\nis subject to no one king or commonwealth. For though she holds here\nher seat, and exerts her temporal authority, she has never yet gained\nstrength and courage to seize upon the entire country, or make herself\nsupreme; yet never has been so weak that when in fear of losing her\ntemporal dominion, she could not call in some foreign potentate to aid\nher against any Italian State by which she was overmatched. Of which we\nfind many instances, both in early times, as when by the intervention\nof Charles the Great she drove the Lombards, who had made themselves\nmasters of nearly the whole country, out of Italy; and also in recent\ntimes, as when, with the help of France, she first stripped the\nVenetians of their territories, and then, with the help of the Swiss,\nexpelled the French.\nThe Church, therefore, never being powerful enough herself to take\npossession of the entire country, while, at the same time, preventing\nany one else from doing so, has made it impossible to bring Italy under\none head; and has been the cause of her always living subject to many\nprinces or rulers, by whom she has been brought to such division and\nweakness as to have become a prey, not to Barbarian kings only, but to\nany who have thought fit to attack her. For this, I say, we Italians\nhave none to thank but the Church. And were any man powerful enough to\ntransplant the Court of Rome, with all the authority it now wields over\nthe rest of Italy, into the territories of the Swiss (the only people\nwho at this day, both as regards religion and military discipline, live\nlike the ancients,) he would have clear proof of the truth of what I\naffirm, and would find that the corrupt manners of that Court had, in a\nlittle while, wrought greater mischief in these territories than any\nother disaster which could ever befall them.\nCHAPTER XIII.\u2014_Of the use the Romans made of Religion in giving\nInstitutions to their City, in carrying out their Enterprises, and in\nquelling Tumults._\nHere it seems to me not out of place to cite instances of the Romans\nseeking assistance from religion in reforming their institutions and in\ncarrying out their warlike designs. And although many such are related\nby Titus Livius, I content myself with mentioning the following only:\nThe Romans having appointed tribunes with consular powers, all of them,\nsave one, plebeians, it so chanced that in that very year they were\nvisited by plague and famine, accompanied by many strange portents.\nTaking occasion from this, the nobles, at the next creation of\ntribunes, gave out that the gods were angry with Rome for lowering the\nmajesty of her government, nor could be appeased but by the choice of\ntribunes being restored to a fair footing. Whereupon the people,\nsmitten with religious awe, chose all the tribunes from the nobles.\nAgain, at the siege of Veii, we find the Roman commanders making use of\nreligion to keep the minds of their men well disposed towards that\nenterprise. For when, in the last year of the siege, the soldiers,\ndisgusted with their protracted service, began to clamour to be led\nback to Rome, on the Alban lake suddenly rising to an uncommon height,\nit was found that the oracles at Delphi and elsewhere had foretold that\nVeii should fall that year in which the Alban lake overflowed. The hope\nof near victory thus excited in the minds of the soldiers, led them to\nput up with the weariness of the war, and to continue in arms; until,\non Camillus being named dictator, Veii was taken after a ten years\u2019\nsiege. In these cases, therefore, we see religion, wisely used, assist\nin the reduction of this city, and in restoring the tribuneship to the\nnobles; neither of which ends could well have been effected without it.\nOne other example bearing on the same subject I must not omit. Constant\ndisturbances were occasioned in Rome by the tribune Terentillus, who,\nfor reasons to be noticed in their place, sought to pass a certain law.\nThe nobles, in their efforts to baffle him, had recourse to religion,\nwhich they sought to turn to account in two ways. For first they caused\nthe Sibylline books to be searched, and a feigned answer returned, that\nin that year the city ran great risk of losing its freedom through\ncivil discord; which fraud, although exposed by the tribunes,\nnevertheless aroused such alarm in the minds of the commons that they\nslackened in their support of their leaders. Their other contrivance\nwas as follows: A certain Appius Herdonius, at the head of a band of\nslaves and outlaws, to the number of four thousand, having seized the\nCapitol by night, an alarm was spread that were the Equians and\nVolscians, those perpetual enemies of the Roman name, then to attack\nthe city, they might succeed in taking it. And when, in spite of this,\nthe tribunes stubbornly persisted in their efforts to pass the law,\ndeclaring the act of Herdonius to be a device of the nobles and no real\ndanger. Publius Rubetius, a citizen of weight and authority, came forth\nfrom the Senate House, and in words partly friendly and partly\nmenacing, showed them the peril in which the city stood, and that their\ndemands were unseasonable; and spoke to such effect that the commons\nbound themselves by oath to stand by the consul; in fulfilment of which\nengagement they aided the consul, Publius Valerius, to carry the\nCapitol by assault. But Valerius being slain in the attack, Titus\nQuintius was at once appointed in his place, who, to leave the people\nno breathing time, nor suffer their thoughts to revert to the\nTerentillian law, ordered them to quit Rome and march against the\nVolscians; declaring them bound to follow him by virtue of the oath\nthey had sworn not to desert the consul. And though the tribunes\nwithstood him, contending that the oath had been sworn to the dead\nconsul and not to Quintius, yet the people under the influence of\nreligious awe, chose rather to obey the consul than believe the\ntribunes. And Titus Livius commends their behaviour when he says:\n\u201c_That neglect of the gods which now prevails, had not then made its\nway nor was it then the practice for every man to interpret his oath,\nor the laws, to suit his private ends_.\u201d The tribunes accordingly,\nfearing to lose their entire ascendency, consented to obey the consul,\nand to refrain for a year from moving in the matter of the Terentillian\nlaw; while the consuls, on their part, undertook that for a year the\ncommons should not be called forth to war. And thus, with the help of\nreligion, the senate were able to overcome a difficulty which they\nnever could have overcome without it.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014_That the Romans interpreted the Auspices to meet the\noccasion; and made a prudent show of observing the Rites of Religion\neven when forced to disregard them; and any who rashly slighted\nReligion they punished._\nAuguries were not only, as we have shown above, a main foundation of\nthe old religion of the Gentiles, but were also the cause of the\nprosperity of the Roman commonwealth. Accordingly, the Romans gave more\nheed to these than to any other of their observances; resorting to them\nin their consular comitia; in undertaking new enterprises; in calling\nout their armies; in going into battle; and, in short, in every\nbusiness of importance, whether civil or military. Nor would they ever\nset forth on any warlike expedition, until they had satisfied their\nsoldiers that the gods had promised them victory.\nAmong other means of declaring the auguries, they had in their armies a\nclass of soothsayers, named by them _pullarii_, whom, when they desired\nto give battle, they would ask to take the auspices, which they did by\nobserving the behaviour of fowls. If the fowls pecked, the engagement\nwas begun with a favourable omen. If they refused, battle was declined.\nNevertheless, when it was plain on the face of it that a certain course\nhad to be taken, they would take it at all hazards, even though the\nauspices were adverse; contriving, however, to manage matters so\nadroitly as not to appear to throw any slight on religion; as was done\nby the consul Papirius in the great battle he fought with the Samnites\nwherein that nation was finally broken and overthrown. For Papirius\nbeing encamped over against the Samnites, and perceiving that if he\nfought, victory was certain, and consequently being eager to engage,\ndesired the omens to be taken. The fowls refused to peck; but the chief\nsoothsayer observing the eagerness of the soldiers to fight and the\nconfidence felt both by them and by their captain, not to deprive the\narmy of such an opportunity of glory, reported to the consul that the\nauspices were favourable. Whereupon Papirius began to array his army\nfor battle. But some among the soothsayers having divulged to certain\nof the soldiers that the fowls had not pecked, this was told to Spurius\nPapirius, the nephew of the consul, who reporting it to his uncle, the\nlatter straightway bade him mind his own business, for that so far as\nhe himself and the army were concerned, the auspices were fair; and if\nthe soothsayer had lied, the consequences were on his head. And that\nthe event might accord with the prognostics, he commanded his officers\nto place the soothsayers in front of the battle. It so chanced that as\nthey advanced against the enemy, the chief soothsayer was killed by a\nspear thrown by a Roman soldier; which, the consul hearing of, said,\n\u201c_All goes well, and as the Gods would have it, for by the death of\nthis liar the army is purged of blame and absolved from whatever\ndispleasure these may have conceived against it_.\u201d And contriving, in\nthis way to make his designs tally with the auspices, he joined battle,\nwithout the army knowing that the ordinances of religion had in any\ndegree been disregarded.\nBut an opposite course was taken by Appius Pulcher, in Sicily, in the\nfirst Carthaginian war. For desiring to join battle, he bade the\nsoothsayers take the auspices, and on their announcing that the fowls\nrefused to feed, he answered, \u201c_Let us see, then, whether they will\ndrink,_\u201d and, so saying, caused them to be thrown into the sea. After\nwhich he fought and was defeated. For this he was condemned at Rome,\nwhile Papirius was honoured; not so much because the one had gained\nwhile the other had lost a battle, as because in their treatment of the\nauspices the one had behaved discreetly, the other with rashness. And,\nin truth, the sole object of this system of taking the auspices was to\ninsure the army joining battle with that confidence of success which\nconstantly leads to victory; a device followed not by the Romans only,\nbut by foreign nations as well; of which I shall give an example in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014_How the Samnites, as a last resource in their broken\nFortunes, had recourse to Religion._\nThe Samnites, who before had met with many defeats at the hands of the\nRomans, were at last decisively routed by them in Etruria, where their\narmies were cut to pieces and their commanders slain. And because their\nallies also, such as the Etruscans, the Umbrians, and the Gauls, were\nlikewise vanquished, they \u201c_could now no longer_\u201d as Livius tells us,\n\u201c_either trust to their own strength or to foreign aid; yet, for all\nthat, would not cease from hostilities, nor resign themselves to\nforfeit the liberty which they had unsuccessfully defended, preferring\nnew defeats to an inglorious submission._\u201d They resolved, therefore, to\nmake a final effort; and as they knew that victory was only to be\nsecured by inspiring their soldiers with a stubborn courage, to which\nend nothing could help so much as religion, at the instance of their\nhigh priest, Ovius Paccius, they revived an ancient sacrificial rite\nperformed by them in the manner following. After offering solemn\nsacrifice they caused all the captains of their armies, standing\nbetween the slain victims and the smoking altars, to swear never to\nabandon the war. They then summoned the common soldiers, one by one,\nand before the same altars, and surrounded by a ring of many centurions\nwith drawn swords, first bound them by oath never to reveal what they\nmight see or hear; and then, after imprecating the Divine wrath, and\nreciting the most terrible incantations, made them vow and swear to the\ngods, as they would not have a curse light on their race and offspring,\nto follow wherever their captains led, never to turn back from battle,\nand to put any they saw turn back to death. Some who in their terror\ndeclined to swear, were forthwith slain by the centurions. The rest,\nwarned by their cruel fate, complied. Assembling thereafter to the\nnumber of forty thousand, one-half of whom, to render their appearance\nof unusual splendour were clad in white, with plumes and crests over\ntheir helmets, they took up their ground in the neighbourhood of\nAquilonia. But Papirius, being sent against them, bade his soldiers be\nof good cheer, telling them \u201c_that feathers made no wounds, and that a\nRoman spear would pierce a painted shield;_\u201d and to lessen the effect\nwhich the oath taken by the Samnites had upon the minds of the Romans,\nhe said that such an oath must rather distract than strengthen those\nbound by it, since they had to fear, at once, their enemies, their\ncomrades, and their Gods. In the battle which ensued, the Samnites were\nrouted, any firmness lent them by religion or by the oath they had\nsworn, being balanced by the Roman valour, and the terror inspired by\npast defeats. Still we see that, in their own judgment, they had no\nother refuge to which to turn, nor other remedy for restoring their\nbroken hopes; and this is strong testimony to the spirit which religion\nrightly used can arouse.\nSome of the incidents which I have now been considering may be thought\nto relate rather to the foreign than to the domestic affairs of Rome,\nwhich last alone form the proper subject of this Book; nevertheless\nsince the matter connects itself with one of the most important\ninstitutions of the Roman republic, I have thought it convenient to\nnotice it here, so as not to divide the subject and be obliged to\nreturn to it hereafter.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014_That a People accustomed to live under a Prince, if by\nany accident it become free, can hardly preserve that Freedom._\nShould a people accustomed to live under a prince by any accident\nbecome free, as did the Romans on the expulsion of the Tarquins, we\nknow from numberless instances recorded in ancient history, how hard it\nwill be for it to maintain that freedom. And this is no more than we\nmight expect. For a people in such circumstances may be likened to the\nwild animal which, though destined by nature to roam at large in the\nwoods, has been reared in the cage and in constant confinement and\nwhich, should it chance to be set free in the open country, being\nunused to find its own food, and unfamiliar with the coverts where it\nmight lie concealed, falls a prey to the first who seeks to recapture\nit. Even thus it fares with the people which has been accustomed to be\ngoverned by others; since ignorant how to act by itself either for\nattack or defence, and neither knowing foreign princes nor being known\nof them, it is speedily brought back under the yoke, and often under a\nheavier yoke than that from which it has just freed its neck. These\ndifficulties will be met with, even where the great body of the\ncitizens has not become wholly corrupted; but where the corruption is\ncomplete, freedom, as shall presently be shown, is not merely fleeting\nbut impossible. Wherefore my remarks are to be taken as applying to\nthose States only wherein corruption has as yet made no great progress,\nand in which there is more that is sound than unsound.\nTo the difficulties above noticed, another has to be added, which is,\nthat a State in becoming free makes for itself bitter enemies but not\nwarm friends. All become its bitter enemies who, drawing their support\nfrom the wealth of the tyrant, flourished under his government. For\nthese men, when the causes which made them powerful are withdrawn, can\nno longer live contented, but are one and all impelled to attempt the\nrestoration of the tyranny in hopes of regaining their former\nimportance. On the other hand, as I have said, the State which becomes\nfree does not gain for itself warm friends. For a free government\nbestows its honours and rewards in accordance with certain fixed rules,\nand on considerations of merit, without which none is honoured or\nrewarded. But when a man obtains only those honours or rewards which he\nseems to himself to deserve, he will never admit that he is under any\nobligation to those who bestow them. Moreover the common benefits that\nall derive from a free government, which consist in the power to enjoy\nwhat is our own, openly and undisturbed, in having to feel no anxiety\nfor the honour of wife or child, nor any fear for personal safety, are\nhardly recognized by men while they still possess them, since none will\never confess obligation to him who merely refrains from injury. For\nthese reasons, I repeat, a State which has recently become free, is\nlikely to have bitter enemies and no warm friends.\nNow, to meet these difficulties and their attendant disorders, there is\nno more potent, effectual, wholesome, and necessary remedy than _to\nslay the sons of Brutus_. They, as the historian tells us, were along\nwith other young Romans led to conspire against their country, simply\nbecause the unusual privileges which they had enjoyed under the kings,\nwere withheld under the consuls; so that to them it seemed as though\nthe freedom of the people implied their servitude. Any one, therefore,\nwho undertakes to control a people, either as their prince or as the\nhead of a commonwealth, and does not make sure work with all who are\nhostile to his new institutions, founds a government which cannot last\nlong. Undoubtedly those princes are to be reckoned unhappy, who, to\nsecure their position, are forced to advance by unusual and irregular\npaths, and with the people for their enemies. For while he who has to\ndeal with a few adversaries only, can easily and without much or\nserious difficulty secure himself, he who has an entire people against\nhim can never feel safe and the greater the severity he uses the weaker\nhis authority becomes; so that his best course is to strive to make the\npeople his friends.\nBut since these views may seem to conflict with what I have said above,\ntreating there of a republic and here of a prince, that I may not have\nto return to the subject again, I will in this place discuss it\nbriefly. Speaking, then of those princes who have become the tyrants of\ntheir country, I say that the prince who seeks to gain over an\nunfriendly people should first of all examine what it is the people\nreally desire, and he will always find that they desire two things:\nfirst, to be revenged upon those who are the cause of their servitude;\nand second, to regain their freedom. The first of these desires the\nprince can gratify wholly, the second in part. As regards the former,\nwe have an instance exactly in point. Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea,\nbeing in exile, it so happened that on a feud arising between the\ncommons and the nobles of that city, the latter, perceiving they were\nweaker than their adversaries, began to look with favour on Clearchus,\nand conspiring with him, in opposition to the popular voice recalled\nhim to Heraclea and deprived the people of their freedom. Clearchus\nfinding himself thus placed between the arrogance of the nobles, whom\nhe could in no way either satisfy or correct, and the fury of the\npeople, who could not put up with the loss of their freedom, resolved\nto rid himself at a stroke from the harassment of the nobles and\nrecommend himself to the people. Wherefore, watching his opportunity,\nhe caused all the nobles to be put to death, and thus, to the extreme\ndelight of the people, satisfied one of those desires by which they are\npossessed, namely, the desire for vengeance.\nAs for the other desire of the people, namely, to recover their\nfreedom, the prince, since he never can content them in this, should\nexamine what the causes are which make them long to be free; and he\nwill find a very few of them desiring freedom that they may obtain\npower, but all the rest, whose number is countless, only desiring it\nthat they may live securely. For in all republics, whatever the form of\ntheir government, barely forty or fifty citizens have any place in the\ndirection of affairs; who, from their number being so small, can easily\nbe reckoned with, either by making away with them, or by allowing them\nsuch a share of honours as, looking to their position, may reasonably\ncontent them. All those others whose sole aim it is to live safely, are\nwell contented where the prince enacts such laws and ordinances as\nprovide for the general security, while they establish his own\nauthority; and when he does this, and the people see that nothing\ninduces him to violate these laws, they soon begin to live happily and\nwithout anxiety. Of this we have an example in the kingdom of France,\nwhich enjoys perfect security from this cause alone, that its kings are\nbound to compliance with an infinity of laws upon which the well-being\nof the whole people depends. And he who gave this State its\nconstitution allowed its kings to do as they pleased as regards arms\nand money; but provided that as regards everything else they should not\ninterfere save as the laws might direct. Those rulers, therefore, who\nomit to provide sufficiently for the safety of their government at the\noutset, must, like the Romans, do so on the first occasion which\noffers; and whoever lets the occasion slip, will repent too late of not\nhaving acted as he should. The Romans, however, being still uncorrupted\nat the time when they recovered their freedom, were able, after slaying\nthe sons of Brutus and getting rid of the Tarquins, to maintain it with\nall those safeguards and remedies which we have elsewhere considered.\nBut had they already become corrupted, no remedy could have been found,\neither in Rome or out of it, by which their freedom could have been\nsecured; as I shall show in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014_That a corrupt People obtaining Freedom can hardly\npreserve it._\nI believe that if her kings had not been expelled, Rome must very soon\nhave become a weak and inconsiderable State. For seeing to what a pitch\nof corruption these kings had come, we may conjecture that if two or\nthree more like reigns had followed, and the taint spread from the head\nto the members, so soon as the latter became infected, cure would have\nbeen hopeless. But from the head being removed while the trunk was\nstill sound, it was not difficult for the Romans to return to a free\nand constitutional government.\nIt may be assumed, however, as most certain, that a corrupted city\nliving under a prince can never recover its freedom, even were the\nprince and all his line to be exterminated. For in such a city it must\nnecessarily happen that one prince will be replaced by another, and\nthat things will never settle down until a new lord be established;\nunless, indeed, the combined goodness and valour of some one citizen\nshould maintain freedom, which, even then, will endure only for his\nlifetime; as happened twice in Syracuse, first under the rule of Dion,\nand again under that of Timoleon, whose virtues while they lived kept\ntheir city free, but on whose death it fell once more under a tyranny.\nBut the strongest example that can be given is that of Rome, which on\nthe expulsion of the Tarquins was able at once to seize on liberty and\nto maintain it; yet, on the deaths of C\u00e6sar, Caligula, and Nero, and on\nthe extinction of the Julian line, was not only unable to establish her\nfreedom, but did not even venture a step in that direction. Results so\nopposite arising in one and the same city can only be accounted for by\nthis, that in the time of the Tarquins the Roman people were not yet\ncorrupted, but in these later times had become utterly corrupt. For on\nthe first occasion, nothing more was needed to prepare and determine\nthem to shake off their kings, than that they should be bound by oath\nto suffer no king ever again to reign in Rome; whereas, afterwards, the\nauthority and austere virtue of Brutus, backed by all the legions of\nthe East, could not rouse them to maintain their hold of that freedom,\nwhich he, following in the footsteps of the first Brutus, had won for\nthem; and this because of the corruption wherewith the people had been\ninfected by the Marian faction, whereof C\u00e6sar becoming head, was able\nso to blind the multitude that it saw not the yoke under which it was\nabout to lay its neck.\nThough this example of Rome be more complete than any other, I desire\nto instance likewise, to the same effect, certain peoples well known in\nour own days; and I maintain that no change, however grave or violent,\ncould ever restore freedom to Naples or Milan, because in these States\nthe entire body of the people has grown corrupted. And so we find that\nMilan, although desirous to return to a free form of government, on the\ndeath of Filippo Visconti, had neither the force nor the skill needed\nto preserve it.\nMost fortunate, therefore, was it for Rome that her kings grew corrupt\nsoon, so as to be driven out before the taint of their corruption had\nreached the vitals of the city. For it was because these were sound\nthat the endless commotions which took place in Rome, so far from being\nhurtful, were, from their object being good, beneficial to the\ncommonwealth. From which we may draw this inference, that where the\nbody of the people is still sound, tumults and other like disorders do\nlittle hurt, but that where it has become corrupted, laws, however well\ndevised, are of no advantage, unless imposed by some one whose\nparamount authority causes them to be observed until the community be\nonce more restored to a sound and healthy condition.\nWhether this has ever happened I know not, nor whether it ever can\nhappen. For we see, as I have said a little way back, that a city which\nowing to its pervading corruption has once begun to decline, if it is\nto recover at all, must be saved not by the excellence of the people\ncollectively, but of some one man then living among them, on whose\ndeath it at once relapses into its former plight; as happened with\nThebes, in which the virtue of Epaminondas made it possible while he\nlived to preserve the form of a free Government, but which fell again\non his death into its old disorders; the reason being that hardly any\nruler lives so long as to have time to accustom to right methods a city\nwhich has long been accustomed to wrong. Wherefore, unless things be\nput on a sound footing by some one ruler who lives to a very advanced\nage, or by two virtuous rulers succeeding one another, the city upon\ntheir death at once falls back into ruin; or, if it be preserved, must\nbe so by incurring great risks, and at the cost of much blood. For the\ncorruption I speak of, is wholly incompatible with a free government,\nbecause it results from an inequality which pervades the State and can\nonly be removed by employing unusual and very violent remedies, such as\nfew are willing or know how to employ, as in another place I shall more\nfully explain.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\u2014_How a Free Government existing in a corrupt City may be\npreserved, or not existing may be created._\nI think it neither out of place, nor inconsistent with what has been\nsaid above, to consider whether a free government existing in a corrupt\ncity can be maintained, or, not existing, can be introduced. And on\nthis head I say that it is very difficult to bring about either of\nthese results, and next to impossible to lay down rules as to how it\nmay be done; because the measures to be taken must vary with the degree\nof corruption which prevails.\nNevertheless, since it is well to reason things out, I will not pass\nthis matter by, but will assume, in the first place, the case of a very\ncorrupt city, and then take the case of one in which corruption has\nreached a still greater height; but where corruption is universal, no\nlaws or institutions will ever have force to restrain it. Because as\ngood customs stand in need of good laws for their support, so laws,\nthat they may be respected, stand in need of good customs. Moreover,\nthe laws and institutions established in a republic at its beginning,\nwhen men were good, are no longer suitable when they have become bad;\nbut while the laws of a city are altered to suit its circumstances, its\ninstitutions rarely or never change; whence it results that the\nintroduction of new laws is of no avail, because the institutions,\nremaining unchanged, corrupt them.\nAnd to make this plainer, I say that in Rome it was first of all the\ninstitutions of the State, and next the laws as enforced by the\nmagistrates, which kept the citizens under control. The institutions of\nthe State consisted in the authority of the people, the senate, the\ntribunes, and the consuls; in the methods of choosing and appointing\nmagistrates; and in the arrangements for passing laws. These\ninstitutions changed little, if at all, with circumstances. But the\nlaws by which the people were controlled, as for instance the law\nrelating to adultery, the sumptuary laws, the law as to canvassing at\nelections, and many others, were altered as the citizens grew more and\nmore corrupted. Hence, the institutions of the State remaining the same\nalthough from the corruption of the people no longer suitable,\namendments in the laws could not keep men good, though they might have\nproved very useful if at the time when they were made the institutions\nhad likewise been reformed.\nThat its original institutions are no longer adapted to a city that has\nbecome corrupted, is plainly seen in two matters of great moment, I\nmean in the appointment of magistrates and in the passing of laws. For\nthe Roman people conferred the consulship and other great offices of\ntheir State on none save those who sought them; which was a good\ninstitution at first, because then none sought these offices save those\nwho thought themselves worthy of them, and to be rejected was held\ndisgraceful; so that, to be deemed worthy, all were on their best\nbehaviour. But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most\nmischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those\nwho had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were\nwithout influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This\nuntoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar\nresults, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and\nreducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became\nperfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer\nto have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and\nthe weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the\nconsulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting\nfor the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those\nwho knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of\nselecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had\nmost influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their\ninstitutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.\nAgain, as to making laws, any of the tribunes and certain others of the\nmagistrates were entitled to submit laws to the people; but before\nthese were passed it was open to every citizen to speak either for or\nagainst them. This was a good system so long as the citizens were good,\nsince it is always well that every man should be able to propose what\nhe thinks may be of use to his country, and that all should be allowed\nto express their views with regard to his proposal; so that the people,\nhaving heard all, may resolve on what is best. But when the people grew\ndepraved, this became a very mischievous institution; for then it was\nonly the powerful who proposed laws, and these not in the interest of\npublic freedom but of their own authority; and because, through fear,\nnone durst speak against the laws they proposed, the people were either\ndeceived or forced into voting their own destruction.\nIn order, therefore, that Rome after she had become corrupted might\nstill preserve her freedom, it was necessary that, as in the course of\nevents she had made new laws, so likewise she should frame new\ninstitutions, since different institutions and ordinances are needed in\na corrupt State from those which suit a State which is not corrupted;\nfor where the matter is wholly dissimilar, the form cannot be similar.\nBut since old institutions must either be reformed all at once, as soon\nas they are seen to be no longer expedient, or else gradually, as the\nimperfection of each is recognized, I say that each of these two\ncourses is all but impossible. For to effect a gradual reform requires\na sagacious man who can discern mischief while it is still remote and\nin the germ. But it may well happen that no such person is found in a\ncity; or that, if found, he is unable to persuade others of what he is\nhimself persuaded. For men used to live in one way are loath to leave\nit for another, especially when they are not brought face to face with\nthe evil against which they should guard, and only have it indicated to\nthem by conjecture. And as for a sudden reform of institutions which\nare seen by all to be no longer good, I say that defects which are\neasily discerned are not easily corrected, because for their correction\nit is not enough to use ordinary means, these being in themselves\ninsufficient; but recourse must be had to extraordinary means, such as\nviolence and arms; and, as a preliminary, you must become prince of the\ncity, and be able to deal with it at your pleasure. But since the\nrestoration of a State to new political life presupposes a good man,\nand to become prince of a city by violence presupposes a bad man, it\ncan, consequently, very seldom happen that, although the end be good, a\ngood man will be found ready to become a prince by evil ways, or that a\nbad man having become a prince will be disposed to act virtuously, or\nthink of turning to good account his ill-acquired authority.\nFrom all these causes comes the difficulty, or rather the\nimpossibility, which a corrupted city finds in maintaining an existing\nfree government, or in establishing a new one. So that had we to\nestablish or maintain a government in that city, it would be necessary\nto give it a monarchical, rather than a popular form, in order that men\ntoo arrogant to be restrained by the laws, might in some measure be\nkept in check by a power almost absolute; since to attempt to make them\ngood otherwise would be a very cruel or a wholly futile endeavour.\nThis, as I have said, was the method followed by Cleomenes; and if he,\nthat he might stand alone, put to death the Ephori; and if Romulus,\nwith a like object, put to death his brother and Titus Tatius the\nSabine, and if both afterwards made good use of the authority they thus\nacquired, it is nevertheless to be remembered that it was because\nneither Cleomenes nor Romulus had to deal with so corrupt a people as\nthat of which I am now speaking, that they were able to effect their\nends and to give a fair colour to their acts.\nCHAPTER XIX.\u2014_After a strong Prince a weak Prince may maintain himself:\nbut after one weak Prince no Kingdom can stand a second._\nWhen we contemplate the excellent qualities of Romulus, Numa, and\nTullus, the first three kings of Rome, and note the methods which they\nfollowed, we recognize the extreme good fortune of that city in having\nher first king fierce and warlike, her second peaceful and religious,\nand her third, like the first, of a high spirit and more disposed to\nwar than to peace. For it was essential for Rome that almost at the\noutset of her career, a ruler should be found to lay the foundations of\nher civil life; but, after that had been done, it was necessary that\nher rulers should return to the virtues of Romulus, since otherwise the\ncity must have grown feeble, and become a prey to her neighbours.\nAnd here we may note that a prince who succeeds to another of superior\nvalour, may reign on by virtue of his predecessor\u2019s merits, and reap\nthe fruits of his labours; but if he live to a great age, or if he be\nfollowed by another who is wanting in the qualities of the first, that\nthen the kingdom must necessarily dwindle. Conversely, when two\nconsecutive princes are of rare excellence, we commonly find them\nachieving results which win for them enduring renown. David, for\nexample, not only surpassed in learning and judgment, but was so\nvaliant in arms that, after conquering and subduing all his neighbours,\nhe left to his young son Solomon a tranquil State, which the latter,\nthough unskilled in the arts of war, could maintain by the arts of\npeace, and thus happily enjoy the inheritance of his father\u2019s valour.\nBut Solomon could not transmit this inheritance to his son Rehoboam,\nwho neither resembling his grandfather in valour, nor his father in\ngood fortune, with difficulty made good his right to a sixth part of\nthe kingdom. In like manner Bajazet, sultan of the Turks, though a man\nof peace rather than of war, was able to enjoy the labours of Mahomet\nhis father, who, like David, having subdued his neighbours, left his\nson a kingdom so safely established that it could easily be retained by\nhim by peaceful arts. But had Selim, son to Bajazet, been like his\nfather, and not like his grandfather, the Turkish monarchy must have\nbeen overthrown; as it is, he seems likely to outdo the fame of his\ngrandsire.\nI affirm it to be proved by these examples, that after a valiant prince\na feeble prince may maintain himself; but that no kingdom can stand\nwhen two feeble princes follow in succession, unless, as in the case of\nFrance, it be supported by its ancient ordinances. By feeble princes, I\nmean such as are not valiant in war. And, to put the matter shortly, it\nmay be said, that the great valour of Romulus left Numa a period of\nmany years within which to govern Rome by peaceful arts; that after\nNuma came Tullus, who renewed by his courage the fame of Romulus; and\nthat he in turn was succeeded by Ancus, a prince so gifted by nature\nthat he could equally avail himself of the methods of peace or war; who\nsetting himself at first to pursue the former, when he found that his\nneighbours judged him to be effeminate, and therefore held him in\nslight esteem, understood that to preserve Rome he must resort to arms\nand resemble Romulus rather than Numa. From whose example every ruler\nof a State may learn that a prince like Numa will hold or lose his\npower according as fortune and circumstances befriend him; but that the\nprince who resembles Romulus, and like him is fortified with foresight\nand arms, will hold his State whatever befall, unless deprived of it by\nsome stubborn and irresistible force. For we may reckon with certainty\nthat if Rome had not had for her third king one who knew how to restore\nher credit by deeds of valour, she could not, or at any rate not\nwithout great difficulty, have afterwards held her ground, nor could\never have achieved the great exploits she did.\nAnd for these reasons Rome, while she lived under her kings, was in\nconstant danger of destruction through a king who might be weak or bad.\nCHAPTER XX.\u2014_That the consecutive Reigns of two valiant Princes produce\ngreat results: and that well-ordered Commonwealths are assured of a\nSuccession of valiant Rulers by whom their Power and Growth are rapidly\nextended_.\nWhen Rome had driven out her kings, she was freed from those dangers to\nwhich, as I have said, she was exposed by the possible succession of a\nweak or wicked prince. For the chief share in the government then\ndevolved upon the consuls, who took their authority not by inheritance,\nnor yet by craft or by ambitious violence, but by the free suffrages of\ntheir fellow-citizens, and were always men of signal worth; by whose\nvalour and good fortune Rome being constantly aided, was able to reach\nthe height of her greatness in the same number of years as she had\nlived under her kings. And since we find that two successive reigns of\nvaliant princes, as of Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander, suffice\nto conquer the world, this ought to be still easier for a commonwealth,\nwhich has it in its power to choose, not two excellent rulers only, but\nan endless number in succession. And in every well ordered commonwealth\nprovision will be made for a succession of this sort.\nCHAPTER XXI.\u2014_That it is a great reproach to a Prince or to a\nCommonwealth to be without a national Army_.\nThose princes and republics of the present day who lack forces of their\nown, whether for attack or defence, should take shame to themselves,\nand should be convinced by the example of Tullus, that their deficiency\ndoes not arise from want of men fit for warlike enterprises, but from\ntheir own fault in not knowing how to make their subjects good\nsoldiers. For after Rome had been at peace for forty years, Tullus,\nsucceeding to the kingdom, found not a single Roman who had ever been\nin battle. Nevertheless when he made up his mind to enter on a war, it\nnever occurred to him to have recourse to the Samnites, or the\nEtruscans, or to any other of the neighbouring nations accustomed to\narms, but he resolved, like the prudent prince he was, to rely on his\nown countrymen. And such was his ability that, under his rule, the\npeople very soon became admirable soldiers. For nothing is more true\nthan that where a country, having men, lacks soldiers, it results from\nsome fault in its ruler, and not from any defect in the situation or\nclimate. Of this we have a very recent instance. Every one knows, how,\nonly the other day, the King of England invaded the realm of France\nwith an army raised wholly from among his own people, although from his\ncountry having been at peace for thirty years, he had neither men nor\nofficers who had ever looked an enemy in the face. Nevertheless, he did\nnot hesitate with such troops as he had, to attack a kingdom well\nprovided with officers and excellent soldiers who had been constantly\nunder arms in the Italian wars. And this was possible through the\nprudence of the English king and the wise ordinances of his kingdom,\nwhich never in time of peace relaxes its warlike discipline. So too, in\nold times, Pelopidas and Epaminondas the Thebans, after they had freed\nThebes from her tyrants, and rescued her from thraldom to Sparta,\nfinding themselves in a city used to servitude and surrounded by an\neffeminate people, scrupled not, so great was their courage, to furnish\nthese with arms, and go forth with them to meet and to conquer the\nSpartan forces on the field. And he who relates this, observes, that\nthese two captains very soon showed that warriors are not bred in\nLaced\u00e6mon alone, but in every country where men are found, if only some\none arise among them who knows how to direct them to arms; as we see\nTullus knew how to direct the Romans. Nor could Virgil better express\nthis opinion, or show by fitter words that he was convinced of its\ntruth than, when he says:\u2014\n\u201cTo arms shall Tullus rouse\nHis sluggish warriors.\u201d[2]\n[2] Residesque movebit\nTullus in arma viros. _Virg. Aen_. vi. 814.\nCHAPTER XXII.\u2014_What is to be noted in the combat of the three Roman\nHoratii and the three Alban Curiatii_.\nIt was agreed between Tullus king of Rome, and Metius king of Alba,\nthat the nation whose champions were victorious in combat should rule\nover the other. The three Alban Curiatii were slain; one of the Roman\nHoratii survived. Whereupon the Alban king with all his people became\nsubject to the Romans. The surviving Horatius returning victorious to\nRome, and meeting his sister, wife to one of the dead Curiatii,\nbewailing the death of her husband, slew her; and being tried for this\ncrime, was, after much contention, liberated, rather on the entreaties\nof his father than for his own deserts.\nHerein three points are to be noted. _First_, that we should never\nperil our whole fortunes on the success of only a part of our forces.\n_Second_, that in a well-governed State, merit should never be allowed\nto balance crime. And _third_, that those are never wise covenants\nwhich we cannot or should not expect to be observed. Now, for a State\nto be enslaved is so terrible a calamity that it ought never to have\nbeen supposed possible that either of these kings or nations would rest\ncontent under a slavery resulting from the defeat of three only of\ntheir number. And so it appeared to Metius; for although on the victory\nof the Roman champions, he at once confessed himself vanquished, and\npromised obedience; nevertheless, in the very first expedition which he\nand Tullus undertook jointly against the people of Veii, we find him\nseeking to circumvent the Roman, as though perceiving too late the rash\npart he had played.\nThis is enough to say of the third point which I noted as deserving\nattention. Of the other two I shall speak in the next two Chapters.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\u2014_That we should never hazard our whole Fortunes where we\nput not forth our entire Strength; for which reason to guard a Defile\nis often hurtful_.\nIt was never judged a prudent course to peril your whole fortunes where\nyou put not forth your whole strength; as may happen in more ways than\none. One of these ways was that taken by Tullus and Metius, when each\nstaked the existence of his country and the credit of his army on the\nvalour and good fortune of three only of his soldiers, that being an\nutterly insignificant fraction of the force at his disposal. For\nneither of these kings reflected that all the labours of their\npredecessors in framing such institutions for their States, as might,\nwith the aid of the citizens themselves, maintain them long in freedom,\nwere rendered futile, when the power to ruin all was left in the hands\nof so small a number. No rasher step, therefore, could have been taken,\nthan was taken by these kings.\nA like risk is almost always incurred by those who, on the approach of\nan enemy, resolve to defend some place of strength, or to guard the\ndefiles by which their country is entered. For unless room be found in\nthis place of strength for almost all your army, the attempt to hold it\nwill almost always prove hurtful. If you can find room, it will be\nright to defend your strong places; but if these be difficult of\naccess, and you cannot there keep your entire force together, the\neffort to defend is mischievous. I come to this conclusion from\nobserving the example of those who, although their territories be\nenclosed by mountains and precipices, have not, on being attacked by\npowerful enemies, attempted to fight on the mountains or in the\ndefiles, but have advanced beyond them to meet their foes; or, if\nunwilling to advance, have awaited attack behind their mountains, on\nlevel and not on broken ground. The reason of which is, as I have above\nexplained, that many men cannot be assembled in these strong places for\ntheir defence; partly because a large number of men cannot long subsist\nthere, and partly because such places being narrow and confined, afford\nroom for a few only; so that no enemy can there be withstood, who comes\nin force to the attack; which he can easily do, his design being to\npass on and not to make a stay; whereas he who stands on the defensive\ncannot do so in force, because, from not knowing when the enemy may\nenter the confined and sterile tracts of which I speak, he may have to\nlodge himself there for a long time. But should you lose some pass\nwhich you had reckoned on holding, and on the defence of which your\ncountry and army have relied, there commonly follows such panic among\nyour people and among the troops which remain to you, that you are\nvanquished without opportunity given for any display of valour, and\nlose everything without bringing all your resources into play.\nEvery one has heard with what difficulty Hannibal crossed the Alps\nwhich divide France from Lombardy, and afterwards those which separate\nLombardy from Tuscany. Nevertheless the Romans awaited him, in the\nfirst instance on the banks of the Ticino, in the second on the plain\nof Arezzo, preferring to be defeated on ground which at least gave them\na chance of victory, to leading their army into mountain fastnesses\nwhere it was likely to be destroyed by the mere difficulties of the\nground. And any who read history with attention will find, that very\nfew capable commanders have attempted to hold passes of this nature, as\nwell for the reasons already given, as because to close them all were\nimpossible. For mountains, like plains, are traversed not only by\nwell-known and frequented roads, but also by many by-ways, which,\nthough unknown to strangers, are familiar to the people of the country,\nunder whose guidance you may always, and in spite of any opposition, be\neasily conducted to whatever point you please. Of this we have a recent\ninstance in the events of the year 1515. For when Francis I. of France\nresolved on invading Italy in order to recover the province of\nLombardy, those hostile to his attempt looked mainly to the Swiss, who\nit was hoped would stop him in passing through their mountains. But\nthis hope was disappointed by the event. For leaving on one side two or\nthree defiles which were guarded by the Swiss, the king advanced by\nanother unknown pass, and was in Italy and upon his enemies before they\nknew. Whereupon they fled terror-stricken into Milan; while the whole\npopulation of Lombardy, finding themselves deceived in their\nexpectation that the French would be detained in the mountains, went\nover to their side.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014_That well-ordered States always provide Rewards and\nPunishments for their Citizens; and never set off Deserts against\nMisdeeds_.\nThe valour of Horatius in vanquishing the Curiatii deserved the highest\nreward. But in slaying his sister he had been guilty of a heinous\ncrime. And so displeasing to the Romans was an outrage of this nature,\nthat although his services were so great and so recent, they brought\nhim to trial for his life. To one looking at it carelessly, this might\nseem an instance of popular ingratitude, but he who considers the\nmatter more closely, and examines with sounder judgment what the\nordinances of a State should be, will rather blame the Roman people for\nacquitting Horatius than for putting him on his trial. And this because\nno well-ordered State ever strikes a balance between the services of\nits citizens and their misdeeds; but appointing rewards for good\nactions and punishment for bad, when it has rewarded a man for acting\nwell, will afterwards, should he act ill, chastise him, without regard\nto his former deserts. When these ordinances are duly observed, a city\nwill live long in freedom, but when they are neglected, it must soon\ncome to ruin. For when a citizen has rendered some splendid service to\nhis country, if to the distinction which his action in itself confers,\nwere added an over-weening confidence that any crime he might\nthenceforth commit would pass unpunished, he would soon become so\narrogant that no civil bonds could restrain him.\nStill, while we would have punishment terrible to wrongdoers, it is\nessential that good actions should be rewarded, as we see to have been\nthe case in Rome. For even where a republic is poor, and has but little\nto give, it ought not to withhold that little; since a gift, however\nsmall, bestowed as a reward for services however great, will always be\nesteemed most honourable and precious by him who receives it. The story\nof Horatius Cocles and that of Mutius Sc\u00e6vola are well known: how the\none withstood the enemy on the bridge while it was being cut down, and\nthe other thrust his hand into the fire in punishment of the mistake\nmade when he sought the life of Porsenna the Etruscan king. To each of\nthese two, in requital of their splendid deeds, two ploughgates only of\nthe public land were given. Another famous story is that of Manlius\nCapitolinus, to whom, for having saved the Capitol from the besieging\nGauls, a small measure of meal was given by each of those who were shut\nup with him during the siege. Which recompense, in proportion to the\nwealth of the citizens of Rome at that time, was thought ample; so that\nafterwards, when Manlius, moved by jealousy and malice, sought to\narouse sedition in Rome, and to gain over the people to his cause, they\nwithout regard to his past services threw him headlong from that\nCapitol in saving which he had formerly gained so great a renown.\nCHAPTER XXV.\u2014_That he who would reform the Institutions of a free\nState, must retain at least the semblance of old Ways._\nWhoever takes upon him to reform the government of a city, must, if his\nmeasures are to be well received and carried out with general approval,\npreserve at least the semblance of existing methods, so as not to\nappear to the people to have made any change in the old order of\nthings; although, in truth, the new ordinances differ altogether from\nthose which they replace. For when this is attended to, the mass of\nmankind accept what seems as what is; nay, are often touched more\nnearly by appearances than by realities.\nThis tendency being recognized by the Romans at the very outset of\ntheir civil freedom, when they appointed two consuls in place of a\nsingle king, they would not permit the consuls to have more than twelve\nlictors, in order that the old number of the king\u2019s attendants might\nnot be exceeded. Again, there being solemnized every year in Rome a\nsacrificial rite which could only be performed by the king in person,\nthat the people might not be led by the absence of the king to remark\nthe want of any ancient observance, a priest was appointed for the due\ncelebration of this rite, to whom was given the name of _Rex\nsacrificulus_, and who was placed under the orders of the chief priest.\nIn this way the people were contented, and had no occasion from any\ndefect in the solemnities to desire the return of their kings. Like\nprecautions should be used by all who would put an end to the old\ngovernment of a city and substitute new and free institutions. For\nsince novelty disturbs men\u2019s minds, we should seek in the changes we\nmake to preserve as far as possible what is ancient, so that if the new\nmagistrates differ from the old in number, in authority, or in the\nduration of their office, they shall at least retain the old names.\nThis, I say, should be seen to by him who would establish a\nconstitutional government, whether in the form of a commonwealth or of\na kingdom. But he who would create an absolute government of the kind\nwhich political writers term a tyranny, must renew everything, as shall\nbe explained in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\u2014_A new Prince in a City or Province of which he has taken\nPossession, ought to make Everything new._\nWhosoever becomes prince of a city or State, more especially if his\nposition be so insecure that he cannot resort to constitutional\ngovernment either in the form of a republic or a monarchy, will find\nthat the best way to preserve his princedom is to renew the whole\ninstitutions of that State; that is to say, to create new magistracies\nwith new names, confer new powers, and employ new men, and like David\nwhen he became king, exalt the humble and depress the great, \u201c_filling\nthe hungry with good things, and sending the rich empty away_.\u201d\nMoreover, he must pull down existing towns and rebuild them, removing\ntheir inhabitants from one place to another; and, in short, leave\nnothing in the country as he found it; so that there shall be neither\nrank, nor condition, nor honour, nor wealth which its possessor can\nrefer to any but to him. And he must take example from Philip of\nMacedon, the father of Alexander, who by means such as these, from\nbeing a petty prince became monarch of all Greece; and of whom it was\nwritten that he shifted men from province to province as a shepherd\nmoves his flocks from one pasture to another.\nThese indeed are most cruel expedients, contrary not merely to every\nChristian, but to every civilized rule of conduct, and such as every\nman should shun, choosing rather to lead a private life than to be a\nking on terms so hurtful to mankind. But he who will not keep to the\nfair path of virtue, must to maintain himself enter this path of evil.\nMen, however, not knowing how to be wholly good or wholly bad, choose\nfor themselves certain middle ways, which of all others are the most\npernicious, as shall be shown by an instance in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\u2014_That Men seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly\nbad_.\nWhen in the year 1505, Pope Julius II. went to Bologna to expel from\nthat city the family of the Bentivogli, who had been princes there for\nover a hundred years, it was also in his mind, as a part of the general\ndesign he had planned against all those lords who had usurped Church\nlands, to remove Giovanpagolo Baglioni, tyrant of Perugia. And coming\nto Perugia with this intention and resolve, of which all men knew, he\nwould not wait to enter the town with a force sufficient for his\nprotection, but entered it unattended by troops, although Giovanpagolo\nwas there with a great company of soldiers whom he had assembled for\nhis defence. And thus, urged on by that impetuosity which stamped all\nhis actions, accompanied only by his body-guard, he committed himself\ninto the hands of his enemy, whom he forthwith carried away with him,\nleaving a governor behind to hold the town for the Church. All prudent\nmen who were with the Pope remarked on his temerity, and on the\npusillanimity of Giovanpagolo; nor could they conjecture why the latter\nhad not, to his eternal glory, availed himself of this opportunity for\ncrushing his enemy, and at the same time enriching himself with\nplunder, the Pope being attended by the whole College of Cardinals with\nall their luxurious equipage. For it could not be supposed that he was\nwithheld by any promptings of goodness or scruples of conscience;\nbecause in the breast of a profligate living in incest with his sister,\nand who to obtain the princedom had put his nephews and kinsmen to\ndeath, no virtuous impulse could prevail. So that the only inference to\nbe drawn was, that men know not how to be splendidly wicked or wholly\ngood, and shrink in consequence from such crimes as are stamped with an\ninherent greatness or disclose a nobility of nature. For which reason\nGiovanpagolo, who thought nothing of incurring the guilt of incest, or\nof murdering his kinsmen, could not, or more truly durst not, avail\nhimself of a fair occasion to do a deed which all would have admired;\nwhich would have won for him a deathless fame as the first to teach the\nprelates how little those who live and reign as they do are to be\nesteemed; and which would have displayed a greatness far transcending\nany infamy or danger that could attach to it.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\u2014_Whence it came that the Romans were less ungrateful to\ntheir Citizens than were the Athenians_.\nIn the histories of all republics we meet with instances of some sort\nof ingratitude to their great citizens, but fewer in the history of\nRome than of Athens, or indeed of any other republic. Searching for the\ncause of this, I am persuaded that, so far as regards Rome and Athens,\nit was due to the Romans having had less occasion than the Athenians to\nlook upon their fellow-citizens with suspicion. For, from the expulsion\nof her kings down to the times of Sylla and Marius, the liberty of Rome\nwas never subverted by any one of her citizens; so that there never was\nin that city grave cause for distrusting any man, and in consequence\nmaking him the victim of inconsiderate injustice. The reverse was\nnotoriously the case with Athens; for that city, having, at a time when\nshe was most flourishing, been deprived of her freedom by Pisistratus\nunder a false show of good-will, remembering, after she regained her\nliberty, her former bondage and all the wrongs she had endured, became\nthe relentless chastiser, not of offences only on the part of her\ncitizens, but even of the shadow of an offence. Hence the banishment\nand death of so many excellent men, and hence the law of ostracism, and\nall those other violent measures which from time to time during the\nhistory of that city were directed against her foremost citizens. For\nthis is most true which is asserted by the writers on civil government,\nthat a people which has recovered its freedom, bites more fiercely than\none which has always preserved it.\nAnd any who shall weigh well what has been said, will not condemn\nAthens in this matter, nor commend Rome, but refer all to the necessity\narising out of the different conditions prevailing in the two States.\nFor careful reflection will show that had Rome been deprived of her\nfreedom as Athens was, she would not have been a whit more tender to\nher citizens. This we may reasonably infer from remarking what, after\nthe expulsion of the kings, befell Collatinus and Publius Valerius; the\nformer of whom, though he had taken part in the liberation of Rome, was\nsent into exile for no other reason than that he bore the name of\nTarquin; while the sole ground of suspicion against the latter, and\nwhat almost led to his banishment, was his having built a house upon\nthe C\u00e6lian hill. Seeing how harsh and suspicious Rome was in these two\ninstances, we may surmise that she would have shown the same\ningratitude as Athens, had she, like Athens, been wronged by her\ncitizens at an early stage of her growth, and before she had attained\nto the fulness of her strength.\nThat I may not have to return to this question of ingratitude, I shall\nsay all that remains to be said about it in my next Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\u2014_Whether a People or a Prince is the more ungrateful._\nIn connection with what has been said above, it seems proper to\nconsider whether more notable instances of ingratitude are supplied by\nprinces or peoples. And, to go to the root of the matter, I affirm that\nthis vice of ingratitude has its source either in avarice or in\nsuspicion. For a prince or people when they have sent forth a captain\non some important enterprise, by succeeding in which he earns a great\nname, are bound in return to reward him; and if moved by avarice and\ncovetousness they fail to do so, or if, instead of rewarding, they\nwrong and disgrace him, they commit an error which is not only without\nexcuse, but brings with it undying infamy. And, in fact, we find many\nprinces who have sinned in this way, for the cause given by Cornelius\nTacitus when he says, that \u201c_men are readier to pay back injuries than\nbenefits, since to requite a benefit is felt to be a burthen, to return\nan injury a gain_.\u201d[3]\n[3] Proclivius est injuri\u00e6 quam beneficio vicem exsolvere, quia gratia\noneri, ultio in quastu habetur. _Tacit. Hist._ iv. 2.\nWhen, however, reward is withheld, or, to speak more correctly, where\noffence is given, not from avarice but from suspicion, the prince or\npeople may deserve some excuse; and we read of many instances of\ningratitude proceeding from this cause. For the captain who by his\nvalour has won new dominions for his prince, since while overcoming his\nenemies, he at the same time covers himself with glory and enriches his\nsoldiers, must needs acquire such credit with his own followers, and\nwith the enemy, and also with the subjects of his prince, as cannot be\nwholly agreeable to the master who sent him forth. And since men are by\nnature ambitious as well as jealous, and none loves to set a limit to\nhis fortunes, the suspicion which at once lays hold of the prince when\nhe sees his captain victorious, is sure to be inflamed by some arrogant\nact or word of the captain himself. So that the prince will be unable\nto think of anything but how to secure himself; and to this end will\ncontrive how he may put his captain to death, or at any rate deprive\nhim of the credit he has gained with the army and among the people;\ndoing all he can to show that the victory was not won by his valour,\nbut by good fortune, or by the cowardice of the enemy, or by the skill\nand prudence of those commanders who were with him at this or the other\nbattle.\nAfter Vespasian, who was then in Jud\u00e6a, had been proclaimed emperor by\nhis army, Antonius Primus, who commanded another army in Illyria,\nadopted his cause, and marching into Italy against Vitellius who had\nbeen proclaimed emperor in Rome, courageously defeated two armies under\nthat prince, and occupied Rome; so that Mutianus, who was sent thither\nby Vespasian, found everything done to his hand, and all difficulties\nsurmounted by the valour of Antonius. But all the reward which Antonius\nhad for his pains, was, that Mutianus forthwith deprived him of his\ncommand of the army, and by degrees diminished his authority in Rome\ntill none was left him. Thereupon Antonius went to join Vespasian, who\nwas still in Asia; by whom he was so coldly received and so little\nconsidered, that in despair he put himself to death. And of cases like\nthis, history is full. Every man living at the present hour knows with\nwhat zeal and courage Gonsalvo of Cordova, while conducting the war in\nNaples against the French, conquered and subdued that kingdom for his\nmaster Ferdinand of Aragon; and how his services were requited by\nFerdinand coming from Aragon to Naples, and first of all depriving him\nof the command of the army, afterwards of the fortresses, and finally\ncarrying him back with him to Spain, where soon after he died in\ndisgrace.\nThis jealousy, then, is so natural to princes, that they cannot guard\nthemselves against it, nor show gratitude to those who serving under\ntheir standard have gained great victories and made great conquests on\ntheir behalf. And if it be impossible for princes to free their minds\nfrom such suspicions, there is nothing strange or surprising that a\npeople should be unable to do so. For as a city living under free\ninstitutions has two ends always before it, namely to acquire liberty\nand to preserve it, it must of necessity be led by its excessive\npassion for liberty to make mistakes in the pursuit of both these\nobjects. Of the mistakes it commits in the effort to acquire liberty, I\nshall speak, hereafter, in the proper place. Of mistakes committed in\nthe endeavour to preserve liberty are to be noted, the injuring those\ncitizens who ought to be rewarded, and the suspecting those who should\nbe trusted. Now, although in a State which has grown corrupt these\nerrors occasion great evils, and commonly lead to a tyranny, as\nhappened in Rome when C\u00e6sar took by force what ingratitude had denied\nhim, they are nevertheless the cause of much good in the republic which\nhas not been corrupted, since they prolong the duration of its free\ninstitutions, and make men, through fear of punishment, better and less\nambitious. Of all peoples possessed of great power, the Romans, for the\nreasons I have given, have undoubtedly been the least ungrateful, since\nwe have no other instance of their ingratitude to cite, save that of\nScipio. For both Coriolanus and Camillus were banished on account of\nthe wrongs which they inflicted on the commons; and though the former\nwas not forgiven because he constantly retained ill will against the\npeople, the latter was not only recalled, but for the rest of his life\nhonoured as a prince. But the ingratitude shown towards Scipio arose\nfrom the suspicion wherewith the citizens came to regard him, which\nthey had not felt in the case of the others, and which was occasioned\nby the greatness of the enemy whom he had overthrown, the fame he had\nwon by prevailing in so dangerous and protracted a war, the suddenness\nof his victories, and, finally, the favour which his youth, together\nwith his prudence and his other memorable qualities had gained for him.\nThese qualities were, in truth, so remarkable that the very\nmagistrates, not to speak of others, stood in awe of his authority, a\ncircumstance displeasing to prudent citizens, as before unheard of in\nRome. In short, his whole bearing and character were so much out of the\ncommon, that even the elder Cato, so celebrated for his austere virtue,\nwas the first to declare against him, saying that no city could be\ndeemed free which contained a citizen who was feared by the\nmagistrates. And since, in this instance, the Romans followed the\nopinion of Cato, they merit that excuse which, as I have said already,\nshould be extended to the prince or people who are ungrateful through\nsuspicion.\nIn conclusion it is to be said that while this vice of ingratitude has\nits origin either in avarice or in suspicion, commonwealths are rarely\nled into it by avarice, and far seldomer than princes by suspicion,\nhaving, as shall presently be shown, far less reason than princes for\nsuspecting.\nCHAPTER XXX.\u2014_How Princes and Commonwealths may avoid the vice of\nIngratitude; and how a Captain or Citizen may escape being undone by\nit._\nThat he may not be tormented by suspicion, nor show ungrateful, a\nprince should go himself on his wars as the Roman emperors did at\nfirst, as the Turk does now, and, in short, as all valiant princes have\ndone and do. For when it is the prince himself who conquers, the glory\nand the gain are all his own; but when he is absent, since the glory is\nanother\u2019s, it will seem to the prince that he profits nothing by the\ngain, unless that glory be quenched which he knew not how to win for\nhimself; and when he thus becomes ungrateful and unjust, doubtless his\nloss is greater than his gain. To the prince, therefore, who, either\nthrough indolence or from want of foresight, sends forth a captain to\nconduct his wars while he himself remains inactive at home, I have no\nadvice to offer which he does not already know. But I would counsel the\ncaptain whom he sends, since I am sure that he can never escape the\nattacks of ingratitude, to follow one or other of two courses, and\neither quit his command at once after a victory, and place himself in\nthe hands of his prince, while carefully abstaining from every\nvainglorious or ambitious act, so that the prince, being relieved from\nall suspicion, may be disposed to reward, or at any rate not to injure\nhim; or else, should he think it inexpedient for him to act in this\nway, to take boldly the contrary course, and fearlessly to follow out\nall such measures as he thinks will secure for himself, and not for his\nprince, whatever he has gained; conciliating the good-will of his\nsoldiers and fellow-citizens, forming new friendships with neighbouring\npotentates, placing his own adherents in fortified towns, corrupting\nthe chief officers of his army and getting rid of those whom he fails\nto corrupt, and by all similar means endeavouring to punish his master\nfor the ingratitude which he looks for at his hands. These are the only\ntwo courses open; but since, as I said before, men know not how to be\nwholly good or wholly bad, it will never happen that after a victory a\ncaptain will quit his army and conduct himself modestly, nor yet that\nhe will venture to use those hardy methods which have in them some\nstrain of greatness; and so, remaining undecided, he will be crushed\nwhile he still wavers and doubts.\nA commonwealth desiring to avoid the vice of ingratitude is, as\ncompared with a prince, at this disadvantage, that while a prince can\ngo himself on his expeditions, the commonwealth must send some one of\nits citizens. As a remedy, I would recommend that course being adopted\nwhich was followed by the Roman republic in order to be less ungrateful\nthan others, having its origin in the nature of the Roman government.\nFor the whole city, nobles and commons alike, taking part in her wars,\nthere were always found in Rome at every stage of her history, so many\nvaliant and successful soldiers, that by reason of their number, and\nfrom one acting as a check upon another, the nation had never ground to\nbe jealous of any one man among them; while they, on their part, lived\nuprightly, and were careful to betray no sign of ambition, nor give the\npeople the least cause to distrust them as ambitious; so that he\nobtained most glory from his dictatorship who was first to lay it down.\nWhich conduct, as it excited no suspicion, could occasion no\ningratitude.\nWe see, then, that the commonwealth which would have no cause to be\nungrateful, must act as Rome did; and that the citizen who would escape\ningratitude, must observe those precautions which were observed by\nRoman citizens.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\u2014_That the Roman Captains were never punished with extreme\nseverity for Misconduct; and where loss resulted to the Republic merely\nthrough their Ignorance or Want of Judgment, were not punished at all_.\nThe Romans were not only, as has been said above, less ungrateful than\nother republics, but were also more lenient and more considerate than\nothers in punishing the captains of their armies. For if these erred of\nset purpose, they chastised them with gentleness; while if they erred\nthrough ignorance, so far from punishing, they even honoured and\nrewarded them. And this conduct was well considered. For as they judged\nit of the utmost moment, that those in command of their armies should,\nin all they had to do, have their minds undisturbed and free from\nexternal anxieties, they would not add further difficulty and danger to\na task in itself both dangerous and difficult, lest none should ever be\nfound to act with valour. For supposing them to be sending forth an\narmy against Philip of Macedon in Greece or against Hannibal in Italy,\nor against any other enemy at whose hands they had already sustained\nreverses, the captain in command of that expedition would be weighted\nwith all the grave and important cares which attend such enterprises.\nBut if to all these cares, had been added the example of Roman generals\ncrucified or otherwise put to death for having lost battles, it would\nhave been impossible for a commander surrounded by so many causes for\nanxiety to have acted with vigour and decision. For which reason, and\nbecause they thought that to such persons the mere ignominy of defeat\nwas in itself punishment enough, they would not dishearten their\ngenerals by inflicting on them any heavier penalty.\nOf errors committed not through ignorance, the following is an\ninstance. Sergius and Virginius were engaged in the siege of Veii, each\nbeing in command of a division of the army, and while Sergius was set\nto guard against the approach of the Etruscans, it fell to Virginius to\nwatch the town. But Sergius being attacked by the Faliscans and other\ntribes, chose rather to be defeated and routed than ask aid from\nVirginius, who, on his part, awaiting the humiliation of his rival, was\nwilling to see his country dishonoured and an army destroyed, sooner\nthan go unasked to his relief. This was notable misconduct, and likely,\nunless both offenders were punished, to bring discredit on the Roman\nname. But whereas another republic would have punished these men with\ndeath, the Romans were content to inflict only a money fine: not\nbecause the offence did not in itself deserve severe handling, but\nbecause they were unwilling, for the reasons already given, to depart\nin this instance from their ancient practice.\nOf errors committed through ignorance we have no better example than in\nthe case of Varro, through whose rashness the Romans were defeated by\nHannibal at Cann\u00e6, where the republic well-nigh lost its liberty. But\nbecause he had acted through ignorance and with no evil design, they\nnot only refrained from punishing him, but even treated him with\ndistinction; the whole senate going forth to meet him on his return to\nRome, and as they could not thank him for having fought, thanking him\nfor having come back, and for not having despaired of the fortunes his\ncountry.\nAgain, when Papirius Cursor would have had Fabius put to death,\nbecause, contrary to his orders, he had fought with the Samnites, among\nthe reasons pleaded by the father of Fabius against the persistency of\nthe dictator, he urged that never on the occasion of the defeat of any\nof their captains had the Romans done what Papirius desired them to do\non the occasion of a victory.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\u2014_That a Prince or Commonwealth should not delay\nconferring Benefits until they are themselves in difficulties._\nThe Romans found it for their advantage to be generous to the commons\nat a season of danger, when Porsenna came to attack Rome and restore\nthe Tarquins. For the senate, apprehending that the people might choose\nrather to take back their kings than to support a war, secured their\nadherence by relieving them of the duty on salt and of all their other\nburthens; saying that \u201c_the poor did enough for the common welfare in\nrearing their offspring._\u201d In return for which indulgence the commons\nwere content to undergo war, siege, and famine. Let no one however,\nrelying on this example, delay conciliating the people till danger has\nactually come; or, if he do, let him not hope to have the same good\nfortune as the Romans. For the mass of the people will consider that\nthey have to thank not him, but his enemies, and that there is ground\nto fear that when the danger has passed away, he will take back what he\ngave under compulsion, and, therefore, that to him they lie under no\nobligation. And the reason why the course followed by the Romans\nsucceeded, was that the State was still new and unsettled. Besides\nwhich, the people knew that laws had already been passed in their\nfavour, as, for instance, the law allowing an appeal to the tribunes,\nand could therefore persuade themselves that the benefits granted them\nproceeded from the good-will entertained towards them by the senate,\nand were not due merely to the approach of an enemy. Moreover, the\nmemory of their kings, by whom they had in many ways been wronged and\nill-treated, was still fresh in their minds. But since like conditions\nseldom recur, it can only rarely happen that like remedies are useful.\nWherefore, all, whether princes or republics, who hold the reins of\ngovernment, ought to think beforehand of the adverse times which may\nawait them, and of what help they may then stand in need; and ought so\nto live with their people as they would think right were they suffering\nunder any calamity. And, whosoever, whether prince or republic, but\nprince more especially, behaves otherwise, and believes that after the\nevent and when danger is upon him he will be able to win men over by\nbenefits, deceives himself, and will not merely fail to maintain his\nplace, but will even precipitate his downfall.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\u2014_When a Mischief has grown up in, or against a State,\nit is safer to temporize with than to meet it with Violence_.\nAs Rome grew in fame, power, and dominion, her neighbours, who at first\nhad taken no heed to the injury which this new republic might do them,\nbegan too late to see their mistake, and desiring to remedy what should\nhave been remedied before, combined against her to the number of forty\nnations. Whereupon the Romans, resorting to a method usual with them in\nseasons of peril, appointed a dictator; that is, gave power to one man\nto decide without advice, and carry out his resolves without appeal.\nWhich expedient, as it then enabled them to overcome the dangers by\nwhich they were threatened, so always afterwards proved most\nserviceable, when, at any time during the growth of their power,\ndifficulties arose to embarrass their republic.\nIn connection with this league against Rome we have first to note, that\nwhen a mischief which springs up either in or against a republic, and\nwhether occasioned by internal or external causes, has grown to such\nproportions that it begins to fill the whole community with alarm, it\nis a far safer course to temporize with it than to attempt to quell it\nby violence. For commonly those who make this attempt only add fuel to\nthe flame, and hasten the impending ruin. Such disorders arise in a\nrepublic more often from internal causes than external, either through\nsome citizen being suffered to acquire undue influence, or from the\ncorruption of some institution of that republic, which had once been\nthe life and sinew of its freedom; and from this corruption being\nallowed to gain such head that the attempt to check it is more\ndangerous than to let it be. And it is all the harder to recognize\nthese disorders in their beginning, because it seems natural to men to\nlook with favour on the beginnings of things. Favour of this sort, more\nthan by anything else, is attracted by those actions which seem to have\nin them a quality of greatness, or which are performed by the young.\nFor when in a republic some young man is seen to come forward endowed\nwith rare excellence, the eyes of all the citizens are at once turned\nupon him, and all, without distinction, concur to do him honour; so\nthat if he have one spark of ambition, the advantages which he has from\nnature, together with those he takes from this favourable disposition\nof men\u2019s minds, raise him to such a pitch of power, that when the\ncitizens at last see their mistake it is almost impossible for them to\ncorrect it; and when they do what they can to oppose his influence the\nonly result is to extend it. Of this I might cite numerous examples,\nbut shall content myself with one relating to our own city.\nCosimo de\u2019 Medici, to whom the house of the Medici in Florence owes the\norigin of its fortunes, acquired so great a name from the favour\nwherewith his own prudence and the blindness of others invested him,\nthat coming to be held in awe by the government, his fellow-citizens\ndeemed it dangerous to offend him, but still more dangerous to let him\nalone. Nicol\u00f2 da Uzzano, his cotemporary, who was accounted well versed\nin all civil affairs, but who had made a first mistake in not\ndiscerning the dangers which might grow from the rising influence of\nCosimo, would never while he lived, permit a second mistake to be made\nin attempting to crush him; judging that such an attempt would be the\nruin of the State, as in truth it proved after his death. For some who\nsurvived him, disregarding his counsels, combined against Cosimo and\nbanished him from Florence. And so it came about that the partisans of\nCosimo, angry at the wrong done him, soon afterwards recalled him and\nmade him prince of the republic, a dignity he never would have reached\nbut for this open opposition. The very same thing happened in Rome in\nthe case of C\u00e6sar. For his services having gained him the good-will of\nPompey and other citizens, their favour was presently turned to fear,\nas Cicero testifies where he says that \u201cit was late that Pompey began\nto fear C\u00e6sar.\u201d This fear led men to think of remedies, and the\nremedies to which they resorted accelerated the destruction of the\nrepublic.\nI say, then, that since it is difficult to recognize these disorders in\ntheir beginning, because of the false impressions which things produce\nat the first, it is a wiser course when they become known, to temporize\nwith them than to oppose them; for when you temporize, either they die\nout of themselves, or at any rate the injury they do is deferred. And\nthe prince who would suppress such disorders or oppose himself to their\nforce and onset, must always be on his guard, lest he help where he\nwould hinder, retard when he would advance, and drown the plant he\nthinks to water. He must therefore study well the symptoms of the\ndisease; and, if he believe himself equal to the cure, grapple with it\nfearlessly; if not, he must let it be, and not attempt to treat it in\nany way. For, otherwise, it will fare with him as it fared with those\nneighbours of Rome, for whom it would have been safer, after that city\nhad grown to be so great, to have sought to soothe and restrain her by\npeaceful arts, than to provoke her by open war to contrive new means of\nattack and new methods of defence. For this league had no other effect\nthan to make the Romans more united and resolute than before, and to\nbethink themselves of new expedients whereby their power was still more\nrapidly advanced; among which was the creation of a dictator; for this\ninnovation not only enabled them to surmount the dangers which then\nthreatened them, but was afterwards the means of escaping infinite\ncalamities into which, without it, the republic must have fallen.\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\u2014_That the authority of the Dictator did good and not\nharm to the Roman Republic: and that it is not those Powers which are\ngiven by the free suffrages of the People, but those which ambitious\nCitizens usurp for themselves, that are pernicious to a State._\nThose citizens who first devised a dictatorship for Rome have been\nblamed by certain writers, as though this had been the cause of the\ntyranny afterwards established there. For these authors allege that the\nfirst tyrant of Rome governed it with the title of Dictator, and that,\nbut for the existence of the office, C\u00e6sar could never have cloaked his\nusurpation under a constitutional name. He who first took up this\nopinion had not well considered the matter, and his conclusion has been\naccepted without good ground. For it was not the name nor office of\nDictator which brought Rome to servitude, but the influence which\ncertain of her citizens were able to assume from the prolongation of\ntheir term of power; so that even had the name of Dictator been wanting\nin Rome, some other had been found to serve their ends, since power may\nreadily give titles, but not titles power. We find, accordingly, that\nwhile the dictatorship was conferred in conformity with public\nordinances, and not through personal influence, it was constantly\nbeneficial to the city. For it is the magistracies created and the\npowers usurped in unconstitutional ways that hurt a republic, not those\nwhich conform to ordinary rule; so that in Rome, through the whole\nperiod of her history, we never find a dictator who acted otherwise\nthan well for the republic. For which there were the plainest reasons.\nIn the first place, to enable a citizen to work harm and to acquire\nundue authority, many circumstances must be present which never can be\npresent in a State which is not corrupted. For such a citizen must be\nexceedingly rich, and must have many retainers and partisans, whom he\ncannot have where the laws are strictly observed, and who, if he had\nthem, would occasion so much alarm, that the free suffrage of the\npeople would seldom be in his favour. In the second place, the dictator\nwas not created for life, but for a fixed term, and only to meet the\nemergency for which he was appointed. Power was indeed given him to\ndetermine by himself what measures the exigency demanded; to do what he\nhad to do without consultation; and to punish without appeal. But he\nhad no authority to do anything to the prejudice of the State, as it\nwould have been to deprive the senate or the people of their\nprivileges, to subvert the ancient institutions of the city, or\nintroduce new. So that taking into account the brief time for which his\noffice lasted, its limited authority, and the circumstance that the\nRoman people were still uncorrupted, it was impossible for him to\noverstep the just limits of his power so as to injure the city; and in\nfact we find that he was always useful to it.\nAnd, in truth, among the institutions of Rome, this of the dictatorship\ndeserves our special admiration, and to be linked with the chief causes\nof her greatness; for without some such safeguard a city can hardly\npass unharmed through extraordinary dangers. Because as the ordinary\ninstitutions of a commonwealth work but slowly, no council and no\nmagistrate having authority to act in everything alone, but in most\nmatters one standing in need of the other, and time being required to\nreconcile their differences, the remedies which they provide are most\ndangerous when they have to be applied in cases which do not brook\ndelay. For which reason, every republic ought to have some resource of\nthis nature provided by its constitution; as we find that the Republic\nof Venice, one of the best of those now existing, has in cases of\nurgent danger reserved authority to a few of her citizens, if agreed\namong themselves, to determine without further consultation what course\nis to be followed. When a republic is not provided with some safeguard\nsuch as this, either it must be ruined by observing constitutional\nforms, or else, to save it, these must be broken through. But in a\nrepublic nothing should be left to be effected by irregular methods,\nbecause, although for the time the irregularity may be useful, the\nexample will nevertheless be pernicious, as giving rise to a practice\nof violating the laws for good ends, under colour of which they may\nafterwards be violated for ends which are not good. For which reason,\nthat can never become a perfect republic wherein every contingency has\nnot been foreseen and provided for by the laws, and the method of\ndealing with it defined. To sum up, therefore, I say that those\nrepublics which cannot in sudden emergencies resort either to a\ndictator or to some similar authority, will, when the danger is\nserious, always be undone.\nWe may note, moreover, how prudently the Romans, in introducing this\nnew office, contrived the conditions under which it was to be\nexercised. For perceiving that the appointment of a dictator involved\nsomething of humiliation for the consuls, who, from being the heads of\nthe State, were reduced to render obedience like every one else, and\nanticipating that this might give offence, they determined that the\npower to appoint should rest with the consuls, thinking that when the\noccasion came when Rome should have need of this regal authority, they\nwould have the consuls acting willingly and feeling the less aggrieved\nfrom the appointment being in their own hands. For those wounds or\nother injuries which a man inflicts upon himself by choice, and of his\nown free will, pain him far less than those inflicted by another.\nNevertheless, in the later days of the republic the Romans were wont to\nentrust this power to a consul instead of to a dictator, using the\nformula, _Videat_ CONSUL _ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat_.\nBut to return to the matter in hand, I say briefly, that when the\nneighbours of Rome sought to crush her, they led her to take measures\nnot merely for her readier defence, but such as enabled her to attack\nthem with a stronger force, with better skill, and with an undivided\ncommand.\nCHAPTER XXXV\u2014_Why the Creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, although\nbrought about by the free and open Suffrage of the Citizens, was\nhurtful to the Liberties of that Republic_\nThe fact of those ten citizens who were chosen by the Roman people to\nmake laws for Rome, in time becoming her tyrants and depriving her of\nher freedom, may seem contrary to what I have said above, namely that\nit is the authority which is violently usurped, and not that conferred\nby the free suffrages of the people which is injurious to a republic.\nHere, however, we have to take into account both the mode in which, and\nthe term for which authority is given. Where authority is unrestricted\nand is conferred for a long term, meaning by that for a year or more,\nit is always attended with danger, and its results will be good or bad\naccording as the men are good or bad to whom it is committed. Now when\nwe compare the authority of the Ten with that possessed by the\ndictator, we see that the power placed in the hands of the former was\nout of all proportion greater than that entrusted to the latter. For\nwhen a dictator was appointed there still remained the tribunes, the\nconsuls, and the senate, all of them invested with authority of which\nthe dictator could not deprive them. For even if he could have taken\nhis consulship from one man, or his status as a senator from another,\nhe could not abolish the senatorial rank nor pass new laws. So that the\nsenate, the consuls, and the tribunes continuing to exist with\nundiminished authority were a check upon him and kept him in the right\nroad. But on the creation of the Ten, the opposite of all this took\nplace. For on their appointment, consuls and tribunes were swept away,\nand express powers were given to the new magistrates to make laws and\ndo whatever else they thought fit, with the entire authority of the\nwhole Roman people. So that finding themselves alone without consuls or\ntribunes to control them, and with no appeal against them to the\npeople, and thus there being none to keep a watch upon them, and\nfurther being stimulated by the ambition of Appius, in the second year\nof their office they began to wax insolent.\nLet it be noted, therefore, that when it is said that authority given\nby the public vote is never hurtful to any commonwealth, it is assumed\nthat the people will never be led to confer that authority without due\nlimitations, or for other than a reasonable term. Should they, however\neither from being deceived or otherwise blinded, be induced to bestow\nauthority imprudently, as the Romans bestowed it on the Ten, it will\nalways fare with them as with the Romans. And this may readily be\nunderstood on reflecting what causes operated to keep the dictator\ngood, what to make the Ten bad, and by observing how those republics\nwhich have been accounted well governed, have acted when conferring\nauthority for an extended period, as the Spartans on their kings and\nthe Venetians on their doges; for it will be seen that in both these\ninstances the authority was controlled by checks which made it\nimpossible for it to be abused. But where an uncontrolled authority is\ngiven, no security is afforded by the circumstance that the body of the\npeople is not corrupted; for in the briefest possible time absolute\nauthority will make a people corrupt, and obtain for itself friends and\npartisans. Nor will it be any hindrance to him in whom such authority\nis vested, that he is poor and without connections, for wealth and\nevery other advantage will quickly follow, as shall be shown more fully\nwhen we discuss the appointment of the Ten.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\u2014_That Citizens who have held the higher Offices of a\nCommonwealth should not disdain the lower_.\nUnder the consuls M. Fabius and Cn. Manlius, the Romans had a memorable\nvictory in a battle fought with the Veientines and the Etruscans, in\nwhich Q. Fabius, brother of the consul, who had himself been consul the\nyear before, was slain. This event may lead us to remark how well the\nmethods followed by the city of Rome were suited to increase her power,\nand how great a mistake is made by other republics in departing from\nthem. For, eager as the Romans were in the pursuit of glory, they never\nesteemed it a dishonour to obey one whom before they had commanded, or\nto find themselves serving in the ranks of an army which once they had\nled. This usage, however, is opposed to the ideas, the rules, and the\npractice which prevail at the present day, as, for instance, in Venice,\nwhere the notion still obtains that a citizen who has filled a great\noffice should be ashamed to accept a less; and where the State itself\npermits him to decline it. This course, assuming it to lend lustre to\nindividual citizens, is plainly to the disadvantage of the community,\nwhich has reason to hope more from, and to trust more to, the citizen\nwho descends from a high office to fill a lower, than him who rises\nfrom a low office to fill a high one; for in the latter no confidence\ncan reasonably be placed, unless he be seen to have others about him of\nsuch credit and worth that it may be hoped their wise counsels and\ninfluence will correct his inexperience. But had the usage which\nprevails in Venice and in other modern commonwealths and kingdoms,\nprevailed in Rome whereby he who had once been consul was never\nafterwards to go with the army except as consul, numberless results\nmust have followed detrimental to the free institutions of that city;\nas well from the mistakes which the inexperience of new men would have\noccasioned, as because from their ambition having a freer course, and\nfrom their having none near them in whose presence they might fear to\ndo amiss, they would have grown less scrupulous; and in this way the\npublic service must have suffered grave harm.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\u2014_Of the Mischief bred in Rome by the Agrarian Law: and\nhow it is a great source of disorder in a Commonwealth to pass a Law\nopposed to ancient Usage and with stringent retrospective Effect._\nIt has been said by ancient writers that to be pinched by adversity or\npampered by prosperity is the common lot of men, and that in whichever\nway they are acted upon the result is the same. For when no longer\nurged to war on one another by necessity, they are urged by ambition,\nwhich has such dominion in their hearts that it never leaves them to\nwhatsoever heights they climb. For nature has so ordered it that while\nthey desire everything, it is impossible for them to have everything,\nand thus their desires being always in excess of their capacity to\ngratify them, they remain constantly dissatisfied and discontented. And\nhence the vicissitudes in human affairs. For some seeking to enlarge\ntheir possessions, and some to keep what they have got, wars and\nenmities ensue, from which result the ruin of one country and the\ngrowth of another.\nI am led to these reflections from observing that the commons of Rome\nwere not content to secure themselves against the nobles by the\ncreation of tribunes, a measure to which they were driven by necessity,\nbut after effecting this, forthwith entered upon an ambitious contest\nwith the nobles, seeking to share with them what all men most esteem,\nnamely, their honours and their wealth. Hence was bred that disorder\nfrom which sprang the feuds relating to the Agrarian Laws, and which\nled in the end to the downfall of the Roman republic. And although it\nshould be the object of every well-governed commonwealth to make the\nState rich and keep individual citizens poor it must be allowed that in\nthe matter of this law the city of Rome was to blame; whether for\nhaving passed it at first in such a shape as to require it to be\ncontinually recast; or for having postponed it so long that its\nretrospective effect was the occasion of tumult; or else, because,\nalthough rightly framed at first, it had come in its operation to be\nperverted. But in whatever way it happened, so it was, that this law\nwas never spoken of in Rome without the whole city being convulsed.\nThe law itself embraced two principal provisions. By one it was enacted\nthat no citizen should possess more than a fixed number of acres of\nland; by the other that all lands taken from the enemy should be\ndistributed among the whole people. A twofold blow was thus aimed at\nthe nobles; since all who possessed more land than the law allowed, as\nmost of the nobles did, fell to be deprived of it; while by dividing\nthe lands of the enemy among the whole people, the road to wealth was\nclosed. These two grounds of offence being given to a powerful class,\nto whom it appeared that by resisting the law they did a service to the\nState, the whole city, as I have said, was thrown into an uproar on the\nmere mention of its name. The nobles indeed sought to temporize, and to\nprevail by patience and address; sometimes calling out the army,\nsometimes opposing another tribune to the one who was promoting the\nlaw, and sometimes coming to a compromise by sending a colony into the\nlands which were to be divided; as was done in the case of the\nterritory of Antium, whither, on a dispute concerning the law having\narisen, settlers were sent from Rome, and the land made over to them.\nIn speaking of which colony Titus Livius makes the notable remark, that\nhardly any one in Rome could be got to take part in it, so much readier\nwere the commons to indulge in covetous schemes at home, than to\nrealize them by leaving it.\nThe ill humour engendered by this contest continued to prevail until\nthe Romans began to carry their arms into the remoter parts of Italy\nand to countries beyond its shores; after which it seemed for a time to\nslumber\u2014and this, because the lands held by the enemies of Rome, out of\nsight of her citizens and too remote to be conveniently cultivated,\ncame to be less desired. Whereupon the Romans grew less eager to punish\ntheir enemies by dividing their lands, and were content, when they\ndeprived any city of its territory, to send colonists to occupy it. For\ncauses such as these, the measure remained in abeyance down to the time\nof the Gracchi; but being by them revived, finally overthrew the\nliberty of Rome. For as it found the power of its adversaries doubled,\nsuch a flame of hatred was kindled between commons and senate, that,\nregardless of all civil restraints, they resorted to arms and\nbloodshed. And as the public magistrates were powerless to provide a\nremedy, each of the two factions having no longer any hopes from them,\nresolved to do what it could for itself, and to set up a chief for its\nown protection. On reaching this stage of tumult and disorder, the\ncommons lent their influence to Marius, making him four times consul;\nwhose authority, lasting thus long, and with very brief intervals,\nbecame so firmly rooted that he was able to make himself consul other\nthree times. Against this scourge, the nobles, lacking other defence,\nset themselves to favour Sylla, and placing him at the head of their\nfaction, entered on the civil wars; wherein, after much blood had been\nspilt, and after many changes of fortune, they got the better of their\nadversaries. But afterwards, in the time of C\u00e6sar and Pompey, the\ndistemper broke out afresh; for C\u00e6sar heading the Marian party, and\nPompey, that of Sylla, and war ensuing, the victory remained with\nC\u00e6sar, who was the first tyrant in Rome; after whose time that city was\nnever again free. Such, therefore, was the beginning and such the end\nof the Agrarian Law.\nBut since it has elsewhere been said that the struggle between the\ncommons and senate of Rome preserved her liberties, as giving rise to\nlaws favourable to freedom, it might seem that the consequences of the\nAgrarian Law are opposed to that view. I am not, however, led to alter\nmy opinion on this account; for I maintain that the ambition of the\ngreat is so pernicious that unless controlled and counteracted in a\nvariety of ways, it will always reduce a city to speedy ruin. So that\nif the controversy over the Agrarian Laws took three hundred years to\nbring Rome to slavery, she would in all likelihood have been brought to\nslavery in a far shorter time, had not the commons, by means of this\nlaw, and by other demands, constantly restrained the ambition of the\nnobles.\nWe may also learn from this contest how much more men value wealth than\nhonours; for in the matter of honours, the Roman nobles always gave way\nto the commons without any extraordinary resistance; but when it came\nto be a question of property, so stubborn were they in its defence,\nthat the commons to effect their ends had to resort to those irregular\nmethods which have been described above. Of which irregularities the\nprime movers were the Gracchi, whose motives are more to be commended\nthan their measures; since to pass a law with stringent retrospective\neffect, in order to remove an abuse of long standing in a republic, is\nan unwise step, and one which, as I have already shown at length, can\nhave no other result than to accelerate the mischief to which the abuse\nleads; whereas, if you temporize, either the abuse develops more\nslowly, or else, in course of time, and before it comes to a head, dies\nout of itself.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\u2014_That weak Republics are irresolute and undecided; and\nthat the course they may take depends more on Necessity than Choice._\nA terrible pestilence breaking out in Rome seemed to the Equians and\nVolscians to offer a fit opportunity for crushing her. The two nations,\ntherefore, assembling a great army, attacked the Latins and Hernicians\nand laid waste their country. Whereupon the Latins and Hernicians were\nforced to make their case known to the Romans, and to ask to be\ndefended by them. The Romans, who were sorely afflicted by the\npestilence, answered that they must look to their own defence, and with\ntheir own forces, since Rome was in no position to succour them.\nHere we recognize the prudence and magnanimity of the Roman senate, and\nhow at all times, and in all changes of fortune, they assumed the\nresponsibility of determining the course their country should take; and\nwere not ashamed, when necessary, to decide on a course contrary to\nthat which was usual with them, or which they had decided to follow on\nsome other occasion. I say this because on other occasions this same\nsenate had forbidden these nations to defend themselves; and a less\nprudent assembly might have thought it lowered their credit to withdraw\nthat prohibition. But the Roman senate always took a sound view of\nthings, and always accepted the least hurtful course as the best. So\nthat, although it was distasteful to them not to be able to defend\ntheir subjects, and equally distasteful\u2014both for the reasons given, and\nfor others which may be understood\u2014that their subjects should take up\narms in their absence, nevertheless knowing that these must have\nrecourse to arms in any case, since the enemy was upon them, they took\nan honourable course in deciding that what had to be done should be\ndone with their leave, lest men driven to disobey by necessity should\ncome afterwards to disobey from choice. And although this may seem the\ncourse which every republic ought reasonably to follow, nevertheless\nweak and badly-advised republics cannot make up their minds to follow\nit, not knowing how to do themselves honour in like extremities.\nAfter Duke Valentino had taken Faenza and forced Bologna to yield to\nhis terms, desiring to return to Rome through Tuscany, he sent one of\nhis people to Florence to ask leave for himself and his army to pass. A\ncouncil was held in Florence to consider how this request should be\ndealt with, but no one was favourable to the leave asked for being\ngranted. Wherein the Roman method was not followed. For as the Duke had\na very strong force with him, while the Florentines were so bare of\ntroops that they could not have prevented his passage, it would have\nbeen far more for their credit that he should seem to pass with their\nconsent, than that he should pass in spite of them; because, while\ndiscredit had to be incurred either way, they would have incurred less\nby acceding to his demand.\nBut of all courses the worst for a weak State is to be irresolute; for\nthen whatever it does will seem to be done under compulsion, so that if\nby chance it should do anything well, this will be set down to\nnecessity and not to prudence. Of this I shall cite two other instances\nhappening in our own times, and in our own country. In the year 1500,\nKing Louis of France, after recovering Milan, being desirous to restore\nPisa to the Florentines, so as to obtain payment from them of the fifty\nthousand ducats which they had promised him on the restitution being\ncompleted, sent troops to Pisa under M. Beaumont, in whom, though a\nFrenchman, the Florentines put much trust. Beaumont accordingly took up\nhis position with his forces between Cascina and Pisa, to be in\nreadiness to attack the town. After he had been there for some days\nmaking arrangements for the assault, envoys came to him from Pisa\noffering to surrender their city to the French if a promise were given\nin the king\u2019s name, not to hand it over to the Florentines until four\nmonths had run. This condition was absolutely rejected by the\nFlorentines, and the siege being proceeded with, they were forced to\nretire with disgrace. Now the proposal of the Pisans was rejected by\nthe Florentines for no other reason than that they distrusted the good\nfaith of the King, into whose hands their weakness obliged them to\ncommit themselves, and did not reflect how much more it was for their\ninterest that, by obtaining entrance into Pisa, he should have it in\nhis power to restore the town to them, or, failing to restore it,\nshould at once disclose his designs, than that remaining outside he\nshould put them off with promises for which they had to pay. It would\ntherefore have been a far better course for the Florentines to have\nagreed to Beaumont taking possession on whatever terms.\nThis was seen afterwards by experience in the year 1502, when, on the\nrevolt of Arezzo, M. Imbalt was sent by the King of France with French\ntroops to assist the Florentines. For when he got near Arezzo, and\nbegan to negotiate with the Aretines, who, like the Pisans, were\nwilling to surrender their town on terms, the acceptance of these terms\nwas strongly disapproved in Florence; which Imbalt learning, and\nthinking that the Florentines were acting with little sense, he took\nthe entire settlement of conditions into his own hands, and, without\nconsulting the Florentine commissioners, concluded an arrangement to\nhis own satisfaction, in execution of which he entered Arezzo with his\narmy. And he let the Florentines know that he thought them fools and\nignorant of the ways of the world; since if they desired to have\nArezzo, they could signify their wishes to the King, who would be much\nbetter able to give it them when he had his soldiers inside, than when\nhe had them outside the town. Nevertheless, in Florence they never\nceased to blame and abuse M. Imbalt, until at last they came to see\nthat if Beaumont had acted in the same way, they would have got\npossession Of Pisa as well as of Arezzo.\nApplying what has been said to the matter in hand, we find that\nirresolute republics, unless upon compulsion, never follow wise\ncourses; for wherever there is room for doubt, their weakness will not\nsuffer them to come to any resolve; so that unless their doubts be\novercome by some superior force which impels them forward, they remain\nalways in suspense.\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\u2014_That often the same Accidents are seen to befall\ndifferent Nations._\nAny one comparing the present with the past will soon perceive that in\nall cities and in all nations there prevail the same desires and\npassions as always have prevailed; for which reason it should be an\neasy matter for him who carefully examines past events, to foresee\nthose which are about to happen in any republic, and to apply such\nremedies as the ancients have used in like cases; or finding none which\nhave been used by them, to strike out new ones, such as they might have\nused in similar circumstances. But these lessons being neglected or not\nunderstood by readers, or, if understood by them, being unknown to\nrulers, it follows that the same disorders are common to all times.\nIn the year 1494 the Republic of Florence, having lost a portion of its\nterritories, including Pisa and other towns, was forced to make war\nagainst those who had taken possession of them, who being powerful, it\nfollowed that great sums were spent on these wars to little purpose.\nThis large expenditure had to be met by heavy taxes which gave occasion\nto numberless complaints on the part of the people; and inasmuch as the\nwar was conducted by a council of ten citizens, who were styled \u201cthe\nTen of the War,\u201d the multitude began to regard these with displeasure,\nas though they were the cause of the war and of the consequent\nexpenditure; and at last persuaded themselves that if they got rid of\nthis magistracy there would be an end to the war. Wherefore when the\nmagistracy of \u201cthe Ten\u201d should have been renewed, the people did not\nrenew it, but, suffering it to lapse, entrusted their affairs to the\n\u201cSignory.\u201d This course was most pernicious, since not only did it fail\nto put an end to the war, as the people expected it would, but by\nsetting aside men who had conducted it with prudence, led to such\nmishaps that not Pisa only, but Arezzo also, and many other towns\nbesides were lost to Florence. Whereupon, the people recognizing their\nmistake, and that the evil was in the disease and not in the physician,\nreinstated the magistracy of the Ten.\nSimilar dissatisfaction grew up in Rome against the consular authority.\nFor the people seeing one war follow another, and that they were never\nallowed to rest, when they should have ascribed this to the ambition of\nneighbouring nations who desired their overthrow, ascribed it to the\nambition of the nobles, who, as they believed, being unable to wreak\ntheir hatred against them within the city, where they were protected by\nthe power of the tribunes, sought to lead them outside the city, where\nthey were under the authority of the consuls, that they might crush\nthem where they were without help. In which belief they thought it\nnecessary either to get rid of the consuls altogether, or so to\nrestrict their powers as to leave them no authority over the people,\neither in the city or out of it.\nThe first who attempted to pass a law to this effect was the tribune\nTerentillus, who proposed that a committee of five should be named to\nconsider and regulate the power of the consuls. This roused the anger\nof the nobles, to whom it seemed that the greatness of their authority\nwas about to set for ever, and that no part would be left them in the\nadministration of the republic. Such, however, was the obstinacy of the\ntribunes, that they succeeded in abolishing the consular title, nor\nwere satisfied until, after other changes, it was resolved that, in\nroom of consuls, tribunes should be appointed with consular powers; so\nmuch greater was their hatred of the name than of the thing. For a long\ntime matters remained on this footing; till eventually, the commons,\ndiscovering their mistake, resumed the appointment of consuls in the\nsame way as the Florentines reverted to \u201cthe Ten of the War.\u201d\nCHAPTER XL.\u2014_Of the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, and what\ntherein is to be noted. Wherein among other Matters is shown how the\nsame Causes may lead to the Safety or to the Ruin of a Commonwealth._\nIt being my desire to treat fully of those disorders which arose in\nRome on the creation of the decemvirate, I think it not amiss first of\nall to relate what took place at the time of that creation, and then to\ndiscuss those circumstances attending it which seem most to deserve\nnotice. These are numerous, and should be well considered, both by\nthose who would maintain the liberties of a commonwealth and by those\nwho would subvert them. For in the course of our inquiry it will be\nseen that many mistakes prejudicial to freedom were made by the senate\nand people, and that many were likewise made by Appius, the chief\ndecemvir, prejudicial to that tyranny which it was his aim to establish\nin Rome.\nAfter much controversy and wrangling between the commons and the nobles\nas to the framing of new laws by which the freedom of Rome might be\nbetter secured, Spurius Posthumius and two other citizens were, by\ngeneral consent, despatched to Athens to procure copies of the laws\nwhich Solon had drawn up for the Athenians, to the end that these might\nserve as a groundwork for the laws of Rome. On their return, the next\nstep was to depute certain persons to examine these laws and to draft\nthe new code. For which purpose a commission consisting of ten members,\namong whom was Appius Claudius, a crafty and ambitious citizen, was\nappointed for a year; and that the commissioners in framing their laws\nmight act without fear or favour, all the other magistracies, and in\nparticular the consulate and tribuneship, were suspended, and the\nappeal to the people discontinued; so that the decemvirs came to be\nabsolute in Rome. Very soon the whole authority of the commissioners\ncame to be centred in Appius, owing to the favour in which he was held\nby the commons. For although before he had been regarded as the cruel\npersecutor of the people, he now showed himself so conciliatory in his\nbearing that men wondered at the sudden change in his character and\ndisposition.\nThis set of commissioners, then, behaved discreetly, being attended by\nno more than twelve lictors, walking in front of that decemvir whom the\nrest put forward as their chief; and though vested with absolute\nauthority, yet when a Roman citizen had to be tried for murder, they\ncited him before the people and caused him to be judged by them. Their\nlaws they wrote upon ten tables, but before signing them they exposed\nthem publicly, that every one might read and consider them, and if any\ndefect were discovered in them, it might be corrected before they were\nfinally passed. At this juncture Appius caused it to be notified\nthroughout the city that were two other tables added to these ten, the\nlaws would be complete; hoping that under this belief the people would\nconsent to continue the decemvirate for another year. This consent the\npeople willingly gave, partly to prevent the consuls being reinstated,\nand partly because they thought they could hold their ground without\nthe aid of the tribunes, who, as has already been said, were the judges\nin criminal cases.\nOn it being resolved to reappoint the decemvirate, all the nobles set\nto canvass for the office, Appius among the foremost; and such\ncordiality did he display towards the commons while seeking their\nvotes, that the other candidates, \u201c_unable to persuade themselves that\nso much affability on the part of so proud a man was wholly\ndisinterested,_\u201d began to suspect him; but fearing to oppose him\nopenly, sought to circumvent him, by putting him forward, though the\nyoungest of them all, to declare to the people the names of the\nproposed decemvirs; thinking that he would not venture to name himself,\nthat being an unusual course in Rome, and held discreditable. \u201c_But\nwhat they meant as a hindrance, he turned to account,_\u201d by proposing,\nto the surprise and displeasure of the whole nobility, his own name\nfirst, and then nominating nine others on whose support he thought he\ncould depend.\nThe new appointments, which were to last for a year, having been made,\nAppius soon let both commons and nobles know the mistake they had\ncommitted, for throwing off the mask, he allowed his innate arrogance\nto appear, and speedily infected his colleagues with the same spirit;\nwho, to overawe the people and the senate, instead of twelve lictors,\nappointed one hundred and twenty. For a time their measures were\ndirected against high and low alike; but presently they began to\nintrigue with the senate, and to attack the commons; and if any of the\nlatter, on being harshly used by one decemvir, ventured to appeal to\nanother, he was worse handled on the appeal than in the first instance.\nThe commons, on discovering their error, began in their despair to turn\ntheir eyes towards the nobles, \u201c_and to look for a breeze of freedom\nfrom that very quarter whence fearing slavery they had brought the\nrepublic to its present straits._\u201d To the nobles the sufferings of the\ncommons were not displeasing, from the hope \u201c_that disgusted with the\nexisting state of affairs, they too might come to desire the\nrestoration of the consuls._\u201d\nWhen the year for which the decemvirs were appointed at last came to an\nend, the two additional tables of the law were ready, but had not yet\nbeen published. This was made a pretext by them for prolonging their\nmagistracy, which they took measures to retain by force, gathering\nround them for this purpose a retinue of young noblemen, whom they\nenriched with the goods of those citizens whom they had condemned.\n\u201c_Corrupted by which gifts, these youths came to prefer selfish licence\nto public freedom._\u201d\nIt happened that at this time the Sabines and Volscians began to stir\nup a war against Rome, and it was during the alarm thereby occasioned\nthat the decemvirs were first made aware how weak was their position.\nFor without the senate they could take no warlike measures, while by\nassembling the senate they seemed to put an end to their own authority.\nNevertheless, being driven to it by necessity, they took this latter\ncourse. When the senate met, many of the senators, but particularly\nValerius and Horatius, inveighed against the insolence of the\ndecemvirs, whose power would forthwith have been cut short, had not the\nsenate through jealousy of the commons declined to exercise their\nauthority. For they thought that were the decemvirs to lay down office\nof their own free will, tribunes might not be reappointed. Wherefore\nthey decided for war, and sent forth the armies under command of\ncertain of the decemvirs. But Appius remaining behind to govern the\ncity, it so fell out that he became enamoured of Virginia, and that\nwhen he sought to lay violent hands upon her, Virginius, her father, to\nsave her from dishonour, slew her. Thereupon followed tumults in Rome,\nand mutiny among the soldiers, who, making common cause with the rest\nof the plebeians, betook themselves to the Sacred Hill, and there\nremained until the decemvirs laid down their office; when tribunes and\nconsuls being once more appointed, Rome was restored to her ancient\nfreedom.\nIn these events we note, first of all, that the pernicious step of\ncreating this tyranny in Rome was due to the same causes which commonly\ngive rise to tyrannies in cities; namely, the excessive love of the\npeople for liberty, and the passionate eagerness of the nobles to\ngovern. For when they cannot agree to pass some measure favourable to\nfreedom, one faction or the other sets itself to support some one man,\nand a tyranny at once springs up. Both parties in Rome consented to the\ncreation of the decemvirs, and to their exercising unrestricted powers,\nfrom the desire which the one had to put an end to the consular name,\nand the other to abolish the authority of the tribunes. When, on the\nappointment of the decemvirate, it seemed to the commons that Appius\nhad become favourable to their cause, and was ready to attack the\nnobles, they inclined to support him. But when a people is led to\ncommit this error of lending its support to some one man, in order that\nhe may attack those whom it holds in hatred, if he only be prudent he\nwill inevitably become the tyrant of that city. For he will wait until,\nwith the support of the people, he can deal a fatal blow to the nobles,\nand will never set himself to oppress the people until the nobles have\nbeen rooted out. But when that time comes, the people, although they\nrecognize their servitude, will have none to whom they can turn for\nhelp.\nHad this method, which has been followed by all who have successfully\nestablished tyrannies in republics, been followed by Appius, his power\nwould have been more stable and lasting; whereas, taking the directly\nopposite course, he could not have acted more unwisely than he did. For\nin his eagerness to grasp the tyranny, he made himself obnoxious to\nthose who were in fact conferring it, and who could have maintained him\nin it; and he destroyed those who were his friends, while he sought\nfriendship from those from whom he could not have it. For although it\nbe the desire of the nobles to tyrannize, that section of them which\nfinds itself outside the tyranny is always hostile to the tyrant, who\ncan never succeed in gaining over the entire body of the nobles by\nreason of their greed and ambition; for no tyrant can ever have honours\nor wealth enough to satisfy them all.\nIn abandoning the people, therefore, and siding with the nobles, Appius\ncommitted a manifest mistake, as well for the reasons above given, as\nbecause to hold a thing by force, he who uses force must needs be\nstronger than he against whom it is used. Whence it happens that those\ntyrants who have the mass of the people for their friends and the\nnobles for their enemies, are more secure than those who have the\npeople for their enemies and the nobles for their friends; because in\nthe former case their authority has the stronger support. For with such\nsupport a ruler can maintain himself by the internal strength of his\nState, as did Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, when attacked by the Romans and\nby the whole of Greece; for making sure work with the nobles, who were\nfew in number, and having the people on his side, he was able with\ntheir assistance to defend himself; which he could not have done had\nthey been against him. But in the case of a city, wherein the tyrant\nhas few friends, its internal strength will not avail him for its\ndefence, and he will have to seek aid from without in one of three\nshapes. For either he must hire foreign guards to defend his person; or\nhe must arm the peasantry, so that they may play the part which ought\nto be played by the citizens; or he must league with powerful\nneighbours for his defence. He who follows these methods and observes\nthem well, may contrive to save himself, though he has the people for\nhis enemy. But Appius could not follow the plan of gaining over the\npeasantry, since in Rome they and the people were one. And what he\nmight have done he knew not how to do, and so was ruined at the very\noutset.\nIn creating the decemvirate, therefore, both the senate and the people\nmade grave mistakes. For although, as already explained, when speaking\nof the dictatorship, it is those magistrates who make themselves, and\nnot those made by the votes of the people, that are hurtful to freedom;\nnevertheless the people, in creating magistrates ought to take such\nprecautions as will make it difficult for these to become bad. But the\nRomans when they ought to have set a check on the decemvirs in order to\nkeep them good, dispensed with it, making them the sole magistrates of\nRome, and setting aside all others; and this from the excessive desire\nof the senate to get rid of the tribunes, and of the commons to get rid\nof the consuls; by which objects both were so blinded as to fall into\nall the disorders which ensued. For, as King Ferrando was wont to say,\nmen often behave like certain of the smaller birds, which are so intent\non the prey to which nature incites them, that they discern not the\neagle hovering overhead for their destruction.\nIn this Discourse then the mistakes made by the Roman people in their\nefforts to preserve their freedom and the mistakes made by Appius in\nhis endeavour to obtain the tyranny, have, as I proposed at the outset,\nbeen plainly shown.\nCHAPTER XLI.\u2014_That it is unwise to pass at a bound from leniency to\nseverity, or to a haughty bearing from a humble._\nAmong the crafty devices used by Appius to aid him in maintaining his\nauthority, this, of suddenly passing from one character to the other\nextreme, was of no small prejudice to him. For his fraud in pretending\nto the commons to be well disposed towards them, was happily contrived;\nas were also the means he took to bring about the reappointment of the\ndecemvirate. Most skilful, too, was his audacity in nominating himself\ncontrary to the expectation of the nobles, and in proposing colleagues\non whom he could depend to carry out his ends. But, as I have said\nalready, it was not happily contrived that, after doing all this, he\nshould suddenly turn round, and from being the friend, reveal himself\nthe enemy of the people; haughty instead of humane; cruel instead of\nkindly; and make this change so rapidly as to leave himself no shadow\nof excuse, but compel all to recognize the doubleness of his nature.\nFor he who has once seemed good, should he afterwards choose, for his\nown ends, to become bad, ought to change by slow degrees, and as\nopportunity serves; so that before his altered nature strip him of old\nfavour, he may have gained for himself an equal share of new, and thus\nhis influence suffer no diminution. For otherwise, being at once\nunmasked and friendless, he is undone:\nCHAPTER XLII.\u2014_How easily Men become corrupted._\nIn this matter of the decemvirate we may likewise note the ease\nwherewith men become corrupted, and how completely, although born good\nand well brought up, they change their nature. For we see how\nfavourably disposed the youths whom Appius gathered round him became\ntowards his tyranny, in return for the trifling benefits which they\ndrew from it; and how Quintus Fabius, one of the second decemvirate and\na most worthy man, blinded by a little ambition, and misled by the evil\ncounsels of Appius, abandoning his fair fame, betook himself to most\nunworthy courses, and grew like his master.\nCareful consideration of this should make those who frame laws for\ncommonwealths and kingdoms more alive to the necessity of placing\nrestraints on men\u2019s evil appetites, and depriving them of all hope of\ndoing wrong with impunity.\nCHAPTER XLIII.\u2014_That Men fighting in their own Cause make good and\nresolute Soldiers._\nFrom what has been touched upon above, we are also led to remark how\nwide is the difference between an army which, having no ground for\ndiscontent, fights in its own cause, and one which, being discontented,\nfights to satisfy the ambition of others. For whereas the Romans were\nalways victorious under the consuls, under the decemvirs they were\nalways defeated. This helps us to understand why it is that mercenary\ntroops are worthless; namely, that they have no incitement to keep them\ntrue to you beyond the pittance which you pay them, which neither is\nnor can be a sufficient motive for such fidelity and devotion as would\nmake them willing to die in your behalf. But in those armies in which\nthere exists not such an attachment towards him for whom they fight as\nmakes them devoted to his cause, there never will be valour enough to\nwithstand an enemy if only he be a little brave. And since such\nattachment and devotion cannot be looked for from any save your own\nsubjects, you must, if you would preserve your dominions, or maintain\nyour commonwealth or kingdom, arm the natives of your country; as we\nsee to have been done by all those who have achieved great things in\nwar.\nUnder the decemvirs the ancient valour of the Roman soldiers had in no\ndegree abated; yet, because they were no longer animated by the same\ngood will, they did not exert themselves as they were wont. But so soon\nas the decemvirate came to an end, and the soldiers began once more to\nfight as free men, the old spirit was reawakened, and, as a\nconsequence, their enterprises, according to former usage, were brought\nto a successful close.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\u2014_That the Multitude is helpless without a Head: and that\nwe should not with the same breath threaten and ask leave._\nWhen Virginia died by her father\u2019s hand, the commons of Rome withdrew\nunder arms to the Sacred Hill. Whereupon the senate sent messengers to\ndemand by what sanction they had deserted their commanders and\nassembled there in arms. And in such reverence was the authority of the\nsenate held, that the commons, lacking leaders, durst make no reply.\n\u201cNot,\u201d says Titus Livius, \u201cthat they were at a loss what to answer, but\nbecause they had none to answer for them;\u201d words which clearly show how\nhelpless a thing is the multitude when without a head.\nThis defect was perceived by Virginius, at whose instance twenty\nmilitary tribunes were appointed by the commons to be their spokesmen\nwith the senate, and to negotiate terms; who, having asked that\nValerius and Horatius might be sent to them, to whom their wishes would\nbe made known, these declined to go until the decemvirs had laid down\ntheir office. When this was done, and Valerius and Horatius came to the\nhill where the commons were assembled, the latter demanded that\ntribunes of the people should be appointed; that in future there should\nbe an appeal to the people from the magistrates of whatever degree; and\nthat all the decemvirs should be given up to them to be burned alive.\nValerius and Horatius approved the first two demands, but rejected the\nlast as inhuman; telling the commons that \u201cthey were rushing into that\nvery cruelty which they themselves had condemned in others;\u201d and\ncounselling them to say nothing about the decemvirs, but to be\nsatisfied to regain their own power and authority; since thus the way\nwould be open to them for obtaining every redress.\nHere we see plainly how foolish and unwise it is to ask a thing and\nwith the same breath to say, \u201cI desire this that I may inflict an\ninjury.\u201d For we should never declare our intention beforehand, but\nwatch for every opportunity to carry it out. So that it is enough to\nask another for his weapons, without adding, \u201cWith these I purpose to\ndestroy you;\u201d for when once you have secured his weapons, you can use\nthem afterwards as you please.\nCHAPTER XLV.\u2014_That it is of evil example, especially in the Maker of a\nLaw, not to observe the Law when made: and that daily to renew acts of\ninjustice in a City is most hurtful to the Governor._\nTerms having been adjusted, and the old order of things restored in\nRome, Virginius cited Appius to defend himself before the people; and\non his appearing attended by many of the nobles, ordered him to be led\nto prison. Whereupon Appius began to cry out and appeal to the people.\nBut Virginius told him that he was unworthy to be allowed that appeal\nwhich he had himself done away with, or to have that people whom he had\nwronged for his protectors. Appius rejoined, that the people should not\nset at nought that right of appeal which they themselves had insisted\non with so much zeal. Nevertheless, he was dragged to prison, and\nbefore the day of trial slew himself. Now, though the wicked life of\nAppius merited every punishment, still it was impolitic to violate the\nlaws, more particularly a law which had only just been passed; for\nnothing, I think, is of worse example in a republic, than to make a law\nand not to keep it; and most of all, when he who breaks is he that made\nit.\nAfter the year 1494, the city of Florence reformed its government with\nthe help of the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, whose writings declare his\nlearning, his wisdom, and the excellence of his heart. Among other\nordinances for the safety of the citizens, he caused a law to be\npassed, allowing an appeal to the people from the sentences pronounced\nby \u201cthe Eight\u201d and by the \u201cSignory\u201d in trials for State offences; a law\nhe had long contended for, and carried at last with great difficulty.\nIt so happened that a very short time after it was passed, five\ncitizens were condemned to death by the \u201cSignory\u201d for State offences,\nand that when they sought to appeal to the people they were not\npermitted to do so, and the law was violated. This, more than any other\nmischance, helped to lessen the credit of the Friar; since if his law\nof appeal was salutary, he should have caused it to be observed; if\nuseless, he ought not to have promoted it. And his inconsistency was\nthe more remarked, because in all the sermons which he preached after\nthe law was broken, he never either blamed or excused the person who\nhad broken it, as though unwilling to condemn, while unable to justify\nwhat suited his purposes. This, as betraying the ambitious and partial\nturn of his mind, took from his reputation and exposed him to much\nobloquy.\nAnother thing which greatly hurts a government is to keep alive bitter\nfeelings in men\u2019s minds by often renewed attacks on individuals, as was\ndone in Rome after the decemvirate was put an end to. For each of the\ndecemvirs, and other citizens besides, were at different times accused\nand condemned, so that the greatest alarm was spread through the whole\nbody of the nobles, who came to believe that these prosecutions would\nnever cease until their entire order was exterminated. And this must\nhave led to grave mischief had not Marcus Duilius the tribune provided\nagainst it, by an edict which forbade every one, for the period of a\nyear, citing or accusing any Roman citizen, an ordinance which had the\neffect of reassuring the whole nobility. Here we see how hurtful it is\nfor a prince or commonwealth to keep the minds of their subjects in\nconstant alarm and suspense by continually renewed punishments and\nviolence. And, in truth, no course can be more pernicious. For men who\nare in fear for their safety will seize on every opportunity for\nsecuring themselves against the dangers which surround them, and will\ngrow at once more daring, and less scrupulous in resorting to new\ncourses. For these reasons we should either altogether avoid inflicting\ninjury, or should inflict every injury at a stroke, and then seek to\nreassure men\u2019s minds and suffer them to settle down and rest.\nCHAPTER XLVI.\u2014_That Men climb from one step of Ambition to another,\nseeking at first to escape Injury and then to injure others._\nAs the commons of Rome on recovering their freedom were restored to\ntheir former position\u2014nay, to one still stronger since many new laws\nhad been passed which confirmed and extended their authority,\u2014it might\nreasonably have been hoped that Rome would for a time remain at rest.\nThe event, however, showed the contrary, for from day to day there\narose in that city new tumults and fresh dissensions. And since the\ncauses which brought this about have been most judiciously set forth by\nTitus Livius, it seems to me much to the purpose to cite his own words\nwhen he says, that \u201cwhenever either the commons or the nobles were\nhumble, the others grew haughty; so that if the commons kept within due\nbounds, the young nobles began to inflict injuries upon them, against\nwhich the tribunes, who were themselves made the objects of outrage,\nwere little able to give redress; while the nobles on their part,\nalthough they could not close their eyes to the ill behaviour of their\nyoung men, were yet well pleased that if excesses were to be committed,\nthey should be committed by their own faction, and not by the commons.\nThus the desire to secure its own liberty prompted each faction to make\nitself strong enough to oppress the other. For this is the common\ncourse of things, that in seeking to escape cause for fear, men come to\ngive others cause to be afraid by inflicting on them those wrongs from\nwhich they strive to relieve themselves; as though the choice lay\nbetween injuring and being injured.\u201d\nHerein, among other things, we perceive in what ways commonwealths are\noverthrown, and how men climb from one ambition to another; and\nrecognize the truth of those words which Sallust puts in the mouth of\nC\u00e6sar, that \u201c_all ill actions have their origin in fair\nbeginnings._\u201d[4] For, as I have said already, the ambitious citizen in\na commonwealth seeks at the outset to secure himself against injury,\nnot only at the hands of private persons, but also of the magistrates;\nto effect which he endeavours to gain himself friends. These he obtains\nby means honourable in appearance, either by supplying them with money\nor protecting them against the powerful. And because such conduct seems\npraiseworthy, every one is readily deceived by it, and consequently no\nremedy is applied. Pursuing these methods without hindrance, this man\npresently comes to be so powerful that private citizens begin to fear\nhim, and the magistrates to treat him with respect. But when he has\nadvanced thus far on the road to power without encountering opposition,\nhe has reached a point at which it is most dangerous to cope with him;\nit being dangerous, as I have before explained, to contend with a\ndisorder which has already made progress in a city. Nevertheless, when\nhe has brought things to this pass, you must either endeavour to crush\nhim, at the risk of immediate ruin, or else, unless death or some like\naccident interpose, you incur inevitable slavery by letting him alone.\nFor when, as I have said, it has come to this that the citizens and\neven the magistrates fear to offend him and his friends, little further\neffort will afterwards be needed to enable him to proscribe and ruin\nwhom he pleases.\n[4] Quod omnia mala exempla ex bonis initiis orta sunt. (Sall. Cat.\n51.)\nA republic ought, therefore, to provide by its ordinances that none of\nits citizens shall, under colour of doing good, have it in their power\nto do evil, but shall be suffered to acquire such influence only as may\naid and not injure freedom. How this may be done, shall presently be\nexplained.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\u2014_That though Men deceive themselves in Generalities, in\nParticulars they judge truly._\nThe commons of Rome having, as I have said, grown disgusted with the\nconsular name, and desiring either that men of plebeian birth should be\nadmitted to the office or its authority be restricted, the nobles, to\nprevent its degradation in either of these two ways, proposed a middle\ncourse, whereby four tribunes, who might either be plebeians or nobles,\nwere to be created with consular authority. This compromise satisfied\nthe commons, who thought they would thus get rid of the consulship, and\nsecure the highest offices of the State for their own order. But here a\ncircumstance happened worth noting. When the four tribunes came to be\nchosen, the people, who had it in their power to choose all from the\ncommons, chose all from the nobles. With respect to which election\nTitus Livius observes, that \u201c_the result showed that the people when\ndeclaring their honest judgment after controversy was over, were\ngoverned by a different spirit from that which had inspired them while\ncontending for their liberties and for a share in public honours_.\u201d The\nreason for this I believe to be, that men deceive themselves more\nreadily in generals than in particulars. To the commons of Rome it\nseemed, in the abstract, that they had every right to be admitted to\nthe consulship, since their party in the city was the more numerous,\nsince they bore the greater share of danger in their wars, and since it\nwas they who by their valour kept Rome free and made her powerful. And\nbecause it appeared to them, as I have said, that their desire was a\nreasonable one, they were resolved to satisfy it at all hazards. But\nwhen they had to form a particular judgment on the men of their own\nparty, they recognized their defects, and decided that individually no\none of them was deserving of what, collectively, they seemed entitled\nto; and being ashamed of them, turned to bestow their honours on those\nwho deserved them. Of which decision Titus Livius, speaking with due\nadmiration, says, \u201c_Where shall we now find in any one man, that\nmodesty, moderation, and magnanimity which were then common to the\nentire people?_\u201d\nAs confirming what I have said, I shall cite another noteworthy\nincident, which occurred in Capua after the rout of the Romans by\nHannibal at Cann\u00e6. For all Italy being convulsed by that defeat, Capua\ntoo was threatened with civil tumult, through the hatred which\nprevailed between her people and senate. But Pacuvius Calavius, who at\nthis time filled the office of chief magistrate, perceiving the danger,\ntook upon himself to reconcile the contending factions. With this\nobject he assembled the Senate and pointed out to them the hatred in\nwhich they were held by the people, and the risk they ran of being put\nto death by them, and of the city, now that the Romans were in\ndistress, being given up to Hannibal. But he added that, were they to\nconsent to leave the matter with him, he thought he could contrive to\nreconcile them; in the meanwhile, however, he must shut them up in the\npalace, that, by putting it in the power of the people to punish them,\nhe might secure their safety.\nThe senate consenting to this proposal, he shut them up in the palace,\nand summoning the people to a public meeting, told them the time had at\nlast come for them to trample on the insolence of the nobles, and\nrequite the wrongs suffered at their hands; for he had them all safe\nunder bolt and bar; but, as he supposed they did not wish the city to\nremain without rulers, it was fit, before putting the old senators to\ndeath, they should appoint others in their room. Wherefore he had\nthrown the names of all the old senators into a bag, and would now\nproceed to draw them out one by one, and as they were drawn would cause\nthem to be put to death, so soon as a successor was found for each.\nWhen the first name he drew was declared, there arose a great uproar\namong the people, all crying out against the cruelty, pride, and\narrogance of that senator whose name it was. But on Pacuvius desiring\nthem to propose a substitute, the meeting was quieted, and after a\nbrief pause one of the commons was nominated. No sooner, however, was\nhis name mentioned than one began to whistle, another to laugh, some\njeering at him in one way and some in another. And the same thing\nhappening in every case, each and all of those nominated were judged\nunworthy of senatorial rank. Whereupon Pacuvius, profiting by the\nopportunity, said, \u201cSince you are agreed that the city would be badly\noff without a senate, but are not agreed whom to appoint in the room of\nthe old senators, it will, perhaps, be well for you to be reconciled to\nthem; for the fear into which they have been thrown must have so\nsubdued them, that you are sure to find in them that affability which\nhitherto you have looked for in vain.\u201d This proposal being agreed to, a\nreconciliation followed between the two orders; the commons having seen\ntheir error so soon as they were obliged to come to particulars.\nA people therefore is apt to err in judging of things and their\naccidents in the abstract, but on becoming acquainted with particulars,\nspeedily discovers its mistakes. In the year 1494, when her greatest\ncitizens were banished from Florence, and no regular government any\nlonger existed there, but a spirit of licence prevailed, and matters\nwent continually from bad to worse, many Florentines perceiving the\ndecay of their city, and discerning no other cause for it, blamed the\nambition of this or the other powerful citizen, who, they thought, was\nfomenting these disorders with a view to establish a government to his\nown liking, and to rob them of their liberties. Those who thought thus,\nwould hang about the arcades and public squares, maligning many\ncitizens, and giving it to be understood that if ever they found\nthemselves in the Signory, they would expose the designs of these\ncitizens and have them punished. From time to time it happened that one\nor another of those who used this language rose to be of the chief\nmagistracy, and so soon as he obtained this advancement, and saw things\nnearer, became aware whence the disorders I have spoken of really came,\nthe dangers attending them, and the difficulty in dealing with them;\nand recognizing that they were the growth of the times, and not\noccasioned by particular men, suddenly altered his views and conduct; a\nnearer knowledge of facts freeing him from the false impressions he had\nbeen led into on a general view of affairs. But those who had heard him\nspeak as a private citizen, when they saw him remain inactive after he\nwas made a magistrate, believed that this arose not from his having\nobtained any better knowledge of things, but from his having been\ncajoled or corrupted by the great. And this happening with many men and\noften, it came to be a proverb among the people, that \u201c_men had one\nmind in the market-place, another in the palace._\u201d\nReflecting on what has been said, we see how quickly men\u2019s eyes may be\nopened, if knowing that they deceive themselves in generalities, we can\nfind a way to make them pass to particulars; as Pacuvius did in the\ncase of the Capuans, and the senate in the case of Rome. Nor do I\nbelieve that any prudent man need shrink from the judgment of the\npeople in questions relating to particulars, as, for instance, in the\ndistribution of honours and dignities. For in such matters only, the\npeople are either never mistaken, or at any rate far seldomer than a\nsmall number of persons would be, were the distribution entrusted to\nthem.\nIt seems to me, however, not out of place to notice in the following\nChapter, a method employed by the Roman senate to enlighten the people\nin making this distribution.\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\u2014_He who would not have an Office bestowed on some\nworthless or wicked Person, should contrive that it be solicited by one\nwho is utterly worthless and wicked, or else by one who is in the\nhighest degree noble and good._\nWhenever the senate saw a likelihood of the tribunes with consular\npowers being chosen exclusively from the commons, it took one or other\nof two ways,\u2014either by causing the office to be solicited by the most\ndistinguished among the citizens; or else, to confess the truth, by\nbribing some base and ignoble fellow to fasten himself on to those\nother plebeians of better quality who were seeking the office, and\nbecome a candidate conjointly with them. The latter device made the\npeople ashamed to give, the former ashamed to refuse.\nThis confirms what I said in my last Chapter, as to the people\ndeceiving themselves in generalities but not in particulars.\nCHAPTER XLIX.\u2014_That if Cities which, like Rome, had their beginning in\nFreedom, have had difficulty in framing such Laws as would preserve\ntheir Freedom, Cities which at the first have been in Subjection will\nfind this almost impossible._\nHow hard it is in founding a commonwealth to provide it with all the\nlaws needed to maintain its freedom, is well seen from the history of\nthe Roman Republic. For although ordinances were given it first by\nRomulus, then by Numa, afterwards by Tullus Hostilius and Servius, and\nlastly by the Ten created for the express purpose, nevertheless, in the\nactual government of Rome new needs were continually developed, to meet\nwhich, new ordinances had constantly to be devised; as in the creation\nof the censors, who were one of the chief means by which Rome was kept\nfree during the whole period of her constitutional government. For as\nthe censors became the arbiters of morals in Rome, it was very much\nowing to them that the progress of the Romans towards corruption was\nretarded. And though, at the first creation of the office, a mistake\nwas doubtless made in fixing its term at five years, this was corrected\nnot long after by the wisdom of the dictator Mamercus, who passed a law\nreducing it to eighteen months; a change which the censors then in\noffice took in such ill part, that they deprived Mamercus of his rank\nas a senator. This step was much blamed both by the commons and the\nFathers; still, as our History does not record that Mamercus obtained\nany redress, we must infer either that the Historian has omitted\nsomething, or that on this head the laws of Rome were defective; since\nit is never well that the laws of a commonwealth should suffer a\ncitizen to incur irremediable wrong because he promotes a measure\nfavourable to freedom.\nBut returning to the matter under consideration, we have, in connection\nwith the creation of this new office, to note, that if those cities\nwhich, as was the case with Rome, have had their beginning in freedom,\nand have by themselves maintained that freedom, have experienced great\ndifficulty in framing good laws for the preservation of their\nliberties, it is little to be wondered at that cities which at the\nfirst were dependent, should find it not difficult merely but\nimpossible so to shape their ordinances as to enable them to live free\nand undisturbed. This difficulty we see to have arisen in the case of\nFlorence, which, being subject at first to the power of Rome and\nsubsequently to that of other rulers, remained long in servitude,\ntaking no thought for herself; and even afterwards, when she could\nbreathe more freely and began to frame her own laws, these, since they\nwere blended with ancient ordinances which were bad, could not\nthemselves be good; and thus for the two hundred years of which we have\ntrustworthy record, our city has gone on patching her institutions,\nwithout ever possessing a government in respect of which she could\ntruly be termed a commonwealth.\nThe difficulties which have been felt in Florence are the same as have\nbeen felt in all cities which have had a like origin; and although,\nrepeatedly, by the free and public votes of her citizens, ample\nauthority has been given to a few of their number to reform her\nconstitution, no alteration of general utility has ever been\nintroduced, but only such as forwarded the interests of the party to\nwhich those commissioned to make changes belonged. This, instead of\norder, has occasioned the greatest disorder in our city.\nBut to come to particulars, I say, that among other matters which have\nto be considered by the founder of a commonwealth, is the question into\nwhose hands should be committed the power of life and death over its\ncitizens\u2019 This was well seen to in Rome, where, as a rule, there was a\nright of appeal to the people, but where, on any urgent case arising in\nwhich it might have been dangerous to delay the execution of a judicial\nsentence, recourse could be had to a dictator with powers to execute\njustice at once; a remedy, however, never resorted to save in cases of\nextremity. But Florence, and other cities having a like origin,\ncommitted this power into the hands of a foreigner, whom they styled\nCaptain, and as he was open to be corrupted by powerful citizens this\nwas a pernicious course. Altering this arrangement afterwards in\nconsequence of changes in their government, they appointed eight\ncitizens to discharge the office of Captain. But this, for a reason\nalready mentioned, namely that a few will always be governed by the\nwill of a few and these the most powerful, was a change from bad to\nworse.\nThe city of Venice has guarded herself against a like danger. For in\nVenice ten citizens are appointed with power to punish any man without\nappeal; and because, although possessing the requisite authority, this\nnumber might not be sufficient to insure the punishment of the\npowerful, in addition to their council of Ten, they have also\nconstituted a council of Forty, and have further provided that the\ncouncil of the \u201c_Pregai_,\u201d which is their supreme council, shall have\nauthority to chastise powerful offenders. So that, unless an accuser be\nwanting, a tribunal is never wanting in Venice to keep powerful\ncitizens in check.\nBut when we see how in Rome, with ordinances of her own imposing, and\nwith so many and so wise legislators, fresh occasion arose from day to\nday for framing new laws favourable to freedom, it is not to be\nwondered at that, in other cities less happy in their beginnings,\ndifficulties should have sprung up which no ordinances could remedy.\nCHAPTER L.\u2014_That neither any Council nor any Magistrate should have\npower to bring the Government of a City to a stay._\nT.Q. CINCINNATUS and Cn. Julius Mento being consuls of Rome, and being\nat variance with one another, brought the whole business of the city to\na stay; which the senate perceiving, were moved to create a dictator to\ndo what, by reason of their differences, the consuls would not. But\nthough opposed to one another in everything else, the consuls were of\none mind in resisting the appointment of a dictator; so that the senate\nhad no remedy left them but to seek the help of the tribunes, who,\nsupported by their authority, forced the consuls to yield.\nHere we have to note, first, the usefulness of the tribunes\u2019 authority\nin checking the ambitious designs, not only of the nobles against the\ncommons, but also of one section of the nobles against another; and\nnext, that in no city ought things ever to be so ordered that it rests\nwith a few to decide on matters, which, if the ordinary business of the\nState is to proceed at all, must be carried out. Wherefore, if you\ngrant authority to a council to distribute honours and offices, or to a\nmagistrate to administer any branch of public business, you must either\nimpose an obligation that the duty confided shall be performed, or\nordain that, on failure to perform, another may and shall do what has\nto be done. Otherwise such an arrangement will be found defective and\ndangerous; as would have been the case in Rome, had it not been\npossible to oppose the authority of the tribunes to the obstinacy of\nthe consuls.\nIn the Venetian Republic, the great council distributes honours and\noffices. But more than once it has happened that the council, whether\nfrom ill-humour or from being badly advised, has declined to appoint\nsuccessors either to the magistrates of the city or to those\nadministering the government abroad. This gave rise to the greatest\nconfusion and disorder; for, on a sudden, both the city itself and the\nsubject provinces found themselves deprived of their lawful governors;\nnor could any redress be had until the majority of the council were\npacified or undeceived. And this disorder must have brought the city to\na bad end, had not provision been made against its recurrence by\ncertain of the wiser citizens, who, finding a fit opportunity, passed a\nlaw that no magistracy, whether within or without the city, should ever\nbe deemed to have been vacated until it was filled up by the\nappointment of a successor. In this way the council was deprived of its\nfacilities for stopping public business to the danger of the State.\nCHAPTER LI.\u2014_What a Prince or Republic does of Necessity, should seem\nto be done by Choice_.\nIn all their actions, even in those which are matters of necessity\nrather than choice, prudent men will endeavour so to conduct themselves\nas to conciliate good-will. This species of prudence was well exercised\nby the Roman senate when they resolved to grant pay from the public\npurse to soldiers on active service, who, before, had served at their\nown charges. For perceiving that under the old system they could\nmaintain no war of any duration, and, consequently, could not undertake\na siege or lead an army to any distance from home, and finding it\nnecessary to be able to do both, they decided on granting the pay I\nhave spoken of. But this, which they could not help doing, they did in\nsuch a way as to earn the thanks of the people, by whom the concession\nwas so well received that all Rome was intoxicated with delight. For it\nseemed to them a boon beyond any they could have ventured to hope for,\nor have dreamed of demanding. And although the tribunes sought to make\nlight of the benefit, by showing the people that their burthens would\nbe increased rather than diminished by it, since taxes would have to be\nimposed out of which the soldier\u2019s stipend might be paid, they could\nnot persuade them to regard the measure otherwise than with gratitude;\nwhich was further increased by the manner in which the senate\ndistributed the taxes, imposing on the nobles all the heavier and\ngreater, and those which had to be paid first.\nCHAPTER LII.\u2014_That to check the arrogance of a Citizen who is growing\ntoo powerful in a State, there is no safer Method, or less open to\nobjection, than to forestall him in those Ways whereby he seeks to\nadvance himself_.\nIt has been seen in the preceding chapter how much credit the nobles\ngained with the commons by a show of good-will towards them, not only\nin providing for their military pay, but also in adjusting taxation.\nHad the senate constantly adhered to methods like these, they would\nhave put an end to all disturbances in Rome, and have deprived the\ntribunes of the credit they had with the people, and of the influence\nthence arising. For in truth, in a commonwealth, and especially in one\nwhich has become corrupted, there is no better, or easier, or less\nobjectionable way of opposing the ambition of any citizen, than to\nanticipate him in those paths by which he is seen to be advancing to\nthe ends he has in view. This plan, had it been followed by the enemies\nof Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, would have proved a far more useful course for\nthem than to banish him from Florence; since if those citizens who\nopposed him had adopted his methods for gaining over the people, they\nwould have succeeded, without violence or tumult, in taking his most\neffective weapon from his hands.\nThe influence acquired in Florence by Piero Soderini was entirely due\nto his skill in securing the affections of the people, since in this\nway he obtained among them a name for loving the liberties of the\ncommonwealth. And truly, for those citizens who envied his greatness it\nwould have been both easier and more honourable, and at the same time\nfar less dangerous and hurtful to the State, to forestall him in those\nmeasures by which he was growing powerful, than to oppose him in such a\nmanner that his overthrow must bring with it the ruin of the entire\nrepublic. For had they, as they might easily have done, deprived him of\nthe weapons which made him formidable, they could then have withstood\nhim in all the councils, and in all public deliberations, without\neither being suspected or feared. And should any rejoin that, if the\ncitizens who hated Piero Soderini committed an error in not being\nbeforehand with him in those ways whereby he came to have influence\nwith the people, Piero himself erred in like manner, in not\nanticipating his enemies in those methods whereby they grew formidable\nto him; I answer that Piero is to be excused, both because it would\nhave been difficult for him to have so acted, and because for him such\na course would not have been honourable. For the paths wherein his\ndanger lay were those which favoured the Medici, and it was by these\nthat his enemies attacked him, and in the end overthrew him. But these\npaths Piero could not pursue without dishonour, since he could not, if\nhe was to preserve his fair fame, have joined in destroying that\nliberty which he had been put forward to defend. Moreover, since\nfavours to the Medicean party could not have been rendered secretly and\nonce for all, they would have been most dangerous for Piero, who, had\nhe shown himself friendly to the Medici, must have become suspected and\nhated by the people; in which case his enemies would have had still\nbetter opportunities than before for his destruction.\nMen ought therefore to look to the risks and dangers of any course\nwhich lies before them, nor engage in it when it is plain that the\ndangers outweigh the advantages, even though they be advised by others\nthat it is the most expedient way to take. Should they act otherwise,\nit will fare with them as with Tullius, who, in seeking to diminish the\npower of Marcus Antonius, added to it. For Antonius, who had been\ndeclared an enemy by the senate, having got together a strong force,\nmostly made up of veterans who had shared the fortunes of C\u00e6sar,\nTullius counselled the senate to invest Octavianus with full authority,\nand to send him against Antonius with the consuls and the army;\naffirming, that so soon as those veterans who had served with C\u00e6sar saw\nthe face of him who was C\u00e6sar\u2019s nephew and had assumed his name, they\nwould rally to his side and desert Antonius, who might easily be\ncrushed when thus left bare of support.\nBut the reverse of all this happened. For Antonius persuaded Octavianus\nto take part with him, and to throw over Tullius and the senate. And\nthis brought about the ruin of the senate, a result which might easily\nhave been foreseen. For remembering the influence of that great\ncaptain, who, after overthrowing all opponents, had seized on sovereign\npower in Rome, the senate should have turned a deaf ear to the\npersuasions of Tullius, nor ever have believed it possible that from\nC\u00e6sar\u2019s heir, or from soldiers who had followed C\u00e6sar, they could look\nfor anything that consisted with the name of Freedom.\nCHAPTER LIII.\u2014_That the People, deceived by a false show of Advantage,\noften desire what would be their Ruin; and that large Hopes and brave\nPromises easily move them_.\nWhen Veii fell, the commons of Rome took up the notion that it would be\nto the advantage of their city were half their number to go and dwell\nthere. For they argued that as Veii lay in a fertile country and was a\nwell-built city, a moiety of the Roman people might in this way be\nenriched; while, by reason of its vicinity to Rome, the management of\ncivil affairs would in no degree be affected. To the senate, however,\nand the wiser among the citizens, the scheme appeared so rash and\nmischievous that they publicly declared they would die sooner than\nconsent to it. The controversy continuing, the commons grew so inflamed\nagainst the senate that violence and bloodshed must have ensued; had\nnot the senate for their protection put forward certain old and\nesteemed citizens, respect for whom restrained the populace and put a\nstop to their violence.\nTwo points are here to be noted. First, that a people deceived by a\nfalse show of advantage will often labour for its own destruction; and,\nunless convinced by some one whom it trusts, that the course on which\nit is bent is pernicious, and that some other is to be preferred, will\nbring infinite danger and injury upon the State. And should it so\nhappen, as sometimes is the case, that from having been deceived\nbefore, either by men or by events, there is none in whom the people\ntrust, their ruin is inevitable. As to which Dante, in his treatise \u201cDe\nMonarchia,\u201d observes that the people will often raise the cry,\n\u201c_Flourish our death and perish our life_.\u201d[5] From which distrust it\narises that often in republics the right course is not followed; as\nwhen Venice, as has been related, on being attacked by many enemies,\ncould not, until her ruin was complete, resolve to make friends with\nany one of them by restoring those territories she had taken from them,\non account of which war had been declared and a league of princes\nformed against her.\n[5] \u201cViva la sua morte e muoia la sua vita.\u201d The quotation does _not_\nseem to be from the \u201cDe Monarchia.\u201d\nIn considering what courses it is easy, and what it is difficult to\npersuade a people to follow, this distinction may be drawn: Either what\nyou would persuade them to, presents on the face of it a semblance of\ngain or loss, or it seems a spirited course or a base one. When any\nproposal submitted to the people holds out promise of advantage, or\nseems to them a spirited course to take, though loss lie hid behind,\nnay, though the ruin of their country be involved in it, they will\nalways be easily led to adopt it; whereas it will always be difficult\nto persuade the adoption of such courses as wear the appearance of\ndisgrace or loss, even though safety and advantage be bound up with\nthem. The truth of what I say is confirmed by numberless examples both\nRoman and foreign, modern and ancient. Hence grew the ill opinion\nentertained in Rome of Fabius Maximus, who could never persuade the\npeople that it behoved them to proceed warily in their conflict with\nHannibal, and withstand his onset without fighting. For this the people\nthought a base course, not discerning the advantage resulting from it,\nwhich Fabius could by no argument make plain to them. And so blinded\nare men in favour of what seems a spirited course, that although the\nRomans had already committed the blunder of permitting Varro, master of\nthe knights to Fabius, to join battle contrary to the latter\u2019s desire,\nwhereby the army must have been destroyed had not Fabius by his\nprudence saved it, this lesson was not enough; for afterwards they\nappointed this Varro to be consul, for no other reason than that he\ngave out, in the streets and market-places, that he would make an end\nof Hannibal as soon as leave was given him to do so. Whence came the\nbattle and defeat of Cann\u00e6, and well-nigh the destruction of Rome.\nAnother example taken from Roman history may be cited to the same\neffect. After Hannibal had maintained himself for eight or ten years in\nItaly, during which time the whole country had been deluged with Roman\nblood, a certain Marcus Centenius Penula, a man of mean origin, but who\nhad held some post in the army, came forward and proposed to the senate\nthat were leave given him to raise a force of volunteers in any part of\nItaly he pleased, he would speedily deliver Hannibal into their hands,\nalive or dead. To the senate this man\u2019s offer seemed a rash one; but\nreflecting that were they to refuse it, and were the people afterwards\nto hear that it had been made, tumults, ill will, and resentment\nagainst them would result, they granted the permission asked; choosing\nrather to risk the lives of all who might follow Penula, than to excite\nfresh discontent on the part of the people, to whom they knew that such\na proposal would be welcome, and that it would be very hard to dissuade\nthem from it. And so this adventurer, marching forth with an\nundisciplined and disorderly rabble to meet Hannibal, was, with all his\nfollowers, defeated and slain in the very first encounter.\nIn Greece, likewise, and in the city of Athens, that most grave and\nprudent statesman, Nicias, could not convince the people that the\nproposal to go and attack Sicily was disadvantageous; and the\nexpedition being resolved on, contrary to his advice and to the wishes\nof the wiser among the citizens, resulted in the overthrow of the\nAthenian power. Scipio, on being appointed consul, asked that the\nprovince of Africa might be awarded to him, promising that he would\nutterly efface Carthage; and when the senate, on the advice of Fabius,\nrefused his request, he threatened to submit the matter to the people\nas very well knowing that to the people such proposals are always\nacceptable.\nI might cite other instances to the same effect from the history of our\nown city, as when Messer Ercole Bentivoglio and Antonio Giacomini,\nbeing in joint command of the Florentine armies, after defeating\nBartolommeo d\u2019Alviano at San Vincenzo, proceeded to invest Pisa. For\nthis enterprise was resolved on by the people in consequence of the\nbrave promises of Messer Ercole; and though many wise citizens\ndisapproved of it, they could do nothing to prevent it, being carried\naway by the popular will, which took its rise in the assurances of\ntheir captain.\nI say, then, that there is no readier way to bring about the ruin of a\nrepublic, when the power is in the hands of the people, than to suggest\ndaring courses for their adoption. For wherever the people have a\nvoice, such proposals will always be well received, nor will those\npersons who are opposed to them be able to apply any remedy. And as\nthis occasions the ruin of States, it likewise, and even more\nfrequently, occasions the private ruin of those to whom the execution\nof these proposals is committed; because the people anticipating\nvictory, do not when there comes defeat ascribe it to the short means\nor ill fortune of the commander, but to his cowardice and incapacity;\nand commonly either put him to death, or imprison or banish him; as was\ndone in the case of numberless Carthaginian generals and of many\nAthenian, no successes they might previously have obtained availing\nthem anything; for all past services are cancelled by a present loss.\nAnd so it happened with our Antonio Giacomini, who not succeeding as\nthe people had expected, and as he had promised, in taking Pisa, fell\ninto such discredit with the people, that notwithstanding his countless\npast services, his life was spared rather by the compassion of those in\nauthority than through any movement of the citizens in his behalf.\nCHAPTER LIV.\u2014_Of the boundless Authority which a great Man may use to\nrestrain an excited Multitude_.\nThe next noteworthy point in the passage referred to in the foregoing\nChapter is, that nothing tends so much to restrain an excited multitude\nas the reverence felt for some grave person, clothed with authority,\nwho stands forward to oppose them. For not without reason has Virgil\nsaid\u2014\n\u201cIf then, by chance, some reverend chief appear,\nKnown for his deeds and for his virtues dear,\nSilent they wait his words and bend a listening ear.\u201d[6]\n[6] Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem\nConspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant.\n_Virg. Aen._, I. 154.\nHe therefore who commands an army or governs a city wherein tumult\nshall have broken out, ought to assume the noblest and bravest bearing\nhe can, and clothe himself with all the ensigns of his station, that he\nmay make himself more revered. It is not many years since Florence was\ndivided into two factions, the _Frateschi_ and _Arrabbiati_, as they\nwere named, and these coming to open violence, the _Frateschi_, among\nwhom was Pagolo Antonio Soderini, a citizen of great reputation in\nthese days, were worsted. In the course of these disturbances the\npeople coming with arms in their hands to plunder the house of\nSoderini, his brother Messer Francesco, then bishop of Volterra and now\ncardinal, who happened to be dwelling there, so soon as he heard the\nuproar and saw the crowd, putting on his best apparel and over it his\nepiscopal robes, went forth to meet the armed multitude, and by his\nwords and mien brought them to a stay; and for many days his behaviour\nwas commended by the whole city. The inference from all which is, that\nthere is no surer or more necessary restraint on the violence of an\nunruly multitude, than the presence of some one whose character and\nbearing command respect.\nBut to return once more to the passage we are considering, we see how\nstubbornly the people clung to this scheme of transplanting themselves\nto Veii, thinking it for their advantage, and not discerning the\nmischief really involved in it; so that in addition to the many\ndissensions which it occasioned, actual violence must have followed,\nhad not the senate with the aid of certain grave and reverend citizens\nrepressed the popular fury.\nCHAPTER LV.\u2014_That Government is easily carried on in a City wherein the\nbody of the People is not corrupted: and that a Princedom is impossible\nwhere Equality prevails, and a Republic where it does not_.\nThough what we have to fear or hope from cities that have grown\ncorrupted has already been discussed, still I think it not out of place\nto notice a resolution passed by the senate touching the vow which\nCamillus made to Apollo of a tenth of the spoil taken from the\nVeientines. For this spoil having fallen into the hands of the people,\nthe senate, being unable by other means to get any account of it,\npassed an edict that every man should publicly offer one tenth part of\nwhat he had taken. And although this edict was not carried out, from\nthe senate having afterwards followed a different course, whereby, to\nthe content of the people, the claim of Apollo was otherwise satisfied,\nwe nevertheless see from their having entertained such a proposal, how\ncompletely the senate trusted to the honesty of the people, when they\nassumed that no one would withhold any part of what the edict commanded\nhim to give; on the other hand, we see that it never occurred to the\npeople that they might evade the law by giving less than was due, their\nonly thought being to free themselves from the law by openly\nmanifesting their displeasure. This example, together with many others\nalready noticed, shows how much virtue and how profound a feeling of\nreligion prevailed among the Roman people, and how much good was to be\nexpected from them. And, in truth, in the country where virtue like\nthis does not exist, no good can be looked for, as we should look for\nit in vain in provinces which at the present day are seen to be\ncorrupted; as Italy is beyond all others, though, in some degree,\nFrance and Spain are similarly tainted. In which last two countries, if\nwe see not so many disorders spring up as we see daily springing up in\nItaly, this is not so much due to the superior virtue of their\ninhabitants (who, to say truth, fall far short of our countrymen), as\nto their being governed by a king who keeps them united, not merely by\nhis personal qualities, but also by the laws and ordinances of the\nrealm which are still maintained with vigour. In Germany, however, we\ndo see signal excellence and a devout religious spirit prevail among\nthe people, giving rise to the many free States which there maintain\nthemselves, with such strict observance of their laws that none, either\nwithin or without their walls, dare encroach on them.\nThat among this last-named people a great share of the ancient\nexcellence does in truth still flourish, I shall show by an example\nsimilar to that which I have above related of the senate and people of\nRome. It is customary with the German Free States when they have to\nexpend any large sum of money on the public account, for their\nmagistrates or councils having authority given them in that behalf, to\nimpose a rate of one or two in the hundred on every man\u2019s estate; which\nrate being fixed, every man, in conformity with the laws of the city,\npresents himself before the collectors of the impost, and having first\nmade oath to pay the amount justly due, throws into a chest provided\nfor the purpose what he conscientiously believes it fair for him to\npay, of which payment none is witness save himself. From this fact it\nmay be gathered what honesty and religion still prevail among this\npeople. For we must assume that each pays his just share, since\notherwise the impost would not yield the sum which, with reference to\nformer imposts, it was estimated to yield; whereby the fraud would be\ndetected, and thereupon some other method for raising money have to be\nresorted to.\nAt the present time this virtue is the more to be admired, because it\nseems to have survived in this province only. That it has survived\nthere may be ascribed to two circumstances: _first_, that the natives\nhave little communication with their neighbours, neither visiting them\nin their countries nor being visited by them; being content to use such\ncommodities, and subsist on such food, and to wear garments of such\nmaterials as their own land supplies; so that all occasion for\nintercourse, and every cause of corruption is removed. For living after\nthis fashion, they have not learned the manners of the French, the\nItalians, or the Spaniards, which three nations together are the\ncorruption of the world. The _second_ cause is, that these republics in\nwhich a free and pure government is maintained will not suffer any of\ntheir citizens either to be, or to live as gentlemen; but on the\ncontrary, while preserving a strict equality among themselves, are\nbitterly hostile to all those gentlemen and lords who dwell in their\nneighbourhood; so that if by chance any of these fall into their hands,\nthey put them to death, as the chief promoters of corruption and the\norigin of all disorders.\nBut to make plain what I mean when I speak of _gentlemen_, I say that\nthose are so to be styled who live in opulence and idleness on the\nrevenues of their estates, without concerning themselves with the\ncultivation of these estates, or incurring any other fatigue for their\nsupport. Such persons are very mischievous in every republic or\ncountry. But even more mischievous are they who, besides the estates I\nhave spoken of, are lords of strongholds and castles, and have vassals\nand retainers who render them obedience. Of these two classes of men\nthe kingdom of Naples, the country round Rome, Romagna, and Lombardy\nare full; and hence it happens that in these provinces no commonwealth\nor free form of government has ever existed; because men of this sort\nare the sworn foes to all free institutions.\nAnd since to plant a commonwealth in provinces which are in this\ncondition were impossible, if these are to be reformed at all, it can\nonly be by some one man who is able there to establish a kingdom; the\nreason being that when the body of the people is grown so corrupted\nthat the laws are powerless to control it, there must in addition to\nthe laws be introduced a stronger force, to wit, the regal, which by\nits absolute and unrestricted authority may curb the excessive ambition\nand corruption of the great. This opinion may be supported by the\nexample of Tuscany, in which within a narrow compass of territory there\nhave long existed the three republics of Florence, Lucca, and Siena,\nwhile the other cities of that province, although to a certain extent\ndependent, still show by their spirit and by their institutions that\nthey preserve, or at any rate desire to preserve, their freedom: and\nthis because there are in Tuscany no lords possessed of strongholds,\nand few or no gentlemen, but so complete an equality prevails, that a\nprudent statesman, well acquainted with the history of the free States\nof antiquity, might easily introduce free institutions. Such, however,\nhas been the unhappiness of this our country, that, up to the present\nhour, it has never produced any man with the power and knowledge which\nwould have enabled him to act in this way.\nFrom what has been said, it follows, that he who would found a\ncommonwealth in a country wherein there are many gentlemen, cannot do\nso unless he first gets rid of them; and that he who would found a\nmonarchy or princedom in a country wherein great equality prevails,\nwill never succeed, unless he raise above the level of that equality\nmany persons of a restless and ambitious temperament, whom he must make\ngentlemen not in name merely but in reality, by conferring on them\ncastles and lands, supplying them with riches, and providing them with\nretainers; that with these gentlemen around him, and with their help,\nhe may maintain his power, while they through him may gratify their\nambition; all others being constrained to endure a yoke, which force\nand force alone imposes on them. For when in this way there comes to be\na proportion between him who uses force and him against whom it is\nused, each stands fixed in his own station.\nBut to found a commonwealth in a country suited for a kingdom, or a\nkingdom in a country suited to be a commonwealth, requires so rare a\ncombination of intelligence and power, that though many engage in the\nattempt, few are found to succeed. For the greatness of the undertaking\nquickly daunts them, and so obstructs their advance they break down at\nthe very outset. The case of the Venetian Republic, wherein none save\ngentlemen are permitted to hold any public office, does, doubtless,\nseem opposed to this opinion of mine that where there are gentlemen it\nis impossible to found a commonwealth. But it may be answered that the\ncase of Venice is not in truth an instance to the contrary; since the\ngentlemen of Venice are gentlemen rather in name than in reality,\ninasmuch as they draw no great revenues from lands, their wealth\nconsisting chiefly in merchandise and chattels, and not one of them\npossessing a castle or enjoying any feudal authority. For in Venice\nthis name of gentleman is a title of honour and dignity, and does not\ndepend on any of those circumstances in respect of which the name is\ngiven in other States. But as in other States the different ranks and\nclasses are divided under different names, so in Venice we have the\ndivision into gentlemen (_gentiluomini_) and plebeians (_popolani_), it\nbeing understood that the former hold, or have the right to hold all\nsituations of honour, from which the latter are entirely excluded. And\nin Venice this occasions no disturbance, for reasons which I have\nalready explained.\nLet a commonwealth, then, be constituted in the country where a great\nequality is found or has been made; and, conversely, let a princedom be\nconstituted where great inequality prevails. Otherwise what is\nconstituted will be discordant in itself, and without stability.\nCHAPTER LVI.\u2014_That when great Calamities are about to befall a City or\nCountry, Signs are seen to presage, and Seers arise who foretell them_.\nWhence it happens I know not, but it is seen from examples both ancient\nand recent, that no grave calamity has ever befallen any city or\ncountry which has not been foretold by vision, by augury, by portent,\nor by some other Heaven-sent sign. And not to travel too far afield for\nevidence of this, every one knows that long before the invasion of\nItaly by Charles VIII. of France, his coming was foretold by the friar\nGirolamo Savonarola; and how, throughout the whole of Tuscany, the\nrumour ran that over Arezzo horsemen had been seen fighting in the air.\nAnd who is there who has not heard that before the death of the elder\nLorenzo de\u2019 Medici, the highest pinnacle of the cathedral was rent by a\nthunderbolt, to the great injury of the building? Or who, again, but\nknows that shortly before Piero Soderini, whom the people of Florence\nhad made gonfalonier for life, was deprived of his office and banished,\nthe palace itself was struck by lightning?\nOther instances might be cited, which, not to be tedious, I shall omit,\nand mention only a circumstance which Titus Livius tells us preceded\nthe invasion of the Gauls. For he relates how a certain plebeian named\nMarcus Ceditius reported to the senate that as he passed by night along\nthe Via Nova, he heard a voice louder than mortal, bidding him warn the\nmagistrates that the Gauls were on their way to Rome.\nThe causes of such manifestations ought, I think, to be inquired into\nand explained by some one who has a knowledge, which I have not, of\ncauses natural and supernatural. It may, however, be, as certain wise\nmen say, that the air is filled with intelligent beings, to whom it is\ngiven to forecast future events; who, taking pity upon men, warn them\nbeforehand by these signs to prepare for what awaits them. Be this as\nit may, certain it is that such warnings are given, and that always\nafter them new and strange disasters befall nations.\nCHAPTER LVII.\u2014_That the People are strong collectively, but\nindividually weak_.\nAfter the ruin brought on their country by the invasion of the Gauls,\nmany of the Romans went to dwell in Veii, in opposition to the edicts\nand commands of the senate, who, to correct this mischief, publicly\nordained that within a time fixed, and under penalties stated, all\nshould return to live in Rome. The persons against whom these\nproclamations were directed at first derided them; but, when the time\ncame for them to be obeyed, all obeyed them. And Titus Livius observes\nthat, \u201c_although bold enough collectively, each separately, fearing to\nbe punished, made his submission_.\u201d And indeed the temper of the\nmultitude in such cases, cannot be better described than in this\npassage. For often a people will be open-mouthed in condemning the\ndecrees of their prince, but afterwards, when they have to look\npunishment in the face, putting no trust in one another, they hasten to\ncomply. Wherefore, if you be in a position to keep the people\nwell-disposed towards you when they already are so, or to prevent them\ninjuring you in case they be ill-disposed, it is clearly of little\nmoment whether the feelings with which they profess to regard you, be\nfavourable or no. This applies to all unfriendliness on the part of a\npeople, whencesoever it proceed, excepting only the resentment felt by\nthem on being deprived either of liberty, or of a prince whom they love\nand who still survives. For the hostile temper produced by these two\ncauses is more to be feared than any beside, and demands measures of\nextreme severity to correct it. The other untoward humours of the\nmultitude, should there be no powerful chief to foster them, are easily\ndealt with; because, while on the one hand there is nothing more\nterrible than an uncontrolled and headless mob, on the other, there is\nnothing feebler. For though it be furnished with arms it is easily\nsubdued, if you have some place of strength wherein to shelter from its\nfirst onset. For when its first fury has somewhat abated, and each man\nsees that he has to return to his own house, all begin to lose heart\nand to take thought how to insure their personal safety, whether by\nflight or by submission. For which reason a multitude stirred in this\nway, if it would avoid dangers such as I speak of, must at once appoint\na head from among its own numbers, who may control it, keep it united,\nand provide for its defence; as did the commons of Rome when, after the\ndeath of Virginia, they quitted the city, and for their protection\ncreated twenty tribunes from among themselves. Unless this be done,\nwhat Titus Livius has observed in the passage cited, will always prove\ntrue, namely, that a multitude is strong while it holds together, but\nso soon as each of those who compose it begins to think of his own\nprivate danger, it becomes weak and contemptible.\nCHAPTER LVIII.\u2014_That a People is wiser and more constant than a Prince_\nThat \u201c_nothing is more fickle and inconstant than the multitude_\u201d is\naffirmed not by Titus Livius only, but by all other historians, in\nwhose chronicles of human actions we often find the multitude\ncondemning some citizen to death, and afterwards lamenting him and\ngrieving greatly for his loss, as the Romans grieved and lamented for\nManlius Capitolinus, whom they had themselves condemned to die. In\nrelating which circumstance our author observes \u201c_In a short time the\npeople, having no longer cause to fear him, began to deplore his\ndeath_\u201d And elsewhere, when speaking of what took place in Syracuse\nafter the murder of Hieronymus, grandson of Hiero, he says, \u201c_It is the\nnature of the multitude to be an abject slave, or a domineering\nmaster_\u201d\nIt may be that in attempting to defend a cause, which, as I have said,\nall writers are agreed to condemn, I take upon me a task so hard and\ndifficult that I shall either have to relinquish it with shame or\npursue it with opprobrium. Be that as it may, I neither do, nor ever\nshall judge it a fault, to support opinion by arguments, where it is\nnot sought to impose them by violence or authority I maintain, then,\nthat this infirmity with which historians tax the multitude, may with\nequal reason be charged against every individual man, but most of all\nagainst princes, since all who are not controlled by the laws, will\ncommit the very same faults as are committed by an uncontrolled\nmultitude. Proof whereof were easy, since of all the many princes\nexisting, or who have existed, few indeed are or have been either wise\nor good.\nI speak of such princes as have had it in their power to break the\nreins by which they are controlled, among whom I do not reckon those\nkings who reigned in Egypt in the most remote antiquity when that\ncountry was governed in conformity with its laws; nor do I include\nthose kings who reigned in Sparta, nor those who in our own times reign\nin France, which kingdom, more than any other whereof we have knowledge\nat the present day, is under the government of its laws. For kings who\nlive, as these do, subject to constitutional restraint, are not to be\ncounted when we have to consider each man\u2019s proper nature, and to see\nwhether he resembles the multitude. For to draw a comparison with such\nprinces as these, we must take the case of a multitude controlled as\nthey are, and regulated by the laws, when we shall find it to possess\nthe same virtues which we see in them, and neither conducting itself as\nan abject slave nor as a domineering master.\nSuch was the people of Rome, who, while the commonwealth continued\nuncorrupted, never either served abjectly nor domineered haughtily;\nbut, on the contrary, by means of their magistrates and their\nordinances, maintained their place, and when forced to put forth their\nstrength against some powerful citizen, as in the case of Manlius, the\ndecemvirs, and others who sought to oppress them, did so; but when it\nwas necessary for the public welfare to yield obedience to the dictator\nor consuls, obeyed. And if the Roman people mourned the loss of the\ndead Manlius, it is no wonder; for they mourned his virtues, which had\nbeen of such a sort that their memory stirred the regret of all, and\nwould have had power to produce the same feelings even in a prince; all\nwriters being agreed that excellence is praised and admired even by its\nenemies. But if Manlius when he was so greatly mourned, could have\nrisen once more from the dead, the Roman people would have pronounced\nthe same sentence against him which they pronounced when they led him\nforth from the prison-house, and straightway condemned him to die. And\nin like manner we see that princes, accounted wise, have put men to\ndeath, and afterwards greatly lamented them, as Alexander mourned for\nClitus and others of his friends, and Herod for Mariamne.\nBut what our historian says of the multitude, he says not of a\nmultitude which like the people of Rome is controlled by the laws, but\nof an uncontrolled multitude like the Syracusans, who were guilty of\nall these crimes which infuriated and ungoverned men commit, and which\nwere equally committed by Alexander and Herod in the cases mentioned.\nWherefore the nature of a multitude is no more to be blamed than the\nnature of princes, since both equally err when they can do so without\nregard to consequences. Of which many instances, besides those already\ngiven, might be cited from the history of the Roman emperors, and of\nother princes and tyrants, in whose lives we find such inconstancy and\nfickleness, as we might look in vain for in a people.\nI maintain, therefore, contrary to the common opinion which avers that\na people when they have the management of affairs are changeable,\nfickle, and ungrateful, that these faults exist not in them otherwise\nthan as they exist in individual princes; so that were any to accuse\nboth princes and peoples, the charge might be true, but that to make\nexception in favour of princes is a mistake; for a people in command,\nif it be duly restrained, will have the same prudence and the same\ngratitude as a prince has, or even more, however wise he may be\nreckoned; and a prince on the other hand, if freed from the control of\nthe laws, will be more ungrateful, fickle, and short-sighted than a\npeople. And further, I say that any difference in their methods of\nacting results not from any difference in their nature, that being the\nsame in both, or, if there be advantage on either side, the advantage\nresting with the people, but from their having more or less respect for\nthe laws under which each lives. And whosoever attentively considers\nthe history of the Roman people, may see that for four hundred years\nthey never relaxed in their hatred of the regal name, and were\nconstantly devoted to the glory and welfare of their country, and will\nfind numberless proofs given by them of their consistency in both\nparticulars. And should any allege against me the ingratitude they\nshowed to Scipio, I reply by what has already been said at length on\nthat head, where I proved that peoples are less ungrateful than\nprinces. But as for prudence and stability of purpose, I affirm that a\npeople is more prudent, more stable, and of better judgment than a\nprince. Nor is it without reason that the voice of the people has been\nlikened to the voice of God; for we see that wide-spread beliefs fulfil\nthemselves, and bring about marvellous results, so as to have the\nappearance of presaging by some occult quality either weal or woe.\nAgain, as to the justice of their opinions on public affairs, seldom\nfind that after hearing two speakers of equal ability urging them in\nopposite directions, they do not adopt the sounder view, or are unable\nto decide on the truth of what they hear. And if, as I have said, a\npeople errs in adopting courses which appear to it bold and\nadvantageous, princes will likewise err when their passions are\ntouched, as is far oftener the case with them than with a people.\nWe see, too, that in the choice of magistrates a people will choose far\nmore honestly than a prince; so that while you shall never persuade a\npeople that it is advantageous to confer dignities on the infamous and\nprofligate, a prince may readily, and in a thousand ways, be drawn to\ndo so. Again, it may be seen that a people, when once they have come to\nhold a thing in abhorrence, remain for many ages of the same mind;\nwhich we do not find happen with princes. For the truth of both of\nwhich assertions the Roman people are my sufficient witness, who, in\nthe course of so many hundred years, and in so many elections of\nconsuls and tribunes, never made four appointments of which they had\nreason to repent; and, as I have said, so detested the name of king,\nthat no obligation they might be under to any citizen who affected that\nname, could shield him from the appointed penalty.\nFurther, we find that those cities wherein the government is in the\nhands of the people, in a very short space of time, make marvellous\nprogress, far exceeding that made by cities which have been always\nruled by princes; as Rome grew after the expulsion of her kings, and\nAthens after she freed herself from Pisistratus; and this we can\nascribe to no other cause than that the rule of a people is better than\nthe rule of a prince.\nNor would I have it thought that anything our historian may have\naffirmed in the passage cited, or elsewhere, controverts these my\nopinions. For if all the glories and all the defects both of peoples\nand of princes be carefully weighed, it will appear that both for\ngoodness and for glory a people is to be preferred. And if princes\nsurpass peoples in the work of legislation, in shaping civil\ninstitutions, in moulding statutes, and framing new ordinances, so far\ndo the latter surpass the former in maintaining what has once been\nestablished, as to merit no less praise than they.\nAnd to state the sum of the whole matter shortly, I say that popular\ngovernments have endured for long periods in the same way as the\ngovernments of princes, and that both have need to be regulated by the\nlaws; because the prince who can do what he pleases is a madman, and\nthe people which can do as it pleases is never wise. If, then, we\nassume the case of a prince bound, and of a people chained down by the\nlaws, greater virtue will appear in the people than in the prince;\nwhile if we assume the case of each of them freed from all control, it\nwill be seen that the people commits fewer errors than the prince, and\nless serious errors, and such as admit of readier cure. For a turbulent\nand unruly people may be spoken to by a good man, and readily brought\nback to good ways; but none can speak to a wicked prince, nor any\nremedy be found against him but by the sword. And from this we may\ninfer which of the two suffers from the worse disease; for if the\ndisease of the people may be healed by words, while that of the prince\nmust be dealt with by the sword, there is none but will judge that evil\nto be the greater which demands the more violent remedy.\nWhen a people is absolutely uncontrolled, it is not so much the follies\nwhich it commits or the evil which it actually does that excites alarm,\nas the mischief which may thence result, since in such disorders it\nbecomes possible for a tyrant to spring up. But with a wicked prince\nthe contrary is the case; for we dread present ill, and place our hopes\nin the future, persuading ourselves that the evil life of the prince\nmay bring about our freedom. So that there is this distinction between\nthe two, that with the one we fear what is, with the other what is\nlikely to be. Again, the cruelties of a people are turned against him\nwho it fears will encroach upon the common rights, but the cruelties of\nthe prince against those who he fears may assert those rights.\nThe prejudice which is entertained against the people arises from this,\nthat any man may speak ill of them openly and fearlessly, even when the\ngovernment is in their hands; whereas princes are always spoken of with\na thousand reserves and a constant eye to consequences.\nBut since the subject suggests it, it seems to me not out of place to\nconsider what alliances we can most trust, whether those made with\ncommonwealths or those made with princes.\nCHAPTER LIX.\u2014_To what Leagues or Alliances we may most trust; whether\nthose we make with Commonwealths or those we make with Princes_.\nSince leagues and alliances are every day entered into by one prince\nwith another, or by one commonwealth with another, and as conventions\nand treaties are concluded in like manner between princes and\ncommonwealths, it seems to me proper to inquire whether the faith of a\ncommonwealth or that of a prince is the more stable and the safer to\ncount on. All things considered, I am disposed to believe that in most\ncases they are alike, though in some they differ. Of one thing,\nhowever, I am convinced, namely, that engagements made under duress\nwill never be observed either by prince or by commonwealth; and that if\nmenaced with the loss of their territories, both the one and the other\nwill break faith with you and treat you with ingratitude. Demetrius,\nwho was named the \u201cCity-taker,\u201d had conferred numberless benefits upon\nthe Athenians; but when, afterwards, on being defeated by his enemies,\nhe sought shelter in Athens, as being a friendly city and under\nobligations to him, it was refused him; a circumstance which grieved\nhim far more than the loss of his soldiers and army had done. Pompey,\nin like manner, when routed by C\u00e6sar in Thessaly, fled for refuge to\nPtolemy in Egypt, who formerly had been restored by him to his kingdom;\nby whom he was put to death. In both these instances the same causes\nwere at work, although the inhumanity and the wrong inflicted were less\nin the case of the commonwealth than of the prince. Still, wherever\nthere is fear, the want of faith will be the same.\nAnd even if there be found a commonwealth or prince who, in order to\nkeep faith, will submit to be ruined, this is seen to result from a\nlike cause. For, as to the prince, it may easily happen that he is\nfriend to a powerful sovereign, whom, though he be at the time without\nmeans to defend him, he may presently hope to see restored to his\ndominions; or it may be that having linked his fortunes with another\u2019s,\nhe despairs of finding either faith or friendship from the enemies of\nhis ally, as was the case with those Neapolitan princes who espoused\nthe interests of France. As to commonwealths, an instance similar to\nthat of the princes last named, is that of Saguntum in Spain, which\nawaited ruin in adhering to the fortunes of Rome. A like course was\nalso followed by Florence when, in the year 1512, she stood steadfastly\nby the cause of the French. And taking everything into account, I\nbelieve that in cases of urgency, we shall find a certain degree of\nstability sooner in commonwealths than in princes. For though\ncommonwealths be like-minded with princes, and influenced by the same\npassions, the circumstance that their movements must be slower, makes\nit harder for them to resolve than it is for a prince, for which reason\nthey will be less ready to break faith.\nAnd since leagues and alliances are broken for the sake of certain\nadvantages, in this respect also, commonwealths observe their\nengagements far more faithfully than princes; for abundant examples\nmight be cited of a very slight advantage having caused a prince to\nbreak faith, and of a very great advantage having failed to induce a\ncommonwealth to do so. Of this we have an instance in the proposal made\nto the Athenians by Themistocles, when he told them at a public meeting\nthat he had certain advice to offer which would prove of great\nadvantage to their city, but the nature of which he could not disclose\nto them, lest it should become generally known, when the opportunity\nfor acting upon it would be lost. Whereupon the Athenians named\nAristides to receive his communication, and to act upon it as he\nthought fit. To him, accordingly, Themistocles showed how the navy of\nunited Greece, for the safety of which the Athenians stood pledged, was\nso situated that they might either gain it over or destroy it, and thus\nmake themselves absolute masters of the whole country. Aristides\nreporting to the Athenians that the course proposed by Themistocles was\nextremely advantageous but extremely dishonourable, the people utterly\nrefused to entertain it. But Philip of Macedon would not have so acted,\nnor any of those other princes who have sought and found more profit in\nbreaking faith than in any other way.\nAs to engagements broken off on the pretext that they have not been\nobserved by the other side, I say nothing, since that is a matter of\neveryday occurrence, and I am speaking here only of those engagements\nwhich are broken off on extraordinary grounds; but in this respect,\nlikewise, I believe that commonwealths offend less than princes, and\nare therefore more to be trusted.\nCHAPTER LX.\u2014_That the Consulship and all the other Magistracies in Rome\nwere given without respect to Age_.\nIt is seen in the course of the Roman history that, after the\nconsulship was thrown open to the commons, the republic conceded this\ndignity to all its citizens, without distinction either of age or\nblood; nay, that in this matter respect for age was never made a ground\nfor preference among the Romans, whose constant aim it was to discover\nexcellence whether existing in old or young. To this we have the\ntestimony of Valerius Corvinus, himself made consul in his\ntwenty-fourth year, who, in addressing his soldiers, said of the\nconsulship that it was \u201c_the reward not of birth but of desert_.\u201d\nWhether the course thus followed by the Romans was well judged or not,\nis a question on which much might be said. The concession as to blood,\nhowever, was made under necessity, and as I have observed on another\noccasion, the same necessity which obtained in Rome, will be found to\nobtain in every other city which desires to achieve the results which\nRome achieved. For you cannot subject men to hardships unless you hold\nout rewards, nor can you without danger deprive them of those rewards\nwhereof you have held out hopes. It was consequently necessary to\nextend, betimes, to the commons the hope of obtaining the consulship,\non which hope they fed themselves for a while, without actually\nrealizing it. But afterwards the hope alone was not enough, and it had\nto be satisfied. For while cities which do not employ men of plebeian\nbirth in any of those undertakings wherein glory is to be gained, as we\nhave seen was the case with Venice, may treat these men as they please,\nthose other cities which desire to do as Rome did, cannot make this\ndistinction. And if there is to be no distinction in respect of blood,\nnothing can be pleaded for a distinction in respect of age. On the\ncontrary, that distinction must of necessity cease to be observed. For\nwhere a young man is appointed to a post which requires the prudence\nwhich are is supposed to bring, it must be, since the choice rests with\nthe people, that he is thus advanced in consideration of some noble\naction which he has performed; but when a young man is of such\nexcellence as to have made a name for himself by some signal\nachievement, it were much to the detriment of his city were it unable\nat once to make use of him, but had to wait until he had grown old, and\nhad lost, with youth, that alacrity and vigour by which his country\nmight have profited; as Rome profited by the services of Valerius\nCorvinus, of Scipio, of Pompey, and of many others who triumphed while\nyet very young.\nBOOK II.\nPREFACE.\nMen do always, but not always with reason, commend the past and condemn\nthe present, and are so much the partisans of what has been, as not\nmerely to cry up those times which are known to them only from the\nrecords left by historians, but also, when they grow old, to extol the\ndays in which they remember their youth to have been spent. And\nalthough this preference of theirs be in most instances a mistaken one,\nI can see that there are many causes to account for it; chief of which\nI take to be that in respect of things long gone by we perceive not the\nwhole truth, those circumstances that would detract from the credit of\nthe past being for the most part hidden from us, while all that gives\nit lustre is magnified and embellished. For the generality of writers\nrender this tribute to the good fortune of conquerors, that to make\ntheir achievements seem more splendid, they not merely exaggerate the\ngreat things they have done, but also lend such a colour to the actions\nof their enemies, that any one born afterwards, whether in the\nconquering or in the conquered country, has cause to marvel at these\nmen and these times, and is constrained to praise and love them beyond\nall others.\nAgain, men being moved to hatred either by fear or envy, these two most\npowerful causes of dislike are cancelled in respect of things which are\npast, because what is past can neither do us hurt, nor afford occasion\nfor envy. The contrary, however, is the case with the things we see,\nand in which we take part; for in these, from our complete acquaintance\nwith them, no part of them being hidden from us, we recognize, along\nwith much that is good, much that displeases us, and so are forced to\npronounce them far inferior to the old, although in truth they deserve\nfar greater praise and admiration. I speak not, here, of what relates\nto the arts, which have such distinction inherent in them, that time\ncan give or take from them but little of the glory which they merit of\nthemselves. I speak of the lives and manners of men, touching which the\ngrounds for judging are not so clear.\nI repeat, then, that it is true that this habit of blaming and praising\nobtains, but not always true that it is wrong applied. For sometimes it\nwill happen that this judgment is just; because, as human affairs are\nin constant movement, it must be that they either rise or fall.\nWherefore, we may see a city or province furnished with free\ninstitutions by some great and wise founder, flourish for a while\nthrough his merits, and advance steadily on the path of improvement.\nAny one born therein at that time would be in the wrong to praise the\npast more than the present, and his error would be occasioned by the\ncauses already noticed. But any one born afterwards in that city or\nprovince when the time has come for it to fall away from its former\nfelicity, would not be mistaken in praising the past.\nWhen I consider how this happens, I am persuaded that the world,\nremaining continually the same, has in it a constant quantity of good\nand evil; but that this good and this evil shift about from one country\nto another, as we know that in ancient times empire shifted from one\nnation to another, according as the manners of these nations changed,\nthe world, as a whole, continuing as before, and the only difference\nbeing that, whereas at first Assyria was made the seat of its\nexcellence, this was afterwards placed in Media, then in Persia, until\nat last it was transferred to Italy and Rome. And although after the\nRoman Empire, none has followed which has endured, or in which the\nworld has centred its whole excellence, we nevertheless find that\nexcellence diffused among many valiant nations, the kingdom of the\nFranks, for example, that of the Turks, that of the Soldan, and the\nStates of Germany at the present day; and shared at an earlier time by\nthat sect of the Saracens who performed so many great achievements and\ngained so wide a dominion, after destroying the Roman Empire in the\nEast.\nIn all these countries, therefore, after the decline of the Roman\npower, and among all these races, there existed, and in some part of\nthem there yet exists, that excellence which alone is to be desired and\njustly to be praised. Wherefore, if any man being born in one of these\ncountries should exalt past times over present, he might be mistaken;\nbut any who, living at the present day in Italy or Greece, has not in\nItaly become an ultramontane or in Greece a Turk, has reason to\ncomplain of his own times, and to commend those others, in which there\nwere many things which made them admirable; whereas, now, no regard\nbeing had to religion, to laws, or to arms, but all being tarnished\nwith every sort of shame, there is nothing to redeem the age from the\nlast extremity of wretchedness, ignominy, and disgrace. And the vices\nof our age are the more odious in that they are practised by those who\nsit on the judgment seat, govern the State, and demand public\nreverence.\nBut, returning to the matter in hand, it may be said, that if the\njudgment of men be at fault in pronouncing whether the present age or\nthe past is the better in respect of things whereof, by reason of their\nantiquity, they cannot have the same perfect knowledge which they have\nof their own times, it ought not to be at fault in old men when they\ncompare the days of their youth with those of their maturity, both of\nwhich have been alike seen and known by them. This were indeed true, if\nmen at all periods of their lives judged of things in the same way, and\nwere constantly influenced by the same desires; but since they alter,\nthe times, although they alter not, cannot but seem different to those\nwho have other desires, other pleasures, and other ways of viewing\nthings in their old age from those they had in their youth. For since,\nwhen they grow old, men lose in bodily strength but gain in wisdom and\ndiscernment, it must needs be that those things which in their youth\nseemed to them tolerable and good, should in their old age appear\nintolerable and evil. And whereas they should ascribe this to their\njudgment, they lay the blame upon the times.\nBut, further, since the desires of men are insatiable, Nature prompting\nthem to desire all things and Fortune permitting them to enjoy but few,\nthere results a constant discontent in their minds, and a loathing of\nwhat they possess, prompting them to find fault with the present,\npraise the past, and long for the future, even though they be not moved\nthereto by any reasonable cause.\nI know not, therefore, whether I may not deserve to be reckoned in the\nnumber of those who thus deceive themselves, if, in these Discourses of\nmine, I render excessive praise to the ancient times of the Romans\nwhile I censure our own. And, indeed, were not the excellence which\nthen prevailed and the corruption which prevails now clearer than the\nsun, I should proceed more guardedly in what I have to say, from fear\nlest in accusing others I should myself fall into this self-deception.\nBut since the thing is so plain that every one sees it, I shall be bold\nto speak freely all I think, both of old times and of new, in order\nthat the minds of the young who happen to read these my writings, may\nbe led to shun modern examples, and be prepared to follow those set by\nantiquity whenever chance affords the opportunity. For it is the duty\nof every good man to teach others those wholesome lessons which the\nmalice of Time or of Fortune has not permitted him to put in practice;\nto the end, that out of many who have the knowledge, some one better\nloved by Heaven may be found able to carry them out.\nHaving spoken, then, in the foregoing Book of the various methods\nfollowed by the Romans in regulating the domestic affairs of their\ncity, in this I shall speak of what was done by them to spread their\nEmpire.\nCHAPTER I.\u2014_Whether the Empire acquired by the Romans was more due to\nValour or to Fortune_.\nMany authors, and among others that most grave historian Plutarch, have\nthought that in acquiring their empire the Romans were more beholden to\ntheir good fortune than to their valour; and besides other reasons\nwhich they give for this opinion, they affirm it to be proved by the\nadmission of the Romans themselves, since their having erected more\ntemples to Fortune than to any other deity, shows that it was to her\nthat they ascribed their success. It would seem, too, that Titus Livius\nwas of the same mind, since he very seldom puts a speech into the mouth\nof any Roman in which he discourses of valour, wherein he does not also\nmake mention of Fortune. This, however, is an opinion with which I can\nin no way concur, and which, I take it, cannot be made good. For if no\ncommonwealth has ever been found to grow like the Roman, it is because\nnone was ever found so well fitted by its institutions to make that\ngrowth. For by the valour of her armies she spread her empire, while by\nher conduct of affairs, and by other methods peculiar to herself and\ndevised by her first founder, she was able to keep what she acquired,\nas shall be fully shown in many of the following Discourses.\nThe writers to whom I have referred assert that it was owing to their\ngood fortune and not to their prudence that the Romans never had two\ngreat wars on their hands at once; as, for instance, that they waged no\nwars with the Latins until they had not merely overcome the Samnites,\nbut undertook in their defence the war on which they then entered; nor\never fought with the Etruscans until they had subjugated the Latins,\nand had almost worn out the Samnites by frequent defeats; whereas, had\nany two of these powers, while yet fresh and unexhausted, united\ntogether, it may easily be believed that the ruin of the Roman Republic\nmust have followed. But to whatsoever cause we ascribe it, it never so\nchanced that the Romans engaged in two great wars at the same time. On\nthe contrary, it always seemed as though on the breaking out of one\nwar, another was extinguished; or that on the termination of one,\nanother broke out. And this we may plainly see from the order in which\ntheir wars succeeded one another.\nFor, omitting those waged by them before their city was taken by the\nGauls, we find that during their struggle with the Equians and the\nVolscians, and while these two nations continued strong, no others rose\nagainst them. On these being subdued, there broke out the war with the\nSamnites; and although before the close of that contest the Latin\nnations had begun to rebel against Rome, nevertheless, when their\nrebellion came to a head, the Samnites were in league with Rome, and\nhelped her with their army to quell the presumption of the rebels; on\nwhose defeat the war with Samnium was renewed.\nWhen the strength of Samnium had been drained by repeated reverses,\nthere followed the war with the Etruscans; which ended, the Samnites\nwere once more stirred to activity by the coming of Pyrrhus into Italy.\nWhen he, too, had been defeated, and sent back to Greece, Rome entered\non her first war with the Carthaginians; which was no sooner over than\nall the Gallic nations on both sides of the Alps combined against the\nRomans, by whom, in the battle fought between Populonia and Pisa, where\nnow stands the fortress of San Vincenzo, they were at last routed with\ntremendous slaughter.\nThis war ended, for twenty years together the Romans were engaged in no\ncontest of importance, their only adversaries being the Ligurians, and\nthe remnant of the Gallic tribes who occupied Lombardy; and on this\nfooting things continued down to the second Carthaginian war, which for\nsixteen years kept the whole of Italy in a blaze. This too being\nbrought to a most glorious termination, there followed the Macedonian\nwar, at the close of which succeeded the war with Antiochus and Asia.\nThese subdued, there remained not in the whole world, king or people\nwho either singly or together could withstand the power of Rome.\nBut even before this last victory, any one observing the order of these\nwars, and the method in which they were conducted, must have recognized\nnot only the good fortune of the Romans, but also their extraordinary\nvalour and prudence. And were any one to search for the causes of this\ngood fortune, he would have little difficulty in finding them, since\nnothing is more certain than that when a potentate has attained so\ngreat a reputation that every neighbouring prince or people is afraid\nto engage him single-handed, and stands in awe of him, none will ever\nventure to attack him, unless driven to do so by necessity; so that it\nwill almost rest on his will to make war as he likes on any of his\nneighbours, while he studiously maintains peace with the rest; who, on\ntheir part, whether through fear of his power, or deceived by the\nmethods he takes to dull their vigilance, are easily kept quiet.\nDistant powers, in the mean time, who have no intercourse with either,\ntreat the matter as too remote to concern them in any way; and abiding\nin this error until the conflagration approaches their own doors, on\nits arrival have no resource for its extinction, save in their own\nstrength, which, as their enemy has by that time become exceedingly\npowerful, no longer suffices.\nI forbear to relate how the Samnites stood looking on while the Romans\nwere subjugating the Equians and the Volscians; and, to avoid being\nprolix, shall content myself with the single instance of the\nCarthaginians, who, at the time when the Romans were contending with\nthe Samnites and Etruscans, were possessed of great power and held in\nhigh repute, being already masters of the whole of Africa together with\nSicily and Sardinia, besides occupying territory in various parts of\nSpain. And because their empire was so great, and at such a distance\nfrom the Roman frontier, they were never led to think of attacking the\nRomans or of lending assistance to the Etruscans or Samnites. On the\ncontrary, they behaved towards the Romans as men behave towards those\nwhom they see prosper, rather taking their part and courting their\nfriendship. Nor did they discover their mistake until the Romans, after\nsubduing all the intervening nations, began to assail their power both\nin Spain and Sicily. What happened in the case of the Carthaginians,\nhappened also in the case of the Gauls, of Philip of Macedon, and of\nAntiochus, each of whom, while Rome was engaged with another of them,\nbelieved that other would have the advantage, and that there would be\ntime enough to provide for their own safety, whether by making peace or\nwar. It seems to me, therefore, that the same good fortune which, in\nthis respect, attended the Romans, might be shared by all princes\nacting as they did, and of a valour equal to theirs.\nAs bearing on this point, it might have been proper for me to show what\nmethods were followed by the Romans in entering the territories of\nother nations, had I not already spoken of this at length in my\n_Treatise on Princedoms_, wherein the whole subject is discussed. Here\nit is enough to say briefly, that in a new province they always sought\nfor some friend who should be to them as a ladder whereby to climb, a\ndoor through which to pass, or an instrument wherewith to keep their\nhold. Thus we see them effect their entrance into Samnium through the\nCapuans, into Etruria through the Camertines, into Sicily through the\nMamertines, into Spain through the Saguntans, into Africa through\nMassinissa, into Greece through the Etolians, into Asia through Eumenes\nand other princes, into Gaul through the Massilians and Eduans; and, in\nlike manner, never without similar assistance in their efforts whether\nto acquire provinces or to keep them.\nThe nations who carefully attend to this precaution will be seen to\nstand in less need of Fortune\u2019s help than others who neglect it. But\nthat all may clearly understand how much more the Romans were aided by\nvalour than by Fortune in acquiring their empire, I shall in the\nfollowing Chapter consider the character of those nations with whom\nthey had to contend, and show how stubborn these were in defending\ntheir freedom.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014_With what Nations the Romans had to contend, and how\nstubborn these were in defending their Freedom._\nIn subduing the countries round about them, and certain of the more\ndistant provinces, nothing gave the Romans so much trouble, as the love\nwhich in those days many nations bore to freedom, defending it with\nsuch obstinacy as could not have been overcome save by a surpassing\nvalour. For we know by numberless instances, what perils these nations\nwere ready to face in their efforts to maintain or recover their\nfreedom, and what vengeance they took against those who deprived them\nof it. We know, too, from history, what hurt a people or city suffers\nfrom servitude. And though, at the present day, there is but one\nprovince which can be said to contain within it free cities, we find\nthat formerly these abounded everywhere. For we learn that in the\nancient times of which I speak, from the mountains which divide Tuscany\nfrom Lombardy down to the extreme point of Italy, there dwelt numerous\nfree nations, such as the Etruscans, the Romans, and the Samnites,\nbesides many others in other parts of the Peninsula. Nor do we ever\nread of there being any kings over them, except those who reigned in\nRome, and Porsenna, king of Etruria. How the line of this last-named\nprince came to be extinguished, history does not inform us; but it is\nclear that at the time when the Romans went to besiege Veii, Etruria\nwas free, and so greatly rejoiced in her freedom, and so detested the\nregal name, that when the Veientines, who for their defence had created\na king in Veii, sought aid from the Etruscans against Rome, these,\nafter much deliberation resolved to lend them no help while they\ncontinued to live under a king; judging it useless to defend a country\ngiven over to servitude by its inhabitants.\nIt is easy to understand whence this love of liberty arises among\nnations, for we know by experience that States have never signally\nincreased, either as to dominion or wealth, except where they have\nlived under a free government. And truly it is strange to think to what\na pitch of greatness Athens came during the hundred years after she had\nfreed herself from the despotism of Pisistratus; and far stranger to\ncontemplate the marvellous growth which Rome made after freeing herself\nfrom her kings. The cause, however, is not far to seek, since it is the\nwell-being, not of individuals, but of the community which makes a\nState great; and, without question, this universal well-being is\nnowhere secured save in a republic. For a republic will do whatsoever\nmakes for its interest; and though its measures prove hurtful to this\nman or to that, there are so many whom they benefit, that these are\nable to carry them out, in spite of the resistance of the few whom they\ninjure.\nBut the contrary happens in the case of a prince; for, as a rule, what\nhelps him hurts the State, and what helps the State hurts him; so that\nwhenever a tyranny springs up in a city which has lived free, the least\nevil which can befall that city is to make no further progress, nor\never increase in power or wealth; but in most cases, if not in all, it\nwill be its fate to go back. Or should there chance to arise in it some\nable tyrant who extends his dominions by his valour and skill in arms,\nthe advantage which results is to himself only, and not to the State;\nsince he can bestow no honours on those of the citizens over whom he\ntyrannizes who have shown themselves good and valiant, lest afterwards\nhe should have cause to fear them. Nor can he make those cities which\nhe acquires, subject or tributary to the city over which he rules;\nbecause to make this city powerful is not for his interest, which lies\nin keeping it so divided that each town and province may separately\nrecognize him alone as its master. In this way he only, and not his\ncountry, is the gainer by his conquests. And if any one desire to have\nthis view confirmed by numberless other proofs, let him look into\nXenophon\u2019s treatise _De Tirannide_.\nNo wonder, then, that the nations of antiquity pursued tyrants with\nsuch relentless hatred, and so passionately loved freedom that its very\nname was dear to them, as was seen when Hieronymus, grandson of Hiero\nthe Syracusan, was put to death in Syracuse. For when word of his death\nreached the army, which lay encamped not far off, at first it was\ngreatly moved, and eager to take up arms against the murderers. But on\nhearing the cry of liberty shouted in the streets of Syracuse, quieted\nat once by the name, it laid aside its resentment against those who had\nslain the tyrant, and fell to consider how a free government might be\nprovided for the city.\nNor is it to be wondered at that the ancient nations took terrible\nvengeance on those who deprived them of their freedom; of which, though\nthere be many instances, I mean only to cite one which happened in the\ncity of Corcyra at the time of the Peloponnesian war. For Greece being\ndivided into two factions, one of which sided with the Athenians, the\nother with the Spartans, it resulted that many of its cities were\ndivided against themselves, some of the citizens seeking the friendship\nof Sparta and some of Athens. In the aforesaid city of Corcyra, the\nnobles getting the upper hand, deprived the commons of their freedom;\nthese, however, recovering themselves with the help of the Athenians,\nlaid hold of the entire body of the nobles, and cast them into a prison\nlarge enough to contain them all, whence they brought them forth by\neight or ten at a time, pretending that they were to be sent to\ndifferent places into banishment, whereas, in fact, they put them to\ndeath with many circumstances of cruelty. Those who were left, learning\nwhat was going on, resolved to do their utmost to escape this\nignominious death, and arming themselves with what weapons they could\nfind, defended the door of their prison against all who sought to\nenter; till the people, hearing the tumult and rushing in haste to the\nprison, dragged down the roof, and smothered the prisoners in the\nruins. Many other horrible and atrocious cruelties likewise perpetrated\nin Greece, show it to be true that a lost freedom is avenged with more\nferocity than a threatened freedom is defended.\nWhen I consider whence it happened that the nations of antiquity were\nso much more zealous in their love of liberty than those of the present\nday, I am led to believe that it arose from the same cause which makes\nthe present generation of men less vigorous and daring than those of\nancient times, namely the difference of the training of the present day\nfrom that of earlier ages; and this, again, arises from the different\ncharacter of the religions then and now prevailing. For our religion,\nhaving revealed to us the truth and the true path, teaches us to make\nlittle account of worldly glory; whereas, the Gentiles, greatly\nesteeming it, and placing therein their highest good, displayed a\ngreater fierceness in their actions.\nThis we may gather from many of their customs, beginning with their\nsacrificial rites, which were of much magnificence as compared with the\nsimplicity of our worship, though that be not without a certain dignity\nof its own, refined rather than splendid, and far removed from any\ntincture of ferocity or violence. In the religious ceremonies of the\nancients neither pomp nor splendour were wanting; but to these was\njoined the ordinance of sacrifice, giving occasion to much bloodshed\nand cruelty. For in its celebration many beasts were slaughtered, and\nthis being a cruel spectacle imparted a cruel temper to the\nworshippers. Moreover, under the old religions none obtained divine\nhonours save those who were loaded with worldly glory, such as captains\nof armies and rulers of cities; whereas our religion glorifies men of a\nhumble and contemplative, rather than of an active life. Accordingly,\nwhile the highest good of the old religions consisted in magnanimity,\nbodily strength, and all those other qualities which make men brave,\nour religion places it in humility, lowliness, and contempt for the\nthings of this world; or if it ever calls upon us to be brave, it is\nthat we should be brave to suffer rather than to do.\nThis manner of life, therefore, seems to have made the world feebler,\nand to have given it over as a prey to wicked men to deal with as they\nplease; since the mass of mankind, in the hope of being received into\nParadise, think more how to bear injuries than how to avenge them. But\nshould it seem that the world has grown effeminate and Heaven laid\naside her arms, this assuredly results from the baseness of those who\nhave interpreted our religion to accord with indolence and ease rather\nthan with valour. For were we to remember that religion permits the\nexaltation and defence of our country, we would see it to be our duty\nto love and honour it, and would strive to be able and ready to defend\nit.\nThis training, therefore, and these most false interpretations are the\ncauses why, in the world of the present day, we find no longer the\nnumerous commonwealths which were found of old; and in consequence,\nthat we see not now among the nations that love of freedom which\nprevailed then; though, at the same time, I am persuaded that one cause\nof this change has been, that the Roman Empire by its arms and power\nput an end to all the free States and free institutions of antiquity.\nFor although the power of Rome fell afterwards into decay, these States\ncould never recover their strength or resume their former mode of\ngovernment, save in a very few districts of the Empire.\nBut, be this as it may, certain it is that in every country of the\nworld, even the least considerable, the Romans found a league of\nwell-armed republics, most resolute in the defence of their freedom,\nwhom it is clear they never could have subdued had they not been\nendowed with the rarest and most astonishing valour. To cite a single\ninstance, I shall take the case of the Samnites who, strange as it may\nnow seem, were on the admission of Titus Livius himself, so powerful\nand so steadfast in arms, as to be able to withstand the Romans down to\nthe consulship of Papirius Cursor, son to the first Papirius, a period\nof six and forty years, in spite of numerous defeats, the loss of many\nof their towns, and the great slaughter which overtook them everywhere\nthroughout their country. And this is the more remarkable when we see\nthat country, which once contained so many noble cities, and supported\nso great a population, now almost uninhabited; and reflect that it\nformerly enjoyed a government and possessed resources making its\nconquest impossible to less than Roman valour.\nThere is no difficulty, therefore, in determining whence that ancient\ngreatness and this modern decay have arisen, since they can be traced\nto the free life formerly prevailing and to the servitude which\nprevails now. For all countries and provinces which enjoy complete\nfreedom, make, as I have said, most rapid progress. Because, from\nmarriage being less restricted in these countries, and more sought\nafter, we find there a greater population; every man being disposed to\nbeget as many children as he thinks he can rear, when he has no anxiety\nlest they should be deprived of their patrimony, and knows not only\nthat they are born to freedom and not to slavery, but that they may\nrise by their merit to be the first men of their country. In such\nStates, accordingly, we see wealth multiply, both that which comes from\nagriculture and that which comes from manufactures. For all love to\ngather riches and to add to their possessions when their enjoyment of\nthem is not likely to be disturbed. And hence it happens that the\ncitizens of such States vie with one another in whatever tends to\npromote public or private well-being; in both of which, consequently,\nthere is a wonderful growth.\nBut the contrary of all this takes place in those countries which live\nin servitude, and the more oppressive their servitude, the more they\nfall short of the good which all desire. And the hardest of all hard\nservitudes is that wherein one commonwealth is subjected to another.\nFirst, because it is more lasting, and there is less hope to escape\nfrom it; and, second, because every commonwealth seeks to add to its\nown strength by weakening and enfeebling all beside. A prince who gets\nthe better of you will not treat you after this fashion, unless he be a\nbarbarian like those eastern despots who lay countries waste and\ndestroy the labours of civilization; but if influenced by the ordinary\npromptings of humanity, will, as a rule, regard all his subject States\nwith equal favour, and suffer them to pursue their usual employments,\nand retain almost all their ancient institutions, so that if they\nflourish not as free States might, they do not dwindle as States that\nare enslaved; by which I mean enslaved by a stranger, for of that other\nslavery to which they may be reduced by one of their own citizens, I\nhave already spoken.\nWhoever, therefore, shall well consider what has been said above, will\nnot be astonished at the power possessed by the Samnites while they\nwere still free, nor at the weakness into which they fell when they\nwere subjugated. Of which change in their fortunes Livius often reminds\nus, and particularly in connection with the war with Hannibal, where he\nrelates that the Samnites, being ill-treated by a Roman legion\nquartered at Nola, sent legates to Hannibal to ask his aid; who in\nlaying their case before him told him, that with their own soldiers and\ncaptains they had fought single handed against the Romans for a hundred\nyears, and had more than once withstood two consuls and two consular\narmies; but had now fallen so low, that they were scarce able to defend\nthemselves against one poor legion.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014_That Rome became great by destroying the Cities which lay\nround about her, and by readily admitting strangers to the rights of\nCitizenship._\n\u201cCrescit interea Roma Alb\u00e6 ruinis\u201d\u2014_Meanwhile Rome grows on the ruins\nof Alba_. They who would have their city become a great empire, must\nendeavour by every means to fill it with inhabitants; for without a\nnumerous population no city can ever succeed in growing powerful. This\nmay be effected in two ways, by gentleness or by force. By gentleness,\nwhen you offer a safe and open path to all strangers who may wish to\ncome and dwell in your city, so as to encourage them to come there of\ntheir own accord; by force, when after destroying neighbouring towns,\nyou transplant their inhabitants to live in yours. Both of these\nmethods were practised by Rome, and with such success, that in the time\nof her sixth king there dwelt within her walls eighty thousand citizens\nfit to bear arms. For the Romans loved to follow the methods of the\nskilful husbandman, who, to insure a plant growing big and yielding and\nmaturing its fruit, cuts off the first shoots it sends out, that the\nstrength remaining in the stem, it may in due season put forth new and\nmore vigorous and more fruitful branches. And that this was a right and\na necessary course for Rome to take for establishing and extending her\nempire, is proved by the example of Sparta and Athens, which, although\nexceedingly well-armed States, and regulated by excellent laws, never\nreached the same greatness as the Roman Republic; though the latter, to\nall appearance, was more turbulent and disorderly than they, and, so\nfar as laws went, not so perfectly governed. For this we can offer no\nother explanation than that already given. For by augmenting the\nnumbers of her citizens in both the ways named, Rome was soon able to\nplace two hundred and eighty thousand men under arms; while neither\nSparta nor Athens could ever muster more than twenty thousand; and\nthis, not because the situation of these countries was less\nadvantageous than that of Rome, but simply from the difference in the\nmethods they followed.\nFor Lycurgus, the founder of the Spartan Republic, thinking nothing so\nlikely to relax his laws as an admixture of new citizens, did all he\ncould to prevent intercourse with strangers; with which object, besides\nrefusing these the right to marry, the right of citizenship, and all\nsuch other social rights as induce men to become members of a\ncommunity, he ordained that in this republic of his the only money\ncurrent should be of leather, so that none might be tempted to repair\nthither to trade or to carry on any art.\nUnder such circumstances the number of the inhabitants of that State\ncould never much increase. For as all our actions imitate nature, and\nit is neither natural nor possible that a puny stem should carry a\ngreat branch, so a small republic cannot assume control over cities or\ncountries stronger than herself; or, doing so, will resemble the tree\nwhose boughs being greater than its trunk, are supported with\ndifficulty, and snapped by every gust of wind. As it proved with\nSparta. For after she had spread her dominion over all the cities of\nGreece, no sooner did Thebes rebel than all the others rebelled\nlikewise, and the trunk was left stripped of its boughs. But this could\nnot have happened with Rome, whose stem was mighty enough to bear any\nbranch with ease.\nIt was, therefore, by adding to her population, and by, adopting\ncertain other methods presently to be noticed, that Rome became so\ngreat and powerful. And this is well expressed by Titus Livius, in the\nwords, \u201c_Crescit interea Roma Albae ruinis_.\u201d\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014_That Commonwealths have followed three Methods for\nextending their Power_.\nAny one who has read ancient history with attention, must have observed\nthat three methods have been used by republics for extending their\npower. One of these, followed by the old Etruscans, is to form a\nconfederation of many States, wherein none has precedence over the rest\nin authority or rank, and each allows the others to share its\nacquisitions; as do the States of the Swiss League in our days, and as\nthe Achaians and Etolians did in Greece in earlier times. And because\nthe Etruscans were opposed to the Romans in many wars, that I may give\na clearer notion of this method of theirs, I shall enlarge a little in\nmy account of the Etruscan people.\nIn Italy, before the Romans became supreme, the Etruscans were very\npowerful, both by sea and land; and although we have no separate\nhistory of their affairs, we have some slight records left us of them,\nand some indications of their greatness. We know, for instance, that\nthey planted a colony, to which they gave the name of Hadria, on the\ncoast of the upper sea; which colony became so renowned that it lent\nits name to the sea itself, which to this day by the Latins is called\nthe Hadriatic. We know, too, that their arms were obeyed from the Tiber\nto the foot of the mountains which enclose the greater part of the\nItalian peninsula; although, two hundred years before Rome grew to any\ngreat strength, they had lost their supremacy in the province now known\nas Lombardy, of which the French had possessed themselves. For that\npeople, whether driven by necessity, or attracted by the excellence of\nthe fruits, and still more of the wine of Italy, came there under their\nchief, Bellovesus; and after defeating and expelling the inhabitants of\nthe country, settled themselves therein, and there built many cities;\ncalling the district Gallia, after the name they then bore: and this\nterritory they retained until they were subdued by the Romans.\nThese Etruscans, therefore, living with one another on a footing of\ncomplete equality, when they sought to extend their power, followed\nthat first method of which I have just now spoken. Their State was made\nup of twelve cities, among which were Chiusi, Veii, Friuli, Arezzo,\nVolterra, and the like, and their government was conducted in the form\nof a league. They could not, however, extend their conquests beyond\nItaly; while even within the limits of Italy, much territory remained\nunoccupied by them for reasons presently to be noticed.\nThe second method is to provide yourself with allies or companions,\ntaking heed, however, to retain in your own hands the chief command,\nthe seat of government, and the titular supremacy. This was the method\nfollowed by the Romans.\nThe third method is to hold other States in direct subjection to you,\nand not merely associated with you as companions; and this was the plan\npursued by the Spartans and Athenians.\nOf these three methods, the last is wholly useless, as was seen in the\ncase of the two States named, which came to ruin from no other cause\nthan that they had acquired a dominion greater than they could\nmaintain. For to undertake to govern cities by force, especially such\ncities as have been used to live in freedom, is a difficult and arduous\ntask, in which you never can succeed without an army and that a great\none. But to have such an army you must needs have associates who will\nhelp to swell the numbers of your own citizens. And because Athens and\nSparta neglected this precaution, whatever they did was done in vain;\nwhereas Rome, which offers an instance of the second of the methods we\nare considering, by attending to this precaution reached a power that\nhad no limit. And as she alone has lived in this way, so she alone has\nattained to this pitch of power. For joining with herself many States\nthroughout Italy as her companions, who in most respects lived with her\non a footing of equality, while, as has been noted, always reserving to\nherself the seat of empire and the titular command, it came about that\nthese States, without being aware of it, by their own efforts, and with\ntheir own blood, wrought out their own enslavement.\nFor when Rome began to send armies out of Italy, for the purpose of\nreducing foreign kingdoms to provinces, and of subjugating nations who,\nbeing used to live under kings, were not impatient of her yoke, and\nwho, receiving Roman governors, and having been conquered by armies\nbearing the Roman name, recognized no masters save the Romans, those\ncompanions of Rome who dwelt in Italy suddenly found themselves\nsurrounded by Roman subjects, and weighed down by the greatness of the\nRoman power; and when at last they came to perceive the mistake in\nwhich they had been living, it was too late to remedy it, so vast was\nthe authority which Rome had then obtained over foreign countries, and\nso great the resources which she possessed within herself; having by\nthis time grown to be the mightiest and best-armed of States. So that\nalthough these her companions sought to avenge their wrongs by\nconspiring against her, they were soon defeated in the attempt, and\nremained in a worse plight than before, since they too became subjects\nand no longer associates. This method, then, as I have said, was\nfollowed by the Romans alone; but no other plan can be pursued by a\nrepublic which desires to extend its power; experience having shown\nnone other so safe and certain.\nThe method which consists in forming leagues, of which I have spoken\nabove as having been adopted by the Etruscans, the Achaians, and the\nEtolians of old, and in our own days by the Swiss, is the next best\nafter that followed by the Romans, for as in this way there can be no\ngreat extension of power, two advantages result: first, that you do not\nreadily involve yourself in war; and, second, that you can easily\npreserve any little acquisition which you may make. The reason why you\ncannot greatly extend your power is, that as your league is made up of\nseparate States with distinct seats of government, it is difficult for\nthese to consult and resolve in concert. The same causes make these\nStates careless to enlarge their territories; because acquisitions\nwhich have to be shared among many communities are less thought of than\nthose made by a single republic which looks to enjoy them all to\nitself. Again, since leagues govern through general councils, they must\nneeds be slower in resolving than a nation dwelling within one\nfrontier.\nMoreover, we find from experience that this method has certain fixed\nlimits beyond which there is no instance of its ever having passed; by\nwhich I mean that some twelve or fourteen communities may league\nthemselves together, but will never seek to pass beyond that limit: for\nafter associating themselves in such numbers as seem to them to secure\ntheir safety against all besides, they desire no further extension of\ntheir power, partly because no necessity compels them to extend, and\npartly because, for the reasons already given, they would find no\nprofit in extending. For were they to seek extension they would have to\nfollow one of two courses: either continuing to admit new members to\ntheir league, whose number must lead to confusion; or else making\nsubjects, a course which they will avoid since they will see difficulty\nin making them, and no great good in having them. Wherefore, when their\nnumber has so increased that their safety seems secured, they have\nrecourse to two expedients: either receiving other States under their\nprotection and engaging for their defence (in which way they obtain\nmoney from various quarters which they can easily distribute among\nthemselves); or else hiring themselves out as soldiers to foreign\nStates, and drawing pay from this or the other prince who employs them\nto carry out his enterprises; as we see done by the Swiss at the\npresent day, and as we read was done in ancient times by certain of\nthose nations whom we have named above. To which we have a witness in\nTitus Livius, who relates that when Philip of Macedon came to treat\nwith Titus Quintius Flamininus, and while terms were being discussed in\nthe presence of a certain Etolian captain, this man coming to words\nwith Philip, the latter taunted him with greed and bad faith; telling\nhim that the Etolians were not ashamed to draw pay from one side, and\nthen send their men to serve on the other; so that often the banner of\nEtolia might be seen displayed in two hostile camps.\nWe see, therefore, that the method of proceeding by leagues has always\nbeen of the same character, and has led always to the same results. We\nsee, likewise, that the method which proceeds by reducing States to\ndirect subjection has constantly proved a weak one, and produced\ninsignificant gains; and that whenever these gains have passed a\ncertain limit, ruin has ensued. And if the latter of these two methods\nbe of little utility among armed States, among those that are unarmed,\nas is now the case with the republics of Italy, it is worse than\nuseless. We may conclude, therefore, that the true method was that\nfollowed by the Romans; which is the more remarkable as we find none\nwho adopted it before they did, and none who have followed it since. As\nfor leagues, I know of no nations who have had recourse to them in\nrecent times except the Swiss and the Suevians.\nBut to bring my remarks on this head to an end, I affirm that all the\nvarious methods followed by the Romans in conducting their affairs,\nwhether foreign or domestic, so far from being imitated in our day,\nhave been held of no account, some pronouncing them to be mere fables,\nsome thinking them impracticable, others out of place and unprofitable;\nand so, abiding in this ignorance, we rest a prey to all who have\nchosen to invade our country. But should it seem difficult to tread in\nthe footsteps of the Romans, it ought not to appear so hard, especially\nfor us Tuscans, to imitate the Tuscans of antiquity, who if, from the\ncauses already assigned, they failed to establish an empire like that\nof Rome, succeeded in acquiring in Italy that degree of power which\ntheir method of acting allowed, and which they long preserved in\nsecurity, with the greatest renown in arms and government, and the\nhighest reputation for manners and religion. This power and this glory\nof theirs were first impaired by the Gauls, and afterwards extinguished\nby the Romans, and so utterly extinguished, that of the Etruscan\nEmpire, so splendid two thousand years ago, we have at the present day\nbarely a record. This it is which has led me to inquire whence this\noblivion of things arises, a question of which I shall treat in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\u2014_That changes in Sects and Tongues, and the happening of\nFloods and Pestilences, obliterate the Memory of the Past_.\nTo those philosophers who will have it that the world has existed from\nall eternity, it were, I think, a good answer, that if what they say be\ntrue we ought to have record of a longer period than five thousand\nyears; did it not appear that the memory of past times is blotted out\nby a variety of causes, some referable to men, and some to Heaven.\nAmong the causes which have a human origin are the changes in sects and\ntongues; because when a new sect, that is to say a new religion, comes\nup, its first endeavour, in order to give itself reputation, is to\nefface the old; and should it so happen that the founders of the new\nreligion speak another tongue, this may readily be effected. This we\nknow from observing the methods which Christianity has followed in\ndealing with the religion of the Gentiles, for we find that it has\nabolished all the rites and ordinances of that worship, and obliterated\nevery trace of the ancient belief. True, it has not succeeded in\nutterly blotting out our knowledge of things done by the famous men who\nheld that belief; and this because the propagators of the new faith,\nretaining the Latin tongue, were constrained to use it in writing the\nnew law; for could they have written this in a new tongue, we may\ninfer, having regard to their other persecutions, that no record\nwhatever would have survived to us of past events. For any one who\nreads of the methods followed by Saint Gregory and the other heads of\nthe Christian religion, will perceive with what animosity they pursued\nall ancient memorials; burning the works of poets and historians;\nbreaking images; and destroying whatsoever else afforded any trace of\nantiquity. So that if to this persecution a new language had been\njoined, it must soon have been found that everything was forgotten.\nWe may believe, therefore, that what Christianity has sought to effect\nagainst the sect of the Gentiles, was actually effected by that sect\nagainst the religion which preceded theirs; and that, from the repeated\nchanges of belief which have taken place in the course of five or six\nthousand years, the memory of what happened at a remote date has\nperished, or, if any trace of it remain, has come to be regarded as a\nfable to which no credit is due; like the Chronicle of Diodorus\nSiculus, which, professing to give an account of the events of forty or\nfifty thousand years, is held, and I believe justly, a lying tale.\nAs for the causes of oblivion which we may refer to Heaven, they are\nthose which make havoc of the human race, and reduce the population of\ncertain parts of the world to a very small number. This happens by\nplague, famine, or flood, of which three the last is the most hurtful,\nas well because it is the most universal, as because those saved are\ngenerally rude and ignorant mountaineers, who possessing no knowledge\nof antiquity themselves, can impart none to those who come after them.\nOr if among the survivors there chance to be one possessed of such\nknowledge, to give himself consequence and credit, he will conceal and\npervert it to suit his private ends, so that to his posterity there\nwill remain only so much as he may have been pleased to communicate,\nand no more.\nThat these floods, plagues, and famines do in fact happen, I see no\nreason to doubt, both because we find all histories full of them, and\nrecognize their effect in this oblivion of the past, and also because\nit is reasonable that such things should happen. For as when much\nsuperfluous matter has gathered in simple bodies, nature makes repeated\nefforts to remove and purge it away, thereby promoting the health of\nthese bodies, so likewise as regards that composite body the human\nrace, when every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that\nthey can neither subsist where they are nor remove elsewhere, every\nregion being equally crowded and over-peopled, and when human craft and\nwickedness have reached their highest pitch, it must needs come about\nthat the world will purge herself in one or another of these three\nways, to the end that men, becoming few and contrite, may amend their\nlives and live with more convenience.\nEtruria, then, as has been said above, was at one time powerful,\nabounding in piety and valour, practising her own customs, and speaking\nher own tongue; but all this was effaced by the power of Rome, so that,\nas I have observed already, nothing is left of her but the memory of a\nname.\nCHAPTER VI.\u2014_Of the Methods followed by the Romans in making War_.\nHaving treated of the methods followed by the Romans for increasing\ntheir power, we shall now go on to consider those which they used in\nmaking war; and in all they did we shall find how wisely they turned\naside from the common path in order to render their progress to supreme\ngreatness easy.\nWhosoever makes war, whether from policy or ambition, means to acquire\nand to hold what he acquires, and to carry on the war he has undertaken\nin such a manner that it shall enrich and not impoverish his native\ncountry and State. It is necessary, therefore, whether for acquiring or\nholding, to consider how cost may be avoided, and everything done most\nadvantageously for the public welfare. But whoever would effect all\nthis, must take the course and follow the methods of the Romans; which\nconsisted, first of all, in making their wars, as the French say,\n_great and short_. For entering the field with strong armies, they\nbrought to a speedy conclusion whatever wars they had with the Latins,\nthe Samnites, or the Etruscans.\nAnd if we take note of all the wars in which they were engaged, from\nthe foundation of their city down to the siege of Veii, all will be\nseen to have been quickly ended some in twenty, some in ten, and some\nin no more than six days. And this was their wont: So soon as war was\ndeclared they would go forth with their armies to meet the enemy and at\nonce deliver battle. The enemy, on being routed, to save their country\nfrom pillage, very soon came to terms, when the Romans would take from\nthem certain portions of their territory. These they either assigned to\nparticular persons, or made the seat of a colony, which being settled\non the confines of the conquered country served as a defence to the\nRoman frontier, to the advantage both of the colonists who had these\nlands given them, and of the Roman people whose borders were thus\nguarded at no expense to themselves. And no other system of defence\ncould have been at once so safe, so strong, and so effectual. For while\nthe enemy were not actually in the field, this guard was sufficient;\nand when they came out in force to overwhelm the colony, the Romans\nalso went forth in strength and gave them battle; and getting the\nbetter of them, imposed harder terms than before, and so returned home.\nAnd in this way they came gradually to establish their name abroad, and\nto add to their power.\nThese methods they continued to employ until they changed their system\nof warfare, which they did during the siege of Veii; when to enable\nthem to carry on a prolonged war, they passed a law for the payment of\ntheir soldiers, whom, up to that time they had not paid, nor needed to\npay, because till then their wars had been of brief duration.\nNevertheless, while allowing pay to their soldiers that they might thus\nwage longer wars, and keep their armies longer in the field when\nemployed on distant enterprises, they never departed from their old\nplan of bringing their campaigns to as speedy an end as place and\ncircumstances allowed, nor ever ceased to plant colonies.\nTheir custom of terminating their wars with despatch, besides being\nnatural to the Romans, was strengthened by the ambition of their\nconsuls, who, being appointed for twelve months only, six of which they\nhad to spend in the city, were eager to bring their wars to an end as\nrapidly as they could, that they might enjoy the honours of a triumph.\nThe usage of planting colonies was recommended by the great advantage\nand convenience which resulted from it. In dealing with the spoils of\nwarfare their practice, no doubt, in a measure changed, so that in this\nrespect they were not afterwards so liberal as they were at first;\npartly, because liberality did not seem so necessary when their\nsoldiers were in receipt of pay; and, partly, because the spoils\nthemselves being greater than before, they thought by their help so to\nenrich the public treasury as to be able to carry on their wars without\ntaxing the city; and, in fact, by pursuing this course the public\nrevenues were soon greatly augmented. The methods thus followed by the\nRomans in dividing plunder and in planting colonies had, accordingly,\nthis result, that whereas other less prudent princes and republics are\nimpoverished by war, Rome was enriched by it; nay, so far was the\nsystem carried, that no consul could hope for a triumph unless he\nbrought back with him for the public treasury much gold and silver and\nspoils of every kind.\nBy methods such as these, at one time bringing their wars to a rapid\nconclusion by invasion and actual defeat, at another wearing out an\nenemy by protracted hostilities, and again by concluding peace on\nadvantageous terms, the Romans continually grew richer and more\npowerful.\nCHAPTER VII.\u2014_Of the Quantity of Land assigned by the Romans to each\nColonist_.\nIt would, I think, be difficult to fix with certainty how much land the\nRomans allotted to each colonist, for my belief is that they gave more\nor less according to the character of the country to which they sent\nthem. We may, however, be sure that in every instance, and to whatever\ncountry they were sent, the quantity of land assigned was not very\nlarge: first, because, these colonists being sent to guard the newly\nacquired country, by giving little land it became possible to send more\nmen; and second because, as the Romans lived frugally at home, it is\nunreasonable to suppose that they should wish their countrymen to be\ntoo well off abroad. And Titus Livius tells us that on the capture of\nVeii, the Romans sent thither a colony, allotting to each colonist\nthree jugera and seven unciae of land, which, according to our\nmeasurement would be something under two acres.\nBesides the above reasons, the Romans may likely enough have thought\nthat it was not so much the quantity of the land allotted as its\ncareful cultivation that would make it suffice. It is very necessary,\nhowever, that every colony should have common pasturage where all may\nsend their cattle to graze, as well as woods where they may cut fuel;\nfor without such conveniences no colony can maintain itself.\nCHAPTER VIII.\u2014_Why certain Nations leave their ancestral Seats and\noverflow the Countries of others_.\nHaving spoken above of the methods followed by the Romans in making\nwar, and related how the Etruscans were attacked by the Gauls, it seems\nto me not foreign to these topics to explain that of wars there are two\nkinds. One kind of war has its origin in the ambition of princes or\nrepublics who seek to extend their dominions. Such were the wars waged\nby Alexander the Great, and by the Romans, and such are those which we\nsee every day carried on by one potentate against another. Wars of this\nsort have their dangers, but do not utterly extirpate the inhabitants\nof a country; what the conqueror seeks being merely the submission of\nthe conquered people, whom, generally speaking, he suffers to retain\ntheir laws, and always their houses and goods.\nThe other species of war is when an entire people, with all the\nfamilies of which it is made up, being driven out by famine or defeat,\nremoves from its former seat, and goes in search of a new abode and a\nnew country, not simply with the view to establish dominion over it,\nbut to possess it as its own, and to expel or exterminate the former\ninhabitants. Of this most terrible and cruel species of warfare Sallust\nspeaks at the end of his history of the war with Jugurtha, where in\nmentioning that after the defeat of Jugurtha the movement of the Gauls\ninto Italy began to be noticed, he observes that \u201c_in the wars of the\nRomans with other nations the struggle was for mastery; but that always\nin their wars with the Gauls the struggle on both sides was for life_.\u201d\nFor a prince or commonwealth, when attacking another State, will be\ncontent to rid themselves of those only who are at the head of affairs;\nbut an entire people, set in motion in the manner described, must\ndestroy all who oppose them, since their object is to subsist on that\nwhereon those whom they invade have hitherto subsisted.\nThe Romans had to pass through three of these desperate wars; the first\nbeing that in which their city was actually captured by those Gauls\nwho, as already mentioned, had previously taken Lombardy from the\nEtruscans and made it their seat, and for whose invasion Titus Livius\nhas assigned two causes. First, that they were attracted, as I have\nsaid before, by the fruitful soil and by the wine of Italy which they\nhad not in Gaul; second, that their population having multiplied so\ngreatly that they could no longer find wherewithal to live on at home,\nthe princes of their land decided that certain of their number should\ngo forth to seek a new abode; and so deciding, chose as leaders of\nthose who were to go, two Gaulish chiefs, Bellovesus and Siccovesus;\nthe former of whom came into Italy while the latter passed into Spain.\nFrom the immigration under Bellovesus resulted the occupation of\nLombardy, and, subsequently, the first war of the Gauls with Rome. At a\nlater date, and after the close of the first war with Carthage, came\nthe second Gallic invasion, when more than two hundred thousand Gauls\nperished in battle between Piombino and Pisa. The third of these wars\nbroke out on the descent into Italy of the Todi and Cimbri, who, after\ndefeating several Roman armies, were themselves defeated by Marius.\nIn these three most dangerous contests the arms of Rome prevailed; but\nno ordinary valour was needed for their success. For we see afterwards,\nwhen the spirit of the Romans had declined, and their armies had lost\ntheir former excellence, their supremacy was overthrown by men of the\nsame race, that is to say by the Goths, the Vandals, and others like\nthem, who spread themselves over the whole of the Western Empire.\nNations such as these, quit, as I have said, their native land, when\nforced by famine, or by defeat in domestic wars, to seek a new\nhabitation elsewhere. When those thus driven forth are in large\nnumbers, they violently invade the territories of other nations,\nslaughtering the inhabitants, seizing on their possessions, founding\nnew kingdoms, and giving new names to provinces; as was done by Moses,\nand by those tribes who overran the Roman Empire. For the new names\nwhich we find in Italy and elsewhere, have no other origin than in\ntheir having been given by these new occupants; as when the countries\nformerly known as Gallia Cisalpina and Gallia Transalpina took the\nnames of Lombardy and France, from the Lombards and the Franks who\nsettled themselves there. In the same way Sclavonia was formerly known\nas Illyria, Hungary as Pannonia, and England as Britain; while many\nother provinces which it would be tedious to enumerate, have similarly\nchanged their designations; as when the name Jud\u00e6a was given by Moses\nto that part of Syria of which he took possession.\nAnd since I have said above that nations such as those I have been\ndescribing, are often driven by wars from their ancestral homes, and\nforced to seek a new country elsewhere, I shall cite the instance of\nthe Maurusians, a people who anciently dwelt in Syria, but hearing of\nthe inroad of the Hebrews, and thinking themselves unable to resist\nthem, chose rather to seek safety in flight than to perish with their\ncountry in a vain effort to defend it. For which reason, removing with\ntheir families, they went to Africa, where, after driving out the\nnative inhabitants, they took up their abode; and although they could\nnot defend their own country, were able to possess themselves of a\ncountry belonging to others. And Procopius, who writes the history of\nthe war which Belisarius conducted against those Vandals who seized on\nAfrica, relates, that on certain pillars standing in places where the\nMaurusians once dwelt, he had read inscriptions in these words: \u201c_We\nMaurusians who fled before Joshua, the robber, the son of Nun_;\u201d[7]\ngiving us to know the cause of their quitting Syria. Be this as it may,\nnations thus driven forth by a supreme necessity, are, if they be in\ngreat number, in the highest degree dangerous, and cannot be\nsuccessfully withstood except by a people who excel in arms.\n[7] Nos Maurusii qui fugimus a facie Jesu latronis filii Nav\u00e6.\n_Procop. Hist. Bell. Vand. II._\nWhen those constrained to abandon their homes are not in large numbers,\nthey are not so dangerous as the nations of whom I have been speaking,\nsince they cannot use the same violence, but must trust to their\naddress to procure them a habitation; and, after procuring it, must\nlive with their neighbours as friends and companions, as we find \u00c6neas,\nDido, the Massilians, and others like them to have lived; all of whom\ncontrived to maintain themselves in the districts in which they\nsettled, by securing the good will of the neighbouring nations.\nAlmost all the great emigrations of nations have been and continue to\nbe from the cold and barren region of Scythia, because from the\npopulation there being excessive, and the soil ill able to support\nthem, they are forced to quit their home, many causes operating to\ndrive them forth and none to keep them back. And if, for the last five\nhundred years, it has not happened that any of these nations has\nactually overrun another country, there are various reasons to account\nfor it. First, the great clearance which that region made of its\ninhabitants during the decline of the Roman Empire, when more than\nthirty nations issued from it in succession; and next, the circumstance\nthat the countries of Germany and Hungary, whence also these nations\ncame, are now so much improved that men can live there in comfort, and\nconsequently are not constrained to shift their habitations. Besides\nwhich, since these countries are occupied by a very warlike race, they\nserve as a sort of bulwark to keep back the neighbouring Scythians, who\nfor this reason do not venture to attack them, nor attempt to force a\npassage. Nevertheless, movements on a great scale have oftentimes been\nbegun by the Tartars, and been at once withstood by the Hungarians and\nPoles, whose frequent boast it is, that but for them, Italy and the\nChurch would more than once have felt the weight of the Tartar arms.\nOf the nations of whom I have been speaking, I shall now say no more.\nCHAPTER IX.\u2014_Of the Causes which commonly give rise to Wars between\nStates_.\nThe occasion which led to war between the Romans and Samnites, who for\nlong had been in league with one another, is of common occurrence in\nall powerful States, being either brought about by accident, or else\npurposely contrived by some one who would set war a-foot. As between\nthe Romans and the Samnites, the occasion of war was accidental. For in\nmaking war upon the Sidicinians and afterwards on the Campanians, the\nSamnites had no thought of involving themselves with the Romans. But\nthe Campanians being overpowered, and, contrary to the expectation of\nRomans and Samnites alike, resorting to Rome for aid, the Romans, on\nwhose protection they threw themselves, were forced to succour them as\ndependants, and to accept a war which, it seemed to them, they could\nnot with honour decline. For though they might have thought it\nunreasonable to be called on to defend the Campanians as friends\nagainst their own friends the Samnites, it seemed to them shameful not\nto defend them as subjects, or as a people who had placed themselves\nunder their protection. For they reasoned that to decline their defence\nwould close the gate against all others who at any future time might\ndesire to submit themselves to their power. And, accordingly, since\nglory and empire, and not peace, were the ends which they always had in\nview, it became impossible for them to refuse this protectorship.\nA similar circumstance gave rise to the first war with the\nCarthaginians, namely the protectorate assumed by the Romans of the\ncitizens of Messina in Sicily, and this likewise came about by chance.\nBut the second war with Carthage was not the result of chance. For\nHannibal the Carthaginian general attacked the Saguntans, who were the\nfriends of Rome in Spain, not from any desire to injure them, but in\norder to set the arms of Rome in motion, and so gain an opportunity of\nengaging the Romans in a war, and passing on into Italy. This method of\npicking a quarrel is constantly resorted to by powerful States when\nthey are bound by scruples of honour or like considerations. For if I\ndesire to make war on a prince with whom I am under an ancient and\nbinding treaty, I shall find some colour or pretext for attacking the\nfriend of that prince, very well knowing that when I attack his friend,\neither the prince will resent it, when my scheme for engaging him in\nwar will be realized; or that, should he not resent it, his weakness or\nbaseness in not defending one who is under his protection will be made\napparent; either of which alternatives will discredit him, and further\nmy designs.\nWe are to note, therefore, in connection with this submission of the\nCampanians, what has just now been said as to provoking another power\nto war; and also the remedy open to a State which, being unequal to its\nown defence, is prepared to go all lengths to ruin its assailant,\u2014that\nremedy being to give itself up unreservedly to some one whom it selects\nfor its defender; as the Campanians gave themselves up to the Romans,\nand as the Florentines gave themselves up to King Robert of Naples,\nwho, after refusing to defend them as his friends against Castruccio of\nLucca by whom they were hard pressed, defended them as his subjects.\nCHAPTER X.\u2014_That contrary to the vulgar opinion, Money is not the\nSinews of War_.\nSince any man may begin a war at his pleasure, but cannot at his\npleasure bring it to a close, a prince before he engages in any warlike\nenterprise ought to measure his strength and govern himself\naccordingly. But he must be prudent enough not to deceive himself as to\nhis strength, which he will always do, if he measure it by money, by\nadvantage of position, or by the good-will of his subjects, while he is\nunprovided with an army of his own. These are things which may swell\nyour strength but do not constitute it, being in themselves null and of\nno avail without an army on which you can depend.\nWithout such an army no amount of money will meet your wants, the\nnatural strength of your country will not protect you, and the fidelity\nand attachment of your subjects will not endure, since it is impossible\nthat they should continue true to you when you cannot defend them.\nLakes, and mountains, and the most inaccessible strongholds, where\nvaliant defenders are wanting, become no better than the level plain;\nand money, so far from being a safeguard, is more likely to leave you a\nprey to your enemy; since nothing can be falser than the vulgar opinion\nwhich affirms it to be the sinews of war.\nThis opinion is put forward by Quintus Curtius, where, in speaking of\nthe war between Antipater the Macedonian and the King of Sparta, he\nrelates that the latter, from want of money, was constrained to give\nbattle and was defeated; whereas, could he have put off fighting for a\nfew days the news of Alexander\u2019s death would have reached Greece, and\nhe might have had a victory without a battle. But lacking money, and\nfearing that on that account his soldiers might desert him, he was\nforced to hazard an engagement. It was for this reason that Quintus\nCurtius declared money to be the sinews of war, a maxim every day cited\nand acted upon by princes less wise than they should be. For building\nupon this, they think it enough for their defence to have laid up great\ntreasures; not reflecting that were great treasures all that is needed\nfor victory, Darius of old had conquered Alexander, the Greeks the\nRomans, and in our own times Charles of Burgundy the Swiss; while the\npope and the Florentines together would have had little difficulty in\ndefeating Francesco Maria, nephew of Pope Julius II., in the recent war\nof Urbino; and yet, in every one of these instances, the victory\nremained with him who held the sinews of war to consist, not in money,\nbut in good soldiers.\nCroesus, king of Lydia, after showing Solon the Athenian much besides,\nat last displayed to him the boundless riches of his treasure-house,\nand asked him what he thought of his power. Whereupon Solon answered\nthat he thought him no whit more powerful in respect of these\ntreasures, for as war is made with iron and not with gold, another\ncoming with more iron might carry off his gold. After the death of\nAlexander the Great a tribe of Gauls, passing through Greece on their\nway into Asia, sent envoys to the King of Macedonia to treat for terms\nof accord; when the king, to dismay them by a display of his resources,\nshowed them great store of gold and silver. But these barbarians, when\nthey saw all this wealth, in their greed to possess it, though before\nthey had looked on peace as settled, broke off negotiations; and thus\nthe king was ruined by those very treasures he had amassed for his\ndefence. In like manner, not many years ago, the Venetians, with a full\ntreasury, lost their whole dominions without deriving the least\nadvantage from their wealth.\nI maintain, therefore, that it is not gold, as is vulgarly supposed,\nthat is the sinews of war, but good soldiers; or while gold by itself\nwill not gain you good soldiers, good soldiers may readily get you\ngold. Had the Romans chosen to make war with gold rather than with iron\nall the treasures of the earth would not have sufficed them having\nregard to the greatness of their enterprises and the difficulties they\nhad to overcome in carrying them out. But making their wars with iron\nthey never felt any want of gold; for those who stood in fear of them\nbrought gold into their camp.\nAnd supposing it true that the Spartan king was forced by lack of money\nto risk the chances of a battle, it only fared with him in respect of\nmoney as it has often fared with others from other causes; since we see\nthat where an army is in such straits for want of victual that it must\neither fight or perish by famine, it will always fight, as being the\nmore honourable course and that on which fortune may in some way smile.\nSo, too, it has often happened that a captain, seeing his enemy about\nto be reinforced, has been obliged either to trust to fortune and at\nonce deliver battle, or else, waiting till the reinforcement is\ncomplete, to fight then, whether he will or no, and at whatever\ndisadvantage. We find also, as in the case of Hasdrubal when beset, in\nthe March of Ancona, at once by Claudius Nero and by the other Roman\nconsul, that a captain, when he must either fight or fly, will always\nfight, since it will seem to him that by this course, however\nhazardous, he has at least a chance of victory, while by the other his\nruin is certain.\nThere are many circumstances, therefore, which may force a captain to\ngive battle contrary to his intention, among which the want of money\nmay sometimes be one. But this is no ground for pronouncing money to be\nthe sinews of war, any more than those other things from the want of\nwhich men are reduced to the same necessity. Once more, therefore, I\nrepeat that not gold but good soldiers constitute the sinews of war.\nMoney, indeed, is most necessary in a secondary place; but this\nnecessity good soldiers will always be able to supply, since it is as\nimpossible that good soldiers should lack money, as that money by\nitself should secure good soldiers. And that what I say is true is\nshown by countless passages in history. When Pericles persuaded the\nAthenians to declare war against the whole Peloponnesus, assuring them\nthat their dexterity, aided by their wealth, was sure to bring them off\nvictorious, the Athenians, though for a while they prospered in this\nwar, in the end were overpowered, the prudent counsels and good\nsoldiers of Sparta proving more than a match for the dexterity and\nwealth of Athens. But, indeed, there can be no better witness to the\ntruth of my contention than Titus Livius himself. For in that passage\nof his history wherein he discusses whether if Alexander the Great had\ninvaded Italy, he would have succeeded in vanquishing the Romans, three\nthings are noted by him as essential to success in war; to wit, many\nand good soldiers, prudent captains, and favourable fortune; and after\nexamining whether the Romans or Alexander would have had the advantage\nin each of these three particulars, he arrives at his conclusion\nwithout any mention of money.\nThe Campanians, therefore, when asked by the Sidicinians to arm in\ntheir behalf, must have measured their strength by wealth and not by\nsoldiers; for after declaring in their favour and suffering two\ndefeats, to save themselves they were obliged to become tributary to\nRome.\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014_That it were unwise to ally yourself a Prince who has\nReputation rather than Strength._\nTo mark the mistake made by the Sidicinians in trusting to the\nprotection of the Campanians, and by the Campanians in supposing\nthemselves able to protect the Sidicinians, Titus Livius could not have\nexpressed himself in apter words than by saying, that \u201c_the Campanians\nrather lent their name to the Sidicinians than furnished any\nsubstantial aid towards their defence._\u201d\nHere we have to note that alliances with princes who from dwelling at a\ndistance have no facility, or who from their own embarrassments, or\nfrom other causes, have no ability to render aid, afford rather\nreputation than protection to those who put their trust in them. As was\nthe case in our own times with the Florentines, when, in the year 1479,\nthey were attacked by the Pope and the King of Naples. For being\nfriends of the French king they drew from that friendship more\nreputation than help. The same would be the case with that prince who\nshould engage in any enterprise in reliance on the Emperor Maximilian,\nhis being one of those friendships which, in the words of our\nhistorian, _nomen magis quam praesidium adferunt_.\nOn this occasion, therefore, the Campanians were misled by imagining\nthemselves stronger than they really were. For often, from defect of\njudgment, men take upon them to defend others, when they have neither\nskill nor ability to defend themselves. Of which we have a further\ninstance in the Tarentines, who, when the Roman and Samnite armies were\nalready drawn up against one another for battle, sent messengers to the\nRoman consul to acquaint him that they desired peace between the two\nnations, and would themselves declare war against whichsoever of the\ntwo first began hostilities. The consul, laughing at their threats, in\nthe presence of the messengers, ordered the signal for battle to sound,\nand bade his army advance to meet the enemy; showing the Tarentines by\nacts rather than words what answer he thought their message deserved.\nHaving spoken in the present Chapter of unwise courses followed by\nprinces for defending others, I shall speak in the next, of the methods\nthey follow in defending themselves.\nCHAPTER XII.\u2014_Whether when Invasion is imminent it is better to\nanticipate or to await it._\nI have often heard it disputed by men well versed in military affairs,\nwhether, when there are two princes of nearly equal strength, and the\nbolder of the two proclaims war upon the other, it is better for that\nother to await attack within his own frontier, or to march into the\nenemy\u2019s country and fight him there; and I have heard reasons given in\nfavour of each of these courses.\nThey who maintain that an enemy should be attacked in his own country,\ncite the advice given by Croesus to Cyrus, when the latter had come to\nthe frontiers of the Massaget\u00e6 to make war on that people. For word\nbeing sent by Tomyris their queen that Cyrus might, at his pleasure,\neither enter her dominions, where she would await him, or else allow\nher to come and meet him; and the matter being debated, Croesus,\ncontrary to the opinion of other advisers, counselled Cyrus to go\nforward and meet the queen, urging that were he to defeat her at a\ndistance from her kingdom, he might not be able to take it from her,\nsince she would have time to repair her strength; whereas, were he to\ndefeat her within her own dominions, he could follow her up on her\nflight, and, without giving her time to recover herself, deprive her of\nher State. They cite also the advice given by Hannibal to Antiochus,\nwhen the latter was meditating a war on the Romans. For Hannibal told\nhim that the Romans could not be vanquished except in Italy, where an\ninvader might turn to account the arms and resources of their friends,\nwhereas any one making war upon them out of Italy, and leaving that\ncountry in their hands, would leave them an unfailing source whence to\ndraw whatever reinforcement they might need; and finally, he told him,\nthat the Romans might more easily be deprived of Rome than of their\nempire, and of Italy more easily than of any of their other provinces.\nThey likewise instance Agathocles, who, being unequal to support a war\nat home, invaded the Carthaginians, by whom he was being attacked, and\nreduced them to sue for peace. They also cite Scipio, who to shift the\nwar from Italy, carried it into Africa.\nThose who hold a contrary opinion contend that to have your enemy at a\ndisadvantage you must get him away from his home, alleging the case of\nthe Athenians, who while they carried on the war at their convenience\nin their own territory, retained their superiority; but when they\nquitted that territory, and went with their armies to Sicily, lost\ntheir freedom. They cite also the fable of the poets wherein it is\nfigured that Ant\u00e6us, king of Libya, being assailed by the Egyptian\nHercules, could not be overcome while he awaited his adversary within\nthe bounds of his own kingdom; but so soon as he was withdrawn from\nthese by the craft of Hercules, lost his kingdom and his life. Whence\nthe fable runs that Ant\u00e6us, being son to the goddess Earth, when thrown\nto the ground drew fresh strength from the Earth, his mother; and that\nHercules, perceiving this, held him up away from the Earth.\nRecent opinions are likewise cited as favouring this view. Every one\nknows how Ferrando, king of Naples, was in his day accounted a most\nwise prince; and how two years before his death there came a rumour\nthat Charles VIII of France was meditating an attack upon him; and how,\nafter making great preparations for his defence, he sickened; and being\non the point of death, among other counsels left his son Alfonso this\nadvice, that nothing in the world should tempt him to pass out of his\nown territory, but to await the enemy within his frontier, and with his\nforces unimpaired; a warning disregarded by Alfonso, who sent into\nRomagna an army, which he lost, and with it his whole dominions,\nwithout a battle.\nOther arguments on both sides of the question in addition to those\nalready noticed, are as follows: He who attacks shows higher courage\nthan he who stands on his defence, and this gives his army greater\nconfidence. Moreover, by attacking your enemy you deprive him of many\nopportunities for using his resources, since he can receive no aid from\nsubjects who have been stripped of their possessions; and when an enemy\nis at his gates, a prince must be careful how he levies money and\nimposes taxes; so that, as Hannibal said, the springs which enable a\ncountry to support a war come to be dried up. Again, the soldiers of an\ninvader, finding themselves in a foreign land, are under a stronger\nnecessity to fight, and necessity, as has often been said, is the\nparent of valour.\nOn the other hand, it may be argued that there are many advantages to\nbe gained by awaiting the attack of your enemy. For without putting\nyourself much about, you may harass him by intercepting his supplies,\nwhether of victual or of whatsoever else an army stands in need: from\nyour better knowledge of the country you can impede his movements; and\nbecause men muster more willingly to defend their homes than to go on\ndistant expeditions, you can meet him with more numerous forces, if\ndefeated you can more easily repair your strength, because the bulk of\nyour army, finding shelter at hand, will be able to save itself, and\nyour reserves will have no distance to come. In this way you can use\nyour whole strength without risking your entire fortunes; whereas, in\nleaving your country, you risk your entire fortunes, without putting\nforth your whole strength. Nay, we find that to weaken an adversary\nstill further, some have suffered him to make a march of several days\ninto their country, and then to capture certain of their towns, that by\nleaving garrisons in these, he might reduce the numbers of his army,\nand so be attacked at greater disadvantage.\nBut now to speak my own mind on the matter, I think we should make this\ndistinction. Either you have your country strongly defended, as the\nRomans had and the Swiss have theirs, or, like the Carthaginians of old\nand the King of France and the Italians at the present day, you have it\nundefended. In the latter case you must keep the enemy at a distance\nfrom your country, for as your strength lies not in men but in money,\nwhenever the supply of money is cut off you are undone, and nothing so\nsoon cuts off this supply as a war of invasion. Of which we have\nexample in the Carthaginians, who, while their country was free from\ninvasion, were able by means of their great revenues to carry on war in\nItaly against the Romans, but when they were invaded could not defend\nthemselves even against Agathocles. The Florentines, in like manner,\ncould make no head against Castruccio, lord of Lucca, when he attacked\nthem in their own country; and to obtain protection, were compelled to\nyield themselves up to King Robert of Naples. And yet, after\nCastruccio\u2019s death, these same Florentines were bold enough to attack\nthe Duke of Milan in his own country, and strong enough to strip him of\nhis dominions. Such valour did they display in distant wars, such\nweakness in those that were near.\nBut when a country is armed as Rome was and Switzerland now is, the\ncloser you press it, the harder it is to subdue; because such States\ncan assemble a stronger force to resist attack than for attacking\nothers. Nor does the great authority of Hannibal move me in this\ninstance, since resentment and his own advantage might lead him to\nspeak as he spoke to Antiochus. For had the Romans suffered in Gaul,\nand within the same space of time, those three defeats at the hands of\nHannibal which they suffered in Italy, it must have made an end of\nthem; since they could not have turned the remnants of their armies to\naccount as they did in Italy, not having the same opportunity for\nrepairing their strength; nor could they have met their enemy with such\nnumerous armies. For we never find them sending forth a force of more\nthan fifty thousand men for the invasion of any province; whereas, in\ndefending their own country against the inroad of the Gauls at the end\nof the first Carthaginian war, we hear of them bringing some eighteen\nhundred thousand men into the field; and their failure to vanquish the\nGauls in Lombardy as they had vanquished those in Tuscany arose from\ntheir inability to lead a great force so far against a numerous enemy,\nor to encounter him with the same advantages. In Germany the Cimbrians\nrouted a Roman army who had there no means to repair their disaster;\nbut when they came into Italy, the Romans could collect their whole\nstrength, and destroy them. Out of their native country, whence they\ncan bring no more than thirty or forty thousand men, the Swiss may\nreadily be defeated; but in their own country, where they can assemble\na hundred thousand, they are well-nigh invincible.\nIn conclusion, therefore, I repeat that the prince who has his people\narmed and trained for war, should always await a great and dangerous\nwar at home, and never go forth to meet it. But that he whose subjects\nare unarmed, and whose country is not habituated to war, should always\ncarry the war to as great a distance as he can from home. For in this\nway each will defend himself in the best manner his means admit.\nCHAPTER XIII.\u2014_That Men rise from humble to high Fortunes rather by\nFraud than by Force._\nI hold it as most certain that men seldom if ever rise to great place\nfrom small beginnings without using fraud or force, unless, indeed,\nthey be given, or take by inheritance the place to which some other has\nalready come. Force, however, will never suffice by itself to effect\nthis end, while fraud often will, as any one may plainly see who reads\nthe lives of Philip of Macedon, Agathocles of Sicily, and many others\nlike them, who from the lowest or, at any rate, from very low\nbeginnings, rose either to sovereignty or to the highest command.\nThis necessity for using deceit is taught by Xenophon in his life of\nCyrus; for the very first expedition on which Cyrus is sent, against\nthe King of Armenia, is seen to teem with fraud; and it is by fraud,\nand not by force, that he is represented as having acquired his\nkingdom; so that the only inference to be drawn from his conduct, as\nXenophon describes it, is, that the prince who would accomplish great\nthings must have learned how to deceive. Xenophon, moreover, represents\nhis hero as deceiving his maternal grandsire Cyaxares, king of the\nMedians, in a variety of ways; giving it to be understood that without\nsuch deceit he could not have reached the greatness to which he came.\nNor do I believe that any man born to humble fortunes can be shown to\nhave attained great station, by sheer and open force, whereas this has\noften been effected by mere fraud, such as that used by Giovanni\nGaleazzo to deprive his uncle Bernabo of the State and government of\nLombardy.\nThe same arts which princes are constrained to use at the outset of\ntheir career, must also be used by commonwealths, until they have grown\npowerful enough to dispense with them and trust to strength alone. And\nbecause Rome at all times, whether from chance or choice, followed all\nsuch methods as are necessary to attain greatness, in this also she was\nnot behindhand. And, to begin with, she could have used no greater\nfraud than was involved in her method above noticed, of making for\nherself companions; since under this name she made for herself\nsubjects, for such the Latins and the other surrounding nations, in\nfact, became. For availing herself at first of their arms to subdue\nneighbouring countries and gain herself reputation as a State, her\npower was so much increased by these conquests that there was none whom\nshe could not overcome. But the Latins never knew that they were\nenslaved until they saw the Samnites twice routed and forced to make\nterms. This success, while it added greatly to the fame of the Romans\namong princes at a distance, who were thereby made familiar with the\nRoman name though not with the Roman arms, bred at the same time\njealousy and distrust among those who, like the Latins, both saw and\nfelt these arms; and such were the effects of this jealousy and\ndistrust, that not the Latins only but all the Roman colonies in\nLatium, along with the Campanians whom a little while before the Romans\nhad defended leagued themselves together against the authority of Rome.\nThis war was set on foot by the Latins in the manner in which, as I\nhave already explained, most wars are begun, not by directly attacking\nthe Romans, but by defending the Sidicinians against the Samnites who\nwere making war upon them with the permission of the Romans. And that\nit was from their having found out the crafty policy of the Romans that\nthe Latins were led to take this step, is plain from the words which\nTitus Livius puts in the mouth of Annius Setinus the Latin pr\u00e6tor, who,\nin addressing the Latin council, is made to say, \u201c_For if even now we\ncan put up with slavery under the disguise of an equal alliance, etc_\u201d\nWe see, therefore, that the Romans, from the time they first began to\nextend their power, were not unfamiliar with the art of deceiving, an\nart always necessary for those who would mount to great heights from\nlow beginnings; and which is the less to be condemned when, as in the\ncase of the Romans, it is skilfully concealed.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014_That Men often err in thinking they can subdue Pride by\nHumility._\nYou shall often find that humility is not merely of no service to you,\nbut is even hurtful, especially when used in dealing with insolent men,\nwho, through envy or other like cause, have conceived hatred against\nyou. Proof whereof is supplied by our historian where he explains the\ncauses of this war between the Romans and the Latins. For on the\nSamnites complaining to the Romans that the Latins had attacked them,\nthe Romans, desiring not to give the Latins ground of offence, would\nnot forbid them proceeding with the war. But the endeavour to avoid\ngiving offence to the Latins only served to increase their confidence,\nand led them the sooner to declare their hostility. Of which we have\nevidence in the language used by the same Latin Pr\u00e6tor, Annius Setinus,\nat the aforesaid council, when he said:\u2014\u201c_You have tried their patience\nby refusing them, soldiers. Who doubts but that they are offended?\nStill they have put up with the affront. They have heard that we are\nassembling an army against their allies the Samnites; and yet they have\nnot stirred from their city. Whence this astonishing forbearance, but\nfrom their knowing our strength and their own weakness_?\u201d Which words\ngive us clearly to understand how much the patience of the Romans\nincreased the arrogance of the Latins.\nA prince, therefore, should never stoop from his dignity, nor should he\nif he would have credit for any concession make it voluntarily, unless\nhe be able or believe himself able to withhold it. For almost always\nwhen matters have come to such a pass that you cannot give way with\ncredit it is better that a thing be taken from you by force than\nyielded through fear of force. For if you yield through fear and to\nescape war, the chances are that you do not escape it; since he to\nwhom, out of manifest cowardice you make this concession, will not rest\ncontent, but will endeavour to wring further concessions from you, and\nmaking less account of you, will only be the more kindled against you.\nAt the same time you will find your friends less zealous on your\nbehalf, since to them you will appear either weak or cowardly. But if,\nso soon as the designs of your enemy are disclosed, you at once prepare\nto resist though your strength be inferior to his, he will begin to\nthink more of you, other neighbouring princes will think more; and many\nwill be willing to assist you, on seeing you take up arms, who, had you\nrelinquished hope and abandoned yourself to despair, would never have\nstirred a finger to save you.\nThe above is to be understood as applying where you have a single\nadversary only; but should you have several, it will always be a\nprudent course, even after war has been declared, to restore to some\none of their number something you have of his, so as to regain his\nfriendship and detach him from the others who have leagued themselves\nagainst you.\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014That weak States are always dubious in their Resolves; and\nthat tardy Resolves are always hurtful.\nTouching this very matter, and with regard to these earliest beginnings\nof war between the Latins and the Romans, it may be noted, that in all\nour deliberations it behoves us to come quickly to a definite resolve,\nand not to remain always in dubiety and suspense. This is plainly seen\nin connection with the council convened by the Latins when they thought\nto separate themselves from the Romans. For the Romans suspecting the\nhostile humour wherewith the Latins were infected, in order to learn\nhow things really stood, and see whether they could not win back the\nmalcontents without recourse to arms, gave them to know that they must\nsend eight of their citizens to Rome, as they had occasion to consult\nwith them. On receiving which message the Latins, knowing that they had\ndone many things contrary to the wishes of the Romans, called a council\nto determine who of their number should be sent, and to instruct them\nwhat they were to say. But Annius, their pr\u00e6tor, being present in the\ncouncil when these matters were being discussed, told them \u201c_that he\nthought it of far greater moment for them to consider what they were to\ndo than what they were to say; for when their resolves were formed, it\nwould be easy to clothe them in fit words_.\u201d This, in truth, was sound\nadvice and such as every prince and republic should lay to heart.\nBecause, where there is doubt and uncertainty as to what we may decide\non doing, we know not how to suit our words to our conduct; whereas,\nwith our minds made up, and the course we are to follow fixed, it is an\neasy matter to find words to declare our resolves. I have noticed this\npoint the more readily, because I have often found such uncertainty\nhinder the public business of our own republic, to its detriment and\ndiscredit. And in all matters of difficulty, wherein courage is needed\nfor resolving, this uncertainty will always be met with, whenever those\nwho have to deliberate and decide are weak.\nNot less mischievous than doubtful resolves are those which are late\nand tardy, especially when they have to be made in behalf of a friend.\nFor from their lateness they help none, and hurt ourselves. Tardy\nresolves are due to want of spirit or want of strength, or to the\nperversity of those who have to determine, who being moved by a secret\ndesire to overthrow the government, or to carry out some selfish\npurpose of their own, suffer no decision to be come to, but only thwart\nand hinder. Whereas, good citizens, even when they see the popular mind\nto be bent on dangerous courses, will never oppose the adoption of a\nfixed plan, more particularly in matters which do not brook delay.\nAfter Hieronymus, the Syracusan tyrant, was put to death, there being\nat that time a great war between the Romans and the Carthaginians, the\ncitizens of Syracuse fell to disputing among themselves with which\nnation they should take part; and so fierce grew the controversy\nbetween the partisans of the two alliances, that no course could be\nagreed on, and they took part with neither; until Apollonides, one of\nthe foremost of the Syracusan citizens, told them in a speech replete\nwith wisdom, that neither those who inclined to hold by the Romans, nor\nthose who chose rather to side with the Carthaginians, were deserving\nof blame; but that what was utterly to be condemned was doubt and delay\nin taking one side or other; for from such uncertainty he clearly\nforesaw the ruin of their republic; whereas, by taking a decided\ncourse, whatever it might be, some good might come. Now Titus Livius\ncould not show more clearly than he does in this passage, the mischief\nwhich results from resting in suspense. He shows it, likewise, in the\ncase of the Lavinians, of whom he relates, that being urged by the\nLatins to aid them against Rome, they were so long in making up their\nminds, that when the army which they at last sent to succour the Latins\nwas issuing from their gates, word came that the Latins were defeated.\nWhereupon Millionius, their pr\u00e6tor, said, \u201c_With the Romans this short\nmarch will cost us dear_.\u201d But had the Lavinians resolved at once\neither to grant aid or to refuse it, taking a latter course they would\nnot have given offence to the Romans, taking the former, and rendering\ntimely help, they and the Latins together might have had a victory. But\nby delay they stood to lose in every way, as the event showed.\nThis example, had it been remembered by the Florentines, might have\nsaved them from all that loss and vexation which they underwent at the\nhands of the French, at the time King Louis XII. of France came into\nItaly against Lodovico, duke of Milan. For when Louis first proposed to\npass through Tuscany he met with no objection from the Florentines,\nwhose envoys at his court arranged with him that they should stand\nneutral, while the king, on his arrival in Italy, was to maintain their\ngovernment and take them under his protection; a month\u2019s time being\nallowed the republic to ratify these terms. But certain persons, who,\nin their folly, favoured the cause of Lodovico, delayed this\nratification until the king was already on the eve of victory; when the\nFlorentines suddenly becoming eager to ratify, the king would not\naccept their ratification, perceiving their consent to be given under\nconstraint and not of their own good-will. This cost the city of\nFlorence dear, and went near to lose her freedom, whereof she was\nafterwards deprived on another like occasion. And the course taken by\nthe Florentines was the more to be blamed in that it was of no sort of\nservice to Duke Lodovico, who, had he been victorious, would have shown\nthe Florentines many more signs of his displeasure than did the king.\nAlthough the hurt which results to republics from weakness of this sort\nhas already been discussed in another Chapter, nevertheless, since an\nopportunity offered for touching upon it again, I have willingly\navailed myself of it, because to me it seems a matter of which\nrepublics like ours should take special heed.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014_That the Soldiers of our days depart widely from the\nmethods of ancient Warfare._\nIn all their wars with other nations, the most momentous battle ever\nfought by the Romans, was that which they fought with the Latins when\nTorquatus and Decius were consuls. For it may well be believed that as\nby the loss of that battle the Latins became subject to the Romans, so\nthe Romans had they not prevailed must have become subject to the\nLatins. And Titus Livius is of this opinion, since he represents the\narmies as exactly equal in every respect, in discipline and in valour,\nin numbers and in obstinacy, the only difference he draws being, that\nof the two armies the Romans had the more capable commanders. We find,\nhowever, two circumstances occurring in the conduct of this battle, the\nlike of which never happened before, and seldom since, namely, that to\ngive steadiness to the minds of their soldiers, and render them\nobedient to the word of command and resolute to fight, one of the\nconsuls put himself, and the other his son, to death.\nThe equality which Titus Livius declares to have prevailed in these two\narmies, arose from this, that having long served together they used the\nsame language, discipline, and arms; that in disposing their men for\nbattle they followed the same system; and that the divisions and\nofficers of their armies bore the same names. It was necessary,\ntherefore, that as they were of equal strength and valour, something\nextraordinary should take place to render the courage of the one army\nmore stubborn and unflinching than that of the other, it being on this\nstubbornness, as I have already said, that victory depends. For while\nthis temper is maintained in the minds of the combatants they will\nnever turn their backs on their foe. And that it might endure longer in\nthe minds of the Romans than of the Latins, partly chance, and partly\nthe valour of the consuls caused it to fall out that Torquatus slew his\nson, and Decius died by his own hand.\nIn pointing out this equality of strength, Titus Livius takes occasion\nto explain the whole system followed by the Romans in the ordering of\ntheir armies and in disposing them for battle; and as he has treated\nthe subject at length, I need not go over the same ground, and shall\ntouch only on what I judge in it most to deserve attention, but, being\noverlooked by all the captains of our times, has led to disorder in\nmany armies and in many battles.\nFrom this passage of Titus Livius, then, we learn that the Roman army\nhad three principal divisions, or battalions as we might now call them,\nof which they named the first _hastati_, the second _principes_, and\nthe third _triarii_, to each of which cavalry were attached. In\narraying an army for battle they set the _hastati_ in front. Directly\nbehind them, in the second rank, they placed the _principes_; and in\nthe third rank of the same column, the _triarii_. The cavalry of each\nof these three divisions they disposed to the right and left of the\ndivision to which it belonged; and to these companies of horse, from\ntheir form and position, they gave the name wings (_al\u00e6_), from their\nappearing like the two wings of the main body of the army. The first\ndivision, the _hastati_, which was in front, they drew up in close\norder to enable it to withstand and repulse the enemy. The second\ndivision, the _principes_, since it was not to be engaged from the\nbeginning, but was meant to succour the first in case that were driven\nin, was not formed in close order but kept in open file, so that it\nmight receive the other into its ranks whenever it was broken and\nforced to retire. The third division, that, namely, of the _triarii_,\nhad its ranks still more open than those of the second, so that, if\noccasion required, it might receive the first two divisions of the\n_hastati_ and _principes_. These divisions, therefore, being drawn up\nin this order, the engagement began, and if the _hastati_ were\noverpowered and driven back, they retired within the loose ranks of the\n_principes_, when both these divisions, being thus united into one,\nrenewed the conflict. If these, again, were routed and forced back,\nthey retreated within the open ranks of the _triarii_, and all three\ndivisions, forming into one, once more renewed the fight, in which, if\nthey were overpowered, since they had no further means of recruiting\ntheir strength, they lost the battle. And because whenever this last\ndivision, of the _triarii_, had to be employed, the army was in\njeopardy, there arose the proverb, \u201c_Res redacta est ad triarios_,\u201d\nequivalent to our expression of _playing a last stake_.\nThe captains of our day, as they have abandoned all the other customs\nof antiquity, and pay no heed to any part of the ancient discipline, so\nalso have discarded this method of disposing their men, though it was\none of no small utility. For to insure the defeat of a commander who so\narranges his forces as to be able thrice during an engagement to renew\nhis strength, Fortune must thrice declare against him, and he must be\nmatched with an adversary able three times over to defeat him; whereas\nhe whose sole chance of success lies in his surviving the first onset,\nas is the case with all the armies of Christendom at the present day,\nmay easily be vanquished, since any slight mishap, and the least\nfailure in the steadiness of his men, may deprive him of victory.\nAnd what takes from our armies the capacity to renew their strength is,\nthat provision is now no longer made for one division being received\ninto the ranks of another, which happens because at present an army is\narranged for battle in one or other of two imperfect methods. For\neither its divisions are placed side by side, so as to form a line of\ngreat width but of no depth or solidity; or if, to strengthen it, it be\ndrawn up in columns after the fashion of the Roman armies, should the\nfront line be broken, no provision having been made for its being\nreceived by the second, it is thrown into complete disorder, and both\ndivisions fall to pieces. For if the front line be driven back, it\njostles the second, if the second line endeavour to advance, the first\nstands in its way: and thus, the first driving against the second, and\nthe second against the third, such confusion follows that often the\nmost trifling accident will cause the ruin of an entire army.\nAt the battle of Ravenna, where M. de Foix, the French commander, was\nslain, although according to modern notions this was a well-fought\nfield, both the French and the Spanish armies were drawn up in the\nfirst of the faulty methods above described; that is to say, each army\nadvanced with the whole of its battalions side by side, so that each\npresented a single front much wider than deep; this being always the\nplan followed by modern armies when, as at Ravenna, the ground is open.\nFor knowing the disorder they fall into on retreat, forming themselves\nin a single line, they endeavour, as I have said, as much as possible\nto escape confusion by extending their front. But where the ground\nconfines them they fall at once into the disorder spoken of, without an\neffort to prevent it.\nTroops traversing an enemy\u2019s country, whether to pillage or carry out\nany other operation of war, are liable to fall into the same disorder;\nand at S. Regolo in the Pisan territory, and at other places where the\nFlorentines were beaten by the Pisans during the war which followed on\nthe revolt of Pisa after the coming of Charles of France into Italy,\nour defeat was due to no other cause than the behaviour of our own\ncavalry, who being posted in front, and being repulsed by the enemy,\nfell back on the infantry and threw them into confusion, whereupon the\nwhole army took to flight; and Messer Ciriaco del Borgo, the veteran\nleader of the Florentine foot, has often declared in my presence that\nhe had never been routed by any cavalry save those who were fighting on\nhis side. For which reason the Swiss, who are the greatest proficients\nin modern warfare, when serving with the French, make it their first\ncare to place themselves on their flank, so that the cavalry of their\nfriends, if repulsed, may not throw them into disorder.\nBut although these matters seem easy to understand and not difficult to\nput in practice, none has yet been found among the commanders of our\ntimes, who attempted to imitate the ancients or to correct the moderns.\nFor although these also have a tripartite division of their armies into\nvan-guard, main-body, and rear-guard, the only use they make of it is\nin giving orders when their men are in quarters; whereas on active\nservice it rarely happens that all divisions are not equally exposed to\nthe same onset.\nAnd because many, to excuse their ignorance, will have it that the\ndestructive fire of artillery forbids our employing at the present day\nmany of the tactics used by the ancients, I will discuss this question\nin the following Chapter, and examine whether artillery does in fact\nprevent us from using the valiant methods of antiquity.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014_What importance the Armies of the present day should\nallow to Artillery; and whether the commonly received opinion\nconcerning it be just._\nLooking to the number of pitched battles, or what are termed by the\nFrench _journ\u00e9es_, and by the Italians _fatti d\u2019arme_, fought by the\nRomans at divers times, I am led further to examine the generally\nreceived opinion, that had artillery been in use in their day, the\nRomans would not have been allowed, or at least not with the same ease,\nto subjugate provinces and make other nations their tributaries, and\ncould never have spread their power in the astonishing way they did.\nFor it is said that by reason of these fire-arms men can no longer use\nor display their personal valour as they could of old; that there is\ngreater difficulty now than there was in former times in joining\nbattle; that the tactics followed then cannot be followed now; and that\nin time all warfare must resolve itself into a question of artillery.\nJudging it not out of place to inquire whether these opinions are\nsound, and how far artillery has added to or taken from the strength of\narmies, and whether its use lessens or increases the opportunities for\na good captain to behave valiantly, I shall at once address myself to\nthe first of the averments noticed above, namely, that the armies of\nthe ancient Romans could not have made the conquests they did, had\nartillery then been in use.\nTo this I answer by saying that, since war is made for purposes either\nof offence or defence, we have first to see in which of these two kinds\nof warfare artillery gives the greater advantage or inflicts the\ngreater hurt. Now, though something might be said both ways, I\nnevertheless believe that artillery is beyond comparison more hurtful\nto him who stands on the defensive than to him who attacks. For he who\ndefends himself must either do so in a town or in a fortified camp. If\nwithin a town, either the town will be a small one, as fortified towns\ncommonly are, or it will be a great one. In the former case, he who is\non the defensive is at once undone. For such is the shock of artillery\nthat there is no wall so strong that in a few days it will not batter\ndown, when, unless those within have ample room to withdraw behind\ncovering works and trenches, they must be beaten; it being impossible\nfor them to resist the assault of an enemy who forces an entrance\nthrough the breaches in their walls. Nor will any artillery a defender\nmay have be of any service to him; since it is an established axiom\nthat where men are able to advance in numbers and rapidly, artillery is\npowerless to check them.\nFor this reason, in storming towns the furious assaults of the northern\nnations prove irresistible, whereas the attacks of our Italian troops,\nwho do not rush on in force, but advance to the assault in small knots\nof skirmishers (_scaramouches_, as they are fitly named), may easily be\nwithstood. Those who advance in such loose order, and with so little\nspirit, against a breach covered by artillery, advance to certain\ndestruction, and as against them artillery is useful. But when the\nassailants swarm to the breach so massed together that one pushes on\nanother, unless they be brought to a stand by ditches and earthworks,\nthey penetrate everywhere, and no artillery has any effect to keep them\nback; and though some must fall, yet not so many as to prevent a\nvictory.\nThe frequent success of the northern nations in storming towns, and\nmore particularly the recovery of Brescia by the French, is proof\nsufficient of the truth of what I say. For the town of Brescia rising\nagainst the French while the citadel still held out, the Venetians, to\nmeet any attack which might be made from the citadel upon the town,\nranged guns along the whole line of road which led from the one to the\nother, planting them in front, and in flank, and wherever else they\ncould be brought to bear. Of all which M. de Foix making no account,\ndismounted with his men-at-arms from horseback, and, advancing with\nthem on foot through the midst of the batteries, took the town; nor do\nwe learn that he sustained any considerable loss from the enemy\u2019s fire.\nSo that, as I have said, he who has to defend himself in a small town,\nwhen his walls are battered down and he has no room to retire behind\nother works, and has only his artillery to trust to, is at once undone.\nBut even where the town you defend is a great one, so that you have\nroom to fall back behind new works, artillery is still, by a long way,\nmore useful for the assailant than for the defender. For to enable your\nartillery to do any hurt to those without, you must raise yourself with\nit above the level of the ground, since, if you remain on the level,\nthe enemy, by erecting any low mound or earth-work, can so secure\nhimself that it will be impossible for you to touch him. But in raising\nyourself above the level of the ground, whether by extending yourself\nalong the gallery of the walls, or otherwise, you are exposed to two\ndisadvantages; for, first, you cannot there bring into position guns of\nthe same size or range as he who is without can bring to bear against\nyou, since it is impossible to work large guns in a confined space;\nand, secondly, although you should succeed in getting your guns into\nposition, you cannot construct such strong and solid works for their\nprotection as those can who are outside, and on level ground, and who\nhave all the room and every other advantage which they could desire. It\nis consequently impossible for him who defends a town to maintain his\nguns in position at any considerable height, when those who are outside\nhave much and powerful artillery; while, if he place it lower, it\nbecomes, as has been explained, to a great extent useless. So that in\nthe end the defence of the city has to be effected, as in ancient\ntimes, by hand to hand fighting, or else by means of the smaller kinds\nof fire-arms, from which if the defender derive some slight advantage,\nit is balanced by the injury he sustains from the great artillery of\nhis enemy, whereby the walls of the city are battered down and almost\nburied in their ditches; so that when it comes once more to an\nencounter at close quarters, by reason of his walls being demolished\nand his ditches filled up, the defender is now at a far greater\ndisadvantage than he was formerly. Wherefore I repeat that these arms\nare infinitely more useful for him who attacks a town than for him who\ndefends it.\nAs to the remaining method, which consists in your taking up your\nposition in an entrenched camp, where you need not fight unless you\nplease, and unless you have the advantage, I say that this method\ncommonly affords you no greater facility for avoiding an engagement\nthan the ancients had; nay, that sometimes, owing to the use of\nartillery, you are worse off than they were. For if the enemy fall\nsuddenly upon you, and have some slight advantage (as may readily be\nthe case from his being on higher ground, or from your works on his\narrival being still incomplete so that you are not wholly sheltered by\nthem), forthwith, and without your being able to prevent him, he\ndislodges you, and you are forced to quit your defences and deliver\nbattle: as happened to the Spaniards at the battle of Ravenna. For\nhaving posted themselves between the river Ronco and an earthwork, from\ntheir not having carried this work high enough, and from the French\nhaving a slight advantage of ground, they were forced by the fire of\nthe latter to quit their entrenchments come to an engagement.\nBut assuming the ground you have chosen for your camp to be, as it\nalways should, higher than that occupied by the enemy, and your works\nto be complete and sufficient, so that from your position and\npreparations the enemy dare not attack you, recourse will then be had\nto the very same methods as were resorted to in ancient times when an\narmy was so posted that it could not be assailed; that is to say, your\ncountry will be wasted, cities friendly to you besieged or stormed, and\nyour supplies intercepted; until you are forced, at last, of necessity\nto quit your camp and to fight a pitched battle, in which, as will\npresently appear, artillery will be of little service to you.\nIf we consider, therefore, for what ends the Romans made wars, and that\nattack and not defence was the object of almost all their campaigns, it\nwill be clear, if what I have said be true, that they would have had\nstill greater advantage, and might have achieved their conquests with\neven greater ease, had artillery been in use in their times.\nAnd as to the second complaint, that by reason of artillery men can no\nlonger display their valour as they could in ancient days, I admit it\nto be true that when they have to expose themselves a few at a time,\nmen run more risks now than formerly; as when they have to scale a town\nor perform some similar exploit, in which they are not massed together\nbut must advance singly and one behind another. It is true, also, that\nCaptains and commanders of armies are subjected to a greater risk of\nbeing killed now than of old, since they an be reached everywhere by\nthe enemy\u2019s fire; and it is no protection to them to be with those of\ntheir men who are furthest from the enemy, or to be surrounded by the\nbravest of their guards. Still, we do not often find either of these\ntwo dangers occasioning extraordinary loss. For towns strongly\nfortified are not attacked by escalade, nor will the assailing army\nadvance against them in weak numbers; but will endeavour, as in ancient\ntimes, to reduce them by regular siege. And even in the case of towns\nattacked by storm, the dangers are not so very much greater now than\nthey were formerly; for in those old days also, the defenders of towns\nwere not without warlike engines, which if less terrible in their\noperation, had, so far as killing goes, much the same effect. And as\nfor the deaths of captains and leaders of companies, it may be said\nthat during the last twenty-four years of war in Italy, we have had\nfewer instances of such deaths than might be found in a period of ten\nyears of ancient warfare. For excepting the Count Lodovico della\nMirandola, who fell at Ferrara, when the Venetians a few years ago\nattacked that city, and the Duke de Nemours, slain at Cirignuola, we\nhave no instance of any commander being killed by artillery. For, at\nRavenna, M. de Foix died by steel and not by shot. Wherefore I say that\nif men no longer perform deeds of individual prowess, it results not so\nmuch from the use of artillery, as from the faulty discipline and\nweakness of our armies, which being collectively without valour cannot\ndisplay it in particular instances.\nAs to the third assertion, that armies can no longer be brought to\nengage one another, and that war will soon come to be carried on wholly\nwith artillery, I maintain that this allegation is utterly untrue, and\nwill always be so held by those who are willing in handling their\ntroops to follow the usages of ancient valour. For whosoever would have\na good army must train it, either by real or by mimic warfare, to\napproach the enemy, to come within sword-thrust, and to grapple with\nhim; and must rely more on foot soldiers than on horse, for reasons\npresently to be explained. But when you trust to your foot-soldiers,\nand to the methods already indicated, artillery becomes powerless to\nharm you. For foot-soldiers, in approaching an enemy, can with more\nease escape the fire of his artillery than in ancient times they could\nhave avoided a charge of elephants or of scythed chariots, or any other\nof those strange contrivances which had to be encountered by the\nRomans, and against which they always devised some remedy. And,\ncertainly, as against artillery, their remedy would have been easier,\nby as much as the time during which artillery can do hurt is shorter\nthan the time during which elephants and chariots could. For by these\nyou were thrown into disorder after battle joined, whereas artillery\nharasses you only before you engage; a danger which infantry can easily\nescape, either by advancing so as to be covered by the inequalities of\nthe ground, or by lying down while the firing continues; nay, we find\nfrom experience that even these precautions may be dispensed with,\nespecially as against great artillery, which can hardly be levelled\nwith such precision that its fire shall not either pass over your head\nfrom the range being too high, or fall short from its being too low.\nSo soon, however, as the engagement is begun, it is perfectly clear\nthat neither small nor great artillery can harm you any longer; since,\nif the enemy have his artillerymen in front, you take them; if in rear,\nthey will injure him before they injure you; and if in flank, they can\nnever fire so effectively as to prevent your closing, with the result\nalready explained. Nor does this admit of much dispute, since we have\nproof of it in the case of the Swiss at Novara, in the year 1513, when,\nwith neither guns nor cavalry, they advanced against the French army,\nwho had fortified themselves with artillery behind entrenchments, and\nrouted them without suffering the slightest check from their fire. In\nfurther explanation whereof it is to be noted, that to work artillery\neffectively it should be protected by walls, by ditches, or by\nearth-works; and that whenever, from being left without such protection\nit has to be defended by men, as happens in pitched battles and\nengagements in the open field, it is either taken or otherwise becomes\nuseless. Nor can it be employed on the flank of an army, save in the\nmanner in which the ancients made use of their warlike engines, which\nthey moved out from their columns that they might be worked without\ninconvenience, but withdrew within them when driven back by cavalry or\nother troops. He who looks for any further advantage from artillery\ndoes not rightly understand its nature, and trusts to what is most\nlikely to deceive him. For although the Turk, using artillery, has\ngained victories over the Soldan and the Sofi, the only advantage he\nhas had from it has been the terror into which the horses of the enemy,\nunused to such sounds, are thrown by the roar of the guns.\nAnd now, to bring these remarks to a conclusion, I say briefly that,\nemployed by an army wherein there is some strain of the ancient valour,\nartillery is useful; but employed otherwise, against a brave adversary,\nis utterly useless.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\u2014_That the authority of the Romans and the example of\nancient Warfare should make us hold Foot Soldiers of more account than\nHorse._\nBy many arguments and instances it can be clearly established that in\ntheir military enterprises the Romans set far more store on their\ninfantry than on their cavalry, and trusted to the former to carry out\nall the chief objects which their armies were meant to effect. Among\nmany other examples of this, we may notice the great battle which they\nfought with the Latins near the lake Regillus, where to steady their\nwavering ranks they made their horsemen dismount, and renewing the\ncombat on foot obtained a victory. Here we see plainly that the Romans\nhad more confidence in themselves when they fought on foot than when\nthey fought on horseback. The same expedient was resorted to by them in\nmany of their other battles, and always in their sorest need they found\nit their surest stay.\nNor are we to condemn the practice in deference to the opinion of\nHannibal, who, at the battle of Cann\u00e6, on seeing the consuls make the\nhorsemen dismount, said scoffingly, \u201c_Better still had they delivered\ntheir knights to me in chains._\u201d For though this saying came from the\nmouth of a most excellent soldier, still, if we are to regard\nauthority, we ought rather to follow the authority of a commonwealth\nlike Rome, and of the many great captains who served her, than that of\nHannibal alone. But, apart from authority, there are manifest reasons\nto bear out what I say. For a man may go on foot into many places where\na horse cannot go; men can be taught to keep rank, and if thrown into\ndisorder to recover form; whereas, it is difficult to keep horses in\nline, and impossible if once they be thrown into disorder to reform\nthem. Moreover we find that with horses as with men, some have little\ncourage and some much; and that often a spirited horse is ridden by a\nfaint-hearted rider, or a dull horse by a courageous rider, and that in\nwhatever way such disparity is caused, confusion and disorder result.\nAgain, infantry, when drawn up in column, can easily break and is not\neasily broken by cavalry. This is vouched, not only by many ancient and\nmany modern instances, but also by the authority of those who lay down\nrules for the government of States, who show that at first wars were\ncarried on by mounted soldiers, because the methods for arraying\ninfantry were not yet understood, but that so soon as these were\ndiscovered, the superiority of foot over horse was at once recognized.\nIn saying this, I would not have it supposed that horsemen are not of\nthe greatest use in armies, whether for purposes of observation, for\nharrying and laying waste the enemy\u2019s country, for pursuing a\nretreating foe or helping to repulse his cavalry. But the substance and\nsinew of an army, and that part of it which ought constantly to be most\nconsidered, should always be the infantry. And among sins of the\nItalian princes who have made their country the slave of foreigners,\nthere is none worse than that they have held these arms in contempt,\nand turned their whole attention to mounted troops.\nThis error is due to the craft of our captains and to the ignorance of\nour rulers. For the control of the armies of Italy for the last five\nand twenty years resting in the hands of men, who, as having no lands\nof their own, may be looked on as mere soldiers of fortune, these fell\nforthwith on contriving how they might maintain their credit by being\nsupplied with the arms which the princes of the country were without.\nAnd as they had no subjects of their own of whom they could make use,\nand could not obtain constant employment and pay for a large number of\nfoot-soldiers, and as a small number would have given them no\nimportance, they had recourse to horsemen. For a _condottiere_ drawing\npay for two or three hundred horsemen was maintained by them in the\nhighest credit, and yet the cost was not too great to be met by the\nprinces who employed him. And to effect their object with more ease,\nand increase their credit still further, these adventurers would allow\nno merit or favour to be due to foot-soldiers, but claimed all for\ntheir horsemen. And to such a length was this bad system carried, that\nin the very greatest army only the smallest sprinkling of infantry was\nto be found. This, together with many other ill practices which\naccompanied it, has so weakened the militia of Italy, that the country\nhas easily been trampled upon by all the nations of the North.\nThat it is a mistake to make more account of cavalry than of infantry,\nmay be still more clearly seen from another example taken from Roman\nhistory. The Romans being engaged on the siege of Sora, a troop of\nhorse a sally from the town to attack their camp; when the Roman master\nof the knights advancing with his own horsemen to give them battle, it\nso chanced that, at the very first onset, the leaders on both sides\nwere slain. Both parties being thus left without commanders, and the\ncombat, nevertheless, continuing, the Romans thinking thereby to have\nthe advantage of their adversaries, alighted from horseback, obliging\nthe enemy\u2019s cavalry, in order to defend themselves, to do the like. The\nresult was that the Romans had the victory. Now there could be no\nstronger instance than this to show the superiority of foot over horse.\nFor while in other battles the Roman cavalry were made by their consuls\nto dismount in order to succour their infantry who were in distress and\nin need of such aid, on this occasion they dismounted, not to succour\ntheir infantry, nor to encounter an enemy contending on foot, but\nbecause they saw that though they could not prevail against the enemy\nfighting as horsemen against horsemen, on foot they readily might. And\nfrom this I conclude that foot-soldiers, if rightly handled, can hardly\nbe beaten except by other soldiers fighting on foot.\nWith very few cavalry, but with a considerable force of infantry, the\nRoman commanders, Crassus and Marcus Antonius, each for many days\ntogether overran the territories of the Parthians, although opposed by\nthe countless horsemen of that nation. Crassus, indeed, with the\ngreater part of his army, was left there dead, and Antonius only saved\nhimself by his valour; but even in the extremities to which the Romans\nwere then brought, see how greatly superior foot-soldiers are to horse.\nFor though fighting in an open country, far from the sea-coast, and cut\noff from his supplies, Antonius proved himself a valiant soldier in the\njudgment even of the Parthians themselves, the whole strength of whose\ncavalry never ventured to attack the columns of his army. And though\nCrassus perished there, any one who reads attentively the account of\nhis expedition must see that he was rather outwitted than defeated, and\nthat even when his condition was desperate, the Parthians durst not\nclose with him, but effected his destruction by hanging continually on\nthe flanks of his army, and intercepting his supplies, while cajoling\nhim with promises which they never kept.\nIt might, I grant, be harder to demonstrate this great superiority of\nfoot over horse, had we not very many modern examples affording the\nclearest proof of it. For instance, at the battle of Novara, of which\nwe have already spoken, nine thousand Swiss foot were seen to attack\nten thousand cavalry together with an equal number of infantry, and to\ndefeat them; the cavalry being powerless to injure them, while of the\ninfantry, who were mostly Gascons, and badly disciplined, they made no\naccount. On another occasion we have seen twenty-six thousand Swiss\nmarch on Milan to attack Francis I. of France, who had with him twenty\nthousand men-at-arms, forty thousand foot, and a hundred pieces of\nartillery; and although they were not victorious as at Novara, they\nnevertheless fought valiantly for two days together, and, in the end,\nthough beaten, were able to bring off half their number. With\nfoot-soldiers only Marcus Attilius Regulus ventured to oppose himself,\nnot to cavalry merely, but to elephants; and if the attempt failed it\ndoes not follow that he was not justified by the valour of his men in\nbelieving them equal to surmount this danger.\nI repeat, therefore, that to prevail against well-disciplined infantry,\nyou must meet them with infantry disciplined still better, and that\notherwise you advance to certain destruction. In the time of Filippo\nVisconti, Duke of Milan, some sixteen thousand Swiss made a descent on\nLombardy, whereupon the Duke, who at that time had Il Carmagnola as his\ncaptain, sent him with six thousand men-at-arms and a slender following\nof foot-soldiers to meet them. Not knowing their manner of fighting,\nCarmagnola fell upon them with his horsemen, expecting to put them at\nonce to rout; but finding them immovable, after losing many of his men\nhe withdrew. But, being a most wise captain, and skilful in devising\nnew remedies to meet unwonted dangers, after reinforcing his company he\nagain advanced to the attack; and when about to engage made all his\nmen-at-arms dismount, and placing them in front of his foot-soldiers,\nfell once more upon the Swiss, who could then no longer withstand him.\nFor his men, being on foot and well armed, easily penetrated the Swiss\nranks without hurt to themselves; and getting among them, had no\ndifficulty in cutting them down, so that of the entire army of the\nSwiss those only escaped who were spared by his humanity.\nOf this difference in the efficiency of these two kinds of troops, many\nI believe are aware; but such is the unhappiness and perversity of the\ntimes in which we live, that neither ancient nor modern examples, nor\neven the consciousness of error, can move our present princes to amend\ntheir ways, or convince them that to restore credit to the arms of a\nState or province, it is necessary to revive this branch of their\nmilitia also, to keep it near them, to make much of it, and to give it\nlife, that in return, it may give back life and reputation to them. But\nas they have departed from all those other methods already spoken of,\nso have they departed from this, and with this result, that to them the\nacquisition of territory is rather a loss than a gain, as presently\nshall be shown.\nCHAPTER XIX.\u2014_That Acquisitions made by ill-governed States and such as\nfollow not the valiant methods of the Romans, tend rather to their Ruin\nthan to their Aggrandizement_.\nTo these false opinions, founded on the pernicious example first set by\nthe present corrupt age, we owe it, that no man thinks of departing\nfrom the methods which are in use. It had been impossible, for\ninstance, some thirty years ago, to persuade an Italian that ten\nthousand foot-soldiers could, on plain ground, attack ten thousand\ncavalry together with an equal number of infantry; and not merely\nattack, but defeat them; as we saw done by the Swiss at that battle of\nNovara, to which I have already referred so often. For although history\nabounds in similar examples, none would have believed them, or,\nbelieving them, would have said that nowadays men are so much better\narmed, that a squadron of cavalry could shatter a rock, to say nothing\nof a column of infantry. With such false pleas would they have belied\ntheir judgment, taking no account that with a very scanty force of\nfoot-soldiers, Lucullus routed a hundred and fifty thousand of the\ncavalry of Tigranes, among whom were a body of horsemen very nearly\nresembling our own men-at-arms. Now, however, this error is\ndemonstrated by the example of the northern nations.\nAnd since what history teaches as to the superiority of foot-soldiers\nis thus proved to be true, men ought likewise to believe that the other\nmethods practised by the ancients are in like manner salutary and\nuseful. And were this once accepted, both princes and commonwealths\nwould make fewer blunders than they do, would be stronger to resist\nsudden attack, and would no longer place their sole hope of safety in\nflight; while those who take in hand to provide a State with new\ninstitutions would know better what direction to give them, whether in\nthe way of extending or merely of preserving; and would see that to\naugment the numbers of their citizens, to assume other States as\ncompanions rather than reduce them to subjection, to send out colonies\nfor the defence of acquired territories, to hold their spoils at the\ncredit of the common stock, to overcome enemies by inroads and pitched\nbattles rather than by sieges, to enrich the public purse, keep down\nprivate wealth, and zealously, to maintain all military exercises, are\nthe true ways to aggrandize a State and to extend its empire. Or if\nthese methods for adding to their power are not to their mind, let them\nremember that acquisitions made in any other way are the ruin of\nrepublics, and so set bounds to their ambition, wisely regulating the\ninternal government of their country by suitable laws and ordinances,\nforbidding extension, and looking only to defence, and taking heed that\ntheir defences are in good order, as do those republics of Germany\nwhich live and for long have lived, in freedom.\nAnd yet, as I have said on another occasion, when speaking of the\ndifference between the methods suitable for acquiring and those\nsuitable for maintaining, it is impossible for a republic to remain\nlong in the peaceful enjoyment of freedom within a restricted frontier.\nFor should it forbear from molesting others, others are not likely to\nrefrain from molesting it; whence must grow at once the desire and the\nnecessity to make acquisitions; or should no enemies be found abroad,\nthey will be found at home, for this seems to be incidental to all\ngreat States. And if the free States of Germany are, and have long been\nable to maintain themselves on their present footing, this arises from\ncertain conditions peculiar to that country, and to be found nowhere\nelse, without which these communities could not go on living as they\ndo.\nThe district of Germany of which I speak was formerly subject to the\nRoman Empire, in the same way as France and Spain; but on the decline\nof the Empire, and when its very name came to be limited to this one\nprovince, its more powerful cities taking advantage of the weakness and\nnecessities of the Emperors, began to free themselves by buying from\nthem their liberty, subject to the payment of a trifling yearly\ntribute; until, gradually, all the cities which held directly from the\nEmperor, and were not subject to any intermediate lord, had, in like\nmanner, purchased their freedom. While this went on, it so happened\nthat certain communities subject to the Duke of Austria, among which\nwere Friburg, the people of Schweitz, and the like, rose in rebellion\nagainst him, and meeting at the outset with good success, by degrees\nacquired such accession of strength that so far from returning under\nthe Austrian yoke, they are become formidable to all their neighbours\nThese are the States which we now name Swiss.\nGermany is, consequently, divided between the Swiss, the communities\nwhich take the name of Free Towns, the Princes, and the Emperor; and\nthe reason why, amid so many conflicting interests, wars do not break\nout, or breaking out are of short continuance, is the reverence in\nwhich all hold this symbol of the Imperial authority. For although the\nEmperor be without strength of his own, he has nevertheless such credit\nwith all these others that he alone can keep them united, and,\ninterposing as mediator, can speedily repress by his influence any\ndissensions among them.\nThe greatest and most protracted wars which have taken place in this\ncountry have been those between the Swiss and the Duke of Austria; and\nalthough for many years past the Empire and the dukedom of Austria have\nbeen united in the same man, he has always failed to subdue the\nstubbornness of the Swiss, who are never to be brought to terms save by\nforce. Nor has the rest of Germany lent the Emperor much assistance in\nhis wars with the Swiss, the Free Towns being little disposed to attack\nothers whose desire is to live as they themselves do, in freedom; while\nthe Princes of the Empire either are so poor that they cannot, or from\njealousy of the power of the Emperor will not, take part with him\nagainst them.\nThese communities, therefore, abide contented within their narrow\nconfines, because, having regard to the Imperial authority, they have\nno occasion to desire greater; and are at the same time obliged to live\nin unity within their walls, because an enemy is always at hand, and\nready to take advantage of their divisions to effect an entrance. But\nwere the circumstances of the country other than they are these\ncommunities would be forced to make attempts to extend their dominions,\nand be constrained to relinquish their present peaceful mode of life.\nAnd since the same conditions are not found elsewhere, other nations\ncannot adopt this way of living, but are compelled to extend their\npower either by means of leagues, or else by the methods used by the\nRomans; and any one who should act otherwise would find not safety but\nrather death and destruction. For since in a thousand ways, and from\ncauses innumerable, conquests are surrounded with dangers, it may well\nhappen that in adding to our dominions, we add nothing to our strength;\nbut whosoever increases not his strength while he adds to his\ndominions, must needs be ruined. He who is impoverished by his wars,\neven should he come off victorious, can add nothing to his strength,\nsince he spends more than he gains, as the Venetians and Florentines\nhave done. For Venice has been far feebler since she acquired Lombardy,\nand Florence since she acquired Tuscany, than when the one was content\nto be mistress of the seas, and the other of the lands lying within six\nmiles from her walls. And this from their eagerness to acquire without\nknowing what way to take. For which ignorance these States are the more\nto be blamed in proportion as there is less to excuse them; since they\nhad seen what methods were used by the Romans, and could have followed\nin their footsteps; whereas the Romans, without any example set them,\nwere able by their own prudence to shape a course for themselves.\nBut even to well-governed States, their conquests may chance to\noccasion much harm; as when some city or province is acquired abounding\nin luxury and delights, by whose manners the conqueror becomes\ninfected; as happened first to the Romans, and afterwards to Hannibal\non taking possession of Capua. And had Capua been at such a distance\nfrom Rome that a ready remedy could not have been applied to the\ndisorders of the soldiery, or had Rome herself been in any degree\ntainted with corruption, this acquisition had certainly proved her\nruin. To which Titus Livius bears witness when he says, \u201c_Most\nmischievous at this time to our military discipline was Capua; for\nministering to all delights, she turned away the corrupted minds of our\nsoldiers from the remembrance of their country_.\u201d And, truly, cities\nand provinces like this, avenge themselves on their conquerors without\nblood or blow; since by infecting them with their own evil customs they\nprepare them for defeat at the hands of any assailant. Nor could the\nsubject have been better handled than by Juvenal, where he says in his\nSatires, that into the hearts of the Romans, through their conquests in\nforeign lands, foreign manners found their way; and in place of\nfrugality and other admirable virtues\u2014\n\u201cCame luxury more mortal than the sword,\nAnd settling down, avenged a vanquished world.\u201d[8]\n[8] S\u00e6vior armis\nLuxuria occubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem.\n_Juv. Sat_. vi. 292.\nAnd if their conquests were like to be fatal to the Romans at a time\nwhen they were still animated by great virtue and prudence, how must it\nfare with those who follow methods altogether different from theirs,\nand who, to crown their other errors of which we have already said\nenough, resort to auxiliary and mercenary arms, bringing upon\nthemselves those dangers whereof mention shall be made in the Chapter\nfollowing.\nCHAPTER XX.\u2014_Of the Dangers incurred by Princes or Republics who resort\nto Auxiliary or Mercenary Arms_.\nHad I not already, in another treatise, enlarged on the inutility of\nmercenary and auxiliary, and on the usefulness of national arms, I\nshould dwell on these matters in the present Discourse more at length\nthan it is my design to do. For having given the subject very full\nconsideration elsewhere, here I would be brief. Still when I find Titus\nLivius supplying a complete example of what we have to look for from\nauxiliaries, by whom I mean troops sent to our assistance by some other\nprince or ruler, paid by him and under officers by him appointed, it is\nnot fit that I should pass it by in silence.\nIt is related, then, by our historian, that the Romans, after defeating\non two different occasions armies of the Samnites with forces sent by\nthem to succour the Capuans, whom they thus relieved from the war which\nthe Samnites Were waging against them, being desirious to return to\nRome, left behind two legions to defend the Capuans, that the latter\nmight not, from being altogether deprived of their protection, once\nmore become a prey to the Samnites. But these two legions, rotting in\nidleness began to take such delight therein, that forgetful of their\ncountry and the reverence due to the senate, they resolved to seize by\nviolence the city they had been left to guard by their valour. For to\nthem it seemed that the citizens of Capua were unworthy to enjoy\nadvantages which they knew not how to defend. The Romans, however,\ngetting timely notice of this design, at once met and defeated it, in\nthe manner to be more fully noticed when I come to treat of\nconspiracies.\nOnce more then, I repeat, that of all the various kinds of troops,\nauxiliaries are the most pernicious, because the prince or republic\nresorting to them for aid has no authority over them, the only person\nwho possesses such authority being he who sends them. For, as I have\nsaid, auxiliary troops are those sent to your assistance by some other\npotentate, under his own flag, under his own officers, and in his own\npay, as were the legions sent by the Romans to Capua. Such troops, if\nvictorious, will for the most part plunder him by whom, as well as him\nagainst whom, they are hired to fight; and this they do, sometimes at\nthe instigation of the potentate who sends them, sometimes for\nambitious ends of their own. It was not the purpose of the Romans to\nviolate the league and treaty which they had made with Capua; but to\ntheir soldiers it seemed so easy a matter to master the Capuans, that\nthey were readily led into this plot for depriving them of their town\nand territories. Many other examples might be given to the same effect,\nbut it is enough to mention besides this instance, that of the people\nof Regium, who were deprived of their city and of their lives by\nanother Roman legion sent for their protection.\nPrinces and republics, therefore, should resort to any other expedient\nfor the defence of their States sooner than call in hired auxiliaries,\nwhen they have to rest their entire hopes of safety on them; since any\naccord or terms, however hard, which you may make with your enemy, will\nbe carefully studied and current events well considered, it will be\nseen that for one who has succeeded with such assistance, hundreds have\nbeen betrayed. Nor, in truth, can any better opportunity for usurping a\ncity or province present itself to an ambitious prince or commonwealth,\nthan to be asked to send an army for its defence. On the other hand, he\nwho is so greedy of conquest as to summon such help, not for purposes\nof defence but in order to attack others, seeks to have what he can\nnever hold and is most likely to be taken from him by the very person\nwho helps him to gain it. Yet such is the perversity of men that, to\ngratify the desire of the moment, they shut their eyes to those ills\nwhich must speedily ensue and are no more moved by example in this\nmatter than in all those others of which I have spoken; for were they\nmoved by these examples they would see that the more disposed they are\nto deal generously with their neighbours, and the more averse they are\nto usurp authority over them, the readier will these be to throw\nthemselves into their arms; as will at once appear from the case of the\nCapuans.\nCHAPTER XXI.\u2014_That Capua was the first City to which the Romans sent a\nPr\u00e6tor; nor there, until four hundred years after they began to make\nWar._\nThe great difference between the methods followed by the ancient Romans\nin adding to their dominions, and those used for that purpose by the\nStates of the present time, has now been sufficiently discussed. It has\nbeen seen, too how in dealing with the cities which they did not think\nfit to destroy, and even with those which had made their submission not\nas companions but as subjects, it was customary with the Romans to\npermit them to live on under their own laws, without imposing any\noutward sign of dependence, merely binding them to certain conditions,\nor complying with which they were maintained in their former dignity\nand importance. We know, further, that the same methods continued to be\nfollowed by the Romans until they passed beyond the confines of Italy,\nand began to reduce foreign kingdoms and States to provinces: as\nplainly appears in the fact that Capua was the first city to which they\nsent a pr\u00e6tor, and him from no motive of ambition, but at the request\nof the Capuans themselves who, living at variance with one another,\nthought it necessary to have a Roman citizen in their town who might\nrestore unity and good order among them. Influenced by this example,\nand urged by the same need, the people of Antium were the next to ask\nthat they too might have a pr\u00e6tor given them; touching which request\nand in connection with which new method of governing, Titus Livius\nobserves, \u201c_that not the arms only but also the laws of Rome now began\nto exert an influence;_\u201d showing how much the course thus followed by\nthe Romans promoted the growth of their authority.\nFor those cities, more especially, which have been used to freedom or\nto be governed by their own citizens, rest far better satisfied with a\ngovernment which they do not see, even though it involve something of\noppression, than with one which standing constantly before their eyes,\nseems every day to reproach them with the disgrace of servitude. And to\nthe prince there is another advantage in this method of government,\nnamely, that as the judges and magistrates who administer the laws\ncivil and criminal within these cities, are not under his control, no\ndecision of theirs can throw responsibility or discredit upon him; so\nthat he thus escapes many occasions of calumny and hatred. Of the truth\nwhereof, besides the ancient instances which might be noted, we have a\nrecent example here in Italy. For Genoa, as every one knows, has many\ntimes been occupied by the French king, who always, until lately, sent\nthither a French governor to rule in his name. Recently, however, not\nfrom choice but of necessity, he has permitted the town to be\nself-governed under a Genoese ruler; and any one who had to decide\nwhich of these two methods of governing gives the greater security to\nthe king\u2019s authority and the greater content to the people themselves,\nwould assuredly have to pronounce in favour of the latter.\nMen, moreover, in proportion as they see you averse to usurp authority\nover them, grow the readier to surrender themselves into your hands;\nand fear you less on the score of their freedom, when they find you\nacting towards them with consideration and kindness. It was the display\nof these qualities that moved the Capuans to ask the Romans for a\npr\u00e6tor; for had the Romans betrayed the least eagerness to send them\none, they would at once have conceived jealousy and grown estranged.\nBut why turn for examples to Capua and Rome, when we have them close at\nhand in Tuscany and Florence? Who is there but knows what a time it is\nsince the city of Pistoja submitted of her own accord to the Florentine\nsupremacy? Who, again, but knows the animosity which down to the\npresent day exists between Florence and the cities of Pisa, Lucca, and\nSiena? This difference of feeling does not arise from the citizens of\nPistoja valuing their freedom less than the citizens of these other\ntowns or thinking themselves inferior to them, but from the Florentines\nhaving always acted towards the former as brothers, towards the latter\nas foes. This it was that led the Pistojans to come voluntarily under\nour authority while the others have done and do all in their power to\nescape it. For there seems no reason to doubt, that if Florence,\ninstead of exasperating these neighbours of hers, had sought to win\nthem over, either by entering into league with them or by lending them\nassistance, she would at this hour have been mistress of Tuscany. Not\nthat I would be understood to maintain that recourse is never to be had\nto force and to arms, but that these are only to be used in the last\nresort, and when all other remedies are unavailing.\nCHAPTER XXII.\u2014_That in matters of moment Men often judge amiss._\nHow falsely men often judge of things, they who are present at their\ndeliberations have constant occasion to know. For in many matters,\nunless these deliberations be guided by men of great parts, the\nconclusions come to are certain to be wrong. And because in corrupt\nrepublics, and especially in quiet times, either through jealousy or\nfrom other like causes, men of great ability are often obliged to stand\naloof, it follows that measures not good in themselves are by a common\nerror judged to be good, or are promoted by those who seek public\nfavour rather than the public advantage. Mistakes of this sort are\nfound out afterwards in seasons of adversity, when recourse must be had\nto those persons who in peaceful times had been, as it were, forgotten,\nas shall hereafter in its proper place be more fully explained. Cases,\nmoreover, arise in which those who have little experience of affairs\nare sure to be misled, from the matters with which they have to deal\nbeing attended by many deceptive appearances such as lead men to\nbelieve whatsoever they are minded to believe.\nThese remarks I make with reference to the false hopes which the\nLatins, after being defeated by the Romans, were led to form on the\npersuasion of their pr\u00e6tor Numitius, and also with reference to what\nwas believed by many a few years ago, when Francis, king of France,\ncame to recover Milan from the Swiss. For Francis of Angoul\u00eame,\nsucceeding on the death of Louis XII. to the throne of France, and\ndesiring to recover for that realm the Duchy of Milan, on which, some\nyears before, the Swiss had seized at the instance of Pope Julius,\nsought for allies in Italy to second him in his attempt; and besides\nthe Venetians, who had already been gained over by King Louis,\nendeavoured to secure the aid of the Florentines and Pope Leo X.;\nthinking that were he to succeed in getting these others to take part\nwith him, his enterprise would be easier. For the forces of the Spanish\nking were then in Lombardy, and the army of the Emperor at Verona.\nPope Leo, however, did not fall in with the wishes of Francis, being,\nit is said, persuaded by his advisers that his best course was to stand\nneutral. For they urged that it was not for the advantage of the Church\nto have powerful strangers, whether French or Swiss, in Italy; but that\nto restore the country to its ancient freedom, it must be delivered\nfrom the yoke of both. And since to conquer both, whether singly or\ntogether, was impossible, it was to be desired that the one should\noverthrow the other, after which the Church with her friends might fall\nupon the victor. And it was averred that no better opportunity for\ncarrying out this design could ever be found than then presented\nitself; for both the French and the Swiss were in the field; while the\nPope had his troops in readiness to appear on the Lombard frontier and\nin the vicinity of the two armies, where, under colour of watching his\nown interests, he could easily keep them until the opposed hosts came\nto an engagement; when, as both armies were full of courage, their\nencounter might be expected to be a bloody one, and likely to leave the\nvictor so weakened that it would be easy for the Pope to attack and\ndefeat him; and so, to his own great glory, remain master of Lombardy\nand supreme throughout Italy.\nHow baseless this expectation was, was seen from the event. For the\nSwiss being routed after a protracted combat, the troops of the Pope\nand Spain, so far from venturing to attack the conqueror, prepared for\nflight; nor would flight have saved them, had not the humanity or\nindifference of the king withheld him from pursuing his victory, and\ndisposed him to make terms with the Church.\nThe arguments put forward by the Pope\u2019s advisers had a certain show of\nreason in their favour, which looked at from a distance seemed\nplausible enough; but were in reality wholly contrary to truth; since\nit rarely happens that the captain who wins a victory loses any great\nnumber of his men, his loss being in battle only, and not in flight.\nFor in the heat of battle, while men stand face to face, but few fall,\nchiefly because such combats do not last long; and even when they do\nlast, and many of the victorious army are slain, so splendid is the\nreputation which attends a victory, and so great the terror it\ninspires, as far to outweigh any loss the victor suffers by the\nslaughter of his soldiers; so that an enemy who, trusting to find him\nweakened, should then venture to attack him, would soon be taught his\nmistake, unless strong enough to give him battle at any time, before\nhis victory as well as after. For in that case he might, as fortune and\nvalour should determine, either win or lose; though, even then, the\narmy which had first fought and won would have an advantage. And this\nwe know for a truth from what befell the Latins in consequence of the\nmistake made by Numitius their pr\u00e6tor, and their blindness in believing\nhim. For when they had already suffered defeat at the hands of the\nRomans, Numitius caused it to be proclaimed throughout the whole\ncountry of Latium, that now was the time to fall upon the enemy,\nexhausted by a struggle in which they were victorious only in name,\nwhile in reality suffering all those ills which attend defeat, and who\nmight easily be crushed by any fresh force brought against them.\nWhereupon the Latins believed him, and getting together a new army,\nwere forthwith routed with such loss as always awaits those who listen\nto like counsels.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\u2014_That in chastising their Subjects when circumstances\nrequired it the Romans always avoided half-measures._\n\u201cSuch _was now the state of affairs in Latium, that peace and war\nseemed alike intolerable_.\u201d No worse calamity can befall a prince or\ncommonwealth than to be reduced to such straits that they can neither\naccept peace nor support war; as is the case with those whom it would\nruin to conclude peace on the terms offered, while war obliges them\neither to yield themselves a spoil to their allies, or remain a prey to\ntheir foes. To this grievous alternative are men led by evil counsels\nand unwise courses, and, as already said, from not rightly measuring\ntheir strength. For the commonwealth or prince who has rightly measured\nhis strength, can hardly be brought so low as were the Latins, who made\nwar with the Romans when they should have made terms, and made terms\nwhen they should have made war, and so mismanaged everything that the\nfriendship and the enmity of Rome were alike fatal. Whence it came\nthat, in the first place, they were defeated and broken by Manlius\nTorquatus, and afterwards utterly subdued by Camillus; who, when he had\nforced them to surrender at discretion to the Roman arms, and had\nplaced garrisons in all their towns, and taken hostages from all,\nreturned to Rome and reported to the senate that the whole of Latium\nnow lay at their mercy.\nAnd because the sentence then passed by the senate is memorable, and\nworthy to be studied by princes that it may be imitated by them on like\noccasion, I shall cite the exact words which Livius puts into the mouth\nof Camillus, as confirming what I have already said touching the\nmethods used by the Romans to extend their power, and as showing how in\nchastising their subjects they always avoided half-measures and took a\ndecided course. For government consists in nothing else than in so\ncontrolling your subjects that it shall neither be in their power nor\nfor their interest to harm you. And this is effected either by making\nsuch sure work with them as puts it out of their power to do you\ninjury, or else by so loading them with benefits that it would be folly\nin them to seek to alter their condition. All which is implied first in\nthe measures proposed by Camillus, and next in the resolutions passed\non these proposals by the senate. The words of Camillus were as\nfollows: \u201c_The immortal gods have made you so entirely masters in the\nmatter you are now considering, that_ _it lies with you to pronounce\nwhether Latium shall or shall not longer exist. So far as the Latins\nare concerned, you can secure a lasting peace either by clemency or by\nseverity. Would you deal harshly with those whom you have conquered and\nwho have given themselves into your hands, you can blot out the whole\nLatin nation. Would you, after the fashion of our ancestors, increase\nthe strength of Rome by admitting the vanquished to the rights of\ncitizenship, here you have opportunity to do so, and with the greatest\nglory to yourselves. That, assuredly, is the strongest government which\nthey rejoice in who obey it. Now, then, is your time, while the minds\nof all are bent on what is about to happen, to obtain an ascendency\nover them, either by punishment or by benefits._\u201d\nUpon this motion the senate resolved, in accordance with the advice\ngiven by the consul, to take the case of each city separately, and\neither destroy utterly or else treat with tenderness all the more\nimportant of the Latin towns. To those cities they dealt with\nleniently, they granted exemptions and privileges, conferring upon them\nthe rights of citizenship, and securing their welfare in every\nparticular. The others they razed to the ground, and planting colonies\nin their room, either removed the inhabitants to Rome, or so scattered\nand dispersed them that neither by arms nor by counsels was it ever\nagain in their power to inflict hurt. For, as I have said already, the\nRomans never, in matters of moment, resorted to half-measures. And the\nsentence which they then pronounced should be a pattern for all rulers,\nand ought to have been followed by the Florentines when, in the year\n1502, Arezzo and all the Val di Chiana rose in revolt. For had they\nfollowed it, they would have established their authority on a surer\nfooting, and added much to the greatness of their city by securing for\nit those lands which are needed to supply it with the necessaries of\nlife. But pursuing that half-hearted policy which is most mischievous\nin executing justice, some of the Aretines they outlawed, some they\ncondemned to death, and all they deprived of their dignities and\nancient importance in their town, while leaving the town itself\nuntouched. And if in the councils then held any Florentine recommended\nthat Arezzo should be dismantled, they who thought themselves wiser\nthan their fellows objected, that to do so would be little to the\nhonour of our republic, since it would look as though she lacked\nstrength to hold it. Reasons like this are of a sort which seem sound,\nbut are not really so; for, by the same rule, no parricide should be\nput to death, nor any other malefactor, however atrocious his crimes;\nbecause, forsooth, it would be discreditable to the ruler to appear\nunequal to the control of a single criminal. They who hold such\nopinions fail to see that when men individually, or entire cities\ncollectively, offend against the State, the prince for his own safety,\nand as a warning to others, has no alternative but to make an end of\nthem; and that true honour lies in being able and in knowing how to\nchastise such offenders, and not in incurring endless dangers in the\neffort to retain them. For the prince who does not chastise offenders\nin a way that puts it out of their power to offend again, is accounted\nunwise or worthless.\nHow necessary it was for the Romans to execute Justice against the\nLatins, is further seen from the course took with the men of Privernum.\nAnd here the text of Livius suggests two points for our attention:\nfirst, as already noted, that a subjugated people is either to be\ncaressed or crushed; and second, how much it is for our advantage to\nmaintain a manly bearing, and to speak the truth fearlessly in the\npresence of the wise. For the senate being met to determine the fate of\nthe citizens of Privernum, who after rebelling had been reduced to\nsubmission by the Roman arms, certain of these citizens were sent by\ntheir countrymen to plead for pardon. When these had come into the\npresence of the senate, one of them was asked by a senator, \u201c_What\npunishment he thought his fellow citizens deserved?_\u201d To which he of\nPrivernum answered, \u201c_Such punishment as they deserve who deem\nthemselves worthy of freedom._\u201d \u201c_But,_\u201d said the consul, \u201c_should we\nremit your punishment, what sort of peace can we hope to have with\nyou?_\u201d To which the other replied, \u201c_If granted on fair terms, a firm\nand lasting peace; if on unfair, a peace of brief duration._\u201d Upon\nthis, though many of the senators were displeased, the wiser among them\ndeclared \u201c_that they had heard the voice of freedom and manhood, and\nwould never believe that the man or people who so spoke ought to remain\nlonger than was needful in a position which gave them cause for shame;\nsince that was a safe peace which was accepted willingly; whereas good\nfaith could not be looked for where it was sought to impose\nservitude._\u201d So saying, they decided that the people of Privernum\nshould be admitted to Roman citizenship, with all the rights and\nprivileges thereto appertaining; declaring that \u201c_men whose only\nthought was for freedom, were indeed worthy to be Romans._\u201d So pleasing\nwas this true and high answer to generous minds, while any other must\nhave seemed at once false and shameful. And they who judge otherwise of\nmen, and of those men, especially, who have been used to be free, or so\nto think themselves, are mistaken; and are led through their mistake to\nadopt courses unprofitable for themselves and affording no content to\nothers. Whence, the frequent rebellions and the downfall of States.\nBut, returning to our subject, I conclude, as well from this instance\nof Privernum, as from the measures followed with the Latins, that when\nwe have to pass sentence upon powerful States accustomed to live in\nfreedom, we must either destroy them utterly, or else treat them with\nmuch indulgence; and that any other course we may take with them will\nbe unprofitable. But most carefully should we avoid, as of all courses\nthe most pernicious, such half-measures as were followed by the\nSamnites when they had the Romans shut up in the Caudine Forks, and\nwould not listen to the counsels of the old man who urged them either\nto send their captives away with every honourable attention, or else\nput them all to death; but adopted a middle course, and after disarming\nthem and making them pass under the yoke, suffered them to depart at\nonce disgraced and angered. And no long time after, they found to their\nsorrow that the old man\u2019s warning was true, and that the course they\nhad themselves chosen was calamitous; as shall, hereafter, in its place\nbe shown.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014_That, commonly, Fortresses do much more Harm than Good_\nTo the wise men of our day it may seem an oversight on the part of the\nRomans, that, when they sought to protect themselves against the men of\nLatium and Privernum, it never occurred to them to build strongholds in\ntheir cities to be a curb upon them, and insure their fidelity,\nespecially when we remember the Florentine saying which these same wise\nmen often quote, to the effect that Pisa and other like cities must be\nheld by fortresses Doubtless, had those old Romans been like-minded\nwith our modern sages, they would not have neglected to build\nthemselves fortresses, but because they far surpassed them in courage,\nsense, and vigour, they refrained. And while Rome retained her freedom,\nand adhered to her own wise ordinances and wholesome usages, she never\nbuilt a single fortress with the view to hold any city or province,\nthough, sometimes, she may have suffered those to stand which she found\nalready built.\nLooking, therefore, to the course followed by the Romans in this\nparticular, and to that adopted by our modern rulers, it seems proper\nto consider whether or not it is advisable to build fortresses, and\nwhether they are more likely to help or to hurt him who builds them In\nthe first place, then, we are to remember that fortresses are built\neither as a defence against foreign foes or against subjects In the\nformer case, I pronounce them unnecessary, in the latter mischievous.\nAnd to state the reasons why in the latter case they are mischievous, I\nsay that when princes or republics are afraid of their subjects and in\nfear lest they rebel, this must proceed from knowing that their\nsubjects hate them, which hatred in its turn results from their own ill\nconduct, and that again from their thinking themselves able to rule\ntheir subjects by mere force, or from their governing with little\nprudence. Now one of the causes which lead them to suppose that they\ncan rule by mere force, is this very circumstance of their people\nhaving these fortresses on their backs So that the conduct which breeds\nhatred is itself mainly occasioned by these princes or republics being\npossessed of fortresses, which, if this be true, are really far more\nhurtful than useful First, because, as has been said already, they\nrender a ruler bolder and more violent in his bearing towards his\nsubjects, and, next, because they do not in reality afford him that\nsecurity which he believes them to give For all those methods of\nviolence and coercion which may be used to keep a people under, resolve\nthemselves into two; since either like the Romans you must always have\nit in your power to bring a strong army into the field, or else you\nmust dissipate, destroy, and disunite the subject people, and so divide\nand scatter them that they can never again combine to injure you For\nshould you merely strip them of their wealth, _spoliatis arma\nsupersunt_, arms still remain to them, or if you deprive them of their\nweapons, _furor arma ministrat_, rage will supply them, if you put\ntheir chiefs to death and continue to maltreat the rest, heads will\nrenew themselves like those Hydra; while, if you build fortresses,\nthese may serve in time of peace to make you bolder in outraging your\nsubjects, but in time of war they will prove wholly useless, since they\nwill be attacked at once by foes both foreign and domestic, whom\ntogether it will be impossible for you to resist. And if ever\nfortresses were useless they are so at the present day, by reason of\nthe invention of artillery, against the fury of which, as I have shown\nalready, a petty fortress which affords no room for retreat behind\nfresh works, cannot be defended.\nBut to go deeper into the matter, I say, either you are a prince\nseeking by means of these fortresses to hold the people of your city in\ncheck; or you are a prince, or it may be a republic, desirous to\ncontrol some city which you have gained in war. To the prince I would\nsay, that, for the reasons already given, nothing can be more\nunserviceable than a fortress as a restraint upon your subjects, since\nit only makes you the readier to oppress them, and less scrupulous how\nyou do so; while it is this very oppression which moves them to destroy\nyou, and so kindles their hatred, that the fortress, which is the cause\nof all the mischief, is powerless to protect you. A wise and good\nprince, therefore, that he may continue good, and give no occasion or\nencouragement to his descendants to become evil, will never build a\nfortress, to the end that neither he nor they may ever be led to trust\nto it rather than to the good-will of their subjects. And if Francesco\nSforza, who was accounted a wise ruler, on becoming Duke of Milan\nerected a fortress in that city, I say that herein he was unwise, and\nthat the event has shown the building of this fortress to have been\nhurtful and not helpful to his heirs. For thinking that by its aid they\ncould behave as badly as they liked to their citizens and subjects, and\nyet be secure, they refrained from no sort of violence or oppression,\nuntil, becoming beyond measure odious, they lost their State as soon as\nan enemy attacked it. Nor was this fortress, which in peace had\noccasioned them much hurt, any defence or of any service them in war.\nFor had they being without it, through thoughtlessness, treated their\nsubjects inhumanely, they must soon have discovered and withdrawn from\ntheir danger; and might, thereafter, with no other help than that of\nattached subjects, have withstood the attacks of the French far more\nsuccessfully than they could with their fortress, but with subjects\nwhom they had estranged.\nAnd, in truth, fortresses are unserviceable in every way, since they\nmay be lost either by the treachery of those to whom you commit their\ndefence, or by the overwhelming strength of an assailant, or else by\nfamine. And where you seek to recover a State which you have lost, and\nin which only the fortress remains to you, if that fortress is to be of\nany service or assistance to you, you must have an army wherewith to\nattack the enemy who has driven you out. But with such an army you\nmight succeed in recovering your State as readily without a fortress as\nwith one; nay, perhaps, even more readily, since your subjects, had you\nnot used them ill, from the overweening confidence your fortress gave\nyou, might then have felt better disposed towards you. And the event\nshows that in times of adversity this very fortress of Milan has been\nof no advantage whatever, either to the Sforzas or to the French; but,\non the contrary, has brought ruin on both, because, trusting to it,\nthey did not turn their thoughts to nobler methods for preserving that\nState. Guido Ubaldo, duke of Urbino and son to Duke Federigo, who in\nhis day was a warrior of much renown, but who was driven from his\ndominions by Cesare Borgia, son to Pope Alexander VI., when afterwards,\nby a sudden stroke of good fortune, he was restored to the dukedom\ncaused all the fortresses of the country to be dismantled, judging them\nto be hurtful. For as he was beloved by his subjects, so far as they\nwere concerned he had no need for fortresses; while, as against foreign\nenemies, he saw he could not defend them, since this would have\nrequired an army kept constantly in the field. For which reasons he\nmade them be razed to the ground.\nWhen Pope Julius II. had driven the Bentivogli from Bologna, after\nerecting a citadel in that town, he caused the people to be cruelly\noppressed by his governor; whereupon, the people rebelled, and he\nforthwith lost the citadel; so that his citadel, and the oppressions to\nwhich it led, were of less service to him than different behaviour on\nhis part had been. When Niccolo da Castello, the ancestor of the\nVitelli, returned to his country out of exile, he straightway pulled\ndown the two fortresses built there by Pope Sixtus IV., perceiving that\nit was not by fortresses, but by the good-will of the people, that he\ncould be maintained in his government.\nBut the most recent, and in all respects most noteworthy instance, and\nthat which best demonstrates the futility of building, and the\nadvantage of destroying fortresses, is what happened only the other day\nin Genoa. Every one knows how, in 1507, Genoa rose in rebellion against\nLouis XII. of France, who came in person and with all his forces to\nrecover it; and after recovering it built there a citadel stronger than\nany before known, being, both from its position and from every other\ncircumstance, most inaccessible to attack. For standing on the\nextremity of a hill, named by the Genoese Codefa, which juts out into\nthe sea, it commanded the whole harbour and the greater part of the\ntown. But, afterwards, in the year 1512, when the French were driven\nout of Italy, the Genoese, in spite of this citadel, again rebelled,\nand Ottaviano Fregoso assuming the government, after the greatest\nefforts, continued over a period of sixteen months, at last succeeded\nin reducing the citadel by famine. By all it was believed that he would\nretain it as a rock of refuge in case of any reverse of fortune, and by\nsome he was advised to do so; but he, being a truly wise ruler, and\nknowing well that it is by the attachment of their subjects and not by\nthe strength of their fortifications that princes are maintained in\ntheir governments, dismantled this citadel; and founding his authority,\nnot upon material defences, but on his own valour and prudence, kept\nand still keeps it. And whereas, formerly, a force of a thousand\nfoot-soldiers could effect a change in the government of Genoa, the\nenemies of Ottaviano have assailed him with ten thousand, without being\nable to harm him.\nHere, then, we see that, while to dismantle this fortress occasioned\nOttaviano no loss, its construction gave the French king no sort of\nadvantage. For when he could come into Italy with an army, he could\nrecover Genoa, though he had no citadel there; but when he could not\ncome with an army, it was not in his power to hold the city by means of\nthe citadel. Moreover it was costly for the king to build, and shameful\nfor him to lose this fortress; while for Ottaviano it was glorious to\ntake, and advantageous to destroy it.\nLet us turn now to those republics which build fortresses not within\ntheir own territories, but in towns whereof they have taken possession.\nAnd if the above example of France and Genoa suffice not to show the\nfutility of this course, that of Florence and Pisa ought, I think, to\nbe conclusive. For in erecting fortresses to hold Pisa, the Florentines\nfailed to perceive that a city which had always been openly hostile to\nthem, which had lived in freedom, and which could cloak rebellion under\nthe name of liberty, must, if it were to be retained at all, be\nretained by those methods which were used by the Romans, and either be\nmade a companion or be destroyed. Of how little service these Pisan\nfortresses were, was seen on the coming of Charles VIII. of France into\nItaly, to whom, whether through the treachery of their defenders or\nfrom fear of worse evils, they were at once delivered up; whereas, had\nthere been no fortresses in Pisa, the Florentines would not have looked\nto them as the means whereby the town was to be held; the king could\nnot by their assistance have taken the town from the Florentines; and\nthe methods whereby it had previously been preserved might, in all\nlikelihood, have continued sufficient to preserve it; and, at any rate,\nhad served that end no worse than the fortresses.\nThese, then, are the conclusions to which I come, namely, that\nfortresses built to hold your own country under are hurtful, and that\nthose built to retain acquired territories are useless; and I am\ncontent to rely on the example of the Romans, who in the towns they\nsought to hold by the strong hand, rather pulled down fortresses than\nbuilt them. And if any, to controvert these views of mine, were to cite\nthe case of Tarentum in ancient times, or of Brescia in recent, as\ntowns which when they rebelled were recovered by means of their\ncitadels; I answer, that for the recovery of Tarentum, Fabius Maximus\nwas sent at the end of a year with an army strong enough to retake it\neven had there been no fortress there; and that although he availed\nhimself of the fortress for the recovery of the town, he might, without\nit, have resorted to other means which would have brought about the\nsame result. Nor do I see of what service a citadel can be said to be,\nwhen to recover the city you must employ a consular army under a Fabius\nMaximus. But that the Romans would, in any case, have recovered\nTarentum, is plain from what happened at Capua, where there was no\ncitadel, and which they retook, simply by the valour of their soldiers.\nAgain, as regards Brescia, I say that the circumstances attending the\nrevolt of that town were such as occur but seldom, namely, that the\ncitadel remaining in your hands after the defection of the city, you\nshould happen to have a great army nigh at hand, as the French had\ntheirs on this occasion. For M. de Foix being in command of the king\u2019s\nforces at Bologna, on hearing of the loss of Brescia, marched thither\nwithout an hour\u2019s delay, and reaching Brescia in three days, retook the\ntown with the help of the citadel. But here, again, we see that, to be\nof any service, the citadel of Brescia had to be succoured by a de\nFoix, and by that French army which in three days\u2019 time marched to its\nrelief. So that this instance cannot be considered conclusive as\nagainst others of a contrary tendency. For, in the course of recent\nwars, many fortresses have been taken and retaken, with the same\nvariety of fortune with which open country has been acquired or lost;\nand this not only in Lombardy, but also in Romagna, in the kingdom of\nNaples, and in all parts of Italy.\nAnd, further, touching the erection of fortresses as a defence against\nforeign enemies, I say that such defences are not needed by the prince\nor people who possess a good army; while for those who do not possess a\ngood army, they are useless. For good armies without fortresses are in\nthemselves a sufficient defence: whereas, fortresses without good\narmies avail nothing. And this we see in the case of those nations\nwhich have been thought to excel both in their government and\notherwise, as, for instance, the Romans and the Spartans. For while the\nRomans would build no fortresses, the Spartans not merely abstained\nfrom building them, but would not even suffer their cities to be\nenclosed with walls; desiring to be protected by their own valour only,\nand by no other defence. So that when a Spartan was asked by an\nAthenian what he thought of the walls of Athens, he answered \u201cthat they\nwere fine walls if meant to hold women only.\u201d\nIf a prince who has a good army has likewise, on the sea-front of his\ndominions, some fortress strong enough to keep an enemy in check for a\nfew days, until he gets his forces together, this, though not\nnecessary, may sometimes be for his advantage. But for a prince who is\nwithout a strong army to have fortresses erected throughout his\nterritories, or upon his frontier, is either useless or hurtful, since\nthey may readily be lost and then turned against him; or, supposing\nthem so strong that the enemy is unable to take them by assault, he may\nleave them behind, and so render them wholly unprofitable. For a brave\narmy, unless stoutly met, enters an enemy\u2019s country without regard to\nthe towns or fortified places it leaves in its rear, as we read of\nhappening in ancient times, and have seen done by Francesco Maria della\nRovere, who no long while ago, when he marched against Urbino, made\nlittle of leaving ten hostile cities behind him.\nThe prince, therefore, who can bring together a strong army can do\nwithout building fortresses, while he who has not a strong army ought\nnot to build them, but should carefully strengthen the city wherein he\ndwells, and keep it well stored with supplies, and its inhabitants well\naffected, so that he may resist attack till an accord be agreed on, or\nhe be relieved by foreign aid. All other expedients are costly in time\nof peace, and in war useless.\nWhoever carefully weighs all that has now been said will perceive, that\nthe Romans, as they were most prudent in all their other methods, so\nalso showed their wisdom in the measures they took with the men of\nLatium and Privernum, when, without ever thinking of fortresses, they\nsought security in bolder and more sagacious courses.\nCHAPTER XXV.\u2014_That he who attacks a City divided against itself, must\nnot think to get possession of it through its Divisions._\nViolent dissensions breaking out in Rome between the commons and the\nnobles, it appeared to the Veientines and Etruscans that now was their\ntime to deal a fatal blow to the Roman supremacy. Accordingly, they\nassembled an army and invaded the territories of Rome. The senate sent\nCaius Manlius and Marcus Fabius to meet them, whose forces encamping\nclose by the Veientines, the latter ceased not to reproach and vilify\nthe Roman name with every sort of taunt and abuse, and so incensed the\nRomans by their unmeasured insolence that, from being divided they\nbecame reconciled, and giving the enemy battle, broke and defeated\nthem. Here, again, we see, what has already been noted, how prone men\nare to adopt wrong courses, and how often they miss their object when\nthey think to secure it. The Veientines imagined that they could\nconquer the Romans by attacking them while they were at feud among\nthemselves; but this very attack reunited the Romans and brought ruin\non their assailants. For the causes of division in a commonwealth are,\nfor the most part, ease and tranquillity, while the causes of union are\nfear and war. Wherefore, had the Veientines been wise, the more divided\nthey saw Rome to be, the more should they have sought to avoid war with\nher, and endeavoured to gain an advantage over her by peaceful arts.\nAnd the best way to effect this in a divided city lies in gaining the\nconfidence of both factions, and in mediating between them as arbiter\nso long as they do not come to blows; but when they resort to open\nviolence, then to render some tardy aid to the weaker side, so as to\nplunge them deeper in hostilities, wherein both may exhaust their\nforces without being led by your putting forth an excess of strength to\nsuspect you of a desire to ruin them and remain their master. Where\nthis is well managed, it will almost always happen that you succeed in\neffecting the object you propose to yourself.\nThe city of Pistoja, as I have said already in connection with another\nmatter, was won over to the Florentine republic by no other artifice\nthan this. For the town being split by factions, the Florentines, by\nnow favouring one side and now the other, without incurring the\nsuspicions of either, brought both to such extremities that, wearied\nout with their harassed life, they threw themselves at last of their\nown accord into the arms of Florence. The city of Siena, again, has\nnever made any change in her government which has had the support of\nthe Florentines, save when that support has been slight and\ninsignificant; for whenever the interference of Florence has been\nmarked and decided, it has had the effect of uniting all parties in\nsupport of things as they stood.\nOne other instance I shall add to those already given. Oftener than\nonce Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan, relying on their divisions, set\nwars on foot against the Florentines, and always without success; so\nthat, in lamenting over these failures, he was wont to complain that\nthe mad humours of the Florentines had cost him two millions of gold,\nwithout his having anything to show for it. The Veientines and\nEtruscans, therefore, as I have said already, were misled by false\nhopes, and in the end were routed by the Romans in a single pitched\nbattle; and any who should look hereafter to prevail on like grounds\nand by similar means against a divided people, will always find\nthemselves deceived.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\u2014_That Taunts and Abuse breed Hatred against him who uses\nthem, without yielding him any Advantage._\nTo abstain from threats and injurious language, is, methinks, one of\nthe wisest precautions a man can use. For abuse and menace take nothing\nfrom the strength of an adversary; the latter only making him more\ncautious, while the former inflames his hatred against you, and leads\nhim to consider more diligently how he may cause you hurt.\nThis is seen from the example of the Veientines, of whom I spoke in the\nlast Chapter, who, to the injury of war against the Romans, added those\nverbal injuries from which all prudent commanders should compel their\nsoldiers to refrain. For these are injuries which stir and kindle your\nenemy to vengeance, and yet, as has been said, in no way disable him\nfrom doing you hurt; so that, in truth, they are weapons which wound\nthose who use them. Of this we find a notable instance in Asia, in\nconnection with the siege of Amida. For Gabade, the Persian general,\nafter besieging this town for a great while, wearied out at last by its\nprotracted defence, determined on withdrawing his army; and had\nactually begun to strike his camp, when the whole inhabitants of the\nplace, elated by their success, came out upon the walls to taunt and\nupbraid their enemies with their cowardice and meanness of spirit, and\nto load them with every kind of abuse. Stung by these insults, Gabade,\nchanging his resolution, renewed the siege with such fury that in a few\ndays he stormed and sacked the town. And the very same thing befell the\nVeientines, who, not content, as we have seen, to make war on the\nRomans with arms, must needs assail them with foul reproaches,\nadvancing to the palisade of their camp to revile them, and molesting\nthem more with their tongues than with their swords, until the Roman\nsoldiers, who at first were most unwilling to fight, forced the consuls\nto lead them to the attack. Whereupon, the Veientines, like those\nothers of whom mention has just now been made, had to pay the penalty\nof their insolence.\nWise captains of armies, therefore, and prudent governors of cities,\nshould take all fit precautions to prevent such insults and reproaches\nfrom being used by their soldiers and subjects, either amongst\nthemselves or against an enemy. For when directed against an enemy they\nlead to the mischiefs above noticed, while still worse consequences may\nfollow from our not preventing them among ourselves by such measures as\nsensible rulers have always taken for that purpose.\nThe legions who were left behind for the protection of Capua having, as\nshall in its place be told, conspired against the Capuans, their\nconspiracy led to a mutiny, which was presently suppressed by Valerius\nCorvinus; when, as one of the conditions on which the mutineers made\ntheir submission, it was declared that whosoever should thereafter\nupbraid any soldier of these legions with having taken part in this\nmutiny, should be visited with the severest punishment. So likewise,\nwhen Tiberius Gracchus was appointed, during the war with Hannibal, to\ncommand a body of slaves, whom the Romans in their straits for soldiers\nhad furnished with arms, one of his first acts was to pass an order\nmaking it death for any to reproach his men with their servile origin.\nSo mischievous a thing did the Romans esteem it to use insulting words\nto others, or to taunt them with their shame. Whether this be done in\nsport or earnest, nothing vexes men more, or rouses them to fiercer\nindignation; \u201c_for the biting jest which flavours too much of truth,\nleaves always behind it a rankling memory._\u201d[9]\n[9] Nam faceti\u00e6 asper\u00e6, quando nimium ex vero traxere, acrem sui\nmemoriam relinquunt. _Tacit. An._ xv. 68.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\u2014_That prudent Princes and Republics should be content to\nhave obtained a Victory; for, commonly, when they are not,\ntheft-Victory turns to Defeat._\nThe use of dishonouring language towards an enemy is mostly caused by\nan insolent humour, bred by victory or the false hope of it, whereby\nmen are oftentimes led not only to speak, but also to act amiss. For\nsuch false hopes, when they gain an entry into men\u2019s minds, cause them\nto overrun their goal, and to miss opportunities for securing a certain\ngood, on the chance of obtaining some thing better, but uncertain. And\nthis, being a matter that deserves attention, because in deceiving\nthemselves men often injure their country, I desire to illustrate it by\nparticular instances, ancient and recent, since mere argument might not\nplace it in so clear a light.\nAfter routing the Romans at Cann\u00e6, Hannibal sent messengers to Carthage\nto announce his victory, and to ask support. A debate arising in the\nCarthaginian senate as to what was to be done, Hanno, an aged and wise\ncitizen, advised that they should prudently take advantage of their\nvictory to make peace with the Romans, while as conquerors they might\nhave it on favourable terms, and not wait to make it after a defeat;\nsince it should be their object to show the Romans that they were\nstrong enough to fight them, but not to peril the victory they had won\nin the hope of winning a greater. This advice was not followed by the\nCarthaginian senate, but its wisdom was well seen later, when the\nopportunity to act upon it was gone.\nWhen the whole East had been overrun by Alexander of Macedon, the\ncitizens of Tyre (then at the height of its renown, and very strong\nfrom being built, like Venice, in the sea), recognizing his greatness,\nsent ambassadors to him to say that they desired to be his good\nservants, and to yield him all obedience, yet could not consent to\nreceive either him or his soldiers within their walls. Whereupon,\nAlexander, displeased that a single city should venture to close its\ngates against him to whom all the rest of the world had thrown theirs\nopen, repulsed the Tyrians, and rejecting their overtures set to work\nto besiege their town. But as it stood on the water, and was well\nstored with victual and all other munitions needed for its defence,\nafter four months had gone, Alexander, perceiving that he was wasting\nmore time in an inglorious attempt to reduce this one city than had\nsufficed for most of his other conquests, resolved to offer terms to\nthe Tyrians, and to make them those concessions which they themselves\nhad asked. But they, puffed up by their success, not merely refused the\nterms offered, but put to death the envoy sent to propose them. Enraged\nby this, Alexander renewed the siege, and with such vigour, that he\ntook and destroyed the city, and either slew or made slaves of its\ninhabitants.\nIn the year 1512, a Spanish army entered the Florentine territory, with\nthe object of restoring the Medici to Florence, and of levying a\nsubsidy from the town; having been summoned thither by certain of the\ncitizens, who had promised them that so soon as they appeared within\nthe Florentine confines they would arm in their behalf. But when the\nSpaniards had come into the plain of the Arno, and none declared in\ntheir favour, being in sore need of supplies, they offered to make\nterms. This offer the people of Florence in their pride rejected, and\nso gave occasion for the sack of Prato and the overthrow of the\nFlorentine Republic.\nA prince, therefore, who is attacked by an enemy much more powerful\nthan himself, can make no greater mistake than to refuse to treat,\nespecially when overtures are made to him; for however poor the terms\noffered may be, they are sure to contain some conditions advantageous\nfor him who accepts them, and which he may construe as a partial\nsuccess. For which reason it ought to have been enough for the citizens\nof Tyre that Alexander was brought to accept terms which he had at\nfirst rejected; and they should have esteemed it a sufficient triumph\nthat, by their resistance in arms, they had forced so great a warrior\nto bow to their will. And, in like manner, it should have been a\nsufficient victory for the Florentines that the Spaniards had in part\nyielded to their wishes, and abated something of their own demands, the\npurport of which was to change the government of Florence, to sever her\nfrom her allegiance to France, and, further, to obtain money from her.\nFor if of these three objects the Spaniards had succeeded in securing\nthe last two, while the Florentines maintained the integrity of their\ngovernment, a fair share of honour and contentment would have fallen to\neach. And while preserving their political existence, the Florentines\nshould have made small account of the other two conditions; nor ought\nthey, even with the possibility and almost certainty of greater\nadvantages before them, to have left matters in any degree to the\narbitration of Fortune, by pushing things to extremes, and incurring\nrisks which no prudent man should incur, unless compelled by necessity.\nHannibal, when recalled by the Carthaginians from Italy, where for\nsixteen years he had covered himself with glory, to the defence of his\nnative country, found on his arrival that Hasdrubal and Syphax had been\ndefeated, the kingdom of Numidia lost, and Carthage confined within the\nlimits of her walls, and left without other resource save in him and\nhis army. Perceiving, therefore, that this was the last stake his\ncountry had to play, and not choosing to hazard it until he had tried\nevery other expedient, he felt no shame to sue for peace, judging that\nin peace rather than in war lay the best hope of safety for his\ncountry. But, when peace was refused him, no fear of defeat deterred\nhim from battle, being resolved either to conquer, if conquer he might,\nor if he must fall, to fall gloriously. Now, if a commander so valiant\nas Hannibal, at the head of an unconquered army, was willing to sue for\npeace rather than appeal to battle when he saw that by defeat his\ncountry must be enslaved, what course ought to be followed by another\ncommander, less valiant and with less experience than he? But men\nlabour under this infirmity, that they know not where to set bounds to\ntheir hopes, and building on these without otherwise measuring their\nstrength, rush headlong on destruction.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\u2014_That to neglect the redress of Grievances, whether\npublic or private, is dangerous for a Prince or Commonwealth_.\nCertain Gauls coming to attack Etruria, and more particularly Clusium\nits chief city, the citizens of Clusium sought aid from Rome; whereupon\nthe Romans sent the three Fabii, as envoys to these Gauls, to notify to\nthem, in the name of the Roman people, that they must refrain from\nmaking war on the Etruscans. From what befell the Romans in connection\nwith this embassy, we see clearly how far men may be carried in\nresenting an affront. For these envoys arriving at the very moment when\nthe Gauls and Etruscans were about to join battle, being readier at\ndeeds than words, took part with the Etruscans and fought in their\nforemost ranks. Whence it came that the Gauls recognizing the Roman\nenvoys, turned against the Romans all the hatred which before they had\nfelt for the Etruscans; and grew still more incensed when on making\ncomplaint to the Roman senate, through their ambassador, of the wrong\ndone them, and demanding that the Fabii should be given up to them in\natonement for their offence, not merely were the offenders not given up\nor punished in any way, but, on the contrary, when the comitia met were\ncreated tribunes with consular powers. But when the Gauls found these\nmen honoured who deserved to be chastised, they concluded that what had\nhappened had been done by way of slight and insult to them, and,\nburning with fury and resentment, hastened forward to attack Rome,\nwhich they took with the exception of the Capitol.\nNow this disaster overtook the Romans entirely from their disregard of\njustice. For their envoys, who had violated the law of nations, and had\ntherefore deserved punishment, they had on the contrary treated with\nhonour. And this should make us reflect, how carefully all princes and\ncommonwealths ought to refrain from committing like wrongs, not only\nagainst communities, but also against particular men. For if a man be\ndeeply wronged, either by a private hand or by a public officer, and be\nnot avenged to his satisfaction, if he live in a republic, he will seek\nto avenge himself, though in doing so he bring ruin on his country; or\nif he live under a prince, and be of a resolute and haughty spirit, he\nwill never rest until he has wreaked his resentment against the prince,\nthough he knows it may cost him dear. Whereof we have no finer or truer\nexample than in the death of Philip of Macedon, the father of\nAlexander. For Pausanias, a handsome and high-born youth belonging to\nPhilip\u2019s court, having been most foully and cruelly dishonoured by\nAttalus, one of the foremost men of the royal household, repeatedly\ncomplained to Philip of the outrage; who for a while put him off with\npromises of vengeance, but in the end, so far from avenging him,\npromoted Attalus to be governor of the province of Greece. Whereupon,\nPausanias, seeing his enemy honoured and not punished, turned all his\nresentment from him who had outraged, against him who had not avenged\nhim, and on the morning of the day fixed for the marriage of Philip\u2019s\ndaughter to Alexander of Epirus, while Philip walked between the two\nAlexanders, his son and his son-in-law, towards the temple to celebrate\nthe nuptials, he slew him.\nThis instance nearly resembles that of the Roman envoys; and offers a\nwarning to all rulers never to think so lightly of any man as to\nsuppose, that when wrong upon wrong has been done him, he will not\nbethink himself of revenge, however great the danger he runs, or the\npunishment he thereby brings upon himself.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\u2014_That Fortune obscures the minds of Men when she would\nnot have them hinder her Designs._\nIf we note well the course of human affairs, we shall often find things\ncome about and accidents befall, against which it seems to be the will\nof Heaven that men should not provide. And if this were the case even\nin Rome, so renowned for her valour, religion, and wise ordinances, we\nneed not wonder if it be far more common in other cities and provinces\nwherein these safeguards are wanting.\nHaving here a notable opportunity to show how Heaven influences men\u2019s\nactions, Titus Livius turns it to account, and treats the subject at\nlarge and in pregnant words, where he says, that since it was Heaven\u2019s\nwill, for ends of its own, that the Romans should feel its power, it\nfirst of all caused these Fabii, who were sent as envoys to the Gauls,\nto act amiss, and then by their misconduct stirred up the Gauls to make\nwar on Rome; and, lastly, so ordered matters that nothing worthy of\ntheir name was done by the Romans to withstand their attack. For it was\nfore-ordained by Heaven that Camillus, who alone could supply the\nremedy to so mighty an evil, should be banished to Ardea; and again,\nthat the citizens, who had often created a dictator to meet attacks of\nthe Volscians and other neighbouring hostile nations, should fail to do\nso when the Gauls were marching upon Rome. Moreover, the army which the\nRomans got together was but a weak one, since they used no signal\neffort to make it strong; nay, were so dilatory in arming that they\nwere barely in time to meet the enemy at the river Allia, though no\nmore than ten miles distant from Rome. Here, again, the Roman tribunes\npitched their camp without observing any of the usual precautions,\nattending neither to the choice of ground, nor to surround themselves\nwith trench or Palisade, nor to avail themselves of any other aid,\nhuman or Divine. In ordering their army for battle, moreover, disposed\nit in weak columns, and these far apart: so that neither men nor\nofficers accomplished anything worthy of the Roman discipline. The\nbattle was bloodless for the Romans fled before they were attacked;\nmost of them retreating to Veii, the rest to Rome, where, without\nturning aside to visit their homes, they made straight for the Capitol.\nMeanwhile, the senate, so far from bethinking themselves how they might\ndefend the city, did not even attend to closing the gates; and while\nsome of them made their escape from Rome, others entered the Capitol\nalong with those who sought shelter there. It was only in the defence\nof the Capitol that any method was observed, measures being taken to\nprevent it being crowded with useless numbers, and all the victual\nwhich could be got, being brought into it to enable it to stand a\nsiege. Of the women, the children, and the men whose years unfitted\nthem for service, the most part fled for refuge to the neighbouring\ntowns, the rest remained in Rome a prey to the invaders; so that no one\nwho had heard of the achievements of the Romans in past years, on being\ntold of what took place on this occasion, could have believed that it\nwas of the same people that things so contrary were related.\nWherefore, Titus Livius, after setting forth all these disorders,\nconcludes with the words, \u201c_So far does Fortune darken men\u2019s minds when\nshe would not have her ascendency gainsaid._\u201d Nor could any juster\nobservation be made. And hence it is that those who experience the\nextremes whether of good or of evil fortune, are, commonly, little\ndeserving either of praise or blame; since it is apparent that it is\nfrom Heaven having afforded them, or denied them opportunities for\nacting worthily, that they have been brought to their greatness or to\ntheir undoing. Fortune, doubtless, when she seeks to effect great ends,\nwill often choose as her instrument a man of such sense and worth that\nhe can recognize the opportunities which she holds out to him; and, in\nlike manner, when she desires to bring about great calamities, will put\nforward such men as will of themselves contribute to that result. And\nall who stand in her way, she either removes by death, or deprives of\nthe means of effecting good. And it is well seen in the passage we are\nconsidering, how Fortune, to aggrandize Rome, and raise her to the\nheight she reached, judged it necessary, as shall be more fully shown\nin the following Book, to humble her; yet would not have her utterly\nundone. For which reason we find her causing Camillus to be banished,\nbut not put to death; suffering Rome to be taken, but not the Capitol;\nand bringing it to pass that, while the Romans took no wise precaution\nfor the defence of their city, they neglected none in defending their\ncitadel. That Rome might be taken, Fortune caused the mass of the army,\nafter the rout at the Allia, to direct its flight to Veii, thus\nwithdrawing the means wherewith the city might have been defended; but\nwhile thus disposing matters, she at the same time prepared all the\nneedful steps for its recovery, in bringing an almost entire Roman\narray to Veii, and Camillus to Ardea, so that a great force might be\nassembled for the rescue of their country, under a captain in no way\ncompromised by previous reverses, but, on the contrary, in the\nenjoyment of an untarnished renown. I might cite many modern instances\nto confirm these opinions, but since enough has been said to convince\nany fair mind, I pass them over. But once more I repeat what, from all\nhistory, may be seen to be most true, that men may aid Fortune, but not\nwithstand her; may interweave their threads with her web, but cannot\nbreak it But, for all that, they must never lose heart, since not\nknowing what their end is to be, and moving towards it by cross-roads\nand untravelled paths, they have always room for hope, and ought never\nto abandon it, whatsoever befalls, and into whatsoever straits they\ncome.\nCHAPTER XXX.\u2014_That really powerful Princes and, Commonwealths do not\nbuy Friendships with Money, but with their Valour and the Fame of their\nProwess_.\nWhen besieged in the Capitol, the Romans although expecting succour\nfrom Veii and from Camillus, nevertheless, being straitened by famine,\nentered into an agreement to buy off the Gauls with gold But at the\nvery moment when, in pursuance of this agreement, the gold was being\nweighed out, Camillus came up with his army. This, says our historian,\nwas contrived by Fortune, \u201c_that the Romans might not live thereafter\nas men ransomed for a price,_\u201d and the matter is noteworthy, not only\nwith reference to this particular occasion, but also as it bears on the\nmethods generally followed by this republic. For we never find Rome\nseeking to acquire towns, or to purchase peace with money, but always\nconfiding in her own warlike valour, which could not, I believe, be\nsaid of any other republic.\nNow, one of the tests whereby to gauge the strength of any State, is to\nobserve on what terms it lives with its neighbours: for when it so\ncarries itself that, to secure its friendship, its neighbours pay it\ntribute, this is a sure sign of its strength, but when its neighbours,\nthough of less reputation, receive payments from it, this is a clear\nproof of its weakness In the course of the Roman history we read how\nthe Massilians, the Eduans, the Rhodians, Hiero of Syracuse, the Kings\nEumenes and Massinissa, all of them neighbours to the Roman frontiers,\nin order to secure the friendship of Rome, submitted to imposts and\ntribute whenever Rome had need of them, asking no return save her\nprotection. But with a weak State we find the reverse of all this\nhappening And, to begin with our own republic of Florence, we know that\nin times past, when she was at the height of her renown, there was\nnever a lordling of Romagna who had not a subsidy from her, to say\nnothing of what she paid to the Perugians, to the Castellans, and to\nall her other neighbours But had our city been armed and strong, the\ndirect contrary would have been the case, for, to obtain her\nprotection, all would have poured money into her lap, not seeking to\nsell their friendship but to purchase hers.\nNor are the Florentines the only people who have lived on this\ndishonourable footing The Venetians have done the same, nay, the King\nof France himself, for all his great dominions, lives tributary to the\nSwiss and to the King of England; and this because the French king and\nthe others named, with a view to escape dangers rather imaginary than\nreal, have disarmed their subjects; seeking to reap a present gain by\nwringing money from them, rather than follow a course which would\nsecure their own safety and the lasting welfare of their country. Which\nill-practices of theirs, though they quiet things for a time, must in\nthe end exhaust their resources, and give rise in seasons of danger to\nincurable mischief and disorder. It would be tedious to count up how\noften in the course of their wars, the Florentines, the Venetians, and\nthe kingdom of France have had to ransom themselves from their enemies,\nand to submit to an ignominy to which, once only, the Romans were very\nnear being subjected. It would be tedious, too, to recite how many\ntowns have been bought by the Florentines and by the Venetians, which,\nafterwards, have only been a trouble to them, from their not knowing\nhow to defend with iron what they had won with gold. While the Romans\ncontinued free they adhered to this more generous and noble method, but\nwhen they came under the emperors, and these, again, began to\ndeteriorate, and to love the shade rather than the sunshine, they also\ntook to purchasing peace, now from the Parthians, now from the Germans,\nand at other times from other neighbouring nations. And this was the\nbeginning of the decline of their great empire.\nSuch are the evils that befall when you withhold arms from your\nsubjects; and this course is attended by the still greater\ndisadvantage, that the closer an enemy presses you the weaker he finds\nyou. For any one who follows the evil methods of which I speak, must,\nin order to support troops whom he thinks can be trusted to keep off\nhis enemies, be very exacting in his dealings with those of his\nsubjects who dwell in the heart of his dominions; since, to widen the\ninterval between himself and his enemies, he must subsidize those\nprinces and peoples who adjoin his frontiers. States maintained on this\nfooting may make a little resistance on their confines; but when these\nare passed by the enemy no further defence remains. Those who pursue\nsuch methods as these seem not to perceive that they are opposed to\nreason and common sense. For the heart and vital parts of the body, not\nthe extremities, are those which we should keep guarded, since we may\nlive on without the latter, but must die if the former be hurt. But the\nStates of which I speak, leaving the heart undefended, defend only the\nhands and feet. The mischief which has thus been, and is at this day\nwrought in Florence is plain enough to see. For so soon as an enemy\npenetrates within her frontiers, and approaches her heart, all is over\nwith her. And the same was witnessed a few years ago in the case of the\nVenetians, whose city, had it not been girdled by the sea, must then\nhave found its end. In France, indeed, a like result has not been seen\nso often, she being so great a kingdom as to have few enemies mightier\nthan herself. Nevertheless, when the English invaded France in the year\n1513, the whole kingdom tottered; and the King himself, as well as\nevery one else, had to own that a single defeat might have cost him his\ndominions.\nBut with the Romans the reverse of all this took place. For the nearer\nan enemy approached Rome, the more completely he found her armed for\nresistance; and accordingly we see that on the occasion of Hannibal\u2019s\ninvasion of Italy, the Romans, after three defeats, and after the\nslaughter of so many of their captains and soldiers, were still able,\nnot merely to withstand the invader, but even, in the end, to come off\nvictorious. This we may ascribe to the heart being well guarded, while\nthe extremities were but little heeded. For the strength of Rome rested\non the Roman people themselves, on the Latin league, on the confederate\ntowns of Italy, and on her colonies, from all of which sources she drew\nso numerous an army, as enabled her to subdue the whole world and to\nkeep it in subjection.\nThe truth of what I say may be further seen from the question put by\nHanno the Carthaginian to the messengers sent to Carthage by Hannibal\nafter his victory at Cann\u00e6. For when these were vaunting the\nachievements of Hannibal, they were asked by Hanno whether any one had\ncome forward on behalf of the Romans to propose terms of peace, and\nwhether any town of the Latin league or of the colonized districts had\nrevolted from the Romans. And when to both inquiries the envoys\nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d Hanno observed that the war was no nearer an end than\non the day it was begun.\nWe can understand, therefore, as well from what has now been said, as\nfrom what I have often said before, how great a difference there is\nbetween the methods followed by the republics of the present times, and\nthose followed by the republics of antiquity; and why it is that we see\nevery day astounding losses alternate with extraordinary gains. For\nwhere men are weak, Fortune shows herself strong; and because she\nchanges, States and Governments change with her; and will continue to\nchange, until some one arise, who, following reverently the example of\nthe ancients, shall so control her, that she shall not have opportunity\nwith every revolution of the sun to display anew the greatness of her\npower.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\u2014_Of the Danger of trusting banished Men._\nThe danger of trusting those who are in exile from their own country,\nbeing one to which the rulers of States are often exposed, may, I\nthink, be fitly considered in these Discourses; and I notice it the\nmore willingly, because I am able to illustrate it by a memorable\ninstance which Titus Livius, though with another purpose, relates in\nhis history. When Alexander the Great passed with his army into Asia,\nhis brother-in-law and uncle, Alexander of Epirus, came with another\narmy into Italy, being invited thither by the banished Lucanians, who\ngave him to believe that, with their aid, he might get possession of\nthe whole of that country. But when, confiding in the promises of these\nexiles, and fed by the hopes they held out to him, he came into Italy,\nthey put him to death, their fellow-citizens having offered to restore\nthem to their country upon this condition. It behoves us, therefore, to\nremember how empty are the promises, and how doubtful the faith, of men\nin banishment from their native land. For as to their faith, it may be\nassumed that whenever they can effect their return by other means than\nyours, notwithstanding any covenants they may have made with you, they\nwill throw you over, and take part with their countrymen. And as for\nthe empty promises and delusive hopes which they set before you, so\nextreme is their desire to return home that they naturally believe many\nthings which are untrue, and designedly misrepresent many others; so\nthat between their beliefs and what they say they believe, they fill\nyou with false impressions, on which if you build, your labour is in\nvain, and you are led to engage in enterprises from which nothing but\nruin can result.\nTo this instance of Alexander I shall add only one other, that, namely,\nof Themistocles the Athenian, who, being proclaimed a traitor, fled\ninto Asia to Darius, to whom he made such lavish promises if he would\nonly attack Greece, that he induced him to undertake the enterprise.\nBut afterwards, when he could not fulfil what he had promised, either\nfrom shame, or through fear of punishment, he poisoned himself. But, if\nsuch a mistake as this was made by a man like Themistocles, we may\nreckon that mistakes still greater will be made by those who, being of\na feebler nature, suffer themselves to be more completely swayed by\ntheir feelings and wishes Wherefore, let a prince be careful how he\nembarks in any enterprise on the representations of an exile; for\notherwise, he is likely either to be put to shame, or to incur the\ngravest calamities.\nBecause towns are sometimes, though seldom, taken by craft, through\nsecret practices had with their inhabitants, I think it not out of\nplace to discuss the matter in the following Chapter, wherein I shall\nlikewise show in how many ways the Romans were wont to make such\nacquisitions.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\u2014_In how many Ways the Romans gained Possession of\nTowns._\nTurning their thoughts wholly to arms, the Romans always conducted\ntheir military enterprises in the most advantageous way, both as to\ncost and every other circumstance of war. For which reason they avoided\nattempting towns by siege, judging the expense and inconvenience of\nthis method of carrying on war greatly to outweigh any advantage to be\ngained by it. Accordingly, they thought it better and more for their\ninterest to reduce towns in any other way than this; and in all those\nyears during which they were constantly engaged in wars we find very\nfew instances of their proceeding by siege.\nFor the capture of towns, therefore, they trusted either to assault or\nto surrender. Assaults were effected either by open force, or by force\nand stratagem combined. When a town was assailed by open force, the\nwalls were stormed without being breached, and the assailants were said\n\u201c_aggredi urbem corona,_\u201d because they encircled the city with their\nentire strength and kept up an attack on all sides. In this way they\noften succeeded in carrying towns, and even great towns, at a first\nonset, as when Scipio took new Carthage in Spain. But when they failed\nto carry a town by storm, they set themselves to breach the walls with\nbattering rams and other warlike engines; or they dug mines so as to\nobtain an entrance within the walls, this being the method followed in\ntaking Veii; or else, to be on a level with the defenders, they erected\ntowers of timber or threw up mounds of earth against the outside of the\nwalls so as to reach the top.\nOf these methods of attack, the first, wherein the city was entirely\nsurrounded, exposed the defenders to more sudden perils and left them\nmore doubtful remedies. For while it was necessary for them to have a\nsufficient force at all points, it might happen that the forces at\ntheir disposal were not numerous enough to be everywhere at once, or to\nrelieve one another. Or if their numbers were sufficient, they might\nnot all be equally resolute in standing their ground, and their failure\nat any one point involved a general defeat. Consequently, as I have\nsaid, this method of attack was often successful. But when it did not\nsucceed at the first, it was rarely renewed, being a method dangerous\nto the attacking army, which having to secure itself along an extended\nline, was left everywhere too weak to resist a sally made from the\ntown; nay, of itself, was apt to fall into confusion and disorder. This\nmethod of attack, therefore, could be attempted once only and by way of\nsurprise.\nAgainst breaches in the walls the defence was, as at the present day,\nto throw up new works; while mines were met by counter-mines, in which\nthe enemy were either withstood at the point of the sword, or baffled\nby some other warlike contrivance; as by filling casks with feathers,\nwhich, being set on fire and placed in the mine, choked out the\nassailants by their smoke and stench. Where towers were employed for\nthe attack, the defenders sought to destroy them with fire; and where\nmounds of earth were thrown up against the walls, they would dig holes\nat the base of the wall against which the mound rested, and carry off\nthe earth which the enemy were heaping up; which, being removed from\nwithin as fast as it was thrown up from without, the mound made no\nprogress.\nNone of these methods of attack can long be persisted in and the\nassailant, if unsuccessful, must either strike his camp and seek\nvictory in some other direction, as Scipio did when he invaded Africa\nand, after failing in the attempt to storm Utica, withdrew from his\nattack on that town and turned his strength against the Carthaginian\narmy in the field; or else recourse must be had to regular siege, as by\nthe Romans at Veii, Capua, Carthage, Jerusalem, and divers other cities\nwhich they reduced in this way.\nThe capture of towns by stratagem combined with force is effected, as\nby the Romans at Pal\u00e6opolis, through a secret understanding with some\nwithin the walls. Many attempts of this sort have been made, both by\nthe Romans and by others, but few successfully, because the least\nhindrance disarranges the plan of action, and because such hindrances\nare very likely to occur. For either the plot is discovered before it\ncan be carried out, as it readily may, whether from treachery on the\npart of those to whom it has been communicated, or from the\ndifficulties which attend its inception, the preliminary arrangements\nhaving to be made with the enemy and with persons with whom it is not\npermitted, save under some pretext or other, to hold intercourse; or if\nit be not discovered while it is being contrived, a thousand\ndifficulties will still be met with in its execution. For if you arrive\neither before or after the appointed time, all is ruined. The faintest\nsound, as of the cackling of the geese in the Capitol, the least\ndeparture from some ordinary routine, the most trifling mistake or\nerror, mars the whole enterprise. Add to which, the darkness of night\nlends further terror to the perils of such undertakings; while the\ngreat majority of those engaged in them, having no knowledge of the\ndistrict or places into which they are brought, are bewildered and\ndisconcerted by the least mishap, and put to flight by every imaginary\ndanger. In secret nocturnal enterprises of this sort, no man was ever\nmore successful than Aratus of Sicyon, although in any encounter by day\nthere never was a more arrant coward. This we must suppose due rather\nto some special and occult quality inherent in the man, than to success\nbeing naturally to be looked for in the like attempts. Such\nenterprises, accordingly, are often planned, but few are put into\nexecution, and fewer still with success.\nWhen cities are acquired by surrender, the surrender is either\nvoluntary or under compulsion; voluntary, when the citizens appeal to\nyou for protection against some threatened danger from without, as\nCapua submitted to the Romans; or where they are moved by a desire to\nbe better governed, and are attracted by the good government which he\nto whom they surrender is seen exercising over others who have placed\nthemselves in his hands; as was the case with the Rhodians, the\nMassilians, and others who for like causes gave themselves up to the\nRoman people. Compulsory surrenders take place, either as the result of\na protracted siege, like those we have spoken of above; or from the\ncountry being continually wasted by incursions, forays, and similar\nseverities, to escape which a city makes its submission.\nOf the methods which have been noticed, the Romans, in preference to\nall others, used this last; and for four hundred and fifty years made\nit their aim to wear out their neighbours by invasion and by defeat in\nthe open field, while endeavouring, as I have elsewhere said, to\nestablish their influence over them by treaties and conventions. It was\nto this method of warfare therefore that they always mainly trusted,\nbecause, after trying all others, they found none so free from\ninconvenience and disadvantage\u2014the procedure by siege involving expense\nand delay, that by assault, difficulty and danger, and that by secret\npractice, uncertainty and doubt. They found, likewise, that while in\nsubduing one obstinate city by siege many years might be wasted, a\nkingdom might be gained in a single day by the defeat of a hostile army\nin the field.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\u2014_That the Romans intrusted the Captains of their Armies\nwith the fullest Powers._\nIn reading this History of Titus Livius with a view to profit by it, I\nthink that all the methods of conduct followed by the Roman people and\nsenate merit attention. And among other things fit to be considered, it\nshould be noted, with how ample an authority they sent forth their\nconsuls, their dictators, and the other captains of their armies, all\nof whom we find clothed with the fullest powers: no other prerogative\nbeing reserved to itself by the senate save that of declaring war and\nmaking peace, while everything else was left to the discretion and\ndetermination of the consul. For so soon as the people and senate had\nresolved on war, for instance on a war against the Latins, they threw\nall further responsibility upon the consul, who might fight or decline\nbattle as he pleased, and attack this or the other city as he thought\nfit.\nThat this was so, is seen in many instances, and especially from what\nhappened during an expedition made against the Etruscans. For the\nconsul Fabius having routed that people near Sutrium, and thinking to\npass onward through the Ciminian forest into Etruria, so far from\nseeking the advice of the senate, gave them no hint whatever of his\ndesign, although for its execution the war had to be carried into a\nnew, difficult, and dangerous country. We have further witness to the\nsame effect, in the action taken in respect of this enterprise by the\nsenate, who being informed of the victory obtained by Fabius, and\napprehending that he might decide to pass onward through the aforesaid\nforest, and deeming it inexpedient that he should incur risk by\nattempting this invasion, sent two messengers to warn him not to enter\nEtruria. These messengers, however, did not come up with the consul\nuntil he had already made his way into that country and gained a second\nvictory; when, instead of opposing his further advance, they returned\nto Rome to announce his good fortune and the glory which he had won.\nWhoever, therefore, shall well consider the character of the authority\nwhereof I speak, will see that it was most wisely accorded; since had\nit been the wish of the senate that a consul, in conducting a war,\nshould proceed step by step as they might direct him, this must have\nmade him at once less cautious and more dilatory; because the credit of\nvictory would not then have seemed to be wholly his own, but shared by\nthe senate on whose advice he acted. Besides which, the senate must\nhave taken upon itself the task of advising on matters which it could\nnot possibly understand; for although it might contain among its\nmembers all who were most versed in military affairs, still, since\nthese men were not on the spot, and were ignorant of many particulars\nwhich, if they were to give sound advice, it was necessary for them to\nknow, they must in advising have made numberless mistakes. For these\nreasons they desired that the consul should act on his own\nresponsibility, and that the honours of success should be wholly his;\njudging that the love of fame would act on him at once as a spur and as\na curb, making him do whatever he had to do well.\nThis matter I have the rather dwelt upon because I observe that our\nmodern republics, such as the Venetian and the Florentine, view it in a\ndifferent light; so that when their captains, commissaries, or\n_provedditori_ have a single gun to place in position, the authorities\nat home must be informed and consulted; a course deserving the same\napproval as is due to all those other methods of theirs, which, one\nwith another, have brought Italy to her present condition.\nBOOK III.\nCHAPTER I.\u2014_For a Sect or Commonwealth to last long, it must often be\nbrought back to its Beginnings._\nDoubtless, all the things of this world have a limit set to their\nduration; yet those of them the bodies whereof have not been suffered\nto grow disordered, but have been so cared for that either no change at\nall has been wrought in them, or, if any, a change for the better and\nnot for the worse, will run that course which Heaven has in a general\nway appointed them. And since I am now speaking of mixed bodies, for\nStates and Sects are so to be regarded, I say that for them these are\nwholesome changes which bring them back to their first beginnings.\nThose States consequently stand surest and endure longest which, either\nby the operation of their institutions can renew themselves, or come to\nbe renewed by accident apart from any design. Nothing, however, can be\nclearer than that unless thus renewed these bodies do not last. Now the\nway to renew them is, as I have said, to bring them back to their\nbeginnings, since all beginnings of sects, commonwealths, or kingdoms\nmust needs have in them a certain excellence, by virtue of which they\ngain their first reputation and make their first growth. But because in\nprogress of time this excellence becomes corrupted, unless something be\ndone to restore it to what it was at first, these bodies necessarily\ndecay; for as the physicians tell us in speaking of the human body,\n\u201c_Something or other is daily added which sooner or later will require\ntreatment._\u201d[10]\n[10] \u201cQuod quotidie aggregatur aliquid quod quandoque indiget\ncuratione.\u201d\nAs regards commonwealths, this return to the point of departure is\nbrought about either by extrinsic accident or by intrinsic foresight.\nAs to the first, we have seen how it was necessary that Rome should be\ntaken by the Gauls, that being thus in a manner reborn, she might\nrecover life and vigour, and resume the observances of religion and\njustice which she had suffered to grow rusted by neglect. This is well\nseen from those passages of Livius wherein he tells us that when the\nRoman army was \u2018sent forth against the Gauls, and again when tribunes\nwere created with consular authority, no religious rites whatever were\ncelebrated, and wherein he further relates how the Romans not only\nfailed to punish the three Fabii, who contrary to the law of nations\nhad fought against the Gauls, but even clothed them with honour. For,\nfrom these instances, we may well infer that the rest of the wise\nordinances instituted by Romulus, and the other prudent kings, had\nbegun to be held of less account than they deserved, and less than was\nessential for the maintenance of good government.\nAnd therefore it was that Rome was visited by this calamity from\nwithout, to the end that all her ordinances might be reformed, and the\npeople taught that it behoved them not only to maintain religion and\njustice, but also to esteem their worthy citizens, and to prize their\nvirtues beyond any advantages of which they themselves might seem to\nhave been deprived at their instance. And this, we find, was just the\neffect produced. For no sooner was the city retaken, than all the\nordinances of the old religion were at once restored; the Fabii, who\nhad fought in violation of the law of nations, were punished; and the\nworth and excellence of Camillus so fully recognized, that the senate\nand the whole people, laying all jealousies aside, once more committed\nto him the entire charge of public affairs.\nIt is necessary then, as I have said already, that where men dwell\ntogether in a regulated society, they be often reminded of those\nordinances in conformity with which they ought to live, either by\nsomething inherent in these, or else by some external accident. A\nreminder is given in the former of these two ways, either by the\npassing of some law whereby the members of the society are brought to\nan account; or else by some man of rare worth arising among them, whose\nvirtuous life and example have the same effect as a law. In a\nCommonwealth, accordingly, this end is served either by the virtues of\nsome one of its citizens, or by the operation of its institutions.\nThe institutions whereby the Roman Commonwealth was led back to its\nstarting point, were the tribuneship of the people and the censorship,\ntogether with all those laws which were passed to check the insolence\nand ambition of its citizens. Such institutions, however, require fresh\nlife to be infused into them by the worth of some one man who\nfearlessly devotes himself to give them effect in opposition to the\npower of those who set them at defiance.\nOf the laws being thus reinforced in Rome, before its capture by the\nGauls, we have notable examples in the deaths of the sons of Brutus, of\nthe Decemvirs, and of Manlius Frumentarius; and after its capture, in\nthe deaths of Manlius Capitolinus, and of the son of Manlius Torquatus\nin the prosecution of his master of the knights by Papirius Cursor, and\nin the impeachment of the Scipios. Such examples as these, being signal\nand extraordinary, had the effect, whenever they took place, of\nbringing men back to the true standard of right; but when they came to\nbe of rarer occurrence, they left men more leisure to grow corrupted,\nand were attended by greater danger and disturbance. Wherefore, between\none and another of these vindications of the laws, no more than ten\nyears, at most, ought to intervene; because after that time men begin\nto change their manners and to disregard the laws; and if nothing occur\nto recall the idea of punishment, and unless fear resume its hold on\ntheir minds, so many offenders suddenly spring up together that it is\nimpossible to punish them without danger. And to this purport it used\nto be said by those who ruled Florence from the year 1434 to 1494, that\ntheir government could hardly be maintained unless it was renewed every\nfive years; by which they meant that it was necessary for them to\narouse the same terror and alarm in men\u2019s minds, as they inspired when\nthey first assumed the government, and when all who offended against\ntheir authority were signally chastised. For when the recollection of\nsuch chastisement has died out, men are emboldened to engage in new\ndesigns, and to speak ill of their rulers; for which the only remedy is\nto restore things to what they were at first.\nA republic may, likewise, be brought back to its original form, without\nrecourse to ordinances for enforcing justice, by the mere virtues of a\nsingle citizen, by reason that these virtues are of such influence and\nauthority that good men love to imitate them, and bad men are ashamed\nto depart from them. Those to whom Rome owed most for services of this\nsort, were Horatius Cocles, Mutius Sc\u00e6vola, the two Decii, Atilius\nRegulus, and divers others, whose rare excellence and generous example\nwrought for their city almost the same results as might have been\neffected by ordinances and laws. And if to these instances of\nindividual worth had been added, every ten years, some signal\nenforcement of justice, it would have been impossible for Rome ever to\nhave grown corrupted. But when both of these incitements to virtuous\nbehavior began to recur less frequently, corruption spread, and after\nthe time of Atilius Regulus, no like example was again witnessed. For\nthough the two Catos came later, so great an interval had elapsed\nbefore the elder Cato appeared, and again, so long a period intervened\nbetween him and the younger, and these two, moreover, stood so much\nalone, that it was impossible for them, by their influence, to work any\nimportant change; more especially for the younger, who found Rome so\nmuch corrupted that he could do nothing to improve his fellow-citizens.\nThis is enough to say concerning commonwealths, but as regards sects,\nwe see from the instance of our own religion that here too a like\nrenewal is needed. For had not this religion of ours been brought back\nto its original condition by Saint Francis and Saint Dominick, it must\nsoon have been utterly extinguished. They, however, by their voluntary\npoverty, and by their imitation of the life of Christ, rekindled in the\nminds of men the dying flame of faith; and by the efficacious rules\nwhich they established averted from our Church that ruin which the ill\nlives of its prelates and heads must otherwise have brought upon it.\nFor living in poverty, and gaining great authority with the people by\nconfessing them and preaching to them, they got them to believe that it\nis evil to speak ill even of what is evil; and that it is good to be\nobedient to rulers, who, if they do amiss, may be left to the judgment\nof God. By which teaching these rulers are encouraged to behave as\nbadly as they can, having no fear of punishments which they neither see\nnor credit. Nevertheless, it is this renewal which has maintained, and\nstill maintains, our religion.\nKingdoms also stand in need of a like renewal, and to have their laws\nrestored to their former force; and we see how, by attending to this,\nthe kingdom of France has profited. For that kingdom, more than any\nother, lies under the control of its laws and ordinances, which are\nmaintained by its parliaments, and more especially by the parliament of\nParis, from which last they derive fresh vigour whenever they have to\nbe enforced against any prince of the realm; for this assembly\npronounces sentence even against the king himself. Heretofore this\nparliament has maintained its name as the fearless champion of the laws\nagainst the nobles of the land; but should it ever at any future time\nsuffer wrongs to pass unpunished, and should offences multiply, either\nthese will have to be corrected with great disturbance to the State, or\nthe kingdom itself must fall to pieces.\nThis, then, is our conclusion\u2014that nothing is so necessary in any\nsociety, be it a religious sect, a kingdom, or a commonwealth, as to\nrestore to it that reputation which it had at first, and to see that it\nis provided either with wholesome laws, or with good men whose actions\nmay effect the same ends, without need to resort to external force. For\nalthough this last may sometimes, as in the case of Rome, afford an\nefficacious remedy, it is too hazardous a remedy to make us ever wish\nto employ it.\nAnd that all may understand how much the actions of particular citizens\nhelped to make Rome great, and how many admirable results they wrought\nin that city, I shall now proceed to set them forth and examine them;\nwith which survey this Third Book of mine, and last division of the\nFirst Decade of Titus Livius, shall be brought to a close. But,\nalthough great and notable actions were done by the Roman kings,\nnevertheless, since history has treated of these at much length, here I\nshall pass them over, and say no more about these princes, save as\nregards certain things done by them with an eye to their private\ninterest. I shall begin, therefore, with Brutus, the father of Roman\nfreedom.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014_That on occasion it is wise to feign Folly._\nNever did any man by the most splendid achievements gain for himself so\ngreat a name for wisdom and prudence as is justly due to Junius Brutus\nfor feigning to be a fool. And although Titus Livius mentions one cause\nonly as having led him to assume this part, namely, that he might live\nmore securely and look after his patrimony; yet on considering his\nbehavior we may believe that in counterfeiting folly it was also his\nobject to escape notice, and so find better convenience to overthrow\nthe kings, and to free his country whenever an occasion offered. That\nthis was in his mind is seen first of all from the interpretation he\ngave to the oracle of Apollo, when, to render the gods favourable to\nhis designs, he pretended to stumble, and secretly kissed his mother\nearth; and, again, from this, that on the death of Lucretia, though her\nfather, her husband, and others of her kinsmen were present, he was the\nfirst to draw the dagger from her wound, and bind the bystanders by\noath never more to suffer king to reign in Rome.\nFrom his example all who are discontented with their prince are taught,\nfirst of all, to measure, and to weigh their strength, and if they find\nthemselves strong enough to disclose their hostility and proclaim open\nwar, then to take that course as at once the nobler and less dangerous;\nbut, if too weak to make open war, then sedulously to court the favour\nof the prince, using to that end all such methods as they may judge\nneedful, adapting themselves to his pleasures, and showing delight in\nwhatever they see him delight in. Such an intimacy, in the first place,\nenables you to live securely, and permits you, without incurring any\nrisk, to share the happy fortunes of the prince, while it affords you\nevery facility for carrying out your plans. Some, no doubt, will tell\nyou that you should not stand so near the prince as to be involved in\nhis downfall; nor yet at such a distance that when he falls you shall\nbe too far off to use the occasion for rising on his ruin. But although\nthis mean course, could we only follow it, were certainly the best,\nyet, since I believe it to be impracticable, we must resort to the\nmethods above indicated, and either keep altogether aloof, or else\ncleave closely to the prince. Whosoever does otherwise, if he be of\ngreat station, lives in constant peril; nor will it avail him to say,\n\u201cI concern myself with nothing; I covet neither honours nor preferment;\nmy sole wish is to live a quiet and peaceful life.\u201d For such excuses,\nthough they be listened to, are not accepted; nor can any man of great\nposition, however much and sincerely he desire it, elect to live this\nlife of tranquillity since his professions will not be believed; so\nthat although he might be contented to be let alone, others will not\nsuffer him to be so. Wherefore, like Brutus, men must feign folly; and\nto play the part effectively, and so as to please their prince, must\nsay, do, see, and praise things contrary to their inclinations.\nBut now, having spoken of the prudence shown by Brutus when he sought\nto recover the freedom of Rome, let us next speak of the severity which\nhe used to maintain it.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014_That to preserve a newly acquired Freedom we must slay\nthe Sons of Brutus._\nThe severity used by Brutus in preserving for Rome the freedom he had\nwon for her, was not less necessary than useful. The spectacle of a\nfather sitting on the judgment, and not merely sentencing his own sons\nto death, but being himself present at their execution, affords an\nexample rare in history. But those who study the records of ancient\ntimes will understand, that after a change in the form of a government,\nwhether it be from a commonwealth to a tyranny or from a tyranny to a\ncommonwealth, those who are hostile to the new order of things must\nalways be visited with signal punishment. So that he who sets up as a\ntyrant and slays not Brutus, and he who creates a free government and\nslays not the sons of Brutus, can never maintain himself long. But\nsince I have elsewhere treated of this matter at large, I shall merely\nrefer to what has there been said concerning it, and shall cite here\none instance only, happening in our own days, and memorable in the\nhistory of our country.\nI speak of Piero Soderini, who thought by his patience and goodness to\novercome the very same temper which prompted the sons of Brutus to\nrevert to the old government, and who failed in the endeavour. For\nalthough his sagacity should have taught him the necessity, while\nchance and the ambition of those who attacked him furnished him with\nthe opportunity of making an end of them, he never could resolve to\nstrike the blow; and not merely believed himself able to subdue\ndisaffection by patience and kindness, and to mitigate the enmity of\nparticular men by the rewards he held out to them, but also persuaded\nhimself, and often declared in the presence of his friends, that he\ncould not confront opposition openly, nor crush his adversaries,\nwithout assuming extraordinary powers and passing laws destructive of\ncivil equality; which measures, although not afterward used by him for\ntyrannical ends, would so alarm the community, that after his death\nthey would never again consent to appoint a Gonfalonier for life, an\noffice which he judged it essential both to maintain and strengthen.\nNow although these scruples of his were wise and good, we ought never\nout of regard for what is good, to suffer an evil to run its course,\nsince it may well happen that the evil will prevail over the good. And\nPiero should have believed that as his acts and intentions were to be\njudged by results, he might, if he lived and if fortune befriended him,\nhave made it clear to all, that what he did was done to preserve his\ncountry, and not from personal ambition; and he might have so contrived\nmatters that no successor of his could ever turn to bad ends the means\nwhich he had used for good ends. But he was misled by a preconceived\nopinion, and failed to understand that ill-will is not to be vanquished\nby time nor propitiated by favours. And, so, from not knowing how to\nresemble Brutus, he lost power, and fame, and was driven an exile from\nhis country.\nThat it is as hard a matter to preserve a princedom as it is to\npreserve a commonwealth, will be shown in the Chapter following.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014_That an Usurper is never safe in his Princedom while those\nlive whom he has deprived of it._\nFrom what befell the elder Tarquin at the hands of the sons of Ancus,\nand Servius Tullius at the hands of Tarquin the Proud, we see what an\narduous and perilous course it is to strip a king of his kingdom and\nyet suffer him to live on, hoping to conciliate him by benefits. We\nsee, too, how the elder Tarquin was ruined by his belief that he held\nthe kingdom by a just title, since it had been given him by the people\nand confirmed to him by the senate, never suspecting that the sons of\nAncus would be so stirred by resentment that it would be impossible to\ncontent them with what contented all the rest of Rome. Servius Tullius\nagain, was ruined through believing that he could conciliate the sons\nof Ancus by loading them with favours.\nBy the fate of the first of these kings every prince may be warned that\nhe can never live securely in his princedom so long as those from whom\nhe has taken it survive; while the fate of the second should remind all\nrulers that old injuries are not to be healed by subsequent benefits,\nand least of all when the new benefit is less in degree than the injury\nsuffered. And, truly, Servius was wanting in wisdom when he imagined\nthat the sons of Tarquin would contentedly resign themselves to be the\nsons-in-law of one whom they thought should be their subject. For the\ndesire to reign is so prevailing a passion, that it penetrates the\nminds not only of those who are rightful heirs, but also of those who\nare not; as happened with the wife of the younger Tarquin, who was\ndaughter to Servius, but who, possessed by this madness, and setting at\nnaught all filial duty, incited her husband to take her father\u2019s\nkingdom, and with it his life; so much nobler did she esteem it to be a\nqueen than the daughter of a king. But while the elder Tarquin and\nServius Tullius lost the kingdom from not knowing how to secure\nthemselves against those whom they had deprived of it, the younger\nTarquin lost it from not observing the ordinances of the old kings, as\nshall be shown in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\u2014_How an Hereditary King may come to lose his Kingdom._\nTarquin the Proud, when he had put Servius Tullius to death, inasmuch\nas the latter left no heirs, took secure possession of the kingdom,\nhaving nothing to fear from any of those dangers which had stood in the\nway of his predecessors. And although the means whereby he made himself\nking were hateful and monstrous, nevertheless, had he adhered to the\nancient ordinances of the earlier kings, he might have been endured,\nnor would he have aroused both senate and people to combine against him\nand deprive him of his government. It was not, therefore, because his\nson Sextus violated Lucretia that Tarquin was driven out, but because\nhe himself had violated the laws of the kingdom, and governed as a\ntyrant, stripping the senate of all authority, and bringing everything\nunder his own control. For all business which formerly had been\ntransacted in public, and with the sanction of the senate, he caused to\nbe transacted in his palace, on his own responsibility, and to the\ndispleasure of every one else, and so very soon deprived Rome of\nwhatever freedom she had enjoyed under her other kings.\nNor was it enough for him to have the Fathers his enemies, but he must\nneeds also kindle the commons against him, wearing them out with mere\nmechanic labours, very different from the enterprises in which they had\nbeen employed by his predecessors; so that when Rome overflowed with\ninstances of his cruelty and pride, he had already disposed the minds\nof all the citizens to rebel whenever they found the opportunity.\nWherefore, had not occasion offered in the violence done to Lucretia,\nsome other had soon been found to bring about the same result. But had\nTarquin lived like the other kings, when Sextus his son committed that\noutrage, Brutus and Collatinus would have had recourse to him to punish\nthe offender, and not to the commons of Rome. And hence let princes\nlearn that from the hour they first violate those laws, customs, and\nusages under which men have lived for a great while, they begin to\nweaken the foundations of their authority. And should they, after they\nhave been stripped of that authority, ever grow wise enough to see how\neasily princedoms are preserved by those who are content to follow\nprudent counsels, the sense of their loss will grieve them far more,\nand condemn them to a worse punishment than any they suffer at the\nhands of others. For it is far easier to be loved by good men than by\nbad, and to obey the laws than to seek to control them.\nAnd to learn what means they must use to retain their authority, they\nhave only to take example by the conduct of good princes, such as\nTimoleon of Corinth, Aratus of Sicyone, and the like, in whose lives\nthey will find such security and content, both on the side of the ruler\nand the ruled, as ought to stir them with the desire to imitate them,\nwhich, for the reasons already given, it is easy for them to do. For\nmen, when they are well governed, ask no more, nor look for further\nfreedom; as was the case with the peoples governed by the two whom I\nhave named, whom they constrained to continue their rulers while they\nlived, though both of them sought repeatedly to return to private life.\nBut because, in this and the two preceding Chapters, I have noticed the\nill-will which arose against the kings, the plots contrived by the sons\nof Brutus against their country, and those directed against the elder\nTarquin and Servius Tullius, it seems to me not out of place to\ndiscourse of these matters more at length in the following Chapter, as\ndeserving the attention both of princes and private citizens.\nCHAPTER VI.\u2014_Of Conspiracies._\nIt were an omission not to say something on the subject of\nconspiracies, these being a source of much danger both to princes and\nto private men. For we see that many more princes have lost their lives\nand states through these than in open warfare; power to wage open war\nupon a prince being conceded to few, whereas power to conspire against\nhim is denied to none. On the other hand, since conspiracies are\nattended at every stage by difficulties and dangers, no more hazardous\nor desperate undertakings can be engaged in by any private citizen;\nwhence it comes that while many conspiracies are planned, few effect\ntheir object. Wherefore, to put princes on their guard against these\ndangers, and to make subjects more cautious how they take part in them,\nand rather learn to live content under whatever government fortune has\nassigned them, I shall treat of them at length, without omitting any\nnoteworthy circumstance which may serve for the instruction of either.\nThough, indeed, this is a golden sentence Of Cornelius Tacitus, wherein\nhe says that \u201c_the past should have our reverence, the present our\nobedience, and that we should wish for good princes, but put up with\nany._\u201d[11] For assuredly whosoever does otherwise is likely to bring\nruin both on himself and on his country.\n[11] _Tac. Hist._ iv. 8.\nBut, to go deeper into the matter, we have first of all to examine\nagainst whom conspiracies are directed; and we shall find that men\nconspire either against their country or their prince; and it is of\nthese two kinds of conspiracy that at present I desire to speak. For of\nconspiracies which have for their object the surrender of cities to\nenemies who are besieging them, and of all others contrived for like\nends, I have already said enough.\nFirst, then, I shall treat of those conspiracies which are directed\nagainst a prince, and begin by inquiring into their causes, which are\nmanifold, but of which one is more momentous than all the rest; I mean,\nthe being hated by the whole community. For it may reasonably be\nassumed, that when a prince has drawn upon himself this universal\nhatred, he must also have given special offence to particular men,\nwhich they will be eager to avenge. And this eagerness will be\naugmented by the feeling of general ill-will which the prince is seen\nto have incurred. A prince ought, therefore, to avoid this load of\npublic hatred. How he is to do so I need not stop here to explain,\nhaving discussed the matter already in another place; but if he can\nguard against this, offence given to particular men will expose him to\nbut few attacks. One reason being, that there are few men who think so\nmuch of an injury done them as to run great risks to revenge it;\nanother, that assuming them to have both the disposition and the\ncourage to avenge themselves, they are restrained by the universal\nfavour which they see entertained towards the prince.\nInjuries are either to a man\u2019s life, to his property, or to his honour.\nAs regards the first, they who threaten injuries to life incur more\ndanger than they who actually inflict them; or rather, while great\ndanger is incurred in threatening, none at all is incurred from\ninflicting such injuries. For the dead are past thinking of revenge;\nand those who survive, for the most part leave such thoughts to the\ndead. But he whose life is threatened, finding himself forced by\nnecessity either to do or suffer, becomes a man most dangerous to the\nprince, as shall be fully explained hereafter.\nAfter menaces to life, injuries to property and honour stir men more\nthan any others, and of these a Prince has most to beware. For he can\nnever strip a man so bare of his possessions as not to leave him some\nweapon wherewith to redress his wrongs, nor ever so far dishonour him\nas to quell the stubborn spirit which prompts revenge. Of all\ndishonours those done to the women of a household are the worst; after\nwhich come such personal indignities as nerved the arm of Pausanias\nagainst Philip of Macedon, and of many another against other princes;\nand, in our own days, it was no other reason that moved Giulio Belanti\nto conspire against Pandolfo, lord of Siena, than that Pandolfo, who\nhad given him his daughter to wife, afterwards took her from him, as\npresently shall be told. Chief among the causes which led the Pazzi to\nconspire against the Medici, was the law passed by the latter depriving\nthem of the inheritance of Giovanni Bonromei.\nAnother most powerful motive to conspire against a prince is the desire\nmen feel to free their country from a usurper. This it was which\nimpelled Brutus and Cassius to conspire against C\u00e6sar, and countless\nothers against such tyrants as Phalaris, Dionysius, and the like.\nAgainst this humour no tyrant can guard, except by laying down his\ntyranny; which as none will do, few escape an unhappy end. Whence the\nverses of Juvenal:\u2014\n\u201cFew tyrants die a peaceful death, and few\nThe kings who visit Proserpine\u2019s dread lord,\nUnscathed by wounds and blood.\u201d[12]\n[12] Ad generum Cereris sine caede et vulnere pauci\nDescendunt reges, et sicca morte tiranni.\n_Juv. Sat._ x. 112.\nGreat, as I have said already, are the dangers which men run in\nconspiring; for at all times they are in peril, whether in contriving,\nin executing, or after execution. And since in conspiracies either many\nare engaged, or one only (for although it cannot properly be said of\n_one_ man that he _conspires_, there may exist in him the fixed resolve\nto put the prince to death), it is only the solitary plotter who\nescapes the first of these three stages of danger. For he runs no risk\nbefore executing his design, since as he imparts it to none, there is\nnone to bring it to the ear of the prince. A deliberate resolve like\nthis may be conceived by a person in any rank of life, high or low,\nbase or noble, and whether or no he be the familiar of his prince. For\nevery one must, at some time or other, have leave to speak to the\nprince, and whoever has this leave has opportunity to accomplish his\ndesign. Pausanias, of whom we have made mention so often, slew Philip\nof Macedon as he walked between his son and his son-in-law to the\ntemple, surrounded by a thousand armed guards. Pausanias indeed was\nnoble, and known to the prince, but Ferdinand of Spain was stabbed in\nthe neck by a poor and miserable Spaniard; and though the wound was not\nmortal, it sufficed to show that neither courage nor opportunity were\nwanting to the would-be-assassin. A Dervish, or Turkish priest, drew\nhis scimitar on Bajazet, father of the Sultan now reigning, and if he\ndid not wound him, it was from no lack either of daring or of\nopportunity. And I believe that there are many who in their minds\ndesire the deed, no punishment or danger attending the mere wish,\nthough there be but few who dare do it. For since few or none who\nventure, escape death, few are willing to go forward to certain\ndestruction.\nBut to pass from these solitary attempts to those in which several are\nengaged, I affirm it to be shown by history that all such plots have\nbeen contrived by men of great station, or by those who have been on\nterms of close intimacy with the prince, since no others, not being\ndownright madmen, would ever think of conspiring. For men of humble\nrank, and such as are not the intimates of their prince, are neither\nfed by the hopes nor possessed of the opportunities essential for such\nattempts. Because, in the first place, men of low degree will never\nfind any to keep faith with them, none being moved to join in their\nschemes by those expectations which encourage men to run great risks;\nwherefore, so soon as their design has been imparted to two or three,\nthey are betrayed and ruined. Or, assuming them fortunate enough to\nhave no traitor of their number, they will be so hampered in the\nexecution of their plot by the want of easy access to the prince, that\nthey are sure to perish in the mere attempt. For if even men of great\nposition, who have ready access to the prince, succumb to the\ndifficulties which I shall presently notice, those difficulties must be\ninfinitely increased in the case of men who are without these\nadvantages. And because when life and property are at stake men are not\nutterly reckless, on perceiving themselves to be weak they grow\ncautious, and though cursing the tyrant in their hearts, are content to\nendure him, and to wait until some one of higher station than they,\ncomes forward to redress their wrongs. So that should we ever find\nthese weaklings attempting anything, we may commend their courage\nrather than their prudence.\nWe see, however, that the great majority of conspirators have been\npersons of position and the familiars of their prince, and that their\nplots have been as often the consequence of excessive indulgence as of\nexcessive injury; as when Perennius conspired against Commodus,\nPlautianus against Severus, and Sejanus against Tiberius; all of whom\nhad been raised by their masters to such wealth, honours, and\ndignities, that nothing seemed wanting to their authority save the\nimperial name. That they might not lack this also, they fell to\nconspiring against their prince; but in every instance their\nconspiracies had the end which their ingratitude deserved.\nThe only instance in recent times of such attempts succeeding, is the\nconspiracy of Jacopo IV. d\u2019Appiano against Messer Piero Gambacorti,\nlord of Pisa. For Jacopo, who had been bred and brought up by Piero,\nand loaded by him with honours, deprived him of his State. Similar to\nthis, in our own days, was the conspiracy of Coppola against King\nFerdinand of Aragon. For Coppola had reached such a pitch of power that\nhe seemed to himself to have everything but sovereignty; in seeking to\nobtain which he lost his life; though if any plot entered into by a man\nof great position could be expected to succeed, this certainly might,\nbeing contrived, as we may say, by another king, and by one who had the\namplest opportunities for its accomplishment. But that lust of power\nwhich blinds men to dangers darkened the minds of those to whom the\nexecution of the scheme was committed; who, had they only known how to\nadd prudence to their villainy, could hardly have missed their aim.\nThe prince, therefore, who would guard himself against plots, ought\nmore to fear those men to whom he has been too indulgent, than those to\nwhom he has done great wrongs. For the latter lack opportunities which\nthe former have in abundance; and the moving cause is equally strong in\nboth, lust of power being at least as strong a passion as lust of\nrevenge. Wherefore, a prince should entrust his friends with so much\nauthority only as leaves a certain interval between his position and\ntheirs; that between the two something be still left them to desire.\nOtherwise it will be strange if he do not fare like those princes who\nhave been named above.\nBut to return from this digression, I say, that having shown it to be\nnecessary that conspirators should be men of great station, and such as\nhave ready access to the prince, we have next to consider what have\nbeen the results of their plots, and to trace the causes which have\nmade them succeed or fail. Now, as I have said already, we find that\nconspiracies are attended by danger at three stages: before during, and\nafter their execution; for which reason very few of them have had a\nhappy issue; it being next to impossible to surmount all these\ndifferent dangers successfully. And to begin with those which are\nincurred beforehand, and which are graver than all the rest, I say that\nhe must be both very prudent and very fortunate who, when contriving a\nconspiracy, does not suffer his secret to be discovered.\nConspiracies are discovered either by disclosures made, or by\nconjecture. Disclosures are made through the treachery or folly of\nthose to whom you communicate your design. Treachery is to be looked\nfor, because you can impart your plans only to such persons as you\nbelieve ready to face death on your behalf, or to those who are\ndiscontented with the prince. Of men whom you can trust thus\nimplicitly, one or two may be found; but when you have to open your\ndesigns to many, they cannot all be of this nature; and their goodwill\ntowards you must be extreme if they are not daunted by the danger and\nby fear of punishment. Moreover men commonly deceive themselves in\nrespect of the love which they imagine others bear them, nor can ever\nbe sure of it until they have put it to the proof. But to make proof of\nit in a matter like this is very perilous; and even if you have proved\nit already, and found it true in some other dangerous trial, you cannot\nassume that there will be the same fidelity here, since this far\ntranscends every other kind of danger. Again, if you gauge a man\u2019s\nfidelity by his discontent with the prince, you may easily deceive\nyourself; for so soon as you have taken this discontented man into your\nconfidence, you have supplied him with the means whereby he may become\ncontented; so that either his hatred of the prince must be great\nindeed, or your influence over him extraordinary, if it keep him\nfaithful. Hence it comes that so many conspiracies have been discovered\nand crushed in their earliest stage, and that when the secret is\npreserved among many accomplices for any length of time, it is looked\non as a miracle; as in the case of the conspiracy of Piso against Nero,\nand, in our own days, in that of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano\nde\u2019 Medici; which last, though more than fifty persons were privy to\nit, was not discovered until it came to be carried out.\nConspiracies are disclosed through the imprudence of a conspirator when\nhe talks so indiscreetly that some servant, or other person not in the\nplot, overhears him; as happened with the sons of Brutus, who, when\ntreating with the envoys of Tarquin, were overheard by a slave, who\nbecame their accuser; or else through your own weakness in imparting\nyour secret to some woman or boy whom you love, or to some other such\nlight person; as when Dymnus, who was one of those who conspired with\nPhilotas against Alexander the Great, revealed the plot to Nicomachus,\na youth whom he loved, who at once told Cebalinus, and Cebalinus the\nking.\nOf discoveries by conjecture we have an instance in the conspiracy of\nPiso against Nero; for Scaevinus, one of the conspirators, the day\nbefore he was to kill Nero, made his will, liberated all his slaves and\ngave them money, and bade Milichus, his freedman, sharpen his old rusty\ndagger, and have bandages ready for binding up wounds. From all which\npreparations Milichus conjecturing what work was in hand, accused\nScaevinus before Nero; whereupon Scaevinus was arrested, and with him\nNatalis, another of the conspirators, who the day before had been seen\nto speak with him for a long time in private; and when the two differed\nin their account of what then passed between them, they were put to the\ntorture and forced to confess the truth. In this way the conspiracy was\nbrought to light, to the ruin of all concerned.\nAgainst these causes of the discovery of conspiracies it is impossible\nso to guard as that either through treachery, want of caution, or\nlevity, the secret shall not be found out, whenever more than three or\nfour persons are privy to it. And whenever more than one conspirator is\narrested, the plot is certain to be detected, because no two persons\ncan perfectly agree in a false account of what has passed between them.\nIf only one be taken, should he be a man of resolute courage, he may\nrefuse to implicate his comrades; but they on their part must have no\nless courage, to stay quiet where they are, and not betray themselves\nby flight; for if courage be absent anywhere, whether in him who is\ntaken or in those still at large, the conspiracy is revealed. And what\nis related by Titus Livius as having happened in the conspiracy against\nHieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse, is most extraordinary, namely, that on\nthe capture of one of the conspirators, named Theodorus, he, with great\nfortitude, withheld the names of all his accomplices, and accused\nfriends of the tyrant; while his companions, on their part, trusted so\ncompletely in his courage, that not one of them quitted Syracuse or\nshowed any sign of fear.\nAll these dangers, therefore, which attend the contrivance of a plot,\nmust be passed through before you come to its execution; or if you\nwould escape them, you must observe the following precautions: Your\nfirst and surest, nay, to say truth, your only safeguard, is to leave\nyour accomplices no time to accuse you; for which reason you must\nimpart the affair to them, only at the moment when you mean it to be\ncarried out, and not before. Those who have followed this course have\nwholly escaped the preliminary dangers of conspiracies, and, generally\nspeaking, the others also; indeed, I may say that they have all\nsucceeded, and that it is open to every prudent man to act as they did.\nIt will be enough to give two instances of plots effected in this way.\nNelematus, unable to endure the tyranny of Aristotimus, despot of\nEpirus, assembling many of his friends and kinsmen in his house,\nexhorted them to free their country; and when some of them asked for\ntime to consider and mature their plans, he bade his slaves close the\ndoors, and told those assembled that unless they swore to go at once\nand do as he directed he would make them over to Aristotimus as\nprisoners. Alarmed by his threats, they bound themselves by a solemn\noath, and going forth at once and without delay, successfully carried\nout his bidding. A certain Magus having fraudulently usurped the throne\nof Persia; Ortanes, a grandee of that realm, discovering the fraud,\ndisclosed it to six others of the chief nobility, telling them that it\nbehoved them to free the kingdom from the tyranny of this impostor. And\nwhen some among them asked for time, Darius, who was one of the six\nsummoned by Ortanes, stood up and said, \u201cEither we go at once to do\nthis deed, or I go to the Magus to accuse you all.\u201d Whereupon, all\nrising together, without time given to any to change his mind, they\nwent forth and succeeded in effecting their end. Not unlike these\ninstances was the plan taken by the Etolians to rid themselves of\nNabis, the Spartan tyrant, to whom, under pretence of succouring him,\nthey sent Alasamenes, their fellow-citizen, with two hundred foot\nsoldiers and thirty horsemen. For they imparted their real design to\nAlasamenes only, charging the rest, under pain of exile, to obey him in\nwhatever he commanded. Alasamenes repaired to Sparta, and never\ndivulged his commission till the time came for executing it; and so\nsucceeded in putting Nabis to death.\nIt was, therefore, by the precautions they observed, that the persons\nof whom I have just now spoken escaped all those perils that attend the\ncontrivance of conspiracies; and any following their example may expect\nthe like good fortune. And that all may learn to do as they did I shall\nnotice the case of Piso, of which mention has before been made. By\nreason of his rank, his reputation, and the intimate terms on which he\nlived with Nero, who trusted him without reserve, and would often come\nto his garden to sup with him, Piso was able to gain the friendship of\nmany persons of spirit and courage, and well fitted in every way to\ntake part in his plot against the emperor, which, under these\ncircumstances, might easily have been carried out. For when Nero came\nto his garden, Piso could readily have communicated his design to those\nfriends of his, and with suitable words have encouraged them to do\nwhat, in fact, they would not have had time to withdraw from, and was\ncertain to succeed. And were we to examine all similar attempts, it\nwould be seen that there are few which might not have been effected in\nthe manner shown. But since most men are very ignorant of practical\naffairs, they commit the gravest blunders, especially in matters which\nlie, as this does, a little way out of the beaten track.\nWherefore, the contriver of a plot ought never, if he can help it, to\ncommunicate his design until the moment when it is to be executed; or\nif he must communicate it, then to some one man only, with whom he has\nlong been intimate, and whom he knows to be moved by the same feelings\nas himself. To find one such person is far easier than to find several,\nand, at the same time, involves less risk; for though this one man play\nyou false, you are not left altogether without resource, as you are\nwhen your accomplices are numerous. For I have heard it shrewdly said\nthat to one man you may impart anything, since, unless you have been\nled to commit yourself by writing, your denial will go as far as his\nassertion. Shun writing, therefore, as you would a rock, for there is\nnothing so damning as a letter under your own hand.\nPlautianus, desiring to procure the deaths of the Emperor Severus and\nhis son Caracalla, intrusted the business to the tribune Saturninus,\nwho, being more disposed to betray than obey Plautianus, but at the\nsame time afraid that, if it came to laying a charge, Plautianus might\nbe believed sooner than he, asked him for a written authority, that his\ncommission might be credited. Blinded by ambition, Plautianus complied,\nand forthwith was accused by Saturninus and found guilty; whereas, but\nfor that written warrant, together with other corroborating proofs, he\nmust have escaped by his bold denial of the charge. Against the\ntestimony of a single witness, you have thus some defence, unless\nconvicted by your own handwriting, or by other circumstantial proof\nagainst which you must guard. A woman, named Epicharis, who had\nformerly been a mistress of Nero, was privy to Piso\u2019s conspiracy, and\nthinking it might be useful to have the help of a certain captain of\ntriremes whom Nero had among his body-guards, she acquainted him with\nthe plot, but not with the names of the plotters. This fellow, turning\ntraitor, and accusing Epicharis to Nero, so stoutly did she deny the\ncharge, that Nero, confounded by her effrontery, let her go.\nIn imparting a plot to a single person there are, therefore, two risks:\none, that he may come forward of his own accord to accuse you; the\nother, that if arrested on suspicion, or on some proof of his guilt, he\nmay, on being convicted, in the hope to escape punishment, betray you.\nBut in neither of these dangers are you left without a defence; since\nyou may meet the one by ascribing the charge to the malice of your\naccuser, and the other by alleging that the witness his been forced by\ntorture to say what is untrue. The wisest course, however, is to impart\nyour design to none, but to act like those who have been mentioned\nabove; or if you impart it, then to one only: for although even in this\ncourse there be a certain degree of danger, it is far less than when\nmany are admitted to your confidence.\nA case nearly resembling that just now noticed, is where an emergency,\nso urgent as to leave you no time to provide otherwise for your safety,\nconstrains you to do to a prince what you see him minded to do to you.\nA necessity of this sort leads almost always to the end desired, as two\ninstances may suffice to show. Among the closest friends and intimates\nof the Emperor Commodus, were two captains of the pretorian guards,\nLetus and Electus, while among the most favoured of his distresses was\na certain Martia. But because these three often reproved him for his\nmanner of living, as disgraceful to himself and to his station, he\nresolved to rid himself of them; and so wrote their names, along with\nthose of certain others whom he meant should be put to death the next\nnight, in a list which he placed under the pillow of his bed. But on\nhis going to bathe, a boy, who was a favourite of his, while playing\nabout his room and on his bed, found the list, and coming out of the\nchamber with it in his hand, was met by Martia, who took it from him,\nand on reading it and finding what it contained, sent for Letus and\nElectus. And all three recognizing the danger in which they stood,\nresolved to be beforehand with the tyrant, and losing no time, murdered\nhim that very night.\nThe Emperor Caracalla, being with his armies in Mesopotamia, had with\nhim Macrinus, who was more of a statesman than a soldier, as his\nprefect. But because princes who are not themselves good are always\nafraid lest others treat them as they deserve, Caracalla wrote to his\nfriend Maternianus in Rome to learn from the astrologers whether any\nman had ambitious designs upon the empire, and to send him word.\nMaternianus, accordingly, wrote back that such designs were entertained\nby Macrinus. But this letter, ere it reached the emperor, fell into the\nhands of Macrinus, who, seeing when he read it that he must either put\nCaracalla to death before further letters arrived from Rome, or else\ndie himself, committed the business to a centurion, named Martialis,\nwhom he trusted, and whose brother had been slain by Caracalla a few\ndays before, who succeeded in killing the emperor.\nWe see, therefore, that an urgency which leaves no room for delay has\nalmost the same results as the method already noticed as followed by\nNelematus of Epirus. We see, too, what I remarked almost at the outset\nof this Discourse, that the threats of princes expose them to greater\ndanger than the wrongs they actually inflict, and lead to more active\nconspiracies: and, therefore, that a prince should be careful not to\nthreaten; since men are either to be treated kindly or else got rid of,\nbut never brought to such a pass that they have to choose between\nslaying and being slain.\nAs to the dangers attending the execution of plots, these result either\nfrom some change made in the plan, or from a failure in courage on the\npart of him who is to carry it out; or else from some mistake he falls\ninto through want of foresight, or from his not giving the affair its\nfinishing stroke, as when some are left alive whom it was meant to put\nto death. Now, nothing causes so much disturbance and hindrance in\nhuman affairs, as to be forced, at a moment\u2019s notice and without time\nallowed for reflection, to vary your plan of action and adopt a\ndifferent one from that fixed on at the first. And if such changes\ncause confusion anywhere, it is in matters appertaining to war, and in\nenterprises of the kind we are now speaking of; for in such affairs as\nthese, there is nothing so essential as that men be prepared to do the\nexact thing intrusted to them. But when men have for many days together\nturned their whole thoughts to doing a thing in a certain way and in a\ncertain order, and the way and order are suddenly altered, it is\nimpossible but that they should be disconcerted and the whole scheme\nruined. For which reason, it is far better to do everything in\naccordance with the preconcerted plan, though it be seen to be attended\nwith some disadvantages, than, in order to escape these, to involve\nyourself in an infinity of dangers. And this will happen when you\ndepart from your original design without time given to form a new one.\nFor when time is given you may manage as you please.\nThe conspiracy of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano de\u2019 Medici is\nwell known. The scheme agreed on was to give a banquet to the Cardinal\nS. Giorgio, at which the brothers should be put to death. To each of\nthe conspirators a part was assigned: to one the murder, to another the\nseizure of the palace, while a third was to ride through the streets\nand call on the people to free themselves. But it so chanced that at a\ntime when the Pazzi, the Medici, and the Cardinal were all assembled in\nthe cathedral church of Florence to hear High Mass, it became known\nthat Giuliano would not be present at the banquet; whereupon the\nconspirators, laying their heads together, resolved to do in church\nwhat they were to have done elsewhere. This, however, deranged the\nwhole scheme. For Giovambattista of Montesecco, would have no hand in\nthe murder if it was to be done in a church; and the whole distribution\nof parts had in consequence to be changed; when, as those to whom the\nnew parts were assigned had no time allowed them to nerve their minds\nto their new tasks, they managed matters so badly that they were\noverpowered in their attempt.\nCourage fails a conspirator either from his own poorness of spirit, or\nfrom his being overcome by some feeling of reverence. For such majesty\nand awe attend the person of a prince, that it may well happen that he\nsoftens or dismays his executioners. When Caius Marius was taken by the\npeople of Minturnum, the slave sent in to slay him, overawed by the\nbearing of the man, and by the memories which his name called up,\nbecame unnerved, and powerless to perform his office. And if this\ninfluence was exercised by one who was a prisoner, and in chains, and\noverwhelmed by adverse fortune, how much more must reverence be\ninspired by a prince who is free and uncontrolled, surrounded by his\nretinue and by all the pomp and splendour of his station; whose dignity\nconfounds, and whose graciousness conciliates.\nCertain persons conspiring against Sitalces, king of Thrace, fixed a\nday for his murder, and assembled at the place appointed, whither the\nking had already come. Yet none of them raised a hand to harm him, and\nall departed without attempting anything against him or knowing why\nthey refrained; each blaming the others. And more than once the same\nfolly was repeated, until the plot getting wind, they were taken and\npunished for what they might have done, yet durst not do.\nTwo brothers of Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, conspired against him,\nemploying as their tool a certain priest named Giennes, a singing-man\nin the service of the Duke. He, at their request, repeatedly brought\nthe Duke into their company, so that they had full opportunity to make\naway with him. Yet neither of them ever ventured to strike the blow;\ntill at last, their scheme being discovered, they paid the penalty of\ntheir combined cowardice and temerity. Such irresolution can only have\narisen from their being overawed by the majesty of the prince, or\ntouched by his graciousness.\nIn the execution of conspiracies, therefore, errors and mishaps arise\nfrom a failure of prudence or courage to which all are subject, when,\nlosing self-control, they are led in their bewilderment to do and say\nwhat they ought not. That men are thus confounded, and thrown off their\nbalance, could not be better shown than in the words of Titus Livius,\nwhere he describes the behaviour of Alasamenes the Etolian, at the time\nwhen he resolved on the death of Nabis the Spartan, of whom I have\nspoken before. For when the time to act came, and he had disclosed to\nhis followers what they had to do, Livius represents him as\n\u201c_collecting his thoughts which had grown confused by dwelling on so\ndesperate an enterprise_.\u201d For it is impossible for any one, though of\nthe most steadfast temper and used to the sight of death and to handle\ndeadly weapons, not to be perturbed at such a moment. For which reason\nwe should on such occasions choose for our tools those who have had\nexperience in similar affairs, and trust no others though reputed of\nthe truest courage. For in these grave undertakings, no one who is\nwithout such experience, however bold and resolute, is to be trusted.\nThe confusion of which I speak may either cause you to drop your weapon\nfrom your hand, or to use words which will have the same results.\nQuintianus being commanded by Lucilla, sister of Commodus, to slay him,\nlay in wait for him at the entrance of the amphitheatre, and rushing\nupon him with a drawn dagger, cried out, \u201c_The senate sends you this_;\u201d\nwhich words caused him to be seized before his blow descended. In like\nmanner Messer Antonio of Volterra, who as we have elsewhere seen was\ntold off to kill Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, exclaimed as he approached him,\n\u201c_Ah traitor!_\u201d and this exclamation proved the salvation of Lorenzo\nand the ruin of that conspiracy.\nFor the reasons now given, a conspiracy against a single ruler may\nreadily break down in its execution; but a conspiracy against two\nrulers is not only difficult, but so hazardous that its success is\nalmost hopeless. For to effect like actions, at the same time, in\ndifferent places, is well-nigh impossible; nor can they be effected at\ndifferent times, if you would not have one counteract another. So that\nif conspiracy against a single ruler be imprudent and dangerous, to\nconspire against two, is in the last degree fool-hardy and desperate.\nAnd were it not for the respect in which I hold the historian, I could\nnot credit as possible what Herodian relates of Plautianus, namely,\nthat he committed to the centurion Saturninus the task of slaying\nsingle-handed both Severus and Caracalla, they dwelling in different\nplaces; for the thing is so opposed to reason that on no other\nauthority could I be induced to accept it as true.\nCertain young Athenians conspired against Diocles and Hippias, tyrants\nof Athens. Diocles they slew; but Hippias, making his escape, avenged\nhim. Chion and Leonidas of Heraclea, disciples of Plato, conspired\nagainst the despots Clearchus and Satirus. Clearchus fell, but Satirus\nsurvived and avenged him. The Pazzi, of whom we have spoken so often,\nsucceeded in murdering Giuliano only. From such conspiracies,\ntherefore, as are directed against more heads than one, all should\nabstain; for no good is to be got from them, whether for ourselves, for\nour country, or for any one else. On the contrary, when those conspired\nagainst escape, they become harsher and more unsufferable than before,\nas, in the examples given, Florence, Athens, and Heraclea had cause to\nknow. True it is that the conspiracy contrived by Pelopidas for the\nliberation of his country, had to encounter every conceivable\nhindrance, and yet had the happiest end. For Pelopidas had to deal, not\nwith two tyrants only, but with ten; and so far from having their\nconfidence, could not, being an outlaw, even approach them. And yet he\nsucceeded in coming to Thebes, in putting the tyrants to death, and in\nfreeing his country. But whatever he did was done with the aid of one\nof the counsellors of the tyrants, a certain Charon, through whom he\nhad all facilities for executing his design. Let none, however, take\nthis case as a pattern; for that it was in truth a desperate attempt,\nand its success a marvel, was and is the opinion of all historians, who\nspeak of it as a thing altogether extraordinary and unexampled.\nThe execution of a plot may be frustrated by some groundless alarm or\nunforeseen mischance occurring at the very moment when the scheme is to\nbe carried out. On the morning on which Brutus and his confederates\nwere to slay C\u00e6sar, it so happened that C\u00e6sar talked for a great while\nwith Cneus Pompilius Lenas, one of the conspirators; which some of the\nothers observing, were in terror that Pompilius was divulging the\nconspiracy to C\u00e6sar; whose life they would therefore have attempted\nthen and there, without waiting his arrival in the senate house, had\nthey not been reassured by seeing that when the conference ended he\nshowed no sign of unusual emotion. False alarms of this sort are to be\ntaken into account and allowed for, all the more that they are easily\nraised. For he who has not a clear conscience is apt to assume that\nothers are speaking of him. A word used with a wholly different\npurpose, may throw his mind off its balance and lead him to fancy that\nreference is intended to the matter he is engaged on, and cause him\neither to betray the conspiracy by flight, or to derange its execution\nby anticipating the time fixed. And the more there are privy to the\nconspiracy, the likelier is this to happen.\nAs to the mischances which may befall, since these are unforeseen, they\ncan only be instanced by examples which may make men more cautious.\nGiulio Belanti of Siena, of whom I have spoken before, from the hate he\nbore Pandolfo Petrucci, who had given him his daughter to wife and\nafterwards taken her from him, resolved to murder him, and thus chose\nhis time. Almost every day Pandolfo went to visit a sick kinsman,\npassing the house of Giulio on the way, who, remarking this, took\nmeasures to have his accomplices ready in his house to kill Pandolfo as\nhe passed. Wherefore, placing the rest armed within the doorway, one he\nstationed at a window to give the signal of Pandolfo\u2019s approach. It so\nhappened however, that as he came nigh the house, and after the\nlook-out had given the signal, Pandolfo fell in with a friend who\nstopped him to converse; when some of those with him, going on in\nadvance, saw and heard the gleam and clash of weapons, and so\ndiscovered the ambuscade; whereby Pandolfo was saved, while Giulio with\nhis companions had to fly from Siena. This plot accordingly was marred,\nand Giulio\u2019s schemes baulked, in consequence of a chance meeting.\nAgainst such accidents, since they are out of the common course of\nthings, no provision can be made. Still it is very necessary to take\ninto account all that may happen, and devise what remedies you can.\nIt now only remains for us to consider those dangers which follow after\nthe execution of a plot. These in fact resolve themselves into one,\nnamely, that some should survive who will avenge the death of the\nmurdered prince. The part of avenger is likely to be assumed by a son,\na brother, or other kinsman of the deceased, who in the ordinary course\nof events might have looked to succeed to the princedom. And such\npersons are suffered to live, either from inadvertence, or from some of\nthe causes noted already, as when Giovann\u2019 Andrea of Lampognano, with\nthe help of his companions, put to death the Duke of Milan. For the son\nand two brothers of the Duke, who survived him, were able to avenge his\ndeath. In cases like this, indeed, the conspirators may be held\nexcused, since there is nothing they can do to help themselves. But\nwhen from carelessness and want of due caution some one is allowed to\nlive whose death ought to have been secured, there is no excuse.\nCertain conspirators, after murdering the lord, Count Girolamo of\nForli, made prisoners of his wife and of his children who were still\nvery young. By thinking they could not be safe unless they got\npossession of the citadel, which the governor refused to surrender,\nthey obtained a promise from Madonna Caterina, for so the Countess was\nnamed, that on their permitting her to enter the citadel she would\ncause it to be given up to them, her children in the mean time\nremaining with them as hostages. On which undertaking they suffered her\nto enter the citadel. But no sooner had she got inside than she fell to\nupbraid them from the walls with the murder of her husband, and to\nthreaten them with every kind of vengeance; and to show them how little\nstore she set upon her children, told them scoffingly that she knew how\nothers could be got. In the end, the rebels having no leader to advise\nthem, and perceiving too late the error into which they had been\nbetrayed, had to pay the penalty of their rashness by perpetual\nbanishment.\nBut of all the dangers which may follow on the execution of a plot,\nnone is so much or so justly to be feared as that the people should be\nwell affected to the prince whom you have put to death. For against\nthis danger conspirators have no resource which can ensure their\nsafety. Of this we have example in the case of C\u00e6sar, who as he had the\nlove of the Roman people was by them avenged; for they it was who, by\ndriving out the conspirators from Rome, were the cause that all of\nthem, at different times and in different places, came to violent ends.\nConspiracies against their country are less danger for those who take\npart in them than conspiracies against princes; since there is less\nrisk beforehand, and though there be the same danger in their\nexecution, there is none afterwards. Beforehand, the risks are few,\nbecause a citizen may use means for obtaining power without betraying\nhis wishes or designs to any; and unless his course be arrested, his\ndesigns are likely enough to succeed; nay, though laws be passed to\nrestrain him, he may strike out a new path. This is to be understood of\na commonwealth which has to some degree become corrupted; for in one\nwherein there is no taint of corruption, there being no soil in which\nevil seed can grow, such designs will never suggest themselves to any\ncitizen.\nIn a commonwealth, therefore, a citizen may by many means and in many\nways aspire to the princedom without risking destruction, both because\nrepublics are slower than princes are to take alarm, are less\nsuspicious and consequently less cautious, and because they look with\ngreater reverence upon their great citizens, who are in this way\nrendered bolder and more reckless in attacking them. Any one who has\nread Sallust\u2019s account of the conspiracy of Catiline, must remember\nhow, when that conspiracy was discovered, Catiline not only remained in\nRome, but even made his appearance in the senatehouse, where he was\nsuffered to address the senate in the most insulting terms,\u2014so\nscrupulous was that city in protecting the liberty of all its citizens.\nNay, even after he had left Rome and placed himself at the head of his\narmy, Lentulus and his other accomplices would not have been\nimprisoned, had not letters been found upon them clearly establishing\ntheir guilt. Hanno, the foremost citizen of Carthage, aspiring to\nabsolute power, on the occasion of the marriage of a daughter contrived\na plot for administering poison to the whole senate and so making\nhimself prince. The scheme being discovered, the senate took no steps\nagainst him beyond passing a law to limit the expense of banquets and\nmarriage ceremonies. So great was the respect they paid to his quality.\nTrue, the _execution_ of a plot against your country is attended with\ngreater difficulty and danger, since it seldom happens that, in\nconspiring against so many, your own resources are sufficient by\nthemselves; for it is not every one who, like C\u00e6sar, Agathocles, or\nCleomenes, is at the head of an army, so as to be able at a stroke, and\nby open force to make himself master of his country. To such as these,\ndoubtless, the path is safe and easy enough; but others who have not\nsuch an assembled force ready at their command, must effect their ends\neither by stratagem and fraud, or with the help of foreign troops. Of\nsuch stratagems and frauds we have an instance in the case of\nPisistratus the Athenian, who after defeating the Megarians and thereby\ngaining the favour of his fellow-citizens, showed himself to them one\nmorning covered with wounds and blood, declaring that he had been thus\noutraged through the jealousy of the nobles, and asking that he might\nhave an armed guard assigned for his protection. With the authority\nwhich this lent him, he easily rose to such a pitch of power as to\nbecome tyrant of Athens. In like manner Pandolfo Petrucci, on his\nreturn with the other exiles to Siena, was appointed the command of the\npublic guard, as a mere office of routine which others had declined.\nVery soon, however, this armed force gave him so much importance that\nhe became the supreme ruler of the State. And many others have followed\nother plans and methods, and in the course of time, and without\nincurring danger, have achieved their aim.\nConspirators against their country, whether trusting to their own\nforces or to foreign aid, have had more or less success in proportion\nas they have been favoured by Fortune. Catiline, of whom we spoke just\nnow, was overthrown. Hanno, who has also been mentioned, failing to\naccomplish his object by poison, armed his partisans to the number of\nmany thousands; but both he and they came to an ill end. On the other\nhand, certain citizens of Thebes conspiring to become its tyrants,\nsummoned a Spartan army to their assistance, and usurped the absolute\ncontrol of the city. In short, if we examine all the conspiracies which\nmen have engaged in against their country, we shall find that few or\nnone have been quelled in their inception, but that all have either\nsucceeded, or have broken down in their execution. Once executed, they\nentail no further risks beyond those implied in the nature of a\nprincedom. For the man who becomes a tyrant incurs all the natural and\nordinary dangers in which a tyranny involves him, and has no remedies\nagainst them save those of which I have already spoken.\nThis is all that occurs to me to say on the subject of conspiracies. If\nI have noticed those which have been carried out with the sword rather\nthan those wherein poison has been the instrument, it is because,\ngenerally speaking, the method of proceeding is the same in both. It is\ntrue, nevertheless, that conspiracies which are to be carried out by\npoison are, by reason of their uncertainty, attended by greater danger.\nFor since fewer opportunities offer for their execution, you must have\nan understanding with persons who can command opportunities. But it is\ndangerous to have to depend on others. Again, many causes may hinder a\npoisoned draught from proving mortal; as when the murderers of\nCommodus, on his vomiting the poison given him, had to strangle him.\nPrinces, then, have no worse enemy than conspiracy, for when a\nconspiracy is formed against them, it either carries them off, or\ndiscredits them: since, if it succeeds, they die; while, if it be\ndiscovered, and the conspirators be put to death themselves, it will\nalways be believed that the whole affair has been trumped up by the\nprince that he might glut his greed and cruelty with the goods and\nblood of those whom he has made away with. Let me not, however, forget\nto warn the prince or commonwealth against whom a conspiracy is\ndirected, that on getting word of it, and before taking any steps to\npunish it, they endeavour, as far as they can, to ascertain its\ncharacter, and after carefully weighing the strength of the\nconspirators with their own, on finding it preponderate, never suffer\ntheir knowledge of the plot to appear until they are ready with a force\nsufficient to crush it. For otherwise, to disclose their knowledge will\nonly give the signal for their destruction. They must strive therefore\nto seem unconscious of what is going on; for conspirators who see\nthemselves detected are driven forward by necessity and will stick at\nnothing. Of this precaution we have an example in Roman history, when\nthe officers of the two legions, who, as has already been mentioned,\nwere left behind to defend the Capuans from the Samnites, conspired\ntogether against the Capuans. For on rumours of this conspiracy\nreaching Rome, Rutilius the new consul was charged to see to it; who,\nnot to excite the suspicions of the conspirators, publicly gave out\nthat by order of the senate the Capuan legions were continued in their\nstation. The conspirators believing this, and thinking they would have\nample time to execute their plans, made no effort to hasten matters,\nbut remained at their ease, until they found that the consul was moving\none of the two legions to a distance from the other. This arousing\ntheir suspicion, led them to disclose their designs and endeavour to\ncarry them out.\nNow, we could have no more instructive example than this in whatever\nway we look at it. For it shows how slow men are to move in those\nmatters wherein time seems of little importance, and how active they\nbecome when necessity urges them. Nor can a prince or commonwealth\ndesiring for their own ends to retard the execution of a conspiracy,\nuse any more effectual means to do so, than by artfully holding out to\nthe conspirators some special opportunity as likely soon to present\nitself; awaiting which, and believing they have time and to spare for\nwhat they have to do, they will afford that prince or commonwealth all\nthe leisure needed to prepare for their punishment. Whosoever neglects\nthese precautions hastens his own destruction, as happened with the\nDuke of Athens, and with Guglielmo de\u2019 Pazzi. For the Duke, who had\nmade himself tyrant of Florence, on learning that he was being\nconspired against, without further inquiry into the matter, caused one\nof the conspirators to be seized; whereupon the rest at once armed\nthemselves and deprived him of his government. Guglielmo, again, being\ncommissary in the Val di Chiana in the year 1501, and learning that a\nconspiracy was being hatched in Arezzo to take the town from the\nFlorentines and give it over to the Vitelli, repaired thither with all\nhaste; and without providing himself with the necessary forces or\ngiving a thought to the strength of the conspirators, on the advice of\nthe bishop, his son, had one of them arrested. Which becoming known to\nthe others, they forthwith rushed to arms, and taking the town from the\nFlorentines, made Guglielmo their prisoner. Where, however,\nconspiracies are weak, they may and should be put down without scruple\nor hesitation.\nTwo methods, somewhat opposed to one another, which have occasionally\nbeen followed in dealing with conspiracies, are in no way to be\ncommended. One of these was that adopted by the Duke of Athens, of whom\nI have just now spoken, who to have it thought that he confided in the\ngoodwill of the Florentines, caused a certain man who gave information\nof a plot against him, to be put to death. The other was that followed\nby Dion the Syracusan, who, to sound the intentions of one whom he\nsuspected, arranged with Calippus, whom he trusted, to pretend to get\nup a conspiracy against him. Neither of these tyrants reaped any\nadvantage from the course he followed. For the one discouraged\ninformers and gave heart to those who were disposed to conspire, the\nother prepared an easy road to his own death, or rather was prime mover\nin a conspiracy against himself. As the event showed. For Calippus\nhaving free leave to plot against Dion, plotted to such effect, that he\ndeprived him at once of his State and life.\nCHAPTER VII.\u2014_Why it is that changes from Freedom to Servitude, and\nfrom Servitude to Freedom, are sometimes made without Bloodshed, but at\nother times reek with Blood_.\nSince we find from history that in the countless changes which have\nbeen made from freedom to servitude and from servitude to freedom,\nsometimes an infinite multitude have perished, while at others not a\nsoul has suffered (as when Rome made her change from kings to consuls,\non which occasion none was banished save Tarquin, and no harm was done\nto any other), it may perhaps be asked, how it happens that of these\nrevolutions, some have been attended by bloodshed and others not.\nThe answer I take to be this. The government which suffers change\neither has or has not had its beginning in violence. And since the\ngovernment which has its beginning in violence must start by inflicting\ninjuries on many, it must needs happen that on its downfall those who\nwere injured will desire to avenge themselves; from which desire for\nvengeance the slaughter and death of many will result. But when a\ngovernment originates with, and derives its authority from the whole\ncommunity, there is no reason why the community, if it withdraw that\nauthority, should seek to injure any except the prince from whom it\nwithdraws it. Now the government of Rome was of this nature, and the\nexpulsion of the Tarquins took place in this way. Of a like character\nwas the government of the Medici in Florence, and, accordingly, upon\ntheir overthrow in the year 1494, no injury was done to any save\nthemselves.\nIn such cases, therefore, the changes I speak of do not occasion any\nvery great danger. But the changes wrought by men who have wrongs to\nrevenge, are always of a most dangerous kind, and such, to say the\nleast, as may well cause dismay in the minds of those who read of them.\nBut since history abounds with instances of such changes I need say no\nmore about them.\nCHAPTER VIII.\u2014_That he who would effect Changes in a Commonwealth, must\ngive heed to its Character and Condition_\nI have said before that a bad citizen cannot work grave mischief in a\ncommonwealth which has not become corrupted. This opinion is not only\nsupported by the arguments already advanced, but is further confirmed\nby the examples of Spurius Cassius and Manlius Capitolinus. For\nSpurius, being ambitious, and desiring to obtain extraordinary\nauthority in Rome, and to win over the people by loading them with\nbenefits (as, for instance, by selling them those lands which the\nRomans had taken from the Hernici,) his designs were seen through by\nthe senate, and laid him under such suspicion, that when in haranguing\nthe people he offered them the money realized by the sale of the grain\nbrought from Sicily at the public expense, they would have none of it,\nbelieving that he offered it as the price of their freedom. Now, had\nthe people been corrupted, they would not have refused this bribe, but\nwould have opened rather than closed the way to the tyranny.\nThe example of Manlius is still more striking. For in his case we see\nwhat excellent gifts both of mind and body, and what splendid services\nto his country were afterwards cancelled by that shameful eagerness to\nreign which we find bred in him by his jealousy of the honours paid\nCamillus. For so darkened did his mind become, that without reflecting\nwhat were the institutions to which Rome was accustomed, or testing the\nmaterial he had to work on, when he would have seen that it was still\nunfit to be moulded to evil ends, he set himself to stir up tumults\nagainst the senate and against the laws of his country.\nAnd herein we recognize the excellence of this city of Rome, and of the\nmaterials whereof it was composed. For although the nobles were wont to\nstand up stoutly for one another, not one of them stirred to succour\nManlius, and not one of his kinsfolk made any effort on his behalf, so\nthat although it was customary, in the case of other accused persons,\nfor their friends to put on black and sordid raiment, with all the\nother outward signs of grief, in order to excite pity for the accused,\nnone was seen to do any of these things for Manlius. Even the tribunes\nof the people, though constantly ready to promote whatever courses\nseemed to favour the popular cause, and the more vehemently the more\nthey seemed to make against the nobles, in this instance sided with the\nnobles to put down the common enemy. Nay the very people themselves,\nkeenly alive to their own interests, and well disposed towards any\nattempt to damage the nobles, though they showed Manlius many proofs of\ntheir regard, nevertheless, when he was cited by the tribunes to appear\nbefore them and submit his cause for their decision, assumed the part\nof judges and not of defenders, and without scruple or hesitation\nsentenced him to die. Wherefore, I think, that there is no example in\nthe whole Roman history which serves so well as this to demonstrate the\nvirtues of all ranks in that republic. For not a man in the whole city\nbestirred himself to shield a citizen endowed with every great quality,\nand who, both publicly and privately, had done so much that deserved\npraise. But in all, the love of country outweighed every other thought,\nand all looked less to his past deserts than to the dangers which his\npresent conduct threatened; from which to relieve themselves they put\nhim to death. \u201c_Such_,\u201d says Livius, \u201c_was the fate of a man worthy our\nadmiration had he not been born in a free State_.\u201d\nAnd here two points should be noted. The first, that glory is to be\nsought by different methods in a corrupt city, and in one which still\npreserves its freedom. The second, which hardly differs from the first,\nthat in their actions, and especially in matters of moment, men must\nhave regard to times and circumstances and adapt themselves thereto.\nFor those persons who from an unwise choice, or from natural\ninclination, run counter to the times will for the most part live\nunhappily, and find all they undertake issue in failure; whereas those\nwho accommodate themselves to the times are fortunate and successful.\nAnd from the passage cited we may plainly infer, that had Manlius lived\nin the days of Marius and Sylla, when the body of the State had become\ncorrupted, so that he could have impressed it with the stamp of his\nambition, he might have had the same success as they had, and as those\nothers had who after them aspired to absolute power; and, conversely,\nthat if Sylla and Marius had lived in the days of Manlius, they must\nhave broken down at the very beginning of their attempts.\nFor one man, by mischievous arts and measures, may easily prepare the\nground for the universal corruption of a city; but no one man in his\nlifetime can carry that corruption so far, as himself to reap the\nharvest; or granting that one man\u2019s life might be long enough for this\npurpose, it would be impossible for him, having regard to the ordinary\nhabits of men, who grow impatient and cannot long forego the\ngratification of their desires, to wait until the corruption was\ncomplete. Moreover, men deceive themselves in respect of their own\naffairs, and most of all in respect of those on which they are most\nbent; so that either from impatience or from self-deception, they rush\nupon undertakings for which the time is not ripe, and so come to an ill\nend. Wherefore to obtain absolute authority in a commonwealth and to\ndestroy its liberties, you must find the body of the State already\ncorrupted, and corrupted by a gradual wasting continued from generation\nto generation; which, indeed, takes place necessarily, unless, as has\nbeen already explained, the State be often reinforced by good examples,\nor brought back to its first beginnings by wise laws.\nManlius, therefore, would have been a rare and renowned man had he been\nborn in a corrupt city; and from his example we see that citizens\nseeking to introduce changes in the form of their government, whether\nin favour of liberty or despotism, ought to consider what materials\nthey have to deal with, and then judge of the difficulty of their task.\nFor it is no less arduous and dangerous to attempt to free a people\ndisposed to live in servitude, than to enslave a people who desire to\nlive free.\nAnd because it has been said above, that in their actions men must take\ninto account the character of the times in which they live, and guide\nthemselves accordingly, I shall treat this point more fully in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER IX.\u2014_That to enjoy constant good Fortune we must change with\nthe Times._\nI have repeatedly noted that the good or bad fortune of men depends on\nwhether their methods of acting accord with the character of the times.\nFor we see that in what they do some men act impulsively, others warily\nand with caution. And because, from inability to preserve the just\nmean, they in both of these ways overstep the true limit, they commit\nmistakes in one direction or the other. He, however, will make fewest\nmistakes, and may expect to prosper most, who, while following the\ncourse to which nature inclines him, finds, as I have said, his method\nof acting in accordance with the times in which he lives.\nAll know that in his command of the Roman armies, Fabius Maximus\ndisplayed a prudence and caution very different from the audacity and\nhardihood natural to his countrymen; and it was his good fortune that\nhis methods suited with the times. For Hannibal coming into Italy in\nall the flush of youth and recent success, having already by two\ndefeats stripped Rome of her best soldiers and filled her with dismay,\nnothing could have been more fortunate for that republic than to find a\ngeneral able, by his deliberateness and caution, to keep the enemy at\nbay. Nor, on the other hand, could Fabius have fallen upon times better\nsuited to the methods which he used, and by which he crowned himself\nwith glory. That he acted in accordance with his natural bent, and not\nfrom a reasoned choice, we may gather from this, that when Scipio, to\nbring the war to an end, proposed to pass with his army into Africa,\nFabius, unable to depart from his characteristic methods and habits,\nstrenuously opposed him; so that had it rested with him, Hannibal might\nnever have left Italy. For he perceived not that the times had changed,\nand that with them it was necessary to change the methods of\nprosecuting the war. Had Fabius, therefore, been King of Rome, he might\nwell have caused the war to end unhappily, not knowing how to\naccommodate his methods to the change in the times. As it was, he lived\nin a commonwealth in which there were many citizens, and many different\ndispositions; and which as it produced a Fabius, excellent at a time\nwhen it was necessary to protract hostilities, so also, afterwards gave\nbirth to a Scipio, at a time suited to bring them to a successful\nclose.\nAnd hence it comes that a commonwealth endures longer, and has a more\nsustained good fortune than a princedom, because from the diversity in\nthe characters of its citizens, it can adapt itself better than a\nprince can to the diversity of times. For, as I have said before, a man\naccustomed to follow one method, will never alter it; whence it must\nneeds happen that when times change so as no longer to accord with his\nmethod, he will be ruined. Piero Soderini, of whom I have already\nspoken, was guided in all his actions by patience and gentleness, and\nhe and his country prospered while the times were in harmony with these\nmethods. But, afterwards, when a time came when it behoved him to have\ndone with patience and gentleness, he knew not how to drop them, and\nwas ruined together with his country. Pope Julius II., throughout the\nwhole of his pontificate, was governed by impulse and passion, and\nbecause the times were in perfect accord, all his undertakings\nprospered. But had other times come requiring other qualities, he could\nnot have escaped destruction, since he could not have changed his\nmethods nor his habitual line of conduct.\nAs to why such changes are impossible, two reasons may be given. One is\nthat we cannot act in opposition to the bent of our nature. The other,\nthat when a man has been very successful while following a particular\nmethod, he can never be convinced that it is for his advantage to try\nsome other. And hence it results that a man\u2019s fortunes vary, because\ntimes change and he does not change with them. So, too, with\ncommonwealths, which, as we have already shown at length, are ruined\nfrom not altering their institutions to suit the times. And\ncommonwealths are slower to change than princes are, changes costing\nthem more effort; because occasions must be waited for which shall stir\nthe whole community, and it is not enough that a single citizen alters\nhis method of acting.\nBut since I have made mention of Fabius Maximus who wore out Hannibal\nby keeping him at bay, I think it opportune to consider in the\nfollowing Chapter whether a general who desires to engage his enemy at\nall risks, can be prevented by that enemy from doing so.\nCHAPTER X.\u2014_That a Captain cannot escape Battle when his Enemy forces\nit on him at all risks._\n\u201c_Cneius Sulpitius when appointed dictator against the Gauls, being\nunwilling to tempt Fortune by attacking an enemy whom delay and a\ndisadvantageous position would every day render weaker, protracted the\nwar._\u201d\nWhen a mistake is made of a sort that all or most men are likely to\nfall into, I think it not amiss to mark it again and again with\ndisapproval. Wherefore, although I have already shown repeatedly how in\naffairs of moment the actions of the moderns conform not to those of\nantiquity, still it seems to me not superfluous, in this place, to say\nthe same thing once more. For if in any particular the moderns have\ndeviated from the methods of the ancients, it is especially in their\nmethods of warfare, wherein not one of those rules formerly so much\nesteemed is now attended to. And this because both princes and\ncommonwealths have devolved the charge of such matters upon others,\nand, to escape danger, have kept aloof from all military service; so\nthat although one or another of the princes of our times may\noccasionally be seen present in person with his army, we are not\ntherefore to expect from him any further praiseworthy behaviour. For\neven where such personages take part in any warlike enterprise, they do\nso out of ostentation and from no nobler motive; though doubtless from\nsometimes seeing their soldiers face to face, and from retaining to\nthemselves the title of command, they are likely to make fewer blunders\nthan we find made by republics, and most of all by the republics of\nItaly, which though altogether dependent upon others, and themselves\nutterly ignorant of everything relating to warfare, do yet, that they\nmay figure as the commanders of their armies, take upon them to direct\ntheir movements, and in doing so commit countless mistakes; some of\nwhich have been considered elsewhere but one is of such importance as\nto deserve notice here.\nWhen these sluggard princes or effeminate republics send forth any of\ntheir Captains, it seems to them that the wisest instruction they can\ngive him is to charge him on no account to give battle, but, on the\ncontrary, to do what he can to avoid fighting. Wherein they imagine\nthemselves to imitate the prudence of Fabius Maximus, who by\nprotracting the war with Hannibal, saved the Roman commonwealth; not\nperceiving that in most instances such advice to a captain is either\nuseless or hurtful. For the truth of the matter is, that a captain who\nwould keep the field, cannot decline battle when his adversary forces\nit on him at all hazards. So that the instruction to avoid battle is\nbut tantamount to saying, \u201cYou shall engage when it pleases your enemy,\nand not when it suits yourself.\u201d For if you would keep the field and\nyet avoid battle, the only safe course is to interpose a distance of at\nleast fifty miles between you and your enemy, and afterwards to\nmaintain so vigilant a look-out, that should he advance you will have\ntime to make your retreat. Another method is to shut yourself up in\nsome town. But both of these methods are extremely disadvantageous. For\nby following the former, you leave your country a prey to the enemy,\nand a valiant prince would far sooner risk the chances of battle than\nprolong a war in a manner so disastrous to his subjects; while by\nadopting the latter method, and shutting yourself up in a town with\nyour army, there is manifest danger of your being besieged, and\npresently reduced by famine and forced to surrender. Wherefore it is\nmost mischievous to seek to avoid battle in either of these two ways.\nTo intrench yourself in a strong position, as Fabius was wont to do, is\na good method when your army is so formidable that the enemy dare not\nadvance to attack you in your intrenchments; yet it cannot truly be\nsaid that Fabius avoided battle, but rather that he sought to give\nbattle where he could do so with advantage. For had Hannibal desired to\nfight, Fabius would have waited for him and fought him. But Hannibal\nnever dared to engage him on his own ground. So that an engagement was\navoided as much by Hannibal as by Fabius, since if either had been\nminded to fight at all hazards the other would have been constrained to\ntake one of three courses, that is to say, one or other of the two just\nnow mentioned, or else to retreat. The truth of this is confirmed by\nnumberless examples, and more particularly by what happened in the war\nwaged by the Romans against Philip of Macedon, the father of Perseus.\nFor Philip being invaded by the Romans, resolved not to give them\nbattle; and to avoid battle, sought at first to do as Fabius had done\nin Italy, posting himself on the summit of a hill, where he intrenched\nhimself strongly, thinking that the Romans would not venture to attack\nhim there. But they advancing and attacking him in his intrenchments,\ndrove him from his position; when, unable to make further resistance,\nhe fled with the greater part of his army, and was only saved from\nutter destruction by the difficulty of the ground, which made it\nimpossible for the Romans to pursue him.\nPhilip, therefore, who had no mind to fight, encamping too near the\nRomans, was forced to fly; and learning from this experience that to\nescape fighting it was not enough for him to intrench himself on a\nhill, yet not choosing to shut himself up in a walled town, he was\nconstrained to take the other alternative of keeping at a distance of\nmany miles from the Roman legions. Accordingly, when the Romans entered\none province, he betook himself to another, and when they left a\nprovince he entered it. But perceiving that by protracting the war in\nthis way, his condition grew constantly worse, while his subjects\nsuffered grievously, now from his own troops, at another time from\nthose of the enemy, he at last resolved to hazard battle, and so came\nto a regular engagement with the Romans.\nIt is for your interest, therefore, not to fight, when you possess the\nsame advantages as Fabius, or as Cneius Sulpitius had; in other words,\nwhen your army is so formidable in itself that the enemy dare not\nattack you in your intrenchments, and although he has got within your\nterritory has yet gained no footing there, and suffers in consequence\nfrom the want of necessary supplies. In such circumstances delay is\nuseful, for the reasons assigned by Titus Livius when speaking of\nSulpitius. In no other circumstances, however, can an engagement be\navoided without dishonour or danger. For to retire as Philip did, is\nnothing else than defeat; and the disgrace is greater in proportion as\nyour valour has been less put to the proof. And if Philip was lucky\nenough to escape, another, not similarly favoured by the nature of the\nground, might not have the same good fortune.\nThat Hannibal was not a master in the arts of warfare there is none\nwill venture to maintain. Wherefore, when he had to encounter Scipio in\nAfrica, it may be assumed that had he seen any advantage in prolonging\nthe war he would have done so; and, possibly, being a skilful captain\nand in command of a valiant army, he might have been able to do what\nFabius did in Italy. But since he took not that course, we may infer\nthat he was moved by sufficient reasons. For the captain who has got an\narmy together, and perceives that from want of money or friends he\ncannot maintain it long, must be a mere madman if he do not at once,\nand before his army melts away, try the fortunes of battle; since he is\ncertain to lose by delay, while by fighting he may chance to succeed.\nAnd there is this also to be kept in view, that we must strive, even if\nwe be defeated, to gain glory; and that more glory is to be won in\nbeing beaten by force, than in a defeat from any other cause. And this\nwe may suppose to have weighed with Hannibal. On the other hand,\nsupposing Hannibal to have declined battle, Scipio, even if he had\nlacked courage to follow him up and attack him in his intrenched camp,\nwould not have suffered thereby; for as he had defeated Syphax, and got\npossession of many of the African towns, he could have rested where he\nwas in the same security and with the same convenience as if he had\nbeen in Italy. But this was not the case with Hannibal when he had to\nencounter Fabius, nor with the Gauls when they were opposed to\nSulpitius.\nLeast of all can he decline battle who invades with his army the\ncountry of another; for seeking to enter his enemy\u2019s country, he must\nfight whenever the enemy comes forward to meet him; and is under still\ngreater necessity to fight, if he undertake the siege of any town. As\nhappened in our own day with Duke Charles of Burgundy, who, when\nbeleaguering Morat, a town of the Swiss, was by them attacked and\nrouted; or as happened with the French army encamped against Novara,\nwhich was in like manner defeated by the Swiss.\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014_That one who has to contend with many, though he be weaker\nthan they, will prevail if he can withstand their first onset._\nThe power exercised in Rome by the tribunes of the people was great,\nand, as I have repeatedly explained, was necessary, since otherwise\nthere would have been no check on the ambition of the nobles, and the\ncommonwealth must have grown corrupted far sooner than it did. But\nbecause, as I have said elsewhere, there is in everything a latent evil\npeculiar to it, giving rise to new mischances, it becomes necessary to\nprovide against these by new ordinances. The authority of the tribunes,\ntherefore, being insolently asserted so as to become formidable to the\nnobility and to the entire city, disorders dangerous to the liberty of\nthe State must thence have resulted, had not a method been devised by\nAppius Claudius for controlling the ambition of the tribunes. This was,\nto secure that there should always be one of their number timid, or\nvenal, or else a lover of the general good, who could be influenced to\noppose the rest whenever these sought to pass any measure contrary to\nthe wishes of the senate. This remedy was a great restraint on the\nexcessive authority of the tribunes, and on many occasions proved\nserviceable to Rome.\nI am led by this circumstance to remark, that when many powerful\npersons are united against one, who, although no match for the others\ncollectively, is also powerful, the chances are more in favour of this\nsingle and less I powerful person, than of the many who together are\nmuch stronger. For setting aside an infinity of accidents which can be\nturned to better account by one than by many, it will always happen\nthat, by exercising a little dexterity, the one will be able to divide\nthe many, and weaken the force which was strong while it was united. In\nproof whereof, I shall not refer to ancient examples, though many such\nmight be cited, but content myself with certain modern instances taken\nfrom the events of our own times.\nIn the year 1484, all Italy combined against the Venetians, who finding\ntheir position desperate, and being unable to keep their army any\nlonger in the field, bribed Signer Lodovico, who then governed Milan,\nand so succeeded in effecting a settlement, whereby they not only\nrecovered the towns they had lost, but also obtained for themselves a\npart of the territories of Ferrara; so that those were by peace the\ngainers, who in war had been the losers. Not many years ago the whole\nworld was banded together against France; but before the war came to a\nclose, Spain breaking with the confederates and entering into a\nseparate treaty with France, the other members of the league also, were\npresently forced to make terms.\nWherefore we may always assume when we see a war set on foot by many\nagainst one, that this one, if he have strength to withstand the first\nshock, and can temporize and wait his opportunity, is certain to\nprevail. But unless he can do this he runs a thousand dangers: as did\nthe Venetians in the year 1508, who, could they have temporized with\nthe French, and so got time to conciliate some of those who had\ncombined against them, might have escaped the ruin which then overtook\nthem. But not possessing such a strong army as would have enabled them\nto temporize with their enemies, and consequently not having the time\nneeded for gaining any to their side, they were undone. Yet we know\nthat the Pope, as soon as he had obtained what he wanted, made friends\nwith them, and that Spain did the like; and that both the one and the\nother of these powers would gladly have saved the Lombard territory for\nthemselves, nor would, if they could have helped it, have left it to\nFrance, so as to augment her influence in Italy.\nThe Venetians, therefore, should have given up a part to save the rest;\nand had they done so at a time when the surrender would not have seemed\nto be made under compulsion, and before any step had been taken in the\ndirection of war, it would have been a most prudent course; although\ndiscreditable and probably of little avail after war had been begun.\nBut until the war broke out, few of the Venetian citizens recognized\nthe danger, fewer still the remedy, and none ventured to prescribe it.\nBut to return to the point whence we started, I say that the same\nsafeguard for their country which the Roman senate found against the\nambition of the tribunes in their number, is within the reach of the\nprince who is attacked by many adversaries, if he only know to use\nprudently those methods which promote division.\nCHAPTER XII.\u2014_A prudent Captain will do what he can to make it\nnecessary for his own Soldiers to fight, and to relieve his Enemy from\nthat necessity._\nElsewhere I have noted how greatly men are governed in what they do by\nNecessity, and how much of their renown is due to her guidance, so that\nit has even been said by some philosophers, that the hands and tongues\nof men, the two noblest instruments of their fame, would never have\nworked to perfection, nor have brought their labours to that pitch of\nexcellence we see them to have reached, had they not been impelled by\nthis cause. The captains of antiquity, therefore, knowing the virtues\nof this necessity, and seeing the steadfast courage which it gave their\nsoldiers in battle, spared no effort to bring their armies under its\ninfluence, while using all their address to loosen its hold upon their\nenemies. For which reason, they would often leave open to an adversary\nsome way which they might have closed, and close against their own men\nsome way they might have left open.\nWhosoever, therefore, would have a city defend itself stubbornly, or an\narmy fight resolutely in the field, must before all things endeavour to\nimpress the minds of those whom he commands with the belief that no\nother course is open to them. In like manner a prudent captain who\nundertakes the attack of a city, will measure the ease or difficulty of\nhis enterprise, by knowing and considering the nature of the necessity\nwhich compels the inhabitants to defend it; and where he finds that\nnecessity to be strong, he may infer that his task will be difficult,\nbut if otherwise, that it will be easy.\nAnd hence it happens that cities are harder to be recovered after a\nrevolt than to be taken for the first time. Because on a first attack,\nhaving no occasion to fear punishment, since they have given no ground\nof offence, they readily surrender; but when they have revolted, they\nknow that they have given ground of offence, and, fearing punishment,\nare not so easily brought under. A like stubbornness grows from the\nnatural hostility with which princes or republics who are neighbours\nregard one another; which again is caused by the desire to dominate\nover those who live near, or from jealousy of their power. This is more\nparticularly the case with republics, as in Tuscany for example; for\ncontention and rivalry have always made, and always will make it\nextremely hard for one republic to bring another into subjection. And\nfor this reason any one who considers attentively who are the\nneighbours of Florence, and who of Venice, will not marvel so much as\nsome have done, that Florence should have spent more than Venice on her\nwars and gained less; since this results entirely from the Venetians\nfinding their neighbouring towns less obstinate in their resistance\nthan the Florentines theirs. For all the towns in the neighbourhood of\nVenice have been used to live under princes and not in freedom; and\nthose who are used to servitude commonly think little of changing\nmasters, nay are often eager for the change. In this way Venice, though\nshe has had more powerful neighbours than Florence, has been able, from\nfinding their towns less stubborn, to subdue them more easily than the\nlatter, surrounded exclusively by free cities, has had it in her power\nto do.\nBut, to return to the matter in hand, the captain who attacks a town\nshould use what care he can, not to drive the defenders to extremities,\nlest he render them stubborn; but when they fear punishment should\npromise them pardon, and when they fear for their freedom should assure\nthem that he has no designs against the common welfare, but only\nagainst a few ambitious men in their city; for such assurances have\noften smoothed the way to the surrender of towns. And although pretexts\nof this sort are easily seen through, especially by the wise, the mass\nof the people are often beguiled by them, because desiring present\ntranquillity, they shut their eyes to the snares hidden behind these\nspecious promises. By means such as these, therefore, cities\ninnumerable have been brought into subjection, as recently was the case\nwith Florence. The ruin of Crassus and his army was similarly caused:\nfor although he himself saw through the empty promises of the\nParthians, as meant only to blind the Roman soldiers to the necessity\nof defending themselves, yet he could not keep his men steadfast, they,\nas we clearly gather in reading the life of this captain, being\ndeceived by the offers of peace held out to them by their enemies.\nOn the other hand, when the Samnites, who, at the instance of a few\nambitious men, and in violation of the terms of the truce made with\nthem, had overrun and pillaged lands belonging to the allies of Rome,\nafterwards sent envoys to Rome to implore peace, offering to restore\nwhatever they had taken, and to surrender the authors of these injuries\nand outrages as prisoners, and these offers were rejected by the\nRomans, and the envoys returned to Samnium bringing with them no hope\nof an adjustment, Claudius Pontius, who then commanded the army of the\nSamnites, showed them in a remarkable speech, that the Romans desired\nwar at all hazards, and declared that, although for the sake of his\ncountry he wished for peace, necessity constrained him to prepare for\nwar; telling them \u201c_that was a just war which could not be escaped, and\nthose arms sacred in which lay their only hopes._\u201d And building on this\nnecessity, he raised in the minds of his soldiers a confident\nexpectation of success. That I may not have to revert to this matter\nagain, it will be convenient to notice here those examples from Roman\nhistory which most merit attention. When Caius Manilius was in command\nof the legions encamped against Veii, a division of the Veientine army\nhaving got within the Roman intrenchments, Manilius ran forward with a\ncompany of his men to defend them, and, to prevent the escape of the\nVeientines, guarded all the approaches to the camp. The Veientines\nfinding themselves thus shut in, began to fight with such fury that\nthey slew Manilius, and would have destroyed all the rest of the Roman\narmy, had not the prudence of one of the tribunes opened a way for the\nVeientines to retreat. Here we see that so long as necessity compelled,\nthe Veientines fought most fiercely, but on finding a path opened for\nescape, preferred flight to combat. On another occasion when the\nVolscians and Equians passed with their armies across the Roman\nfrontier, the consuls were sent out to oppose them, and an engagement\nensued. It so happened that when the combat was at its height, the army\nof the Volscians, commanded by Vectius Mescius, suddenly found\nthemselves shut in between their own camp, which a division of the\nRomans had occupied, and the body of the Roman army; when seeing that\nthey must either perish or cut a way for themselves with their swords,\nVectius said to them, \u201c_Come on, my men, here is no wall or rampart to\nbe scaled: we fight man with man; in valour we are their equals, and\nnecessity, that last and mightiest weapon, gives us the advantage._\u201d\nHere, then, necessity is spoken of by Titus Livius as _the last and\nmightiest weapon_.\nCamillus, the wisest and most prudent of all the Roman commanders, when\nhe had got within the town of Veii with his army, to make its surrender\neasier and not to drive its inhabitants to desperation, called out to\nhis men, so that the Veientines might hear, to spare all whom they\nfound unarmed. Whereupon the defenders throwing away their weapons, the\ntown was taken almost without bloodshed. And this device was afterwards\nfollowed by many other captains.\nCHAPTER XIII.\u2014_Whether we may trust more to a valiant Captain with a\nweak Army, or to a valiant Army with a weak Captain._\nCoriolanus being banished from Rome betook himself to the Volscians,\nand when he had got together an army wherewith to avenge himself on his\ncountrymen, came back to Rome; yet, again withdrew, not constrained to\nretire by the might of the Roman arms, but out of reverence for his\nmother. From this incident, says Titus Livius, we may learn that the\nspread of the Roman power was due more to the valour of her captains\nthan of her soldiers. For before this the Volscians had always been\nrouted, and only grew successful when Coriolanus became their captain.\nBut though Livius be of this opinion, there are many passages in his\nhistory to show that the Roman soldiers, even when left without\nleaders, often performed astonishing feats of valour, nay, sometimes\nmaintained better discipline and fought with greater spirit after their\nconsuls were slain than they had before. For example, the army under\nthe Scipios in Spain, after its two leaders had fallen, was able by its\nvalour not merely to secure its own safety, but to overcome the enemy\nand preserve the province for the Roman Republic. So that to state the\ncase fairly, we find many instances in which the valour of the soldiers\nalone gained the day, as well as many in which success was wholly due\nto the excellence of the captain. From which it may be inferred that\nthe one stands in need of the other.\nAnd here the question suggests itself: which is the more formidable, a\ngood army badly led, or a good captain commanding an indifferent army;\nthough, were we to adopt the opinion of C\u00e6sar on this head, we ought\nlightly to esteem both. For when C\u00e6sar went to Spain against Afranius\nand Petreius, who were there in command of a strong army, he made\nlittle account of them, saying, \u201c_that he went to fight an army without\na captain_,\u201d indicating thereby the weakness of these generals. And,\nconversely, when he went to encounter Pompeius in Thessaly, he said,\n\u201c_I go against a captain without an army_.\u201d[13]\n[13] Professus ante inter suos, ire se ad exercitum sine duce, et inde\nreversurum ad ducem sine exercitu. (_Suet. in Vita J. Caes._)\nA further question may also be raised, whether it is easier for a good\ncaptain to make a good army, or for a good army to make a good captain.\nAs to this it might be thought there was barely room for doubt, since\nit ought to be far easier for many who are good to find one who is good\nor teach him to become so, than for one who is good to find or make\nmany good. Lucullus when sent against Mithridates was wholly without\nexperience in war: but his brave army, which was provided with many\nexcellent officers, speedily taught him to be a good captain. On the\nother hand, when the Romans, being badly off for soldiers, armed a\nnumber of slaves and gave them over to be drilled by Sempronius\nGracchus, he in a short time made them into a serviceable army. So too,\nas I have already mentioned, Pelopidas and Epaminondas after rescuing\nThebes, their native city, from Spartan thraldom, in a short time made\nsuch valiant soldiers of the Theban peasantry, as to be able with their\naid not only to withstand, but even to defeat the Spartan armies. So\nthat the question may seem to be equally balanced, excellence on one\nside generally finding excellence on the other.\nA good army, however, when left without a good leader, as the\nMacedonian army was on the death of Alexander, or as those veterans\nwere who had fought in the civil wars, is apt to grow restless and\nturbulent. Wherefore I am convinced that it is better to trust to the\ncaptain who has time allowed him to discipline his men, and means\nwherewith to equip them, than to a tumultuary host with a chance leader\nof its own choosing. But twofold is the merit and twofold the glory of\nthose captains who not only have had to subdue their enemies, but also\nbefore encountering them to organize and discipline their forces. This,\nhowever, is a task requiring qualities so seldom combined, that were\nmany of those captains who now enjoy a great name with the world,\ncalled on to perform it, they would be much less thought of than they\nare.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014_Of the effect produced in Battle by strange and\nunexpected Sights or Sounds._\nThat the disorder occasioned by strange and unexpected sights or sounds\nmay have momentous consequences in combat, might be shown by many\ninstances, but by none better than by what befell in the battle fought\nbetween the Romans and the Volscians, when Quintius, the Roman general,\nseeing one wing of his army begin to waver, shouted aloud to his men to\nstand firm, for the other wing was already victorious. Which words of\nhis giving confidence to his own troops and striking the enemy with\ndismay won him the battle. But if a cry like this, produce great effect\non a well disciplined army, far greater must be its effect on one which\nis ill disciplined and disorderly. For by such a wind the whole mass\nwill be moved, as I shall show by a well-known instance happening in\nour own times.\nA few years ago the city of Perugia was split into the two factions of\nthe Baglioni and the Oddi, the former holding the government, the\nlatter being in exile. The Oddeschi, however, with the help of friends,\nhaving got together an armed force which they lodged in villages of\ntheir own near Perugia, obtained, by the favour of some of their party,\nan entrance into the city by night, and moving forward without\ndiscovery, came as far as the public square. And as all the streets of\nPerugia are barred with chains drawn across them at their corners, the\nOddeschi had in front of them a man who carried an iron hammer\nwherewith to break the fastenings of the chains so that horsemen might\npass. When the only chain remaining unbroken was that which closed the\npublic square, the alarm having now been given, the hammerman was so\nimpeded by the crowd pressing behind him that he could not raise his\narm to strike freely. Whereupon, to get more room for his work, he\ncalled aloud to the others to stand back; and the word back passing\nfrom rank to rank those furthest off began to run, and, presently, the\nothers also, with such precipitancy, that they fell into utter\ndisorder. In this way, and from this trifling circumstance, the attempt\nof the Oddeschi came to nothing.\nHere we may note that discipline is needed in an army, not so much to\nenable it to fight according to a settled order, as that it may not be\nthrown into confusion by every insignificant accident. For a tumultuary\nhost is useless in war, simply because every word, or cry, or sound,\nmay throw it into a panic and cause it to fly. Wherefore it behoves a\ngood captain to provide that certain fixed persons shall receive his\norders and pass them on to the rest, and to accustom his soldiers to\nlook to these persons, and to them only, to be informed what his orders\nare. For whenever this precaution is neglected the gravest mishaps are\nconstantly seen to ensue.\nAs regards strange and unexpected sights, every captain should\nendeavour while his army is actually engaged with the enemy, to effect\nsome such feint or diversion as will encourage his own men and dismay\nhis adversary since this of all things that can happen is the likeliest\nto ensure victory. In evidence whereof we may cite the example of\nCneius Sulpitius, the Roman dictator, who, when about to give battle to\nthe Gauls, after arming his sutlers and camp followers, mounted them on\nmules and other beasts of burden, furnished them with spears and\nbanners to look like cavalry, and placing them behind a hill, ordered\nthem on a given signal, when the fight was at the hottest, to appear\nand show themselves to the enemy. All which being carried out as he had\narranged, threw the Gauls into such alarm, that they lost the battle.\nA good captain, therefore, has two things to see to: first, to contrive\nhow by some sudden surprise he may throw his enemy into confusion; and\nnext, to be prepared should the enemy use a like stratagem against him\nto discover and defeat it; as the stratagem of Semiramis was defeated\nby the King of India. For Semiramis seeing that this king had elephants\nin great numbers, to dismay him by showing that she, too, was well\nsupplied, caused the skins of many oxen and buffaloes to be sewn\ntogether in the shape of elephants and placed upon camels and sent to\nthe front. But the trick being detected by the king, turned out not\nonly useless but hurtful to its contriver. In a battle which the\nDictator Mamercus fought against the people of Fidenae, the latter, to\nstrike terror into the minds of the Romans, contrived that while the\ncombat raged a number of soldiers should issue from Fidenae bearing\nlances tipped with fire, thinking that the Romans, disturbed by so\nstrange a sight, would be thrown into confusion.\nWe are to note, however, with regard to such contrivances, that if they\nare to serve any useful end, they should _be_ formidable as well as\n_seem_ so; for when they menace a real danger, their weak points are\nnot so soon discerned. When they have more of pretence than reality, it\nwill be well either to dispense with them altogether, or resorting to\nthem, to keep them, like the muleteers of Sulpitius, in the background,\nso that they be not too readily found out. For any weakness inherent in\nthem is soon discovered if they be brought near, when, as happened with\nthe elephants of Semiramis and the fiery spears of the men of Fidenae,\nthey do harm rather than good. For although by this last-mentioned\ndevice the Romans at the first were somewhat disconcerted, so soon as\nthe dictator came up and began to chide them, asking if they were not\nashamed to fly like bees from smoke, and calling on them to turn on\ntheir enemy, and \u201c_with her own flames efface that Fidenae whom their\nbenefits could not conciliate_,\u201d they took courage; so that the device\nproved of no service to its contrivers, who were vanquished in the\nbattle.\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014_That one and not many should head an Army: and why it is\nharmful to have more Leaders than one._\nThe men of Fidenae rising against the colonists whom the Romans had\nsettled among them, and putting them to the sword, the Romans to avenge\nthe insult appointed four tribunes with consular powers: one of whom\nthey retained to see to the defence of Rome, while the other three were\nsent against the Fidenati and the Veientines. But these three falling\nout among themselves, and being divided in their counsels, returned\nfrom their mission with discredit though not with loss. Of which\ndiscredit they were themselves the cause. That they sustained no loss\nwas due to the valour of their soldiers But the senate perceiving the\nsource of the mischief, to the end that one man might put to rights\nwhat three had thrown into confusion, resorted to the appointment of a\ndictator.\nHere we see the disadvantage of having several leaders in one army or\nin a town which has to defend itself. And the case could not be put in\nclearer words than by Titus Livius, where he says, \u201c_The three tribunes\nwith consular authority gave proof how hurtful it is in war to have\nmany leaders; for each forming a different opinion, and each abiding by\nhis own, they threw opportunities in the way of their enemies._\u201d And\nthough this example suffice by itself to show the disadvantage in war\nof divided commands, to make the matter still plainer I shall cite two\nfurther instances, one ancient and one modern.\nIn the year 1500, Louis XII. of France, after recovering Milan, sent\ntroops to restore Pisa to the Florentines, Giovambattista Ridolfi and\nLuca d\u2019Antonio Albizzi going with them as commissaries. Now, because\nGiovambattista had a great name, and was older than Luca, the latter\nleft the whole management of everything to him; and although he did not\nshow his jealousy of him by opposing him, he betrayed it by his\nsilence, and by being so careless and indifferent about everything,\nthat he gave no help in the business of the siege either by word or\ndeed, just as though he had been a person of no account. But when, in\nconsequence of an accident, Giovambattista had to return to Florence,\nall this was changed; for Luca, remaining in sole charge, behaved with\nthe greatest courage, prudence, and zeal, all which qualities had been\nhidden while he held a joint command. Further to bear me out I shall\nagain borrow the words of Titus Livius, who, in relating how when\nQuintius and Agrippa his colleague were sent by the Romans against the\nEquians, Agrippa contrived that the conduct of the war should rest with\nQuintius, observes, \u201c_Most wholesome is it that in affairs of great\nmoment, supreme authority be vested in one man._\u201d Very different,\nhowever, is the course followed by the republics and princes of our own\ndays, who, thinking to be better served, are used to appoint several\ncaptains or commissioners to fill one command; a practice giving rise\nto so much confusion, that were we seeking for the causes of the\noverthrow of the French and Italian armies in recent times, we should\nfind this to be the most active of any.\nRightly, therefore, may we conclude that in sending forth an army upon\nservice, it is wiser to entrust it to one man of ordinary prudence,\nthan to two of great parts but with a divided command.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014_That in Times of Difficulty true Worth is sought after;\nwhereas in quiet Times it is not the most deserving, but those who are\nrecommended by Wealth or Connection who are most in favour._\nIt always has happened and always will, that the great and admirable\nmen of a republic are neglected in peaceful times; because at such\nseasons many citizens are found, who, envying the reputation these men\nhave justly earned, seek to be regarded not merely as their equals but\nas their superiors. Touching this there is a notable passage in\nThucydides, the Greek historian, where he tells how the republic of\nAthens coming victorious out of the Peloponessian war, wherein she had\nbridled the pride of Sparta, and brought almost the whole of Greece\nunder her authority, was encouraged by the greatness of her renown to\npropose to herself the conquest of Sicily. In Athens this scheme was\nmuch debated, Alcibiades and certain others who had the public welfare\nvery little in their thoughts, but who hoped that the enterprise, were\nthey placed in command, might minister to their fame, recommending that\nit should be undertaken. Nicias, on the other hand, one of the best\nesteemed of the Athenian citizens, was against it, and in addressing\nthe people, gave it as the strongest reason for trusting his advice,\nthat in advising them not to engage in this war, he urged what was not\nfor his own advantage; for he knew that while Athens remained at peace\nnumberless citizens were ready to take precedence of him: whereas, were\nwar declared, he was certain that none would rank before him or even be\nlooked upon as his equal.\nHere we see that in tranquil times republics are subject to the\ninfirmity of lightly esteeming their worthiest citizens. And this\noffends these persons for two reasons: first, because they are not\ngiven the place they deserve; and second, because they see unworthy men\nand of abilities inferior to their own, as much or more considered than\nthey. Injustice such as this has caused the ruin of many republics. For\ncitizens who find themselves undeservedly slighted, and perceive the\ncause to be that the times are tranquil and not troubled, will strive\nto change the times by stirring up wars hurtful to the public welfare.\nWhen I look for remedies for this state of things, I find two: first,\nto keep the citizens poor, so that wealth without worth shall corrupt\nneither them nor others; second, to be so prepared for war as always to\nbe ready to make war; for then there will always be a need for worthy\ncitizens, as was the case in Rome in early times. For as Rome\nconstantly kept her armies in the field, there was constant opportunity\nfor men to display their valour, nor was it possible to deprive a\ndeserving man of his post and give it to another who was not deserving.\nOr if ever this were done by inadvertency, or by way of experiment,\nthere forthwith resulted such disorder and danger, that the city at\nonce retraced its steps and reverted to the true path. But other\nrepublics which are not regulated on the same plan, and make war only\nwhen driven to it by necessity, cannot help committing this injustice,\nnay, will constantly run into it, when, if the great citizen who finds\nhimself slighted be vindictive, and have some credit and following in\nthe city, disorder will always ensue. And though Rome escaped this\ndanger for a time, she too, as has elsewhere been said, having no\nlonger, after she had conquered Carthage and Antiochus, any fear of\nwar, came to think she might commit her armies to whom she would,\nmaking less account of the valour of her captains than of those other\nqualities which gain favour with the people. Accordingly we find Paulus\nEmilius rejected oftener than once when he sought the consulship; nor,\nin fact, obtaining it until the Macedonian war broke out, which, being\njudged a formidable business, was by the voice of the whole city\ncommitted to his management. After the year 1494 our city of Florence\nwas involved in a series of wars, in conducting which none of our\ncitizens had any success until chance threw the command into the hands\nof one who showed us how an army should be led. This was Antonio\nGiacomini, and so long as there were dangerous wars on foot, all\nrivalry on the part of other citizens was suspended; and whenever a\ncaptain or commissary had to be appointed he was unopposed. But when a\nwar came to be undertaken, as to the issue of which no misgivings were\nfelt, and which promised both honour and preferment, so numerous were\nthe competitors for command, that three commissaries having to be\nchosen to conduct the siege of Pisa, Antonio was left out; and though\nit cannot with certainty be shown that any harm resulted to our\nrepublic from his not having been sent on this enterprise, we may\nreasonably conjecture that such was indeed the case. For as the people\nof Pisa were then without means either for subsistence or defence, it\nmay be believed that had Antonio been there he would have reduced them\nto such extremities as would have forced them to surrender at\ndiscretion to the Florentines. But Pisa being besieged by captains who\nknew neither how to blockade nor how to storm it, held out so long,\nthat the Florentines, who should have reduced it by force, were obliged\nto buy its submission. Neglect like this might well move Antonio to\nresentment; and he must needs have been both very patient and very\nforgiving if he felt no desire to revenge himself when he could, by the\nruin of the city or by injuries to individual citizens. But a republic\nshould beware not to rouse such feelings, as I shall show in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014_That we are not to offend a Man, and then send him to\nfill an important Office or Command._\nA republic should think twice before appointing to an important command\na citizen who has sustained notable wrong at the hands of his\nfellow-citizens. Claudius Nero, quitting the army with which he was\nopposing Hannibal, went with a part of his forces into the March of\nAncona, designing to join the other consul there, and after joining him\nto attack Hasdrubal before he came up with his brother. Now Claudius\nhad previously commanded against Hasdrubal in Spain, and after driving\nhim with his army into such a position that it seemed he must either\nfight at a disadvantage or perish by famine, had been outwitted by his\nadversary, who, while diverting his attention with proposals of terms,\ncontrived to slip through his hands and rob him of the opportunity for\neffecting his destruction. This becoming known in Rome brought Claudius\ninto so much discredit both with the senate and people, that to his\ngreat mortification and displeasure, he was slightingly spoken of by\nthe whole city. But being afterwards made consul and sent to oppose\nHannibal, he took the course mentioned above, which was in itself so\nhazardous that all Rome was filled with doubt and anxiety until tidings\ncame of Hasdrubal\u2019s defeat. When subsequently asked why he had played\nso dangerous a game, wherein without urgent necessity he had staked the\nvery existence of Rome, Claudius answered, he had done so because he\nknew that were he to succeed he would recover whatever credit he had\nlost in Spain; while if he failed, and his attempt had an untoward\nissue, he would be revenged on that city and On those citizens who had\nso ungratefully and indiscreetly wronged him.\nBut if resentment for an offence like this so deeply moved a Roman\ncitizen at a time when Rome was still uncorrupted, we should consider\nhow it may act on the citizen of a State not constituted as Rome then\nwas. And because there is no certain remedy we can apply to such\ndisorders when they arise in republics, it follows that it is\nimpossible to establish a republic which shall endure always; since in\na thousand unforeseen ways ruin may overtake it.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\u2014_That it is the highest Quality of a Captain to be able\nto forestall the designs of his Adversary._\nIt was a saying of Epaminondas the Theban that nothing was so useful\nand necessary for a commander as to be able to see through the\nintentions and designs of his adversary. And because it is hard to come\nat this knowledge directly, the more credit is due to him who reaches\nit by conjecture. Yet sometimes it is easier to fathom an enemy\u2019s\ndesigns than to construe his actions; and not so much those actions\nwhich are done at a distance from us, as those done in our presence and\nunder our very eyes. For instance, it has often happened that when a\nbattle has lasted till nightfall, the winner has believed himself the\nloser, and the loser has believed himself the winner and that this\nmistake has led him who made it to follow a course hurtful to himself.\nIt was from a mistake of this sort, that Brutus and Cassius lost the\nbattle of Philippi. For though Brutus was victorious with his wing of\nthe army Cassius, whose wing was beaten, believed the entire army to be\ndefeated, and under this belief gave way to despair and slew himself.\nSo too, in our own days, in the battle fought by Francis, king of\nFrance, with the Swiss at Santa Cecilia in Lombardy, when night fell,\nthose of the Swiss who remained unbroken, not knowing that the rest had\nbeen routed and slain, thought they had the victory; and so believing\nwould not retreat, but, remaining on the field, renewed the combat the\nfollowing morning to their great disadvantage. Nor were they the only\nsufferers from their mistake, since the armies of the Pope and of Spain\nwere also misled by it, and well-nigh brought to destruction. For on\nthe false report of a victory they crossed the Po, and had they only\nadvanced a little further must have been made prisoners by the\nvictorious French.\nAn instance is recorded of a like mistake having been made in the camps\nboth of the Romans and of the Equians. For the Consul Sempronius being\nin command against the Equians, and giving the enemy battle, the\nengagement lasted with varying success till nightfall, when as both\narmies had suffered what was almost a defeat, neither returned to their\ncamp, but each drew off to the neighboring hills where they thought\nthey would be safer. The Romans separated into two divisions, one of\nwhich with the consul, the other with the centurion Tempanius by whose\nvalour the army had that day been saved from utter rout. At daybreak\nthe consul, without waiting for further tidings of the enemy, made\nstraight for Rome; and the Equians, in like manner, withdrew to their\nown country. For as each supposed the other to be victorious, neither\nthought much of leaving their camp to be plundered by the enemy. It so\nchanced, however, that Tempanius, who was himself retreating with the\nsecond division of the Roman army, fell in with certain wounded\nEquians, from whom he learned that their commanders had fled,\nabandoning their camp; on hearing which, he at once returned to the\nRoman camp and secured it, and then, after sacking the camp of the\nEquians, went back victorious to Rome. His success, as we see, turned\nentirely on his being the first to be informed of the enemy\u2019s\ncondition. And here we are to note that it may often happen that both\nthe one and the other of two opposed armies shall fall into the same\ndisorder, and be reduced to the same straits; in which case, that which\nsoonest detects the other\u2019s distress is sure to come off best.\nI shall give an instance of this which occurred recently in our own\ncountry. In the year 1498, when the Florentines had a great army in the\nterritory of Pisa and had closely invested the town, the Venetians, who\nhad undertaken its protection, seeing no other way to save it, resolved\nto make a diversion in its favour by attacking the territories of the\nFlorentines in another quarter. Wherefore, having assembled a strong\nforce, they entered Tuscany by the Val di Lamona, and seizing on the\nvillage of Marradi, besieged the stronghold of Castiglione which stands\non the height above it. Getting word of this, the Florentines sought to\nrelieve Marradi, without weakening the army which lay round Pisa. They\naccordingly raised a new levy of foot-soldiers, and equipped a fresh\nsquadron of horse, which they despatched to Marradi under the joint\ncommand of Jacopo IV. d\u2019Appiano, lord of Piombino, and Count Rinuccio\nof Marciano. These troops taking up their position on the hill above\nMarradi, the Venetians withdrew from the investment of Castiglione and\nlodged themselves in the village. But when the two armies had\nconfronted one another for several days, both began to suffer sorely\nfrom want of victuals and other necessaries, and neither of them daring\nto attack the other, or knowing to what extremities the other was\nreduced, both simultaneously resolved to strike their camps the\nfollowing morning, and to retreat, the Venetians towards Berzighella\nand Faenza, the Florentines towards Casaglia and the Mugello. But at\ndaybreak, when both armies had begun to remove their baggage, it so\nhappened that an old woman, whose years and poverty permitted her to\npass unnoticed, leaving the village of Marradi, came to the Florentine\ncamp, where were certain of her kinsfolk whom she desired to visit.\nLearning from her that the Venetians were in retreat, the Florentine\ncommanders took courage, and changing their plan, went in pursuit of\nthe enemy as though they had dislodged them, sending word to Florence\nthat they had repulsed the Venetians and gained a victory. But in truth\nthis victory was wholly due to their having notice of the enemy\u2019s\nmovements before the latter had notice of theirs. For had that notice\nbeen given to the Venetians first, it would have wrought against us the\nsame results as it actually wrought for us.\nCHAPTER XIX.\u2014_Whether Indulgence or Severity be more necessary for\ncontrolling a Multitude._\nThe Roman Republic was distracted by the feuds of the nobles and\ncommons. Nevertheless, on war breaking out, Quintius and Appius\nClaudius were sent forth in command of Roman armies. From his harshness\nand severity to his soldiers, Appius was so ill obeyed by them, that\nafter sustaining what almost amounted to a defeat, he had to resign his\ncommand. Quintius, on the contrary, by kindly and humane treatment,\nkept his men obedient and returned victorious to Rome. From this it\nmight seem that to govern a large body of men, it is better to be\nhumane than haughty, and kindly rather than severe.\nAnd yet Cornelius Tacitus, with whom many other authors are agreed,\npronounces a contrary opinion where he says, \u201c_In governing a multitude\nit avails more to punish than to be compliant._\u201d[14] If it be asked how\nthese opposite views can be reconciled, I answer that you exercise\nauthority either over men used to regard you as their equal, or over\nmen who have always been subject to you. When those over whom you\nexercise authority are your equals, you cannot trust wholly to\npunishment or to that severity of which Tacitus speaks. And since in\nRome itself the commons had equal weight with the nobles, none\nappointed their captain for a time only, could control them by using\nharshness and severity. Accordingly we find that those Roman captains\nwho gained the love of their soldiers and were considerate of them,\noften achieved greater results than those who made themselves feared by\nthem in an unusual degree, unless, like Manlius Torquatus, these last\nwere endowed with consummate valour. But he who has to govern subjects\nsuch as those of whom Tacitus speaks, to prevent their growing insolent\nand trampling upon him by reason of his too great easiness, must resort\nto punishment rather than to compliance. Still, to escape hatred,\npunishment should be moderate in degree, for to make himself hated is\nnever for the interest of any prince. And to escape hatred, a prince\nhas chiefly to guard against tampering with the property of any of his\nsubjects; for where nothing is to be gained by it, no prince will\ndesire to shed blood, unless, as seldom happens, constrained to do so\nby necessity. But where advantage is to be gained thereby, blood will\nalways flow, and neither the desire to shed it, nor causes for shedding\nit will ever be wanting, as I have fully shown when discussing this\nsubject in another treatise.\n[14] \u201cIn multitudine regenda plus poena quam obsequium valet.\u201d But\ncompare Annals, III. 55, \u201cObsequium inde in principem et \u00e6mulandi amoi\nvalidioi quam poena ex legibus et metus.\u201d\nQuintius therefore was more deserving of praise than Appius.\nNevertheless the opinion of Tacitus, duly restricted and not understood\nas applying to a case like that of Appius, merits approval. But since I\nhave spoken of punishment and indulgence, it seems not out of place to\nshow how a single act of humanity availed more than arms with the\ncitizens of Falerii.\nCHAPTER XX.\u2014_How one humane act availed more with the men of Falerii,\nthan all the might of the Roman Arms._\nWhen the besieging army of the Romans lay round Falerii, the master of\na school wherein the best-born youths of the city were taught, thinking\nto curry favour with Camillus and the Romans, came forth from the town\nwith these boys, on pretence of giving them exercise, and bringing them\ninto the camp where Camillus was, presented them to him, saying, \u201c_To\nransom these that city would yield itself into your hands._\u201d Camillus,\nhowever, not only rejected this offer, but causing the schoolmaster to\nbe stripped and his hands tied behind him, gave each of the boys a\nscourge, and bade them lead the fellow back to the town scourging him\nas they went. When the citizens of Falerii heard of this, so much were\nthey pleased with the humanity and integrity of Camillus, that they\nresolved to surrender their town to him without further defence.\nThis authentic instance may lead us to believe that a humane and kindly\naction may sometimes touch men\u2019s minds more nearly than a harsh and\ncruel one; and that those cities and provinces into which the\ninstruments and engines of war, with every other violence to which men\nresort, have failed to force a way, may be thrown open to a single act\nof tenderness, mercy, chastity, or generosity. Whereof history supplies\nus with many examples besides the one which I have just now noticed.\nFor we find that when the arms of Rome were powerless to drive Pyrrhus\nout of Italy, he was moved to depart by the generosity of Fabritius in\ndisclosing to him the proposal which his slave had made the Romans to\npoison him. Again, we read how Scipio gained less reputation in Spain\nby the capture of New Carthage, than by his virtue in restoring a young\nand beautiful wife unviolated to her husband; the fame of which action\nwon him the love of the whole province. We see, too, how much this\ngenerous temper is esteemed by a people in its great men; and how much\nit is praised by historians and by those who write the lives of\nprinces, as well as by those who lay down rules of human conduct. Among\nwhom Xenophon has taken great pains to show what honours, and\nvictories, and how fair a fame accrued to Cyrus from his being kindly\nand gracious, without taint of pride, or cruelty, or luxury, or any\nother of those vices which cast a stain upon men\u2019s lives.\nAnd yet when we note that Hannibal, by methods wholly opposite to\nthese, achieved splendid victories and a great renown, I think I am\nbound to say something in my next Chapter as to how this happened.\nCHAPTER XXI.\u2014_How it happened that Hannibal pursuing a course contrary\nto that taken by Scipio, wrought the same results in Italy which the\nother achieved in Spain._\nSome, I suspect, may marvel to find a captain, taking a contrary\ncourse, nevertheless arrive at the same ends as those who have pursued\nthe methods above spoken of; since it must seem as though success did\nnot depend on the causes I have named; nay, that if glory and fame are\nto be won in other ways, these causes neither add to our strength nor\nadvance our fortunes. Wherefore, to make my meaning plain, and not to\npart company with the men of whom I have been speaking, I say, that as,\non the one hand, we see Scipio enter Spain, and by his humane and\ngenerous conduct at once secure the good-will of the province, and the\nadmiration and reverence of its inhabitants, so on the other hand, we\nsee Hannibal enter Italy, and by methods wholly opposite, to wit, by\nviolence and rapine, by cruelty and treachery of every kind, effect in\nthat country the very same results. For all the States of Italy\nrevolted in his favour, and all the Italian nations ranged themselves\non his side.\nWhen we seek to know why this was, several reasons present themselves,\nthe first being that men so passionately love change, that, commonly\nspeaking, those who are well off are as eager for it as those who are\nbadly off: for as already has been said with truth, men are pampered by\nprosperity, soured by adversity. This love of change, therefore, makes\nthem open the door to any one who puts himself at the head of new\nmovements in their country, and if he be a foreigner they adopt his\ncause, if a fellow-countryman they gather round him and become his\npartisans and supporters; so that whatever methods he may there use, he\nwill succeed in making great progress. Moreover, men being moved by two\nchief passions, love and fear, he who makes himself feared commands\nwith no less authority than he who makes himself loved; nay, as a rule,\nis followed and obeyed more implicitly than the other. It matters\nlittle, however, which of these two ways a captain chooses to follow,\nprovided he be of transcendent valour, and has thereby won for himself\na great name For when, like Hannibal or Scipio, a man is very valiant,\nthis quality will cloak any error he may commit in seeking either to be\ntoo much loved or too much feared. Yet from each of these two\ntendencies, grave mischiefs, and such as lead to the ruin of a prince,\nmay arise. For he who would be greatly loved, if he swerve ever so\nlittle from the right road, becomes contemptible; while he who would be\ngreatly feared, if he go a jot too far, incurs hatred. And since it is\nimpossible, our nature not allowing it, to adhere to the exact mean, it\nis essential that any excess should be balanced by an exceeding valour,\nas it was in Hannibal and Scipio. And yet we find that even they, while\nthey were exalted by the methods they followed, were also injured by\nthem. How they were exalted has been shown. The injury which Scipio\nsuffered was, that in Spain his soldiers, in concert with certain of\nhis allies, rose against him, for no other reason than that they stood\nin no fear of him. For men are so restless, that if ever so small a\ndoor be opened to their ambition, they forthwith forget all the love\nthey have borne their prince in return for his graciousness and\ngoodness, as did these soldiers and allies of Scipio; when, to correct\nthe mischief, he was forced to use something of a cruelty foreign to\nhis nature.\nAs to Hannibal, we cannot point to any particular instance wherein his\ncruelty or want of faith are seen to have been directly hurtful to him;\nbut we may well believe that Naples and other towns which remained\nloyal to the Roman people, did so by reason of the dread which his\ncharacter inspired. This, however, is abundantly clear, that his\ninhumanity made him more detested by the Romans than any other enemy\nthey ever had; so that while to Pyrrhus, in Italy with his army, they\ngave up the traitor who offered to poison him, Hannibal, even when\ndisarmed and a fugitive, they never forgave, until they had compassed\nhis death.\nTo Hannibal, therefore, from his being accounted impious, perfidious,\nand cruel, these disadvantages resulted; but, on the other hand, there\naccrued to him one great gain, noticed with admiration by all\nhistorians, namely, that in his army, although made up of men of every\nrace and country, no dissensions ever broke out among the soldiers\nthemselves, nor any mutiny against their leader. This we can only\nascribe to the awe which his character inspired, which together with\nthe great name his valour had won for him, had the effect of keeping\nhis soldiers quiet and united. I repeat, therefore, that it is of\nlittle moment which method a captain may follow if he be endowed with\nsuch valour as will bear him out in the course which he adopts. For, as\nI have said, there are disadvantages incident to both methods unless\ncorrected by extraordinary valour.\nAnd now, since I have spoken of Scipio and Hannibal, the former of whom\nby praiseworthy, the latter by odious qualities, effected the same\nresults, I must not, I think, omit to notice the characters of two\nRoman citizens, who by different, yet both by honourable methods,\nobtained a like glory.\nChapter XXII.\u2014_That the severity of Manlius Torquatus and the\ngentleness of Valerius Corvinus won for both the same Glory._\nThere lived in Rome, at the same time, two excellent captains, Manlius\nTorquatus and Valerius Corvinus, equal in their triumphs and in their\nrenown, and in the valour which in obtaining these they had displayed\nagainst the enemy; but who in the conduct of their armies and treatment\nof their soldiers, followed very different methods. For Manlius, in his\ncommand, resorted to every kind of severity, never sparing his men\nfatigue, nor remitting punishment; while Valerius, on the contrary,\ntreated them with all kindness and consideration, and was easy and\nfamiliar in his intercourse with them. So that while the one, to secure\nthe obedience of his soldiers, put his own son to death, the other\nnever dealt harshly with any man. Yet, for all this diversity in their\nmodes of acting, each had the same success against the enemy, and each\nobtained the same advantages both for the republic and for himself. For\nno soldier of theirs ever flinched in battle, or rose in mutiny against\nthem, or in any particular opposed their will; though the commands of\nManlius were of such severity that any order of excessive rigour came\nto be spoken of as a _Manlian order_.\nHere, then, we have to consider first of all why Manlius was obliged to\nuse such severity; next, why Valerius could behave so humanely;\nthirdly, how it was that these opposite methods had the same results;\nand lastly, which of the two methods it is better and more useful for\nus to follow. Now, if we well examine the character of Manlius from the\nmoment when Titus Livius first begins to make mention of him, we shall\nfind him to have been endowed with a rare vigour both of mind and body,\ndutiful in his behaviour to his father and to his country, and most\nreverent to his superiors. All which we see in his slaying the Gaul, in\nhis defence of his father against the tribune, and in the words in\nwhich, before going forth to fight the Gaul, he addressed the consul,\nwhen he said, \u201c_Although assured of victory, never will I without thy\nbidding engage an enemy._\u201d But when such a man as this attains to\ncommand, he looks to find all others like himself; his dauntless spirit\nprompts him to engage in daring enterprises, and to insist on their\nbeing carried out. And this is certain, that where things hard to\nexecute are ordered to be done, the order must be enforced with\nsternness, since, otherwise, it will be disobeyed.\nAnd here be it noted that if you would be obeyed you must know how to\ncommand, and that they alone have this knowledge who have measured\ntheir power to enforce, with the willingness of others to yield\nobedience; and who issue their orders when they find these conditions\ncombining, but, otherwise, abstain. Wherefore, a wise man was wont to\nsay that to hold a republic by force, there must be a proportion\nbetween him who uses the force and him against whom it is used; and\nthat while this proportion obtains the force will operate; but that\nwhen he who suffers is stronger than he who uses the force, we may\nexpect to see it brought to an end at any moment.\nBut returning to the matter in hand, I say that to command things hard\nof execution, requires hardness in him who gives the command, and that\na man of this temper and who issues such commands, cannot look to\nenforce them by gentleness. He who is not of such a temper must be\ncareful not to impose tasks of extraordinary difficulty, but may use\nhis natural gentleness in imposing such as are ordinary. For common\npunishments are not imputed to the prince, but to the laws and\nordinances which he has to administer.\nWe must believe, therefore, that Manlius was constrained to act with\nseverity by the unusual character of the commands which his natural\ndisposition prompted him to issue. Such commands are useful in a\nrepublic, as restoring its ordinances to their original efficacy and\nexcellence. And were a republic, as I have before observed, fortunate\nenough to come frequently under the influence of men who, by their\nexample, reinforce its laws, and not only retard its progress towards\ncorruption, but bring it back to its first perfection, it might endure\nfor ever.\nManlius, therefore, was of those who by the severity of their commands\nmaintained the military discipline of Rome; urged thereto, in the first\nplace, by his natural temper, and next by the desire that whatever he\nwas minded to command should be done. Valerius, on the other hand,\ncould afford to act humanely, because for him it was enough if all were\ndone which in a Roman army it was customary to do. And, since the\ncustoms of that army were good customs, they sufficed to gain him\nhonour, while at the same time their maintenance cost him no effort,\nnor threw on him the burthen of punishing transgressors; as well\nbecause there were none who trangressed, as because had there been any,\nthey would, as I have said, have imputed their punishment to the\nordinary rules of discipline, and not to the severity of their\ncommander. In this way Valerius had room to exercise that humane\ndisposition which enabled him at once to gain influence over his\nsoldiers and to content them. Hence it was that both these captains\nobtaining the same obedience, could, while following different methods,\narrive at the same ends. Those, however, who seek to imitate them may\nchance to fall into the errors of which I have already spoken, in\nconnection with Hannibal and Scipio, as breeding contempt or hatred,\nand which are only to be corrected by the presence of extraordinary\nvalour, and not otherwise.\nIt rests now to determine which of these two methods is the more to be\ncommended. This, I take it, is matter of dispute, since both methods\nhave their advocates. Those writers, however, who have laid down rules\nfor the conduct of princes, describe a character approaching more\nnearly to that of Valerius than to that of Manlius; and Xenophon, whom\nI have already cited, while giving many instances of the humanity of\nCyrus, conforms closely to what Livius tells us of Valerius. For\nValerius being made consul against the Samnites, on the eve of battle\nspoke to his men with the same kindliness with which he always treated\nthem; and Livius, after telling us what he said, remarks of him:\n\u201c_Never was there a leader more familiar with his men; cheerfully\nsharing with the meanest among them every hardship and fatigue. Even in\nthe military games, wherein those of the same rank were wont to make\ntrial of their strength or swiftness, he would good-naturedly take a\npart, nor disdain any adversary who offered; meeting victory or defeat\nwith an unruffled temper and an unchanged countenance. When called on\nto act, his bounty and generosity never fell short. When he had to\nspeak, he was as mindful of the feelings of others as of his own\ndignity. And, what more than anything else secures the popular favour,\nhe maintained when exercising his magistracies the same bearing he had\nworn in seeking them._\u201d\nOf Manlius also, Titus Livius speaks in like honourable terms, pointing\nout that his severity in putting his son to death brought the Roman\narmy to that pitch of discipline which enabled it to prevail against\nthe Latins, nay, he goes so far in his praises that after describing\nthe whole order of the battle, comparing the strength of both armies,\nand showing all the dangers the Romans ran, and the difficulties they\nhad to surmount, he winds up by saying, that it was the valour of\nManlius which alone gained for them this great victory, and that\nwhichever side had Manlius for its leader must have won the day. So\nthat weighing all that the historians tell us of these two captains, it\nmight be difficult to decide between them.\nNevertheless, not to leave the question entirely open, I say, that for\na citizen living under a republic, I think the conduct of Manlius more\ndeserving of praise and less dangerous in its consequences. For methods\nlike his tend only to the public good and in no way subserve private\nends. He who shows himself harsh and stern at all times and to all men\nalike, and is seen to care only for the common welfare, will never gain\nhimself partisans, since this is not the way to win personal friends,\nto whom, as I said before, the name of partisans is given. For a\nrepublic, therefore, no line of conduct could be more useful or more to\nbe desired than this, because in following it the public interest is\nnot neglected, and no room is given to suspect personal ambition.\nBut the contrary holds as to the methods followed by Valerius. For\nthough the public service they render be the same, misgivings must\nneeds arise that the personal good-will which, in the course of a\nprolonged command, a captain obtains from his soldiers, may lead to\nconsequences fatal to the public liberty. And if this was not found to\nhappen in the case of Valerius, it was because the minds of the Roman\npeople were not yet corrupted, and because they had never remained for\na long time and continuously under his command.\nHad we, however, like Xenophon, to consider what is most for the\ninterest of a prince, we should have to give up Manlius and hold by\nValerius; for, undoubtedly, a prince should strive to gain the love of\nhis soldiers and subjects, as well as their obedience. The latter he\ncan secure by discipline and by his reputation for valour. But for the\nformer he will be indebted to his affability, kindliness, gentleness,\nand all those other like qualities which were possessed by Valerius,\nand which are described by Xenophon as existing in Cyrus. That a prince\nshould be personally loved and have his army wholly devoted to him is\nconsistent with the character of his government; but that this should\nhappen to a person of private station does not consist with his\nposition as a citizen who has to live in conformity with the laws and\nin subordination to the magistrates. We read in the early annals of the\nVenetian Republic, that once, on the return of the fleet, a dispute\nbroke out between the sailors and the people, resulting in tumults and\narmed violence which neither the efforts of the public officers, the\nrespect felt for particular citizens, nor the authority of the\nmagistrates could quell. But on a certain gentleman, who the year\nbefore had been in command of these sailors, showing himself among\nthem, straightway, from the love they bore him, they submitted to his\nauthority and withdrew from the fray. Which deference on their part\naroused such jealousy and suspicion in the minds of the Venetian\nsenators that very soon after they got rid of this gentleman, either by\ndeath or exile.\nThe sum of the matter, therefore, is, that the methods followed by\nValerius are useful in a prince, but pernicious in a private citizen,\nboth for his country and for himself, for his country, because such\nmethods pave the way to a tyranny; for himself, because his\nfellow-citizens, growing suspicious of his conduct, are constrained to\nprotect themselves to his hurt. And conversely, I maintain, that the\nmethods of Manlius, while hurtful in a prince are useful in a citizen,\nand in the highest degree for his country; and, moreover, seldom give\noffence, unless the hatred caused by his severity be augmented by the\njealousy which the fame of his other virtues inspires: a matter now to\nbe considered in connection with the banishment of Camillas.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\u2014_Why Camillus was banished from Rome._\nIt has been shown above how methods like those of Valerius are hurtful\nto the citizen who employs them and to his country, while methods like\nthose of Manlius are advantageous for a man\u2019s country, though sometimes\nthey be hurtful to the man himself. This is well seen in the example of\nCamillus, whose bearing more nearly resembled that of Manlius than that\nof Valerius, so that Titus Livius, in speaking of him, says, \u201c_His\nvirtues were at once hated and admired by his soldiers._\u201d What gained\nhim their admiration was his care for their safety, his prudence, his\nmagnanimity, and the good order he maintained in conducting and\ncommanding them. What made him hated was his being more stern to punish\nthan bountiful to reward; and Livius instances the following\ncircumstances as giving rise to this hatred. First, his having applied\nthe money got by the sale of the goods of the Veientines to public\npurposes, and not divided it along with the rest of the spoils. Second,\nhis having, on the occasion of his triumph, caused his chariot to be\ndrawn by four white horses, seeking in his pride, men said, to make\nhimself the equal of the sun god. And, third, his having vowed to\nApollo a tenth of the Veientine plunder, which, if he was to fulfil his\nvow, he had to recover from his soldiers, into whose hands it had\nalready come.\nHerein we may well and readily discern what causes tend to make a\nprince hateful to his people; the chief whereof is the depriving them\nof some advantage. And this is a matter of much importance. For when a\nman is deprived of what is in itself useful, he never forgets it, and\nevery trifling occasion recalls it to his mind; and because such\noccasions recur daily, he is every day reminded of his loss. Another\nerror which we are here taught to guard against, is the appearing\nhaughty and proud, than which nothing is more distasteful to a people,\nand most of all to a free people; for although such pride and\nhaughtiness do them no hurt, they nevertheless hold in detestation any\nwho display these qualities. Every show of pride, therefore, a prince\nshould shun as he would a rock, since to invite hatred without\nresulting advantage were utterly rash and futile.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014_That prolonged Commands brought Rome to Servitude_.\nIf we well examine the course of Roman history, we shall find two\ncauses leading to the break-up of that republic: one, the dissensions\nwhich arose in connection with the agrarian laws; the other, the\nprolongation of commands. For had these matters been rightly understood\nfrom the first, and due remedies applied, the freedom of Rome had been\nfar more lasting, and, possibly, less disturbed. And although, as\ntouching the prolongation of commands, we never find any tumult\nbreaking out in Rome on that account, we do in fact discern how much\nharm was done to the city by the ascendency which certain of its\ncitizens thereby gained. This mischief indeed would not have arisen, if\nother citizens whose period of office was extended had been as good and\nwise as Lucius Quintius, whose virtue affords a notable example. For\nterms of accord having been settled between the senate and commons of\nRome, the latter, thinking their tribunes well able to withstand the\nambition of the nobles, prolonged their authority for a year.\nWhereupon, the senate, not to be outdone by the commons, proposed, out\nof rivalry, to extend the consulship of Quintius. He, however, refused\nabsolutely to lend himself to their designs, and insisted on their\nappointing new consuls, telling them that they should seek to discredit\nevil examples, not add to them by setting worse. Had this prudence and\nvirtue of his been shared by all the citizens of Rome, the practice of\nprolonging the terms of civil offices would not have been suffered to\nestablish itself, nor have led to the kindred practice of extending the\nterm of military commands, which in progress of time effected the ruin\nof their republic.\nThe first military commander whose term was extended, was Publius\nPhilo; for when his consulship was about to expire, he being then\nengaged in the siege of Pal\u00e6opolis, the senate, seeing he had the\nvictory in his hands, would not displace him by a successor, but\nappointed him _Proconsul_, which office he was the first to hold. Now,\nalthough in thus acting the senate did what they thought best for the\npublic good, nevertheless it was this act of theirs that in time\nbrought Rome to slavery. For the further the Romans carried their arms,\nthe more necessary it seemed to them to grant similar extensions of\ncommand, and the oftener they, in fact, did so. This gave rise to two\ndisadvantages: first that a smaller number of men were trained to\ncommand; second, that by the long continuance of his command a captain\ngained so much influence and ascendency over his soldiers that in time\nthey came to hold the senate of no account, and looked only to him.\nThis it was, that enabled Sylla and Marius to find adherents ready to\nfollow them even to the public detriment, and enabled C\u00e6sar to\noverthrow the liberties of his country; whereas, had the Romans never\nprolonged the period of authority, whether civil or military, though\nthey might have taken longer to build up their empire, they certainly\nhad been later in incurring servitude.\nCHAPTER XXV.\u2014_Of the poverty of Cincinnatus and of many other Roman\nCitizens.\nElsewhere I have shown that no ordinance is of such advantage to a\ncommonwealth, as one which enforces poverty on its citizens. And\nalthough it does not appear what particular law it was that had this\noperation in Rome (especially since we know the agrarian law to have\nbeen stubbornly resisted), we find, as a fact, that four hundred years\nafter the city was founded, great poverty still prevailed there; and\nmay assume that nothing helped so much to produce this result as the\nknowledge that the path to honours and preferment was closed to none,\nand that merit was sought after wheresoever it was to be found; for\nthis manner of conferring honours made riches the less courted. In\nproof whereof I shall cite one instance only.\nWhen the consul Minutius was beset in his camp by the Equians, the\nRoman people were filled with such alarm lest their army should be\ndestroyed, that they appointed a dictator, always their last stay in\nseasons of peril. Their choice fell on Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, who\nat the time was living on his small farm of little more than four\nacres, which he tilled with his own hand. The story is nobly told by\nTitus Livius where he says: \u201c_This is worth listening to by those who\ncontemn all things human as compared with riches, and think that glory\nand excellence can have no place unless accompanied by lavish wealth._\u201d\nCincinnatus, then, was ploughing in his little field, when there\narrived from Rome the messengers sent by the senate to tell him he had\nbeen made dictator, and inform him of the dangers which threatened the\nRepublic. Putting on his gown, he hastened to Rome, and getting\ntogether an army, marched to deliver Minutius. But when he had defeated\nand spoiled the enemy, and released Minutius, he would not suffer the\narmy he had rescued to participate in the spoils, saying, \u201c_I will not\nhave you share in the plunder of those to whom you had so nearly fallen\na prey._\u201d Minutius he deprived of his consulship, and reduced to be a\nsubaltern, in which rank he bade him remain till he had learned how to\ncommand. And before this he had made Lucius Tarquininus, although\nforced by his poverty to serve on foot, his master of the knights.\nHere, then, we see what honour was paid in Rome to poverty, and how\nfour acres of land sufficed to support so good and great a man as\nCincinnatus. We find the same Poverty still prevailing in the time of\nMarcus Regulus, who when serving with the army in Africa sought leave\nof senate to return home that he might look after his farm which his\nlabourers had suffered to run to waste. Here again we learn two things\nworthy our attention: first, the poverty of these men and their\ncontentment under it, and how their sole study was to gain renown from\nwar, leaving all its advantages to the State. For had they thought of\nenriching themselves by war, it had given them little concern that\ntheir fields were running to waste Further, we have to remark the\nmagnanimity of these citizens, who when placed at the head of armies\nsurpassed all princes in the loftiness of their spirit, who cared\nneither for king nor for commonwealth, and whom nothing could daunt or\ndismay; but who, on returning to private life, became once more so\nhumble, so frugal, so careful of their slender means, and so submissive\nto the magistrates and reverential to their superiors, that it might\nseem impossible for the human mind to undergo so violent a change.\nThis poverty prevailed down to the days of Paulus Emilius, almost the\nlast happy days for this republic wherein a citizen, while enriching\nRome by his triumphs, himself remained poor. And yet so greatly was\npoverty still esteemed at this time, that when Paulus, in conferring\nrewards on those who had behaved well in the war, presented his own\nson-in-law with a silver cup, it was the first vessel of silver ever\nseen in his house.\nI might run on to a great length pointing out how much better are the\nfruits of poverty than those of riches, and how poverty has brought\ncities, provinces, and nations to honour, while riches have wrought\ntheir ruin, had not this subject been often treated by others.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\u2014_How Women are a cause of the ruin of States._\nA feud broke out in Ardea touching the marriage of an heiress, whose\nhand was sought at the same time by two suitors, the one of plebeian,\nthe other of noble birth. For her father being dead, her guardian\nwished her to wed the plebeian, her mother the noble. And so hot grew\nthe dispute that resort was had to arms, the whole nobility siding with\ntheir fellow-noble, and all the plebeians with the plebeian. The latter\nfaction being worsted, left the town, and sent to the Volscians for\nhelp; whereupon, the nobles sought help from Rome. The Volscians were\nfirst in the field, and on their arrival encamped round Ardea. The\nRomans, coming up later, shut in the Volscians between themselves and\nthe town, and, reducing them by famine, forced them to surrender at\ndiscretion. They then entered Ardea, and putting all the ringleaders in\nthis dispute to the sword, composed the disorders of the city.\nIn connection with this affair there are several points to be noted.\nAnd in the first place we see how women have been the occasion of many\ndivisions and calamities in States, and have wrought great harm to\nrulers; as when, according to our historian, the violence done to\nLucretia drove the Tarquins from their kingdom, and that done to\nVirginia broke the power of the decemvirs. And among the chief causes\nwhich Aristotle assigns for the downfall of tyrants are the wrongs done\nby them to their subjects in respect of their women, whether by\nadultery, rape, or other like injury to their honour, as has been\nsufficiently noticed in the Chapter wherein we treated \u201c_of\nConspiracies_\u201d\nI say, then, that neither absolute princes nor the rulers of free\nStates should underrate the importance of matter, but take heed to the\ndisorders which it may breed and provide against them while remedies\ncan still be used without discredit to themselves or to their\ngovernments And this should have been done by the rulers of Ardea who\nby suffering the rivalry between their citizens to come to a head,\npromoted their divisions, and when they sought to reunite them had to\nsummon foreign help, than which nothing sooner leads to servitude.\nBut now let us turn to another subject which merits attention, namely,\nthe means whereby divided cities may be reunited; and of this I propose\nto speak in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\u2014_How a divided City may be reunited, and how it is a\nfalse opinion that to hold Cities in subjection they must be kept\ndivided._\nFrom the example of the Roman consuls who reconciled the citizens of\nArdea, we are taught the method whereby the feuds of a divided city may\nbe composed, namely, by putting the ringleaders of the disturbances to\ndeath; and that no other remedy should be used. Three courses, indeed,\nare open to you, since you may either put to death, as these consuls\ndid, or banish, or bind the citizens to live at peace with one another,\ntaking security for their good behaviour. Of which three ways the last\nis the most hurtful, the most uncertain, and the least effectual;\nbecause when much blood has been shed, or other like outrage done, it\ncannot be that a peace imposed on compulsion should endure between men\nwho are every day brought face to face with one another; for since\nfresh cause of contention may at any moment result from their meeting,\nit will be impossible for them to refrain from mutual injury. Of this\nwe could have no better instance than in the city of Pistoja.\nFifteen years ago this city was divided between the Panciatichi and\nCancellieri, as indeed it still continues, the only difference being\nthat then they were in arms, whereas, now, they have laid them aside.\nAfter much controversy and wrangling, these factions would presently\nproceed to bloodshed, to pulling down houses, plundering property, and\nall the other violent courses usual in divided cities. The Florentines,\nwith whom it lay to compose these feuds, strove for a long time to do\nso by using the third of the methods mentioned; but when this only led\nto increased tumult and disorder, losing patience, they decided to try\nthe second method and get rid of the ringleaders of both factions by\nimprisoning some and banishing others. In this way a sort of settlement\nwas arrived at, which continues in operation up to the present hour.\nThere can be no question, however, that the first of the methods named\nwould have been the surest. But because extreme measures have in them\nan element of greatness and nobility, a weak republic, so far from\nknowing how to use this first method, can with difficulty be brought to\nemploy even the second. This, as I said at the beginning, is the kind\nof blunder made by the princes of our times when they have to decide on\nmatters of moment, from their not considering how those men acted who\nin ancient days had to determine under like conditions. For the\nweakness of the present race of men (the result of their enfeebling\neducation and their ignorance of affairs), makes them regard the\nmethods followed by the ancients as partly inhuman and partly\nimpracticable. Accordingly, they have their own newfangled ways of\nlooking at things, wholly at variance with the true, as when the sages\nof our city, some time since, pronounced that _Pistoja was to be held\nby feuds and Pisa by fortresses_, not perceiving how useless each of\nthese methods is in itself.\nHaving spoken of fortresses already at some length, I shall not further\nrefer to them here, but shall consider the futility of trying to hold\nsubject cities by keeping them divided. In the first place, it is\nimpossible for the ruling power, whether prince or republic, to be\nfriends with both factions. For wherever there is division, it is human\nnature to take a side, and to favour one party more than another. But\nif one party in a subject city be unfriendly to you, the consequence\nwill be that you will lose that city so soon as you are involved in\nwar, since it is impossible for you to hold a city where you have\nenemies both within and without. Should the ruling power be a republic,\nthere is nothing so likely to corrupt its citizens and sow dissension\namong them, as having to control a divided city. For as each faction in\nthat city will seek support and endeavour to make friends in a variety\nof corrupt ways, two very serious evils will result: first, that the\ngoverned city will never be contented with its governors, since there\ncan be no good government where you often change its form, adapting\nyourself to the humours now of one party and now of another; and next,\nthat the factious spirit of the subject city is certain to infect your\nown republic. To which Biondo testifies, when, in speaking of the\ncitizens of Florence and Pistoja, he says, \u201c_In seeking to unite\nPistoja the Florentines themselves fell out_.\u201d[15]\n[15] _Flav. Blondri Hist._, dec. ii. lib. 9. Basle ed. 1559, p. 337\nIt is easy, therefore, to understand how much mischief attends on such\ndivisions. In the year 1501, when we lost Arezzo, and when all the Val\ndi Tevere and Val di Chiana were occupied by the Vitelli and by Duke\nValentino, a certain M. de Lant was sent by the King of France to cause\nthe whole of the lost towns to be restored to the Florentines; who\nfinding in all these towns men who came to him claiming to be of the\nparty of the _Marzocco_,[16] greatly blamed this distinction,\nobserving, that if in France any of the king\u2019s subjects were to say\nthat he was of the king\u2019s party, he would be punished; since the\nexpression would imply that there was a party hostile to the king,\nwhereas it was his majesty\u2019s desire that all his subjects should be his\nfriends and live united without any distinction of party. But all these\nmistaken methods and opinions originate in the weakness of rulers, who,\nseeing that they cannot hold their States by their own strength and\nvalour, have recourse to like devices; which, if now and then in\ntranquil times they prove of some slight assistance to them, in times\nof danger are shown to be worthless.\n[16] The heraldic Lion of Florence.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\u2014_That a Republic must keep an eye on what its Citizens\nare about; since often the seeds of a Tyranny lie hidden under a\nsemblance of generous deeds._\nThe granaries of Rome not sufficing to meet a famine with which the\ncity was visited, a certain Spurius Melius, a very wealthy citizen for\nthese days, privately laid in a supply of corn wherewith to feed the\npeople at his own expense; gaining thereby such general favour with the\ncommons, that the senate, apprehending that his bounty might have\ndangerous consequences, in order to crush him before he grew too\npowerful, appointed a dictator to deal with him and caused him to be\nput to death.\nHere we have to note that actions which seem good in themselves and\nunlikely to occasion harm to any one, very often become hurtful, nay,\nunless corrected in time, most dangerous for a republic. And to treat\nthe matter with greater fulness, I say, that while a republic can never\nmaintain itself long, or manage its affairs to advantage, without\ncitizens of good reputation, on the other hand the credit enjoyed by\nparticular citizens often leads to the establishment of a tyranny. For\nwhich reasons, and that things may take a safe course, it should be so\narranged that a citizen shall have credit only for such behaviour as\nbenefits, and not for such as injures the State and its liberties. We\nmust therefore examine by what ways credit is acquired. These, briefly,\nare two, public or secret. Public, when a citizen gains a great name by\nadvising well or by acting still better for the common advantage. To\ncredit of this sort we should open a wide door, holding out rewards\nboth for good counsels and for good actions, so that he who renders\nsuch services may be at once honoured and satisfied. Reputation\nacquired honestly and openly by such means as these can never be\ndangerous. But credit acquired by secret practices, which is the other\nmethod spoken of, is most perilous and prejudicial. Of such secret\npractices may be instanced, acts of kindness done to this or the other\ncitizen in lending him money, in assisting him to marry his daughters,\nin defending him against the magistrates, and in conferring such other\nprivate favours as gain men devoted adherents, and encourage them after\nthey have obtained such support, to corrupt the institutions of the\nState and to violate its laws.\nA well-governed republic, therefore, ought, as I have said, to throw\nwide the door to all who seek public favour by open courses, and to\nclose it against any who would ingratiate themselves by underhand\nmeans. And this we find was done in Rome. For the Roman republic, as a\nreward to any citizen who served it well, ordained triumphs and all the\nother honours which it had to bestow; while against those who sought to\naggrandize themselves by secret intrigues, it ordained accusations and\nimpeachment; and when, from the people being blinded by a false show of\nbenevolence, these proved insufficient, it provided for a dictator, who\nwith regal authority might bring to bounds any who had strayed beyond\nthem, as instanced in the case of Spurius Melius. And if conduct like\nhis be ever suffered to pass unchastised, it may well be the ruin of a\nrepublic, for men when they have such examples set them are not easily\nled back into the right path.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\u2014_That the Faults of a People are due to its Prince._\nLet no prince complain of the faults committed by a people under his\ncontrol; since these must be ascribed either to his negligence, or to\nhis being himself blemished by similar defects. And were any one to\nconsider what peoples in our own times have been most given to robbery\nand other like offences, he would find that they have only copied their\nrulers, who have themselves been of a like nature. Romagna, before\nthose lords who ruled it were driven out by Pope Alexander VI., was a\nnursery of all the worst crimes, the slightest occasion giving rise to\nwholesale rapine and murder. This resulted from the wickedness of these\nlords, and not, as they asserted, from the evil disposition of their\nsubjects. For these princes being poor, yet choosing to live as though\nthey were rich, were forced to resort to cruelties innumerable and\npractised in divers ways; and among other shameful devices contrived by\nthem to extort money, they would pass laws prohibiting certain acts,\nand then be the first to give occasion for breaking them; nor would\nthey chastise offenders until they saw many involved in the same\noffence; when they fell to punishing, not from any zeal for the laws\nwhich they had made, but out of greed to realize the penalty. Whence\nflowed many mischiefs, and more particularly this, that the people\nbeing impoverished, but not corrected, sought to make good their\ninjuries at the expense of others weaker than themselves. And thus\nthere sprang up all those evils spoken of above, whereof the prince is\nthe true cause.\nThe truth of what I say is confirmed by Titus Livius where he relates\nhow the Roman envoys, who were conveying the spoils of the Veientines\nas an offering to Apollo, were seized and brought on shore by the\ncorsairs of the Lipari islands in Sicily; when Timasitheus, the prince\nof these islands, on learning the nature of the offering, its\ndestination, and by whom sent, though himself of Lipari, behaved as a\nRoman might, showing his people what sacrilege it would be to intercept\nsuch a gift, and speaking to such purpose that by general consent the\nenvoys were suffered to proceed upon their voyage, taking all their\npossessions with them. With reference to which incident the historian\nobserves: \u201c_The multitude, who always take their colour from their\nruler, were filled by Timasitheus with a religious awe._\u201d And to like\npurport we find it said by Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici:\u2014\n\u201cA prince\u2019s acts his people imitate;\nFor on their lord the eyes of all men wait.\u201d[17]\n[17] E quel che fa il signer, fanno poi molti;\nCh\u00e8 nel signer son tutti gli occhi volti.\n(_La Rappresentazione di San Giovanni e Paolo._)\nCHAPTER XXX.\u2014_That a Citizen who seeks by his personal influence to\nrender signal service to his Country, must first stand clear of Envy.\nHow a City should prepare for its defence on the approach of an Enemy._\nWhen the Roman senate learned that all Etruria was assembled in arms to\nmarch against Rome, and that the Latins and Hernicians, who before had\nbeen the friends of the Romans, had ranged themselves with the\nVolscians the ancient enemies of the Roman name, they foresaw that a\nperilous contest awaited them. But because Camillus was at that time\ntribune with consular authority they thought all might be managed\nwithout the appointment of a dictator, provided the other tribunes, his\ncolleagues would agree to his assuming the sole direction of affairs.\nThis they willingly did; \u201c_nor_,\u201d says Titus Livius, \u201c_did they account\nanything as taken from their own dignity which was added to his._\u201d\nOn receiving their promise of obedience, Camillus gave orders that\nthree armies should be enrolled. Of the first, which was to be directed\nagainst the Etruscans, he himself assumed command. The command of the\nsecond, which he meant to remain near Rome and meet any movement of the\nLatins and Hernicians, he gave to Quintius Servilius. The third army,\nwhich he designed for the protection of the city, and the defence of\nthe gates and Curia, he entrusted to Lucius Quintius. And he further\ndirected, that Horatius, one of his colleagues, should furnish supplies\nof arms, and corn, and of all else needful in time of war. Finally he\nput forward his colleague Cornelius to preside in the senate and public\ncouncil, that from day to day he might advise what should be done. For\nin those times these tribunes were ready either to command or obey as\nthe welfare of their country might require.\nWe may gather from this passage how a brave and prudent man should act,\nhow much good he may effect, and how serviceable he may be to his\ncountry, when by the force of his character and worth he succeeds in\nextinguishing envy. For this often disables men from acting to the best\nadvantage, not permitting them to obtain that authority which it is\nessential they should have in matters of importance. Now, envy may be\nextinguished in one or other of two ways: first, by the approach of\nsome flagrant danger, whereby seeing themselves like to be overwhelmed,\nall forego their own private ambition and lend a willing obedience to\nhim who counts on his valour to rescue them. As in the case of\nCamillas, who from having given many proofs of surpassing ability, and\nfrom having been three times dictator and always exercised the office\nfor the public good and not for his private advantage, had brought men\nto fear nothing from his advancement; while his fame and reputation\nmade it no shame for them to recognize him as their superior. Wisely,\ntherefore, does Titus Livius use concerning him the words which I have\ncited.\nThe other way in which envy may be extinguished, is by the death,\nwhether by violence or in the ordinary course of nature, of those who\nhave been your rivals in the pursuit of fame or power, and who seeing\nyou better esteemed than themselves, could never acquiesce in your\nsuperiority or put up with it in patience. For when these men have been\nbrought up in a corrupt city, where their training is little likely to\nimprove them, nothing that can happen will induce them to withdraw\ntheir pretensions; nay, to have their own way and satisfy their\nperverse humour, they will be content to look on while their country is\nruined. For envy such as this there is no cure save by the death of\nthose of whom it has taken possession. And when fortune so befriends a\ngreat man that his rivals are removed from his path by a natural death,\nhis glory is established without scandal or offence, since he is then\nable to display his great qualities unhindered. But when fortune is not\nthus propitious to him, he must contrive other means to rid himself of\nrivals, and must do so successfully before he can accomplish anything.\nAny one who reads with intelligence the lessons of Holy Writ, will\nremember how Moses, to give effect to his laws and ordinances, was\nconstrained to put to death an endless number of those who out of mere\nenvy withstood his designs. The necessity of this course was well\nunderstood by the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, and by the Gonfalonier\nPiero Soderini. But the former could not comply with it, because, as a\nfriar, he himself lacked the needful authority; while those of his\nfollowers who might have exercised that authority, did not rightly\ncomprehend his teaching. This, however, was no fault of his; for his\nsermons are full of invectives and attacks against \u201c_the wise of this\nworld_,\u201d that being the name he gave to envious rivals and to all who\nopposed his reforms. As for Piero Soderini, he was possessed by the\nbelief that in time and with favourable fortune he could allay envy by\ngentleness-and by benefits conferred on particular men; for as he was\nstill in the prime of life, and in the fresh enjoyment of that\ngood-will which his character and opinions had gained for him, he\nthought to get the better of all who out of jealousy opposed him,\nwithout giving occasion for tumult, violence, or disorder; not knowing\nhow time stays not, worth suffices not, fortune shifts, and malice will\nnot be won over by any benefit Wherefore, because they could not or\nknew not how to vanquish this envy, the two whom I have named came to\ntheir downfall.\nAnother point to be noted in the passage we are considering, is the\ncareful provision made by Camillus for the safety of Rome both within\nand without the city. And, truly, not without reason do wise\nhistorians, like our author, set forth certain events with much\nminuteness and detail, to the end that those who come after may learn\nhow to protect themselves in like dangers. Further, we have to note\nthat there is no more hazardous or less useful defence than one\nconducted without method or system. This is shown in Camillus causing a\nthird army to be enrolled that it might be left in Rome for the\nprotection of the city. Many persons, doubtless, both then and now,\nwould esteem this precaution superfluous, thinking that as the Romans\nwere a warlike people and constantly under arms, there could be no\noccasion for a special levy, and that it was time enough to arm when\nthe need came. But Camillus, and any other equally prudent captain\nwould be of the same mind, judged otherwise, not permitting the\nmultitude to take up arms unless they were to be bound by the rules and\ndiscipline of military service. Let him, therefore, who is called on to\ndefend a city, taking example by Camillus, before all things avoid\nplacing arms in the hands of an undisciplined multitude, but first of\nall select and enroll those whom he proposes to arm, so that they may\nbe wholly governed by him as to where they shall assemble and whither\nthey shall march; and then let him direct those who are not enrolled,\nto abide every man in his own house for its defence. Whosoever observes\nthis method in a city which is attacked, will be able to defend it with\nease; but whosoever disregards it, and follows not the example of\nCamillus, shall never succeed.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\u2014_That strong Republics and valiant Men preserve through\nevery change the same Spirit and Bearing._\nAmong other high sayings which our historian ascribes to Camillus, as\nshowing of what stuff a truly great man should be made, he puts in his\nmouth the words, \u201c_My courage came not with my dictatorship nor went\nwith my exile;_\u201d for by these words we are taught that a great man is\nconstantly the same through all vicissitudes of Fortune; so that\nalthough she change, now exalting, now depressing, he remains\nunchanged, and retains always a mind so unmoved, and in such complete\naccordance with his nature as declares to all that over him Fortune has\nno dominion.\nVery different is the behaviour of those weak-minded mortals who,\npuffed up and intoxicated with their success, ascribe all their\nfelicity to virtues which they never knew, and thus grow hateful and\ninsupportable to all around them. Whence also the changes in their\nfortunes. For whenever they have to look adversity in the face, they\nsuddenly pass to the other extreme, becoming abject and base. And thus\nit happens that feeble-minded princes, when they fall into\ndifficulties, think rather of flight than of defence, because, having\nmade bad use of their prosperity, they are wholly unprepared to defend\nthemselves.\nThe same merits and defects which I say are found in individual men,\nare likewise found in republics, whereof we have example in the case of\nRome and of Venice. For no reverse of fortune ever broke the spirit of\nthe Roman people, nor did any success ever unduly elate them; as we see\nplainly after their defeat at Cann\u00e6, and after the victory they had\nover Antiochus. For the defeat at Cann\u00e6, although most momentous, being\nthe third they had met with, no whit daunted them; so that they\ncontinued to send forth armies, refused to ransom prisoners as contrary\nto their custom, and despatched no envoy to Hannibal or to Carthage to\nsue for peace; but without ever looking back on past humiliations,\nthought always of war, though in such straits for soldiers that they\nhad to arm their old men and slaves. Which facts being made known to\nHanno the Carthaginian, he, as I have already related, warned the\nCarthaginian senate not to lay too much stress upon their victory.\nHere, therefore, we see that in times of adversity the Romans were\nneither cast down nor dismayed. On the other hand, no prosperity ever\nmade them arrogant. Before fighting the battle wherein he was finally\nrouted, Antiochus sent messengers to Scipio to treat for an accord;\nwhen Scipio offered peace on condition that he withdrew at once into\nSyria, leaving all his other dominions to be dealt with by the Romans\nas they thought fit. Antiochus refusing these terms, fought and was\ndefeated, and again sent envoys to Scipio, enjoining them to accept\nwhatever conditions the victor might be pleased to impose. But Scipio\nproposed no different terms from those he had offered before saying\nthat \u201c_the Romans, as they lost not heart on defeat, so waxed not\ninsolent with success._\u201d\nThe contrary of all this is seen in the behaviour of the Venetians, who\nthinking their good fortune due to valour of which they were devoid, in\ntheir pride addressed the French king as \u201cSon of St. Mark;\u201d and making\nno account of the Church, and no longer restricting their ambition to\nthe limits of Italy, came to dream of founding an empire like the\nRoman. But afterwards, when their good fortune deserted them, and they\nmet at Vail\u00e0 a half-defeat at the hands of the French king, they lost\ntheir whole dominions, not altogether from revolt, but mainly by a base\nand abject surrender to the Pope and the King of Spain. Nay, so low did\nthey stoop as to send ambassadors to the Emperor offering to become his\ntributaries, and to write letters to the Pope, full of submission and\nservility, in order to move his compassion. To such abasement were they\nbrought in four days\u2019 time by what was in reality only a half-defeat.\nFor on their flight after the battle of Vail\u00e0 only about a half of\ntheir forces were engaged, and one of their two provedditori escaped to\nVerona with five and twenty thousand men, horse and foot. So that had\nthere been a spark of valour in Venice, or any soundness in her\nmilitary system, she might easily have renewed her armies, and again\nconfronting fortune have stood prepared either to conquer, or, if she\nmust fall, to fall more gloriously; and at any rate might have obtained\nfor herself more honourable terms. But a pusillanimous spirit,\noccasioned by the defects of her ordinances in so far as they relate to\nwar, caused her to lose at once her courage and her dominions. And so\nwill it always happen with those who behave like the Venetians. For\nwhen men grow insolent in good fortune, and abject inn evil, the fault\nlies in themselves and in the character of their training, which, when\nslight and frivolous, assimilates them to itself; but when otherwise,\nmakes them of another temper, and giving them better acquaintance with\nthe world, causes them to be less disheartened by misfortunes and less\nelated by success.\nAnd while this is true of individual men, it holds good also of a\nconcourse of men living together in one republic, who will arrive at\nthat measure of perfection which the institutions of their State\npermit. And although I have already said on another occasion that a\ngood militia is the foundation of all States, and where that is wanting\nthere can neither be good laws, nor aught else that is good, it seems\nto me not superfluous to say the same again; because in reading this\nhistory of Titus Livius the necessity of such a foundation is made\napparent in every page. It is likewise shown that no army can be good\nunless it be thoroughly trained and exercised, and that this can only\nbe the case with an army raised from your own subjects. For as a State\nis not and cannot always be at war, you must have opportunity to train\nyour army in times of peace; but this, having regard to the cost, you\ncan only have in respect of your own subjects.\nWhen Camillus, as already related, went forth to meet the Etruscans,\nhis soldiers on seeing the great army of their enemy, were filled with\nfear, thinking themselves too to withstand its onset. This untoward\ndisposition being reported to Camillus, he showed himself to his men\nand by visiting their tents, and conversing with this and the other\namong them, was able to remove their misgivings; and, finally, without\nother word of command, he bade them \u201c_each do his part as he had\nlearned and been accustomed_.\u201d Now, any one who well considers the\nmethods followed by Camillus, and the words spoken by him to encourage\nhis soldiers to face their enemy, will perceive that these words and\nmethods could never have been used with an army which had not been\ntrained and disciplined in time of peace as well as of war. For no\ncaptain can trust to untrained soldiers or look for good service at\ntheir hands; nay, though he were another Hannibal, with such troops his\ndefeat were certain. For, as a captain cannot be present everywhere\nwhile a battle is being fought, unless he have taken all measures\nbeforehand to render his men of the same temper as himself, and have\nmade sure that they perfectly understand his orders and arrangements,\nhe will inevitably be destroyed.\nWhen a city therefore is armed and trained as Rome was, and when its\ncitizens have daily opportunity, both singly and together, to make\ntrial of their valour and learn what fortune can effect, it will always\nhappen, that at all times, and whether circumstances be adverse or\nfavourable, they will remain of unaltered courage and preserve the same\nnoble bearing. But when its citizens are unpractised in arms, and trust\nnot to their own valour but wholly to the arbitration of Fortune, they\nwill change their temper as she changes, and offer always the same\nexample of behaviour as was given by the Venetians.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\u2014_Of the methods which some have used to make Peace\nimpossible_.\nThe towns of C\u00e6re and Velitr\u00e6, two of her own colonies, revolted from\nRome in expectation of being protected by the Latins. But the Latins\nbeing routed and all hopes of help from that quarter at an end, many of\nthe townsmen recommended that envoys should be sent to Rome to make\ntheir peace with the senate. This proposal, however, was defeated by\nthose who had been the prime movers of the revolt, who, fearing that\nthe whole punishment might fall on their heads, to put a stop to any\ntalk of an adjustment, incited the multitude to take up arms and make a\nforay into the Roman territory.\nAnd, in truth, when it is desired that a prince or people should banish\nfrom their minds every thought of reconciliation, there is no surer or\nmore effectual plan than to incite them to inflict grave wrong on him\nwith whom you would not have them be reconciled; for, then, the fear of\nthat punishment which they will seem to themselves to have deserved,\nwill always keep them apart. At the close of the first war waged by the\nRomans against Carthage, the soldiers who had served under the\nCarthaginians in Sardinia and Sicily, upon peace being proclaimed,\nreturned to Africa; where, being dissatisfied with their pay, they\nmutinied against the Carthaginians, and choosing two of their number,\nMato and Spendio, to be their leaders, seized and sacked many towns\nsubject to Carthage. The Carthaginians, being loath to use force until\nthey had tried all other methods for bringing them to reason, sent\nHasdrubal, their fellow-citizen, to mediate with them, thinking that\nfrom formerly having commanded them he might be able to exercise some\ninfluence over them. But on his arrival, Spendio and Mato, to\nextinguish any hope these mutineers might have had of making peace with\nCarthage, and so leave them no alternative but war, persuaded them that\ntheir best course was to put Hasdrubal, with all the other Carthaginian\ncitizens whom they had taken prisoners, to death. Whereupon, they not\nonly put them to death, but first subjected them to an infinity of\ntortures; crowning their wickedness by a proclamation to the effect\nthat every Carthaginian who might thereafter fall into their hands\nshould meet a like fate. This advice, therefore, and its consummation\nhad the effect of rendering these mutineers relentless and inveterate\nin their hostility to the Carthaginians.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\u2014_That to insure victory in battle you must inspire your\nMen with confidence in one another and in you._\nTo insure an army being victorious in battle you must inspire it with\nthe conviction that it is certain to prevail. The causes which give it\nthis confidence are its being well armed and disciplined, and the\nsoldiers knowing one another. These conditions are only to be found\nunited in soldiers born and bred in the same country.\nIt is likewise essential that the army should think so well of its\ncaptain as to trust implicitly to his prudence; which it will always do\nif it see him careful of its welfare, attentive to discipline, brave in\nbattle, and otherwise supporting well and honourably the dignity of his\nposition. These conditions he fulfils when, while punishing faults, he\ndoes not needlessly harass his men, keeps his word with them, shows\nthem that the path to victory is easy, and conceals from them, or makes\nlight of things which seen from a distance might appear to threaten\ndanger. The observance of these precautions will give an army great\nconfidence, and such confidence leads to victory.\nThis confidence the Romans were wont to inspire in the minds of their\nsoldiers by the aid of religion; and accordingly their consuls were\nappointed, their armies were enrolled, their soldiers marched forth,\nand their battles were begun, only when the auguries and auspices were\nfavourable; and without attending to all these observances no prudent\ncaptain would ever engage in combat; knowing that unless his soldiers\nwere first assured that the gods were on their side, he might readily\nsuffer defeat. But if any consul or other leader ever joined battle\ncontrary to the auspices, the Romans would punish him, as they did\nClaudius Pulcher.\nThe truth of what I affirm is plainly seen from the whole course of the\nRoman history, but is more particularly established by the words which\nLivius puts into the mouth of Appius Claudius, who, when complaining to\nthe people of the insolence of the tribunes, and taxing them with\nhaving caused the corruption of the auspices and other rites of\nreligion, is made to say, \u201c_And now they would strip even religion of\nits authority. For what matters it, they will tell you, that the fowls\nrefuse to peck, or come slowly from the coop, or that a cock has\ncrowed? These are small matters doubtless; but it was by not contemning\nsuch small matters as these, that our forefathers built up this great\nrepublic._\u201d And, indeed, in these small matters lies a power which\nkeeps men united and of good courage, which is of itself the chief\ncondition of success.\nBut the observances of religion must be accompanied by valour, for\notherwise they can nothing avail. The men of Praneste, leading forth\ntheir army against the Romans, took up their position near the river\nAllia, on the very spot where the Romans had been routed by the Gauls,\nselecting this ground that it might inspire their own side with\nconfidence, and dishearten their enemies with the unhappy memories\nwhich it recalled But although, for the reasons already noted, this was\na course which promised success, the result nevertheless showed that\ntrue valour is not to be daunted by trifling disadvantages. And this\nthe historian well expresses by the words he puts in the mouth of the\ndictator as spoken to his master of the knights \u201c_See how these\nfellows, in encamping on the banks of the Allia, have chosen their\nground in reliance upon fortune. Do you, therefore, relying on\ndiscipline and valour, fall upon then centre._\u201d For true valour, tight\ndiscipline, and the feeling of security gained by repeated victories,\nare not to be counteracted by things of no real moment, dismayed by\nempty terrors, or quelled by a solitary mishap. As was well seen when\nthe two Manlii, being consuls in command against the Volscians, rashly\nallowed a part of their army to go out foraging, and both those who\nwent out and those who stayed behind found themselves attacked at the\nsame moment For from this danger they were saved by the courage of the\nsoldiers, and not by the foresight of the consuls. With regard to which\noccurrence Titus Livius observes, \u201c_Even without a leader the steadfast\nvalour of the soldiers was maintained._\u201d\nHere I must not omit to notice the device practised by Fabius to give\nhis army confidence, when he led it for the first time into Etruria.\nFor judging such encouragement to be especially needed by his men,\nsince they were entering an unknown country to encounter a new foe, he\naddressed them before they joined battle, and, after reciting many\nreasons for expecting a victory, told them, that \u201c_he could have\nmentioned other favourable circumstances making victory certain, had it\nnot been dangerous to disclose them._\u201d And as this device was\ndexterously used it merits imitation.\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\u2014_By what reports, rumours, or surmises the Citizens of a\nRepublic are led to favour a Fellow-citizen: and-whether the\nMagistracies are bestowed with better judgment by a People or by a\nPrince._\nI have elsewhere related how Titus Manlius, afterwards named Torquatus,\nrescued his father from the charge laid against him by Marcus\nPomponius, tribune of the people. And though the means he took to\neffect this were somewhat violent and irregular, so pleasing to\neveryone were his filial piety and affection, that not only did he\nescape rebuke, but when military tribunes had to be appointed his name\nwas second on the list of those chosen. To explain his good fortune, it\nwill, I think, be useful to consider what are the methods followed by\nthe citizens of a republic in estimating the character of those on whom\nthey bestow honours, so as to see whether what I have already said on\nthis head be true, namely, that a people is more discriminating in\nawarding honours than a prince.\nI say, then, that in conferring honours and offices, the people, when\nit has no knowledge of a man from his public career, follows the\nestimate given of him by the general voice, and by common report; or\nelse is guided by some prepossession or preconceived opinion which it\nhas adopted concerning him. Such impressions are formed either from\nconsideration of a man\u2019s descent (it being assumed, until the contrary\nappears, that where his ancestors have been great and distinguished\ncitizens their descendant will resemble them), or else from regard to\nhis manners and habits; and nothing can be more in his favour than that\nhe frequents the company of the grave and virtuous, and such as are\ngenerally reputed wise. For as we can have no better clue to a man\u2019s\ncharacter than the company he keeps, he who frequents worthy company\ndeservedly obtains a good name, since there can hardly fail to be some\nsimilarity between himself and his associates. Sometimes, however, the\npopular estimate of a man is founded on some remarkable and noteworthy\naction, though not of public moment, in which he has acquitted himself\nwell. And of all the three causes which create a prepossession in a\nman\u2019s favour, none is so effectual as this last. For the presumption\nthat he will resemble his ancestors and kinsmen is so often misleading,\nthat men are slow to trust and quick to discard it, unless confirmed by\nthe personal worth of him of whom they are judging.\nThe criterion of character afforded by a man\u2019s manners and conversation\nis a safer guide than the presumption of inherited excellence, but is\nfar inferior to that afforded by his actions; for until he has given\nactual proof of his worth, his credit is built on mere opinion, which\nmay readily change. But this third mode of judging, which originates in\nand rests upon his actions, at once gives him a name which can only be\ndestroyed by his afterwards doing many actions of a contrary nature.\nThose therefore who live in a republic should conform to this third\ncriterion, and endeavour, as did many of the Roman youth, to make their\nstart in life with some extraordinary achievement, either by promoting\na law conducive to the general well-being, or by accusing some powerful\ncitizen as a transgressor of the laws, or by performing some similar\nnew and notable action which cannot fail to be much spoken of.\nActions like this are necessary not only to lay a foundation for your\nfame, but also to maintain and extend it. To which end, they must\ncontinually be renewed, as we find done by Titus Manlius throughout the\nwhole course of his life. For after winning his earliest renown by his\nbold and singular defence of his father, when some years had passed he\nfought his famous duel with the Gaul, from whom, when he had slain him,\nhe took the twisted golden collar which gave him the name of Torquatus.\nNor was this the last of his remarkable actions, for at a later period,\nwhen he was of ripe years, he caused his own son to be put to death,\nbecause he had fought without leave, although successfully. Which three\nactions gained for him at the time a greater name, and have made him\nmore renowned through after ages than all his triumphs and victories,\nthough of these he had as large a share as fell to the lot of any other\nRoman. The explanation of which is, that while in his victories Manlius\nhad many who resembled him, in these particular actions he stood almost\nor entirely alone.\nSo, too, with the elder Scipio, all whose victories together did not\nobtain for him so much reputation, as did his rescue, while he was yet\nyoung, of his father at the Ticino, and his undaunted bearing after the\nrout at Cann\u00e6, when with his naked sword he constrained a number of the\nRoman youth to swear never to abandon their country, as some among them\nhad before been minded to do. It was these two actions, therefore,\nwhich laid the foundation of his future fame and paved the way for his\ntriumphs in Spain and Africa. And the fair esteem in which men held\nhim, was still further heightened when in Spain he restored a daughter\nto her father, a wife to her husband.\nNor is it only the citizen who seeks reputation as leading to civil\nhonours, who must act in this way; the prince who would maintain his\ncredit in his princedom must do likewise; since nothing helps so much\nto make a prince esteemed as to give signal proofs of his worth,\nwhether by words or by deeds which tend to promote the public good, and\nshow him to be so magnanimous, generous, and just, that he may well\npass into a proverb among his subjects. But to return to the point\nwhence I digressed, I say that if a people, when they first confer\nhonours on a fellow-citizen, rest their judgment on any one of the\nthree circumstances above-mentioned, they build on a reasonable\nfoundation; but, when many instances of noble conduct have made a man\nfavourably known, that the foundation is still better, since then there\nis hardly room for mistake. I speak merely of those honours which are\nbestowed on a man at the outset of his career, before he has come to be\nknown by continued proof, or is found to have passed from one kind of\nconduct to another and dissimilar kind, and I maintain that in such\ncases, so far as erroneous judgments or corrupt motives are concerned,\na people will always commit fewer mistakes than a prince.\nBut since a people may happen to be deceived as regards the character,\nreputation, and actions of a man, thinking them better or greater than\nin truth they are, an error a prince is less likely to fall into from\nhis being informed and warned by his advisers, in order that the people\nmay not lack similar advice, wise founders of republics have provided,\nthat when the highest dignities of the State, to which it would be\ndangerous to appoint incapable men, have to be filled up, and it\nappears that some incapable man is the object of the popular choice, it\nshall be lawful and accounted honourable for any citizen to declare in\nthe public assemblies the defects of the favoured candidate, that the\npeople, being made acquainted therewith, may be better able to judge of\nhis fitness. That this was the practice in Rome we have proof in the\nspeech made by Fabius Maximus to the people during the second Punic\nwar, when in the appointment of consuls public favour leaned towards\nTitus Ottacilius. For Fabius judging him unequal to the duties of the\nconsulship at such a crisis, spoke against him and pointed out his\ninsufficiency, and so prevented his appointment, turning the popular\nfavour towards another who deserved it more.\nIn the choice of its magistrates, therefore, a people judges of those\namong whom it has to choose, in accordance with the surest indications\nit can get; and when it can be advised as princes are, makes fewer\nmistakes than they. But the citizen who would make a beginning by\ngaining the good-will of the people, must, to obtain it, perform, like\nTitus Manlius, some noteworthy action.\nCHAPTER XXXV.\u2014_Of the Danger incurred in being the first to recommend\nnew Measures; and that the more unusual the Measures the greater the\nDanger_.\nHow perilous a thing it is to put one\u2019s self at the head of changes\nwhereby many are affected, how difficult to guide and bring them to\nperfection, and when perfected to maintain them, were too wide and\narduous a subject to be treated here. Wherefore I reserve it for a\nfitter occasion, and shall now speak only of those dangers which are\nincurred by the citizens of a republic or by the counsellors of a\nprince in being the first to promote some grave and important measure\nin such manner that the whole responsibility attending it rests with\nthem. For as men judge of things by their results, any evil which\nensues from such measures will be imputed to their author. And although\nif good ensue he will be applauded, nevertheless in matters of this\nkind, what a man may gain is as nothing to what he may lose.\nSelim, the present sultan, or Grand Turk as he is called, being in\nreadiness, as some who come from his country relate, to set forth on an\nexpedition against Egypt and Syria, was urged by one of his bashaws\nwhom he had stationed on the confines of Persia, to make war upon the\nSofi. In compliance with which advice he went on this new enterprise\nwith a vast army. But coming to a great plain, wherein were many\ndeserts and few streams, and encountering the same difficulties as in\nancient times had proved the ruin of many Roman armies, he suffered so\nmuch from pestilence and famine, that, although victorious in battle,\nhe lost a great part of his men. This so enraged him against the bashaw\non whose advice he had acted, that he forthwith put him to death.\nIn like manner, we read of many citizens who having strenuously\npromoted various measures were banished when these turned out badly.\nCertain citizens of Rome, for instance, were very active in forwarding\na law allowing the appointment of a plebeian to be consul. This law\npassing, it so happened that the first plebeian consul who went forth\nwith the armies was routed; and had it not been that the party in whose\nbehalf the law was made was extremely powerful, its promoters would\nhave fared badly. It is plain therefore that the counsellors whether of\na republic or of a prince stand in this dilemma, that if they do not\nconscientiously advise whatsoever they think advantageous for their\ncity or prince, they fail in their duty; if they do advise it, they\nrisk their places and their lives; all men being subject to this\ninfirmity of judging advice by the event.\nWhen I consider in what way this reproach or this danger may best be\nescaped, I find no other remedy to recommend than that in giving advice\nyou proceed discreetly not identifying yourself in a special manner\nwith the measure you would see carried out, but offering your opinion\nwithout heat, and supporting it temperately and modestly, so that if\nthe prince or city follow it, they shall do so of their own good-will,\nand not seem to be dragged into it by your importunity. When you act\nthus, neither prince nor people can reasonably bear you a grudge in\nrespect of the advice given by you, since that advice was not adopted\ncontrary to the general opinion. For your danger lies in many having\nopposed you, who afterwards, should your advice prove hurtful, combine\nto ruin you. And although in taking this course you fall short of the\nglory which is earned by him who stands alone against many in urging\nsome measure which succeeds, you have nevertheless two advantages to\nmake up for it: first, that you escape danger; and second, that when\nyou have temperately stated your views, and when, in consequence of\nopposition, your advice has not been taken, should other counsels\nprevail and mischief come of them, your credit will be vastly enhanced.\nAnd although credit gained at the cost of misfortune to your prince or\ncity cannot be matter of rejoicing, still it is something to be taken\ninto account.\nOn this head, then, I know of no other advice to offer. For that you\nshould be silent and express no opinion at all, were a course hurtful\nfor your prince or city, and which would not absolve you from danger,\nsince you would soon grow to be suspected, when it might fare with you\nas with the friend of Perseus the Macedonian king. For Perseus being\ndefeated by Paulus Emilius, and making his escape with a few\ncompanions, it happened that one of them, in reviewing the past, began\nto point out to the king many mistakes which he had made and which had\nbeen his ruin. Whereupon Perseus turning upon him said, \u201c_Traitor, hast\nthou waited till now when there is no remedy to tell me these things_?\u201d\nand so saying, slew him with his own hand. Such was the penalty\nincurred by one who was silent when he should have spoken, and who\nspoke when he should have been silent; and who found no escape from\ndanger in having refrained from giving advice. Wherefore, I believe,\nthat the course which I have recommended should be observed and\nfollowed.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\u2014_Why it has been and still may be affirmed of the Gauls,\nthat at the beginning of a fray they are more than Men, but afterwards\nless than Women_.\nThe bravery of the Gaul who on the banks of the Anio challenged any\namong the Romans to fight with him, and the combat that thereupon\nensued between him and Titus Manlius, remind me of what Titus Livius\noftener than once observes in his history, that \u201c_at the beginning of a\nfray the Gauls are more than men, but ere it is ended show themselves\nless than women_.\u201d\nTouching the cause of this, many are content to believe that such is\ntheir nature, which, indeed, I take to be true; but we are not,\ntherefore, to assume that the natural temper which makes them brave at\nthe outset, may not be so trained and regulated as to keep them brave\nto the end. And, to prove this, I say, that armies are of three kinds.\nIn one of these you have discipline with bravery and valour as its\nconsequence. Such was the Roman army, which is shown by all historians\nto have maintained excellent discipline as the result of constant\nmilitary training. And because in a well-disciplined army none must do\nanything save by rule, we find that in the Roman army, from which as it\nconquered the world all others should take example, none either eat, or\nslept, or bought, or sold, or did anything else, whether in his\nmilitary or in his private capacity, without orders from the consul.\nThose armies which do otherwise are not true armies, and if ever they\nhave any success, it is owing to the fury and impetuosity of their\nonset and not to trained and steady valour. But of this impetuosity and\nfury, trained valour, when occasion requires, will make use; nor will\nany danger daunt it or cause it to lose heart, its courage being kept\nalive by its discipline, and its confidence fed by the hope of victory\nwhich never fails it while that discipline is maintained.\nBut the contrary happens with armies of the second sort, those, namely,\nwhich have impetuosity without discipline, as was the case with the\nGauls whose courage in a protracted conflict gradually wore away; so\nthat unless they succeeded in their first attack, the impetuosity to\nwhich they trusted, having no support from disciplined valour, soon\ncooled; when, as they had nothing else to depend on, their efforts\nceased. The Romans, on the other hand, being less disquieted in danger\nby reason of their perfect discipline, and never losing hope, fought\nsteadily and stubbornly to the last, and with the same courage at the\nend as at the outset; nay, growing heated by the conflict, only became\nthe fiercer the longer it was continued.\nIn armies of the third sort both natural spirit and trained valour are\nwanting; and to this class belong the Italian armies of our own times,\nof which it may be affirmed that they are absolutely worthless, never\nobtaining a victory, save when, by some accident, the enemy they\nencounter takes to flight. But since we have daily proofs of this\nabsence of valour, it were needless to set forth particular instances\nof it.\nThat all, however, may know on the testimony of Titus Livius what\nmethods a good army should take, and what are taken by a bad army, I\nshall cite the words he represents Papirius Cursor to have used when\nurging that Fabius, his master of the knights, should be punished for\ndisobedience, and denouncing the consequences which would ensue were he\nabsolved, saying:\u2014\u201c_Let neither God nor man be held in reverence; let\nthe orders of captains and the Divine auspices be alike disregarded;\nlet a vagrant soldiery range without leave through the country of\nfriend or foe; reckless of their military oath, let them disband at\ntheir pleasure; let them forsake their deserted standards, and neither\nrally nor disperse at the word of command; let them fight when they\nchoose, by day or by night, with or without advantage of ground, with\nor without the bidding of their leader, neither maintaining their ranks\n_nor observing the order of battle; and let our armies, from being a\nsolemn and consecrated company, grow to resemble some dark and\nfortuitous gathering of cut-throats._\u201d With this passage before us, it\nis easy to pronounce whether the armies of our times be \u201c_a dark and\nfortuitous gathering_,\u201d or \u201c_a solemn and consecrated company_;\u201d nay,\nhow far they fall short of anything worthy to be called an army,\npossessing neither the impetuous but disciplined valour of the Romans,\nnor even the mere undisciplined impetuosity of the Gauls.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\u2014_Whether a general engagement should be preceded by\nskirmishes; and how, avoiding these, we may get knowledge of a new\nEnemy._\nBesides all the other difficulties which hinder men from bringing\nanything to its utmost perfection, it appears, as I have already\nobserved, that in close vicinity to every good is found also an evil,\nso apt to grow up along with it that it is hardly possible to have the\none without accepting the other. This we see in all human affairs, and\nthe result is, that unless fortune aid us to overcome this natural and\ncommon disadvantage, we never arrive at any excellence. I am reminded\nof this by the combat between Titus Manlius and the Gaul, concerning\nwhich Livius writes that it \u201c_determined the issue of the entire war;\nsince the Gauls, abandoning their camp, hastily withdrew to the country\nabout Tivoli, whence they presently passed into Campania._\u201d\nIt may be said, therefore, on the one hand, that a prudent captain\nought absolutely to refrain from all those operations which, while of\ntrifling moment in themselves, may possibly produce an ill effect on\nhis army. Now, to engage in a combat wherein you risk your whole\nfortunes without putting forth your entire strength, is, as I observed\nbefore, when condemning the defence of a country by guarding its\ndefiles, an utterly foolhardy course. On the other hand, it is to be\nsaid that a prudent captain, when he has to meet a new and redoubtable\nadversary, ought, before coming to a general engagement, to accustom\nhis men by skirmishes and passages of arms, to the quality of their\nenemy; that they may learn to know him, and how to deal with him, and\nso free themselves from the feeling of dread which his name and fame\ninspire.\nThis for a captain is a matter of the very greatest importance, and one\nwhich it might be almost fatal for him to neglect, since to risk a\npitched battle without first giving your soldiers such opportunities to\nknow their enemy and shake off their fear of him, is to rush on certain\ndestruction. When Valerius Corvinus was sent by the Romans with their\narmies against the Samnites, these being new adversaries with whom up\nto that time they had not measured their strength, Titus Livius tells\nus that before giving battle he made his men make trial of the enemy in\nseveral unimportant skirmishes, \u201c_lest they should be dismayed by a new\nfoe and a new method of warfare._\u201d Nevertheless, there is very great\ndanger that, if your soldiers get the worst in these encounters, their\nalarm and self-distrust may be increased, and a result follow contrary\nto that intended, namely, that you dispirit where you meant to\nreassure.\nThis, therefore, is one of those cases in which the evil lies so nigh\nthe good, and both are so mixed up together that you may readily lay\nhold of the one when you think to grasp the other. And with regard to\nthis I say, that a good captain should do what he can that nothing\nhappen which might discourage his men, nor is there anything so likely\nto discourage them as to begin with a defeat. For which reason\nskirmishes are, as a rule, to be avoided, and only to be allowed where\nyou fight to great advantage and with a certainty of victory. In like\nmanner, no attempt should be made to defend the passes leading into\nyour country unless your whole army can co-operate; nor are any towns\nto be defended save those whose loss necessarily involves your ruin.\nAnd as to those towns which you do defend, you must so arrange, both in\nrespect of the garrison within and the army without, that in the event\nof a siege your whole forces can be employed. All other towns you must\nleave undefended. For, provided your army be kept together, you do not,\nin losing what you voluntarily abandon, forfeit your military\nreputation, or sacrifice your hopes of final success. But when you lose\nwhat it was your purpose, and what all know it was your purpose to\nhold, you suffer a real loss and injury, and, like the Gauls on the\ndefeat of their champion, you are ruined by a mishap of no moment in\nitself.\nPhilip of Macedon, the father of Perseus, a great soldier in his day,\nand of a great name, on being invaded by the Romans, laid waste and\nrelinquished much of his territory which he thought he could not\ndefend; rightly judging it more hurtful to his reputation to lose\nterritory after an attempt to defend it, than to abandon it to the\nenemy as something he cared little to retain. So, likewise, after the\nbattle of Cann\u00e6, when their affairs were at their worst, the Romans\nrefused aid to many subject and protected States, charging them to\ndefend themselves as best they could. And this is a better course than\nto undertake to defend and then to fail; for by refusing to defend, you\nlose only your friend; whereas in failing, you not only lose your\nfriend, but weaken yourself.\nBut to return to the matter in hand, I affirm, that even when a captain\nis constrained by inexperience of his enemy to make trial of him by\nmeans of skirmishes, he ought first to see that he has so much the\nadvantage that he runs no risk of defeat; or else, and this is his\nbetter course, he must do as Marius did when sent against the\nCimbrians, a very courageous people who were laying Italy waste, and by\ntheir fierceness and numbers, and from the fact of their having already\nrouted a Roman army, spreading terror wherever they came. For before\nfighting a decisive battle, Marius judged it necessary to do something\nto lessen the dread in which these enemies were held by his army; and\nbeing a prudent commander, he, on several occasions, posted his men at\npoints where the Cimbrians must pass, that seeing and growing familiar\nwith their appearance, while themselves in safety and within the\nshelter of their intrenched camp, and finding them to be a mere\ndisorderly rabble, encumbered with baggage, and either without weapons,\nor with none that were formidable, they might at last assume courage\nand grow eager to engage them in battle. The part thus prudently taken\nby Marius, should be carefully imitated by others who would escape the\ndangers above spoken of and not have to betake themselves like the\nGauls to a disgraceful flight, on sustaining some trifling defeat.\nBut since in this Discourse I have referred by name to Valerius\nCorvinus, in my next Chapter I shall cite his words to show what manner\nof man a captain ought to be.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\u2014_Of the Qualities of a Captain in whom his Soldiers\ncan confide._\nValerius Corvinus, as I have said already, was sent in command of an\narmy against the Samnites, who were then new enemies to Rome.\nWherefore, to reassure his soldiers and familiarize them with their\nadversaries, he made them engage with them in various unimportant\npassages of arms. But not thinking this enough, he resolved before\ndelivering battle to address his men, and by reminding them of their\nvalour and his own, to make it plain how little they should esteem such\nenemies. And from the words which Titus Livius puts in his mouth we may\ngather what manner of man the captain ought to be in whom an army will\nput its trust. For he makes him say:\u2014\u201c_Bear ye also this in mind under\nwhose conduct and auspices you are about to fight, and whether he whom\nyou are to obey be great only in exhorting, bold only in words, and all\nunpractised in arms; or whether he be one who himself knows how to use\nhis spear, to march before the eagles, and play his part in the\nthickest of the fight. Soldiers! I would have you follow my deeds and\nnot my words, and look to me for example rather than for commands; for\nwith this right hand I have won for myself three consulships, and an\nunsurpassed renown._\u201d Which words rightly understood give every one to\nknow what he must do to merit a captain\u2019s rank. And if any man obtain\nit by other means, he will soon discover that advancement due to chance\nor intrigue rather takes away than brings reputation, since it is men\nwho give lustre to titles and not titles to men.\nFrom what has been said it will likewise be understood that if great\ncaptains when matched against an unfamiliar foe have had to resort to\nunusual methods for reassuring the minds even of veteran soldiers, much\nmore will it be necessary for them to use all their address when in\ncommand of a raw and untried army which has never before looked an\nenemy in the face. For if an unfamiliar adversary inspire terror even\nin a veteran army, how much greater must be the terror which any army\nwill inspire in the minds of untrained men. And yet we often find all\nthese difficulties overcome by the supreme prudence of a great captain\nlike the Roman Gracchus or the Theban Epaminondas, of whom I have\nbefore spoken, who with untried troops defeated the most practised\nveterans. And the method they are said to have followed was to train\ntheir men for some months in mimic warfare, so as to accustom them to\ndiscipline and obedience, after which they employed them with complete\nconfidence on actual service.\nNo man, therefore, of warlike genius, need despair of creating a good\narmy if only he have the men; for the prince who has many subjects and\nyet lacks soldiers, has only to thank his own inertness and want of\nforesight, and must not complain of the cowardice of his people.\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\u2014_That a Captain should have good knowledge of Places._\nAmong other qualifications essential in a good captain is a knowledge,\nboth general and particular, of places and countries, for without such\nknowledge it is impossible for him to carry out any enterprise in the\nbest way. And while practice is needed for perfection in every art, in\nthis it is needed in the highest degree. Such practice, or particular\nknowledge as it may be termed, is sooner acquired in the chase than in\nany other exercise; and, accordingly, we find it said by ancient\nhistorians that those heroes who, in their day, ruled the world, were\nbred in the woods and trained to the chase; for this exercise not\nmerely gives the knowledge I speak of, but teaches countless other\nlessons needful in war. And Xenophon in his life of Cyrus tells us,\nthat Cyrus, on his expedition against the King of Armenia, when\nassigning to each of his followers the part he was to perform, reminded\nthem that the enterprise on which they were engaged, differed little\nfrom one of those hunting expeditions on which they had gone so often\nin his company; likening those who were to lie in ambush in the\nmountains, to the men sent to spread the toils on the hill-tops; and\nthose who were to overrun the plain, to the beaters whose business it\nis to start the game from its lair that it may be driven into the\ntoils. Now, this is related to show how, in the opinion of Xenophon,\nthe chase is a mimic representation of war, and therefore to be\nesteemed by the great as useful and honourable.\nNor can that knowledge of countries which I have spoken of as necessary\nin a commander, be obtained in any convenient way except by the chase.\nFor he who joins therein gains a special acquaintance with the\ncharacter of the country in which it is followed; and he who has made\nhimself specially familiar with one district, will afterwards readily\nunderstand the character of any strange country into which he comes.\nFor all countries, and the districts of which they are made up, have a\ncertain resemblance to one another, so that from a knowledge of one we\ncan pass easily to the knowledge of another. He therefore who is\nwithout such practical acquaintance with some one country, can only\nwith difficulty, and after a long time, obtain a knowledge of another,\nwhile he who possesses it can take in at a glance how this plain\nspreads, how that mountain slopes, whither that valley winds, and all\nother like particulars in respect of which he has already acquired a\ncertain familiarity.\nThe truth of what I affirm is shown by Titus Livius in the case of\nPublius Decius, who, being military tribune in the army which the\nconsul Cornelius led against the Samnites, when the consul advanced\ninto a defile where the Roman army were like to be shut in by the\nenemy, perceiving the great danger they ran, and noting, as Livius\nrelates, a hill which rose by a steep ascent and overhung the enemy\u2019s\ncamp, and which, though hard of access for heavy-armed troops,\npresented little difficulty to troops lightly armed, turned to the\nconsul and said:\u2014\u201c_Seest thou, Aulus Cornelius, yonder height over\nabove the enemy, which they have been blind enough to neglect? There,\nwere we manfully to seize it, might we find the citadel of our hopes\nand of our safety._\u201d Whereupon, he was sent by the consul with three\nthousand men to secure the height, and so saved the Roman army. And as\nit was part of his plan to make his own escape and carry off his men\nsafely under shelter of night, Livius represents him as saying to his\nsoldiers:\u2014\u201c_Come with me, that, while daylight still serves, we may\nlearn where the enemy have posted their guards, and by what exit we may\nissue hence._\u201d Accordingly, putting on the cloak of a common soldier,\nlest the enemy should observe that an officer was making his rounds he\nsurveyed their camp in all directions.\nNow any one who carefully studies the whole of this passage, must\nperceive how useful and necessary it is for a captain to know the\nnature of places, which knowledge had Decius not possessed he could not\nhave decided that it would be for the advantage of the Roman army to\noccupy this hill; nor could he have judged from a distance whether the\nhill was accessible or no; and when he reached the summit and desired\nto return to the consul, since he was surrounded on all sides by the\nenemy, he never could have distinguished the path it was safe for him\nto take, from those guarded by the foe. For all which reasons it was\nabsolutely essential that Decius should have that thorough knowledge\nwhich enabled him by gaining possession of this hill to save the Roman\narmy, and to discover a path whereby, in the event of his being\nattacked, he and his followers might escape.\nCHAPTER XL.\u2014_That Fraud is fair in War._\nAlthough in all other affairs it be hateful to use fraud, in the\noperations of war it is praiseworthy and glorious; so that he who gets\nthe better of his enemy by fraud, is as much extolled as he who\nprevails by force. This appears in the judgments passed by such as have\nwritten of the lives of great warriors, who praise Hannibal and those\nother captains who have been most noted for acting in this way. But\nsince we may read of many instances of such frauds, I shall not cite\nthem here. This, however, I desire to say, that I would not have it\nunderstood that any fraud is glorious which leads you to break your\nplighted word, or to depart from covenants to which you have agreed;\nfor though to do so may sometimes gain you territory and power, it can\nnever, as I have said elsewhere, gain you glory.\nThe fraud, then, which I here speak of is that employed against an\nenemy who places no trust in you, and is wholly directed to military\noperations, such as the stratagem of Hannibal at the Lake of\nThrasymene, when he feigned flight in order to draw the Roman consul\nand his army into an ambuscade; or when to escape from the hands of\nFabius Maximus he fastened lights to the horns of his oxen. Similar to\nthe above was the deceit practised by Pontius the Samnite commander to\ninveigle the Roman army into the Caudine Forks. For after he had drawn\nup his forces behind the hills, he sent out a number of his soldiers,\ndisguised as herdsmen, to drive great herds of cattle across the plain;\nwho being captured by the Romans, and interrogated as to where the\nSamnite army was, all of them, as they had been taught by Pontius,\nagreed in saying that it had gone to besiege Nocera: which being\nbelieved by the consuls, led them to advance within the Caudine Valley,\nwhere no sooner were they come than they were beset by the Samnites.\nAnd the victory thus won by a fraud would have been most glorious for\nPontius had he but taken the advice of his father Herennius, who urged\nthat the Romans should either be set at liberty unconditionally, or all\nbe put to death; but that a mean course \u201c_which neither gains friends\nnor gets rid of foes_\u201d should be avoided. And this was sound advice,\nfor, as has already been shown, in affairs of moment a mean course is\nalways hurtful.\nCHAPTER XLI.\u2014_That our Country is to be defended by Honour or by\nDishonour; and in either way is well defended._\nThe consuls together with the whole Roman army fell, as I have related,\ninto the hands of the Samnites, who imposed on them the most\nignominious terms, insisting that they should be stripped of their\narms, and pass under the yoke before they were allowed to return to\nRome. The consuls being astounded by the harshness of these conditions\nand the whole army overwhelmed with dismay, Lucius Lentulus, the Roman\nlieutenant, stood forward and said, that in his opinion they ought to\ndecline no course whereby their country might be saved; and that as the\nvery existence of Rome depended on the preservation of her army, that\narmy must be saved at any sacrifice, for whether the means be\nhonourable or ignominious, all is well done that is done for the\ndefence of our country. And he said that were her army preserved, Rome,\nin course of time, might wipe out the disgrace; but if her army were\ndestroyed, however gloriously it might perish, Rome and her freedom\nwould perish with it. In the event his counsel was followed.\nNow this incident deserves to be noted and pondered over by every\ncitizen who is called on to advise his country; for when the entire\nsafety of our country is at stake, no consideration of what is just or\nunjust, merciful or cruel, praiseworthy or shameful, must intervene. On\nthe contrary, every other consideration being set aside, that course\nalone must be taken which preserves the existence of the country and\nmaintains its liberty. And this course we find followed by the people\nof France, both in their words and in their actions, with the view of\nsupporting the dignity of their king and the integrity of their\nkingdom; for there is no remark they listen to with more impatience\nthan that this or the other course is disgraceful to the king. For\ntheir king, they say, can incur no disgrace by any resolve he may take,\nwhether it turn out well or ill; and whether it succeed or fail, all\nmaintain that he has acted as a king should.\nCHAPTER XLII.\u2014_That Promises made on Compulsion are not to be\nobserved._\nWhen, after being subjected to this disgrace, the consuls returned to\nRome with their disarmed legions, Spurius Posthumius, himself one of\nthe consuls, was the first to contend in the senate that the terms made\nin the Caudine Valley were not to be observed. For he argued that the\nRoman people were not bound by them, though he himself doubtless was,\ntogether with all the others who had promised peace; wherefore, if the\npeople desired to set themselves free from every engagement, he and all\nthe rest who had given this promise must be made over as prisoners into\nthe hands of the Samnites. And so steadfastly did he hold to this\nopinion, that the senate were content to adopt it, and sending him and\nthe rest as prisoners back to Samnium, protested to the Samnites that\nthe peace was not binding. And so kind was Fortune to Posthumius on\nthis occasion, that the Samnites would not keep him as a prisoner, and\nthat on his return to Rome, notwithstanding his defeat, he was held in\nhigher honour by the Romans than the victorious Pontius by his\ncountrymen.\nHere two points are to be noted; first, that glory may be won by any\naction; for although, commonly, it follow upon victory, it may also\nfollow on defeat, if this defeat be seen to have happened through no\nfault of yours, or if, directly after, you perform some valiant action\nwhich cancels it. The other point to be noted is that there is no\ndisgrace in not observing promises wrung from you by force; for\npromises thus extorted when they affect the public welfare will always\nbe broken so soon as the pressure under which they were made is\nwithdrawn, and that, too, without shame on the part of him who breaks\nthem; of which we read many instances in history, and find them\nconstantly occurring at the present day. Nay, as between princes, not\nonly are such compulsory promises broken when the force which extorted\nthem is removed, but all other promises as well, are in like manner\ndisregarded when the causes which led to them no longer operate.\nWhether this is a thing to be commended or no, and whether such methods\nought or ought not to be followed by princes, has already been\nconsidered by me in my \u201c_Treatise of the Prince_\u201d wherefore I say no\nmore on that subject here.\nCHAPTER XLIII.\u2014_That Men born in the same Province retain through all\nTimes nearly the same Character._\nThe wise are wont to say, and not without reason or at random, that he\nwho would forecast what is about to happen should look to what has\nbeen; since all human events, whether present or to come, have their\nexact counterpart in the past. And this, because these events are\nbrought about by men, whose passions and dispositions remaining in all\nages the same naturally give rise to the same effects; although,\ndoubtless, the operation of these causes takes a higher form, now in\none province, and now in another, according to the character of the\ntraining wherein the inhabitants of these provinces acquire their way\nof life.\nAnother aid towards judging of the future by the past, is to observe\nhow the same nation long retains the same customs, remaining constantly\ncovetous or deceitful, or similarly stamped by some one vice or virtue.\nAny one reading the past history of our city of Florence, and noting\nwhat has recently befallen it, will find the French and German nations\noverflowing with avarice, pride, cruelty, and perfidy, all of which\nfour vices have at divers times wrought much harm to our city. As an\ninstance of their perfidy, every one knows how often payments of money\nwere made to Charles VIII. of France, in return for which he engaged to\nrestore the fortresses of Pisa, yet never did restore them, manifesting\nthereby his bad faith and grasping avarice. Or, to pass from these very\nrecent events, all may have heard of what happened in the war in which\nthe Florentines were involved with the Visconti, dukes of Milan, when\nFlorence, being left without other resource, resolved to invite the\nemperor into Italy, that she might be assisted by his name and power in\nher struggle with Lombardy. The emperor promised to come with a strong\narmy to take part against the Visconti and to protect Florence from\nthem, on condition that the Florentines paid him a hundred thousand\nducats on his setting out, and another hundred thousand on his arrival\nin Italy; to which terms the Florentines agreed. But although he then\nreceived payment of the first instalment and, afterwards, on reaching\nVerona, of the second, he turned back from the expedition without\neffecting anything, alleging as his excuse that he was stopped by\ncertain persons who had failed to fulfil their engagements. But if\nFlorence had not been urged by passion or overcome by necessity, or had\nshe read of and understood the ancient usages of the barbarians, she\nwould neither on this, nor on many other occasions, have been deceived\nby them, seeing that these nations have always been of the same\ncharacter, and have always, in all circumstances, and with all men\nalike, used the same methods. For in ancient times we find them\nbehaving after the same fashion to the Etruscans, who, when overpowered\nby the Romans, by whom they had been repeatedly routed and put to\nflight, perceiving that they could not stand without help, entered into\na compact with the Gauls dwelling in the parts of Italy south of the\nAlps, to pay them a certain sum if they would unite with them in a\ncampaign against the Romans. But the Gauls, after taking their money,\nrefused to arm on their behalf, alleging that they had not been paid to\nmake war on the enemies of the Etruscans, but only to refrain from\npillaging their lands. And thus the people of Etruria, through the\navarice and perfidy of the Gauls, were at once defrauded of their money\nand disappointed of the help which they had counted on obtaining.\nFrom which two instances of the Etruscans in ancient times and of the\nFlorentines in recent, we may see that barbaric races have constantly\nfollowed the same methods, and may easily draw our conclusions as to\nhow far princes should trust them.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\u2014_That where ordinary methods fail, Hardihood and Daring\noften succeed._\nWhen attacked by the Romans, the Samnites as they could not without\nhelp stand against them in the field, resolved to leave garrisons in\nthe towns of Samnium, and to pass with their main army into Etruria,\nthat country being then at truce with Rome, and thus ascertain whether\ntheir actual presence in arms might not move the Etruscans to renew\nhostilities against Rome, which they had refused to renew when invited\nthrough envoys. During the negotiations which, on this occasion, passed\nbetween the two nations, the Samnites in explaining the chief causes\nthat led them to take up arms, used the memorable words\u2014\u201c_they had\nrisen because peace is a heavier burthen for slaves than war for\nfreemen_\u201d In the end, partly by their persuasions, and partly by the\npresence of their army, they induced the Etruscans to join forces with\nthem.\nHere we are to note that when a prince would obtain something from\nanother, he ought, if the occasion allow, to leave him no time to\ndeliberate, but should so contrive that the other may see the need of\nresolving at once; as he will, if he perceive that refusal or delay in\ncomplying with what is asked of him, will draw upon him a sudden and\ndangerous resentment.\nThis method we have seen employed with good effect in our own times by\nPope Julius II. in dealing with France, and by M. de Foix, the general\nof the French king, in dealing with the Marquis of Mantua. For Pope\nJulius desiring to expel the Bentivogli from Bologna, and thinking that\nfor this purpose he needed the help of French troops, and to have the\nVenetians neutral, after sounding both and receiving from both\nhesitating and ambiguous answers, determined to make both fall in with\nhis views, by giving them no time to oppose him; and so, setting forth\nfrom Rome with as strong a force as he could get together, he marched\non Bologna, sending word to the Venetians that they must stand aloof,\nand to the King of France to send him troops. The result was that in\nthe brief time allowed them, neither of the two powers could make up\ntheir mind to thwart him; and knowing that refusal or delay would be\nviolently resented by the Pope, they yielded to his demands, the king\nsending him soldiers and the Venetians maintaining neutrality.\nM. de Foix, again, being with the king\u2019s army in Bologna when word came\nthat Brescia had risen, could not rest till he had recovered that town.\nBut, to get there he had to choose between two routes, one long and\ncircuitous leading through the territories of the king, the other short\nand direct. In taking the latter route, however, not only would he have\nto pass through the dominions of the Marquis of Mantua, but also to\nmake his way into these through the lakes and marshes wherewith that\ncountry abounds, by following an embanked road, closed and guarded by\nthe marquis with forts and other defensive works. Resolving,\nnevertheless, to take the shortest road at all hazards, he waited till\nhis men were already on their march before signifying to the marquis\nthat he desired leave to pass through his country, so that no time\nmight be left him to deliberate. Taken aback by the unexpected demand,\nthe marquis gave the leave sought, which he never would have given had\nDe Foix acted with less impetuosity. For he was in league with the\nVenetians and with the Pope, and had a son in the hands of the latter;\nall which circumstances would have afforded him fair pretexts for\nrefusal. But carried away by the suddenness and urgency of the demand,\nhe yielded. And in like manner the Etruscans yielded to the instances\nof the Samnites, the presence of whose army decided them to renew\nhostilities which before they had declined to renew.\nCHAPTER XLV.\u2014_Whether in battle it is better to await and repel the\nEnemy\u2019s attack, or to anticipate it by an impetuous onset._\nDecius and Fabius, the Roman consuls, were each of them in command of a\nseparate army, one directed against the Samnites, the other against the\nEtruscans: and as both delivered battle, we have to pronounce, in\nrespect of the two engagements, which commander followed the better\nmethod. Decius attacked his enemy at once with the utmost fury and with\nhis whole strength. Fabius was content, at first, merely to maintain\nhis ground; for judging that more was to be gained by a later attack,\nhe reserved his forces for a final effort, when the ardour of the enemy\nhad cooled and his energy spent itself. The event showed Fabius to be\nmore successful in his tactics than Decius, who being exhausted by his\nfirst onset, and seeing his ranks begin to waver, to secure by death\nthe glory he could no longer hope from victory, followed the example\nset him by his father, and sacrificed himself to save the Roman\nlegions. Word whereof being brought to Fabius, he, to gain, while he\nyet lived, as much honour as the other had earned by his death, pushed\nforward all the troops he had reserved for his final effort, and so\nobtained an unexampled victory. Whence we see that of the two methods,\nthat of Fabius was the safer and the more deserving our imitation.\nCHAPTER XLVI.\u2014_How the Characteristics of Families come to be\nperpetuated._\nManners and institutions differing in different cities, seem here to\nproduce a harder and there a softer race; and a like difference may\nalso be discerned in the character of different families in the same\ncity. And while this holds good of all cities, we have many instances\nof it in reading the history of Rome. For we find the Manlii always\nstern and stubborn; the Valerii kindly and courteous; the Claudii\nhaughty and ambitious; and many families besides similarly\ndistinguished from one another by their peculiar qualities.\nThese qualities we cannot refer wholly to the _blood_, for that must\nchange as a result of repeated intermarriages, but must ascribe rather\nto the different training and education given in different families.\nFor much turns on whether a child of tender years hears a thing well or\nill spoken of, since this must needs make an impression on him whereby\nhis whole conduct in after life will be influenced. Were it otherwise\nwe should not have found the whole family of the Claudii moved by the\ndesires and stirred by the passions which Titus Livius notes in many of\nthem, and more especially in one holding the office of censor, who,\nwhen his colleague laid down his magistracy, as the law prescribed, at\nthe end of eighteen months, would not resign, maintaining that he was\nentitled to hold the office for five years in accordance with the\noriginal law by which the censorship was regulated. And although his\nrefusal gave occasion to much controversy, and bred great tumult and\ndisturbance, no means could be found to depose him from his office,\nwhich he persisted in retaining in opposition to the will of the entire\ncommons and a majority of the senate. And any who shall read the speech\nmade against him by Publius Sempronius, tribune of the people, will\nfind therein all the Claudian insolence exposed, and will recognize the\ndocility and good temper shown by the body of the citizens in\nrespecting the laws and institutions of their country.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\u2014_That love of his Country should lead a good Citizen to\nforget private Wrongs._\nWhile commanding as consul against the Samnites, Manlius was wounded in\na skirmish. His army being thereby endangered, the senate judged it\nexpedient to send Papirius Cursor as dictator to supply his place. But\nas it was necessary that the dictator should be nominated by Fabius,\nthe other consul, who was with the army in Etruria, and as a doubt was\nfelt that he might refuse to nominate Papirius, who was his enemy, the\nsenate sent two messengers to entreat him to lay aside private\nanimosity, and make the nomination which the public interest required.\nMoved by love of his country Fabius did as he was asked, although by\nhis silence, and by many other signs, he gave it to be known that\ncompliance was distasteful. From his conduct at this juncture all who\nwould be thought good citizens should take example.\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\u2014_That on finding an Enemy make what seems a grave\nblunder, we should suspect some fraud to lurk behind._\nThe consul having gone to Rome to perform certain ceremonial rites, and\nFulvius being left in charge of the Roman army in Etruria, the\nEtruscans, to see whether they could not circumvent the new commander,\nplanting an ambush not far from the Roman camp, sent forward soldiers\ndisguised as shepherds driving large flocks of sheep so as to pass in\nsight of the Roman army. These pretended shepherds coming close to the\nwall of his camp, Fulvius, marvelling at what appeared to him\nunaccountable audacity, hit upon a device whereby the artifice of the\nEtruscans was detected and their design defeated.\nHere it seems proper to note that the captain of an army ought not to\nbuild on what seems a manifest blunder on the part of an enemy; for as\nmen are unlikely to act with conspicuous want of caution, it will\ncommonly be found that this blunder is cover to a fraud. And yet, so\nblinded are men\u2019s minds by their eagerness for victory, that they look\nonly to what appears on the surface.\nAfter defeating the Romans on the Allia, the Gauls, hastening on to\nRome, found the gates of the city left open and unguarded. But fearing\nsome stratagem, and being unable to believe that the Romans could be so\nfoolish and cowardly as to abandon their city, they waited during the\nwhole of that day and the following night outside the gates, without\ndaring to enter. In the year 1508, when the Florentines Avere engaged\nin besieging Pisa, Alfonso del Mutolo, a citizen of that town,\nhappening to be taken prisoner, was released on his promise to procure\nthe surrender to the Florentines of one of the gates of the city.\nAfterwards, on pretence of arranging for the execution of this\nsurrender, he came repeatedly to confer with those whom the Florentine\ncommissaries had deputed to treat with him, coming not secretly but\nopenly, and accompanied by other citizens of Pisa, whom he caused to\nstand aside while he conversed with the Florentines. From all which\ncircumstances his duplicity might have been suspected, since, had he\nmeant to do as he had engaged, it was most unlikely that he should be\nnegotiating so openly. But the desire to recover possession of Pisa so\nblinded the Florentines that they allowed themselves to be conducted\nunder his guidance to the Lucca Gate, where, through his treachery, but\nto their own disgrace, they lost a large number of their men and\nofficers.\nCHAPTER XLIX.\u2014_That a Commonwealth to preserve its Freedom has constant\nneed of new Ordinances. Of the services in respect of which Quintius\nFabius received the surname of Maximus._\nIt must happen, as I have already said, in every great city, that\ndisorders needing the care of the physician continually spring up; and\nthe graver these disorders are, the greater will be the skill needed\nfor their treatment. And if ever in any city, most assuredly in Rome,\nwe see these disorders assume strange and unexpected shapes. As when it\nappeared that all the Roman wives had conspired to murder their\nhusbands, many of them being found to have actually administered\npoison, and many others to have drugs in readiness for the purpose.\nOf like nature was the conspiracy of the Bacchanals, discovered at the\ntime of the Macedonian war, wherein many thousands, both men and women,\nwere implicated, and which, had it not been found out, or had the\nRomans not been accustomed to deal with large bodies of offenders, must\nhave proved perilous for their city. And, indeed, if the greatness of\nthe Roman Republic were not declared by countless other signs, as well\nas by the manner in which it caused its laws to be observed, it might\nbe seen in the character of the punishments which it inflicted against\nwrong-doers. For in vindicating justice, it would not scruple or\nhesitate to put a whole legion to death, to depopulate an entire city,\nor send eight or ten thousand men at a time into banishment, subject to\nthe most stringent conditions, which had to be observed, not by one of\nthese exiles only, but by all. As in the case of those soldiers who\nfought unsuccessfully at Cann\u00e6, who were banished to Sicily, subject to\nthe condition that they should not harbour in towns, and should all eat\nstanding.\nBut the most formidable of all their punishments was that whereby one\nman out of every ten in an entire army was chosen by lot to be put to\ndeath. For correcting a great body of men no more effectual means could\nbe devised; because, when a multitude have offended and the ringleaders\nare not known, all cannot be punished, their number being too great;\nwhile to punish some only, and leave the rest unpunished, were unjust\nto those punished and an encouragement to those passed over to offend\nagain. But where you put to death a tenth chosen by lot, where all\nequally deserve death, he who is punished will blame his unlucky\nfortune, while he who escapes will be afraid that another time the lot\nmay be his, and for that reason will be careful how he repeats his\noffence. The poisoners and the Bacchanals, therefore, were punished as\ntheir crimes deserved.\nAlthough disorders like these occasion mischievous results in a\ncommonwealth, still they are not fatal, since almost always there is\ntime to correct them. But no time is given in the case of disorders in\nthe State itself, which unless they be treated by some wise citizen,\nwill always bring a city to destruction. From the readiness wherewith\nthe Romans conferred the right of citizenship on foreigners, there came\nto be so many new citizens in Rome, and possessed of so large a share\nof the suffrage, that the government itself began to alter, forsaking\nthose courses which it was accustomed to follow, and growing estranged\nfrom the men to whom it had before looked for guidance. Which being\nobserved by Quintius Fabius when censor, he caused all those new\ncitizens to be classed in four _Tribes_, that being reduced within this\nnarrow limit they might not have it in their power to corrupt the\nentire State. And this was a wisely contrived measure, for, without\nintroducing any violent change, it supplied a convenient remedy, and\none so acceptable to the republic as to gain for Fabius the\nwell-deserved name of Maximus.\nTHE END.", "source": "discourses.txt"}
