{"text": "LETTER VII. ON CROWDS\nGreetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nDO you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I answer: crowds. For as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety. I shall admit my own weakness, at any rate; for I never bring back home the same character that I took abroad with me. Something of that which I have forced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes that I have routed return again. Just as the sick man, who has been weak for a long time, is in such a condition that he cannot be taken out of the house without suffering a relapse, so we ourselves are affected when our souls are recovering from a lingering disease.\nTo consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unwittingly. The greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger.\nBut nothing is so damaging to good character as the habit of lounging at the games; for then it is that vice steals subtly upon one through the avenue of pleasure. What do you think I mean? I mean that I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous, and even more cruel and inhuman, because I have been among human beings. By chance I attended a mid-day exhibition, expecting some fun, wit, and relaxation,\u2014an exhibition at which men's eyes have a respite from the slaughter of their fellow-men. But it was quite the reverse. The previous combats were the essence of mercy; but now all the trifling is put aside and it is pure murder. The men have no defensive armour. They are exposed to blows at all points, and no one ever strikes in vain. Many persons prefer this programme to the usual pairs and to the bouts \"by request.\" Of course they do; there is no helmet or shield to deflect the weapon. What is the need of defensive armour, or of skill? All these mean delaying death. In the morning they throw men to the lions and the bears; at noon, they throw them to the spectators. The spectators demand that the slayer shall face the man who is to slay him in his turn; and they always reserve the latest conqueror for another butchery. The outcome of every fight is death, and the means are fire and sword. This sort of thing goes on while the arena is empty. You may retort: \"But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!\" And what of it? Granted that, as a murderer, he deserved this punishment, what crime have you committed, poor fellow, that you should deserve to sit and see this show? In the morning they cried \"Kill him! Lash him! Burn him! Why does he meet the sword in so cowardly a way? Why does he strike so feebly? Why doesn't he die game? Whip him to meet his wounds! Let them receive blow for blow, with chests bare and exposed to the stroke!\" And when the games stop for the intermission, they announce: \"A little throat-cutting in the meantime, so that there may still be something going on!\"\nCome now; do you not understand even this truth: that a bad example reacts on the agent? Thank the immortal gods that you are teaching cruelty to a person who cannot learn to be cruel. The young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob; it is too easy to side with the majority. Even Socrates, Cato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their moral strength by a crowd that was unlike them; so true it is that none of us, no matter how much he cultivates his abilities, can withstand the shock of faults that approach, as it were, with so great a retinue. Much harm is done by a single case of indulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he be luxurious, weakens and softens us imperceptibly; the neighbour, if he be rich, rouses our covetousness; the companion, if he be slanderous, rubs off some of his rust upon us, even though we be spotless and sincere. What then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world at large assaults it! You must either imitate or loathe the world. But both courses are to be shunned; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach.\nThere is no reason why pride in advertising your abilities should lure you into publicity, so that you should desire to recite or harangue before the general public. Of course I should be willing for you to do so if you had a stock-in-trade that suited such a mob; but there is nothing in your goods that they can understand. There may be perchance one or two who will understand them; and even these will need to be moulded and educated by you so that they can understand you. \"For whose benefit, then, have I learned all this?\" you ask. Why, you have learned it for yourself.\nMuch more I could say to you about this, but I have already written a long letter. I shall end it with a quotation which I found in our Hecato; for I have taken to reading him lately. \"I used to be surprised,\" says he, \"at the number of things which made you a philosopher.\" \"But,\" says the objector, \"you have already shown me the path; now tell me what I am to find there.\" And here is the answer: \"You will find a friend.\"\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_7_on_crowds.txt"}
{"text": "LETTER I. ON SAVING TIME\nGreetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.\nCONTINUE to act thus, my dear Lucilius\u2014set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words,\u2014that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.\nTherefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,\u2014time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess that, for my part, I keep an account of my spending. I cannot say that I lose nothing, but I can say what I lose, and why, and how; I can give you the reasons for my poverty. But it happens to me as it happens to many others who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: everyone forgives them, but no one gives them a helping hand.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_1_on_saving_time.txt"}
{"text": "ON ANGER (DE IRA) - EXCERPTS\nWe must prevent anger from coming to the fore; for if it once begins to lead the charge, it is hard to retreat. Reason is strong only so long as it stands aloof from the passions; if it once mixes with them, it is polluted and unable to hold back what it might have cleared away. For when the mind has once been shaken and thrown off its balance, it becomes the slave of the impulse which urges it on. Certain things, at the start, are in our own power, but later on they drag us by their own force and allow us no retreat. Thus a man running down a steep slope cannot stop just where he wishes, but the weight of his body and the irreversible nature of his course carry him further than he intended.\nThe best plan is to reject straightway the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once passion has been admitted to the mind, and has by our own free will been given a certain authority, it will for the future do as much as it chooses, not only as much as you will allow it. The enemy, I repeat, must be met and driven back at the outermost frontier-line: for when he has once entered the city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.\nLet us then consider how we may avoid falling into anger, or how we may free ourselves from it. And the first thing is not to be angry at all; the second, to cease from being angry.\nSome may think that anger is necessary for the punishment of crimes and the defense of the state. But virtue does not need the help of vice. Reason is sufficient for all the needs of life. When reason punishes, it does so not because it delights in punishment, but because it is necessary. It looks to the future, not to the past. It does not punish because a crime has been committed, but in order that crimes may not be committed. It is not angry, but it is firm.\nIf you wish to correct a man who is doing wrong, you must be calm yourself. For if you are angry, you are doing wrong yourself. How can you correct another when you yourself need correction? The physician does not get angry with his patient, but tries to cure him. We should look upon sinners as sick men who need to be cured.\nWe are all bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us\u2014we must agree to go easy with one another.", "source": "on_anger_excerpt.txt"}
