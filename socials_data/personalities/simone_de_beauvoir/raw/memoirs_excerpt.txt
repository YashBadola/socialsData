I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the ninth of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. My father was a man of culture and tradition, while my mother was a devout Catholic. I grew up torn between these two influences, but early on I decided that I would be a writer. I wanted to tell the truth about my life and the world.

Meeting Sartre was the great event of my life. We made a pact: we would be "essential" loves, but we would also allow ourselves "contingent" loves. We would never lie to each other. This radical honesty was difficult at times, but it allowed us to build a relationship based on absolute transparency and intellectual companionship. We would sit in cafes for hours, working side by side, discussing our ideas, critiquing each other's manuscripts.

I remember those days at the Sorbonne, the feeling of intellectual awakening. We felt that we were inventing a new way of living, a new philosophy. We wanted to tear down the bourgeois hypocrisies that suffocated society. We were young, arrogant perhaps, but fueled by a genuine passion for ideas.

As I look back, I see that my life has been a long struggle to forge my own path, to define myself not as a daughter, a wife, or a muse, but as an independent woman and a thinker. Writing has been my salvation, my way of making sense of the chaos of existence. Every book I wrote was an attempt to answer the question: What does it mean to be a woman? What does it mean to be free?
