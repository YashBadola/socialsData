{"text": "INTRODUCTION.\nOUR age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It\nwrites biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing\ngenerations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their\neyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the\nuniverse? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of\ninsight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and\nnot the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose\nfloods of life stream around and through us, and invite us by the\npowers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, why should we\ngrope among the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation\ninto masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day\nalso. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are new lands,\nnew men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws\nand worship.\nUndoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswerable.\nWe must trust the perfection of the creation so far, as to believe that\nwhatever curiosity the order of things has awakened in our minds,\nthe order of things can satisfy. Every man's condition is a solution in\nhieroglyphic to those inquiries he would put. He acts it as life,\nbefore he apprehends it as truth. In like manner, nature is already, in\nits forms and tendencies, describing its own design. Let us\ninterrogate the great apparition, that shines so peacefully around us.\nLet us inquire, to what end is nature?\nAll science has one aim, namely, to find a theory of nature. We have\ntheories of races and of functions, but scarcely yet a remote\napproach to an idea of creation. We are now so far from the road to\ntruth, that religious teachers dispute and hate each other, and\nspeculative men are esteemed unsound and frivolous. But to a sound\njudgment, the most abstract truth is the most practical. Whenever a\ntrue theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is, that it will\nexplain all phenomena. Now many are thought not only unexplained\nbut inexplicable; as language, sleep, madness, dreams, beasts, sex.\nPhilosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and\nthe Soul. Strictly speaking, therefore, all that is separate from us, all\nwhich Philosophy distinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature\nand art, all other men and my own body, must be ranked under this\nname, NATURE. In enumerating the values of nature and casting up\ntheir sum, I shall use the word in both senses;--in its common and in\nits philosophical import. In inquiries so general as our present one,\nthe inaccuracy is not material; no confusion of thought will occur.\n_Nature_, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by\nman; space, the air, the river, the leaf. _Art_ is applied to the\nmixture of his will with the same things, as in a house, a canal, a\nstatue, a picture. But his operations taken together are so\ninsignificant, a little chipping, baking, patching, and washing, that in\nan impression so grand as that of the world on the human mind, they\ndo not vary the result.\nNATURE.\nCHAPTER I.\nTO go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber\nas from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though\nnobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the\nstars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate\nbetween him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere\nwas made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly\nbodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of\ncities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a\nthousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for\nmany generations the remembrance of the city of God which had\nbeen shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and\nlight the universe with their admonishing smile.\nThe stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present,\nthey are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kindred\nimpression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never\nwears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man extort her\nsecret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her perfection. Nature\nnever became a toy to a wise spirit. The flowers, the animals, the\nmountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they\nhad delighted the simplicity of his childhood.\nWhen we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most\npoetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression\nmade by manifold natural objects. It is this which distinguishes the\nstick of timber of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet. The\ncharming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made\nup of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that,\nand Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the\nlandscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but\nhe whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the\nbest part of these men's farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give\nno title.\nTo speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do\nnot see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun\nilluminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the\nheart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and\noutward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has\nretained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. His\nintercourse with heaven and earth, becomes part of his daily food. In\nthe presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite\nof real sorrows. Nature says,--he is my creature, and maugre all his\nimpertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me. Not the sun or the\nsummer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight;\nfor every hour and change corresponds to and authorizes a different\nstate of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight.\nNature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning piece.\nIn good health, the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a\nbare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky,\nwithout having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good\nfortune, I have enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink\nof fear. In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his\nslough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the\nwoods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a\ndecorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the\nguest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the\nwoods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can\nbefall me in life,--no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,)\nwhich nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,--my head\nbathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,--all mean\negotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I\nsee all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I\nam part or particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds\nthen foreign and accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances,\n--master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of\nuncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find\nsomething more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the\ntranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon,\nman beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.\nThe greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the\nsuggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I\nam not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them.\nThe waving of the boughs in the storm, is new to me and old. It\ntakes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of\na higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I\ndeemed I was thinking justly or doing right.\nYet it is certain that the power to produce this delight, does not\nreside in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary\nto use these pleasures with great temperance. For, nature is not\nalways tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday\nbreathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs, is\noverspread with melancholy today. Nature always wears the colors\nof the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own\nfire hath sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the\nlandscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The\nsky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.\nCHAPTER II.\nCOMMODITY.\nWHOEVER considers the final cause of the world, will discern a\nmultitude of uses that result. They all admit of being thrown into one\nof the following classes; Commodity; Beauty; Language; and\nDiscipline.\nUnder the general name of Commodity, I rank all those advantages\nwhich our senses owe to nature. This, of course, is a benefit which is\ntemporary and mediate, not ultimate, like its service to the soul. Yet\nalthough low, it is perfect in its kind, and is the only use of nature\nwhich all men apprehend. The misery of man appears like childish\npetulance, when we explore the steady and prodigal provision that\nhas been made for his support and delight on this green ball which\nfloats him through the heavens. What angels invented these splendid\nornaments, these rich conveniences, this ocean of air above, this\nocean of water beneath, this firmament of earth between? this zodiac\nof lights, this tent of dropping clouds, this striped coat of climates,\nthis fourfold year? Beasts, fire, water, stones, and corn serve him.\nThe field is at once his floor, his work-yard, his play-ground, his\ngarden, and his bed.\n\"More servants wait on man\nThan he'll take notice of.\"--\nNature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the\nprocess and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each\nother's hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun\nevaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on\nthe other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the\nplant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of\nthe divine charity nourish man.\nThe useful arts are reproductions or new combinations by the wit of\nman, of the same natural benefactors. He no longer waits for\nfavoring gales, but by means of steam, he realizes the fable of\nAeolus's bag, and carries the two and thirty winds in the boiler of his\nboat. To diminish friction, he paves the road with iron bars,\nand, mounting a coach with a ship-load of men, animals, and\nmerchandise behind him, he darts through the country, from town to\ntown, like an eagle or a swallow through the air. By the aggregate of\nthese aids, how is the face of the world changed, from the era of\nNoah to that of Napoleon! The private poor man hath cities, ships,\ncanals, bridges, built for him. He goes to the post-office, and the\nhuman race run on his errands; to the book-shop, and the human\nrace read and write of all that happens, for him; to the court-house,\nand nations repair his wrongs. He sets his house upon the road, and\nthe human race go forth every morning, and shovel out the snow,\nand cut a path for him.\nBut there is no need of specifying particulars in this class of uses.\nThe catalogue is endless, and the examples so obvious, that I shall\nleave them to the reader's reflection, with the general remark, that\nthis mercenary benefit is one which has respect to a farther good. A\nman is fed, not that he may be fed, but that he may work.\nCHAPTER III.\nBEAUTY.\nA NOBLER want of man is served by nature, namely, the love of\nBeauty.\nThe ancient Greeks called the world _kosmos_, beauty. Such is the\nconstitution of all things, or such the plastic power of the human eye,\nthat the primary forms, as the sky, the mountain, the tree, the animal,\ngive us a delight _in and for themselves_; a pleasure arising from\noutline, color, motion, and grouping. This seems partly owing to the\neye itself. The eye is the best of artists. By the mutual action of its\nstructure and of the laws of light, perspective is produced, which\nintegrates every mass of objects, of what character soever, into a\nwell colored and shaded globe, so that where the particular objects\nare mean and unaffecting, the landscape which they compose, is\nround and symmetrical. And as the eye is the best composer, so light\nis the first of painters. There is no object so foul that intense light\nwill not make beautiful. And the stimulus it affords to the sense, and\na sort of infinitude which it hath, like space and time, make all\nmatter gay. Even the corpse has its own beauty. But besides this\ngeneral grace diffused over nature, almost all the individual forms\nare agreeable to the eye, as is proved by our endless imitations of\nsome of them, as the acorn, the grape, the pine-cone, the wheat-ear,\nthe egg, the wings and forms of most birds, the lion's claw, the\nserpent, the butterfly, sea-shells, flames, clouds, buds, leaves, and\nthe forms of many trees, as the palm.\nFor better consideration, we may distribute the aspects of Beauty in\na threefold manner.\n1. First, the simple perception of natural forms is a delight. The\ninfluence of the forms and actions in nature, is so needful to man,\nthat, in its lowest functions, it seems to lie on the confines of\ncommodity and beauty. To the body and mind which have been\ncramped by noxious work or company, nature is medicinal and\nrestores their tone. The tradesman, the attorney comes out of the din\nand craft of the street, and sees the sky and the woods, and is a man\nagain. In their eternal calm, he finds himself. The health of the eye\nseems to demand a horizon. We are never tired, so long as we can\nsee far enough.\nBut in other hours, Nature satisfies by its loveliness, and without any\nmixture of corporeal benefit. I see the spectacle of morning from the\nhill-top over against my house, from day-break to sun-rise, with\nemotions which an angel might share. The long slender bars of\ncloud float like fishes in the sea of crimson light. From the earth, as\na shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid\ntransformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I\ndilate and conspire with the morning wind. How does Nature deify\nus with a few and cheap elements! Give me health and a day, and I\nwill make the pomp of emperors ridiculous. The dawn is my Assyria;\nthe sun-set and moon-rise my Paphos, and unimaginable realms of\nfaerie; broad noon shall be my England of the senses and the\nunderstanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic philosophy\nand dreams.\nNot less excellent, except for our less susceptibility in the afternoon,\nwas the charm, last evening, of a January sunset. The western clouds\ndivided and subdivided themselves into pink flakes modulated with\ntints of unspeakable softness; and the air had so much life and\nsweetness, that it was a pain to come within doors. What was it that\nnature would say? Was there no meaning in the live repose of the\nvalley behind the mill, and which Homer or Shakspeare could not\nreform for me in words? The leafless trees become spires of flame in\nthe sunset, with the blue east for their back-ground, and the stars of\nthe dead calices of flowers, and every withered stem and stubble\nrimed with frost, contribute something to the mute music.\nThe inhabitants of cities suppose that the country landscape is\npleasant only half the year. I please myself with the graces of the\nwinter scenery, and believe that we are as much touched by it as by\nthe genial influences of summer. To the attentive eye, each moment\nof the year has its own beauty, and in the same field, it beholds,\nevery hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall\nnever be seen again. The heavens change every moment, and reflect\ntheir glory or gloom on the plains beneath. The state of the crop in\nthe surrounding farms alters the expression of the earth from week\nto week. The succession of native plants in the pastures and\nroadsides, which makes the silent clock by which time tells the\nsummer hours, will make even the divisions of the day sensible to a\nkeen observer. The tribes of birds and insects, like the plants\npunctual to their time, follow each other, and the year has room for\nall. By water-courses, the variety is greater. In July, the blue\npontederia or pickerel-weed blooms in large beds in the shallow\nparts of our pleasant river, and swarms with yellow butterflies in\ncontinual motion. Art cannot rival this pomp of purple and gold.\nIndeed the river is a perpetual gala, and boasts each month a new\nornament.\nBut this beauty of Nature which is seen and felt as beauty, is the\nleast part. The shows of day, the dewy morning, the rainbow,\nmountains, orchards in blossom, stars, moonlight, shadows in still\nwater, and the like, if too eagerly hunted, become shows merely, and\nmock us with their unreality. Go out of the house to see the moon,\nand 't is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its light shines upon\nyour necessary journey. The beauty that shimmers in the yellow\nafternoons of October, who ever could clutch it? Go forth to find it,\nand it is gone: 't is only a mirage as you look from the windows of\ndiligence.\n2. The presence of a higher, namely, of the spiritual element is\nessential to its perfection. The high and divine beauty which can be\nloved without effeminacy, is that which is found in combination\nwith the human will. Beauty is the mark God sets upon virtue. Every\nnatural action is graceful. Every heroic act is also decent, and causes\nthe place and the bystanders to shine. We are taught by great actions\nthat the universe is the property of every individual in it. Every\nrational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his, if\nhe will. He may divest himself of it; he may creep into a corner, and\nabdicate his kingdom, as most men do, but he is entitled to the world\nby his constitution. In proportion to the energy of his thought and\nwill, he takes up the world into himself. \"All those things for which\nmen plough, build, or sail, obey virtue;\" said Sallust. \"The winds\nand waves,\" said Gibbon, \"are always on the side of the ablest\nnavigators.\" So are the sun and moon and all the stars of heaven.\nWhen a noble act is done,--perchance in a scene of great natural\nbeauty; when Leonidas and his three hundred martyrs consume one\nday in dying, and the sun and moon come each and look at them\nonce in the steep defile of Thermopylae; when Arnold Winkelried,\nin the high Alps, under the shadow of the avalanche, gathers in his\nside a sheaf of Austrian spears to break the line for his comrades; are\nnot these heroes entitled to add the beauty of the scene to the beauty\nof the deed? When the bark of Columbus nears the shore of\nAmerica;--before it, the beach lined with savages, fleeing out of all\ntheir huts of cane; the sea behind; and the purple mountains of the\nIndian Archipelago around, can we separate the man from the living\npicture? Does not the New World clothe his form with her\npalm-groves and savannahs as fit drapery? Ever does natural beauty steal\nin like air, and envelope great actions. When Sir Harry Vane was\ndragged up the Tower-hill, sitting on a sled, to suffer death, as the\nchampion of the English laws, one of the multitude cried out to him,\n\"You never sate on so glorious a seat.\" Charles II., to intimidate the\ncitizens of London, caused the patriot Lord Russel to be drawn in an\nopen coach, through the principal streets of the city, on his way to\nthe scaffold. \"But,\" his biographer says, \"the multitude imagined\nthey saw liberty and virtue sitting by his side.\" In private places,\namong sordid objects, an act of truth or heroism seems at once to\ndraw to itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its candle. Nature\nstretcheth out her arms to embrace man, only let his thoughts be of\nequal greatness. Willingly does she follow his steps with the rose\nand the violet, and bend her lines of grandeur and grace to the\ndecoration of her darling child. Only let his thoughts be of equal\nscope, and the frame will suit the picture. A virtuous man is in\nunison with her works, and makes the central figure of the visible\nsphere. Homer, Pindar, Socrates, Phocion, associate themselves fitly\nin our memory with the geography and climate of Greece. The\nvisible heavens and earth sympathize with Jesus. And in common\nlife, whosoever has seen a person of powerful character and happy\ngenius, will have remarked how easily he took all things along with\nhim,--the persons, the opinions, and the day, and nature became\nancillary to a man.\n3. There is still another aspect under which the beauty of the world\nmay be viewed, namely, as it becomes an object of the intellect.\nBeside the relation of things to virtue, they have a relation to thought.\nThe intellect searches out the absolute order of things as they stand\nin the mind of God, and without the colors of affection. The\nintellectual and the active powers seem to succeed each other, and\nthe exclusive activity of the one, generates the exclusive activity of\nthe other. There is something unfriendly in each to the other, but\nthey are like the alternate periods of feeding and working in animals;\neach prepares and will be followed by the other. Therefore does\nbeauty, which, in relation to actions, as we have seen, comes\nunsought, and comes because it is unsought, remain for the\napprehension and pursuit of the intellect; and then again, in its turn,\nof the active power. Nothing divine dies. All good is eternally\nreproductive. The beauty of nature reforms itself in the mind, and\nnot for barren contemplation, but for new creation.\nAll men are in some degree impressed by the face of the world;\nsome men even to delight. This love of beauty is Taste. Others have\nthe same love in such excess, that, not content with admiring, they\nseek to embody it in new forms. The creation of beauty is Art.\nThe production of a work of art throws a light upon the mystery of\nhumanity. A work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world. It is\nthe result or expression of nature, in miniature. For, although the\nworks of nature are innumerable and all different, the result or the\nexpression of them all is similar and single. Nature is a sea of forms\nradically alike and even unique. A leaf, a sun-beam, a landscape, the\nocean, make an analogous impression on the mind. What is common\nto them all,--that perfectness and harmony, is beauty. The standard\nof beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms,--the totality of nature;\nwhich the Italians expressed by defining beauty \"il piu nell' uno.\"\nNothing is quite beautiful alone: nothing but is beautiful in the\nwhole. A single object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this\nuniversal grace. The poet, the painter, the sculptor, the musician, the\narchitect, seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one\npoint, and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty\nwhich stimulates him to produce. Thus is Art, a nature passed\nthrough the alembic of man. Thus in art, does nature work through\nthe will of a man filled with the beauty of her first works.\nThe world thus exists to the soul to satisfy the desire of beauty. This\nelement I call an ultimate end. No reason can be asked or given why\nthe soul seeks beauty. Beauty, in its largest and profoundest sense, is\none expression for the universe. God is the all-fair. Truth, and\ngoodness, and beauty, are but different faces of the same All. But\nbeauty in nature is not ultimate. It is the herald of inward and eternal\nbeauty, and is not alone a solid and satisfactory good. It must stand\nas a part, and not as yet the last or highest expression of the final\ncause of Nature.\nCHAPTER IV.\nLANGUAGE.\nLANGUAGE is a third use which Nature subserves to man. Nature\nis the vehicle, and threefold degree.\n1. Words are signs of natural facts.\n2. Particular natural facts are symbols of particular spiritual facts.\n3. Nature is the symbol of spirit.\n1. Words are signs of natural facts. The use of natural history is to\ngive us aid in supernatural history: the use of the outer creation, to\ngive us language for the beings and changes of the inward creation.\nEvery word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if\ntraced to its root, is found to be borrowed from some material\nappearance. _Right_ means _straight_; _wrong_ means _twisted_.\n_Spirit_ primarily means _wind_; _transgression_, the crossing of a\n_line_; _supercilious_, the _raising of the eyebrow_. We say the\n_heart_ to express emotion, the _head_ to denote thought; and\n_thought_ and _emotion_ are words borrowed from sensible things,\nand now appropriated to spiritual nature. Most of the process by\nwhich this transformation is made, is hidden from us in the remote\ntime when language was framed; but the same tendency may be\ndaily observed in children. Children and savages use only nouns or\nnames of things, which they convert into verbs, and apply to\nanalogous mental acts.\n2. But this origin of all words that convey a spiritual import,--so\nconspicuous a fact in the history of language,--is our least debt to\nnature. It is not words only that are emblematic; it is things which\nare emblematic. Every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact.\nEvery appearance in nature corresponds to some state of the mind,\nand that state of the mind can only be described by presenting that\nnatural appearance as its picture. An enraged man is a lion, a\ncunning man is a fox, a firm man is a rock, a learned man is a torch.\nA lamb is innocence; a snake is subtle spite; flowers express to us\nthe delicate affections. Light and darkness are our familiar\nexpression for knowledge and ignorance; and heat for love. Visible\ndistance behind and before us, is respectively our image of memory\nand hope.\nWho looks upon a river in a meditative hour, and is not reminded of\nthe flux of all things? Throw a stone into the stream, and the circles\nthat propagate themselves are the beautiful type of all influence.\nMan is conscious of a universal soul within or behind his individual\nlife, wherein, as in a firmament, the natures of Justice, Truth, Love,\nFreedom, arise and shine. This universal soul, he calls Reason: it is\nnot mine, or thine, or his, but we are its; we are its property and men.\nAnd the blue sky in which the private earth is buried, the sky with its\neternal calm, and full of everlasting orbs, is the type of Reason. That\nwhich, intellectually considered, we call Reason, considered in\nrelation to nature, we call Spirit. Spirit is the Creator. Spirit hath life\nin itself. And man in all ages and countries, embodies it in his\nlanguage, as the FATHER.\nIt is easily seen that there is nothing lucky or capricious in these\nanalogies, but that they are constant, and pervade nature. These are\nnot the dreams of a few poets, here and there, but man is an\nanalogist, and studies relations in all objects. He is placed in the\ncentre of beings, and a ray of relation passes from every other being\nto him. And neither can man be understood without these objects,\nnor these objects without man. All the facts in natural history taken\nby themselves, have no value, but are barren, like a single sex. But\nmarry it to human history, and it is full of life. Whole Floras, all\nLinnaeus' and Buffon's volumes, are dry catalogues of facts; but the\nmost trivial of these facts, the habit of a plant, the organs, or work,\nor noise of an insect, applied to the illustration of a fact in\nintellectual philosophy, or, in any way associated to human nature,\naffects us in the most lively and agreeable manner. The seed of a\nplant,--to what affecting analogies in the nature of man, is that little\nfruit made use of, in all discourse, up to the voice of Paul, who calls\nthe human corpse a seed,--\"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a\nspiritual body.\" The motion of the earth round its axis, and round the\nsun, makes the day, and the year. These are certain amounts of brute\nlight and heat. But is there no intent of an analogy between man's\nlife and the seasons? And do the seasons gain no grandeur or pathos\nfrom that analogy? The instincts of the ant are very unimportant,\nconsidered as the ant's; but the moment a ray of relation is seen to\nextend from it to man, and the little drudge is seen to be a monitor, a\nlittle body with a mighty heart, then all its habits, even that said to\nbe recently observed, that it never sleeps, become sublime.\nBecause of this radical correspondence between visible things and\nhuman thoughts, savages, who have only what is necessary,\nconverse in figures. As we go back in history, language becomes\nmore picturesque, until its infancy, when it is all poetry; or all\nspiritual facts are represented by natural symbols. The same symbols\nare found to make the original elements of all languages. It has\nmoreover been observed, that the idioms of all languages approach\neach other in passages of the greatest eloquence and power. And as\nthis is the first language, so is it the last. This immediate dependence\nof language upon nature, this conversion of an outward phenomenon\ninto a type of somewhat in human life, never loses its power to\naffect us. It is this which gives that piquancy to the conversation of a\nstrong-natured farmer or back-woodsman, which all men relish.\nA man's power to connect his thought with its proper symbol, and so\nto utter it, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon\nhis love of truth, and his desire to communicate it without loss. The\ncorruption of man is followed by the corruption of language. When\nsimplicity of character and the sovereignty of ideas is broken up by\nthe prevalence of secondary desires, the desire of riches, of pleasure,\nof power, and of praise,--and duplicity and falsehood take place of\nsimplicity and truth, the power over nature as an interpreter of the\nwill, is in a degree lost; new imagery ceases to be created, and old\nwords are perverted to stand for things which are not; a paper\ncurrency is employed, when there is no bullion in the vaults. In due\ntime, the fraud is manifest, and words lose all power to stimulate the\nunderstanding or the affections. Hundreds of writers may be found\nin every long-civilized nation, who for a short time believe, and\nmake others believe, that they see and utter truths, who do not of\nthemselves clothe one thought in its natural garment, but who feed\nunconsciously on the language created by the primary writers of the\ncountry, those, namely, who hold primarily on nature.\nBut wise men pierce this rotten diction and fasten words again to\nvisible things; so that picturesque language is at once a commanding\ncertificate that he who employs it, is a man in alliance with truth and\nGod. The moment our discourse rises above the ground line of\nfamiliar facts, and is inflamed with passion or exalted by thought, it\nclothes itself in images. A man conversing in earnest, if he watch his\nintellectual processes, will find that a material image, more or less\nluminous, arises in his mind, cotemporaneous with every thought,\nwhich furnishes the vestment of the thought. Hence, good writing\nand brilliant discourse are perpetual allegories. This imagery is\nspontaneous. It is the blending of experience with the present action\nof the mind. It is proper creation. It is the working of the Original\nCause through the instruments he has already made.\nThese facts may suggest the advantage which the country-life\npossesses for a powerful mind, over the artificial and curtailed life\nof cities. We know more from nature than we can at will\ncommunicate. Its light flows into the mind evermore, and we forget\nits presence. The poet, the orator, bred in the woods, whose senses\nhave been nourished by their fair and appeasing changes, year after\nyear, without design and without heed,--shall not lose their lesson\naltogether, in the roar of cities or the broil of politics. Long hereafter,\namidst agitation and terror in national councils,--in the hour of\nrevolution,--these solemn images shall reappear in their morning\nlustre, as fit symbols and words of the thoughts which the passing\nevents shall awaken. At the call of a noble sentiment, again the\nwoods wave, the pines murmur, the river rolls and shines, and the\ncattle low upon the mountains, as he saw and heard them in his\ninfancy. And with these forms, the spells of persuasion, the keys of\npower are put into his hands.\n3. We are thus assisted by natural objects in the expression of\nparticular meanings. But how great a language to convey such\npepper-corn informations! Did it need such noble races of creatures,\nthis profusion of forms, this host of orbs in heaven, to furnish man\nwith the dictionary and grammar of his municipal speech? Whilst\nwe use this grand cipher to expedite the affairs of our pot and kettle,\nwe feel that we have not yet put it to its use, neither are able. We are\nlike travellers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs.\nWhilst we see that it always stands ready to clothe what we would\nsay, we cannot avoid the question, whether the characters are not\nsignificant of themselves. Have mountains, and waves, and skies, no\nsignificance but what we consciously give them, when we employ\nthem as emblems of our thoughts? The world is emblematic. Parts of\nspeech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of\nthe human mind. The laws of moral nature answer to those of matter\nas face to face in a glass. \"The visible world and the relation of its\nparts, is the dial plate of the invisible.\" The axioms of physics\ntranslate the laws of ethics. Thus, \"the whole is greater than its part;\"\n\"reaction is equal to action;\" \"the smallest weight may be made to\nlift the greatest, the difference of weight being compensated by\ntime;\" and many the like propositions, which have an ethical as well\nas physical sense. These propositions have a much more extensive\nand universal sense when applied to human life, than when confined\nto technical use.\nIn like manner, the memorable words of history, and the proverbs of\nnations, consist usually of a natural fact, selected as a picture or\nparable of a moral truth. Thus; A rolling stone gathers no moss; A\nbird in the hand is worth two in the bush; A cripple in the right way,\nwill beat a racer in the wrong; Make hay while the sun shines; 'T is\nhard to carry a full cup even; Vinegar is the son of wine; The last\nounce broke the camel's back; Long-lived trees make roots first;\n--and the like. In their primary sense these are trivial facts, but we\nrepeat them for the value of their analogical import. What is true of\nproverbs, is true of all fables, parables, and allegories.\nThis relation between the mind and matter is not fancied by some\npoet, but stands in the will of God, and so is free to be known by all\nmen. It appears to men, or it does not appear. When in fortunate\nhours we ponder this miracle, the wise man doubts, if, at all other\ntimes, he is not blind and deaf;\n--\"Can these things be,\nAnd overcome us like a summer's cloud,\nWithout our special wonder?\"\nfor the universe becomes transparent, and the light of higher laws\nthan its own, shines through it. It is the standing problem which has\nexercised the wonder and the study of every fine genius since the\nworld began; from the era of the Egyptians and the Brahmins, to that\nof Pythagoras, of Plato, of Bacon, of Leibnitz, of Swedenborg.\nThere sits the Sphinx at the road-side, and from age to age, as each\nprophet comes by, he tries his fortune at reading her riddle. There\nseems to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms;\nand day and night, river and storm, beast and bird, acid and alkali,\npreexist in necessary Ideas in the mind of God, and are what they\nare by virtue of preceding affections, in the world of spirit. A Fact is\nthe end or last issue of spirit. The visible creation is the terminus or\nthe circumference of the invisible world. \"Material objects,\" said a\nFrench philosopher, \"are necessarily kinds of _scoriae_ of the\nsubstantial thoughts of the Creator, which must always preserve an\nexact relation to their first origin; in other words, visible nature must\nhave a spiritual and moral side.\"\nThis doctrine is abstruse, and though the images of \"garment,\"\n\"scoriae,\" \"mirror,\" &c., may stimulate the fancy, we must summon\nthe aid of subtler and more vital expositors to make it plain. \"Every\nscripture is to be interpreted by the same spirit which gave it forth,\"\n--is the fundamental law of criticism. A life in harmony with nature,\nthe love of truth and of virtue, will purge the eyes to understand her\ntext. By degrees we may come to know the primitive sense of the\npermanent objects of nature, so that the world shall be to us an open\nbook, and every form significant of its hidden life and final cause.\nA new interest surprises us, whilst, under the view now suggested,\nwe contemplate the fearful extent and multitude of objects; since\n\"every object rightly seen, unlocks a new faculty of the soul.\" That\nwhich was unconscious truth, becomes, when interpreted and\ndefined in an object, a part of the domain of knowledge,--a new\nweapon in the magazine of power.\nCHAPTER V.\nDISCIPLINE.\nIN view of the significance of nature, we arrive at once at a new fact,\nthat nature is a discipline. This use of the world includes the\npreceding uses, as parts of itself.\nSpace, time, society, labor, climate, food, locomotion, the animals,\nthe mechanical forces, give us sincerest lessons, day by day, whose\nmeaning is unlimited. They educate both the Understanding and the\nReason. Every property of matter is a school for the understanding,\n--its solidity or resistance, its inertia, its extension, its figure, its\ndivisibility. The understanding adds, divides, combines, measures,\nand finds nutriment and room for its activity in this worthy scene.\nMeantime, Reason transfers all these lessons into its own world of\nthought, by perceiving the analogy that marries Matter and Mind.\n1. Nature is a discipline of the understanding in intellectual truths.\nOur dealing with sensible objects is a constant exercise in the\nnecessary lessons of difference, of likeness, of order, of being and\nseeming, of progressive arrangement; of ascent from particular to\ngeneral; of combination to one end of manifold forces. Proportioned\nto the importance of the organ to be formed, is the extreme care with\nwhich its tuition is provided,--a care pretermitted in no single case.\nWhat tedious training, day after day, year after year, never ending,\nto form the common sense; what continual reproduction of\nannoyances, inconveniences, dilemmas; what rejoicing over us of\nlittle men; what disputing of prices, what reckonings of interest,\n--and all to form the Hand of the mind;--to instruct us that \"good\nthoughts are no better than good dreams, unless they be executed!\"\nThe same good office is performed by Property and its filial systems\nof debt and credit. Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow,\nthe orphan, and the sons of genius fear and hate;--debt, which\nconsumes so much time, which so cripples and disheartens a great\nspirit with cares that seem so base, is a preceptor whose lessons\ncannot be forgone, and is needed most by those who suffer from it\nmost. Moreover, property, which has been well compared to snow,\n--\"if it fall level to-day, it will be blown into drifts to-morrow,\"--is\nthe surface action of internal machinery, like the index on the face of a\nclock. Whilst now it is the gymnastics of the understanding, it is\nhiving in the foresight of the spirit, experience in profounder laws.\nThe whole character and fortune of the individual are affected by the\nleast inequalities in the culture of the understanding; for example, in\nthe perception of differences. Therefore is Space, and therefore\nTime, that man may know that things are not huddled and lumped,\nbut sundered and individual. A bell and a plough have each their use,\nand neither can do the office of the other. Water is good to drink,\ncoal to burn, wool to wear; but wool cannot be drunk, nor water\nspun, nor coal eaten. The wise man shows his wisdom in separation,\nin gradation, and his scale of creatures and of merits is as wide as\nnature. The foolish have no range in their scale, but suppose every\nman is as every other man. What is not good they call the worst, and\nwhat is not hateful, they call the best.\nIn like manner, what good heed, nature forms in us! She pardons no\nmistakes. Her yea is yea, and her nay, nay.\nThe first steps in Agriculture, Astronomy, Zooelogy, (those first steps\nwhich the farmer, the hunter, and the sailor take,) teach that nature's\ndice are always loaded; that in her heaps and rubbish are concealed\nsure and useful results.\nHow calmly and genially the mind apprehends one after another the\nlaws of physics! What noble emotions dilate the mortal as he enters\ninto the counsels of the creation, and feels by knowledge the\nprivilege to BE! His insight refines him. The beauty of nature shines\nin his own breast. Man is greater that he can see this, and the\nuniverse less, because Time and Space relations vanish as laws are\nknown.\nHere again we are impressed and even daunted by the immense\nUniverse to be explored. \"What we know, is a point to what we do\nnot know.\" Open any recent journal of science, and weigh the\nproblems suggested concerning Light, Heat, Electricity, Magnetism,\nPhysiology, Geology, and judge whether the interest of natural\nscience is likely to be soon exhausted.\nPassing by many particulars of the discipline of nature, we must not\nomit to specify two.\nThe exercise of the Will or the lesson of power is taught in every\nevent. From the child's successive possession of his several senses\nup to the hour when he saith, \"Thy will be done!\" he is learning the\nsecret, that he can reduce under his will, not only particular events,\nbut great classes, nay the whole series of events, and so conform all\nfacts to his character. Nature is thoroughly mediate. It is made to\nserve. It receives the dominion of man as meekly as the ass on\nwhich the Saviour rode. It offers all its kingdoms to man as the raw\nmaterial which he may mould into what is useful. Man is never\nweary of working it up. He forges the subtile and delicate air into\nwise and melodious words, and gives them wing as angels of\npersuasion and command. One after another, his victorious thought\ncomes up with and reduces all things, until the world becomes, at\nlast, only a realized will,--the double of the man.\n2. Sensible objects conform to the premonitions of Reason and\nreflect the conscience. All things are moral; and in their boundless\nchanges have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature. Therefore is\nnature glorious with form, color, and motion, that every globe in the\nremotest heaven; every chemical change from the rudest crystal up\nto the laws of life; every change of vegetation from the first\nprinciple of growth in the eye of a leaf, to the tropical forest and\nantediluvian coal-mine; every animal function from the sponge up to\nHercules, shall hint or thunder to man the laws of right and wrong,\nand echo the Ten Commandments. Therefore is nature ever the ally\nof Religion: lends all her pomp and riches to the religious sentiment.\nProphet and priest, David, Isaiah, Jesus, have drawn deeply from\nthis source. This ethical character so penetrates the bone and marrow\nof nature, as to seem the end for which it was made. Whatever\nprivate purpose is answered by any member or part, this is its public\nand universal function, and is never omitted. Nothing in nature is\nexhausted in its first use. When a thing has served an end to the\nuttermost, it is wholly new for an ulterior service. In God, every end\nis converted into a new means. Thus the use of commodity, regarded\nby itself, is mean and squalid. But it is to the mind an education in\nthe doctrine of Use, namely, that a thing is good only so far as it\nserves; that a conspiring of parts and efforts to the production of an\nend, is essential to any being. The first and gross manifestation of\nthis truth, is our inevitable and hated training in values and wants, in\ncorn and meat.\nIt has already been illustrated, that every natural process is a version\nof a moral sentence. The moral law lies at the centre of nature and\nradiates to the circumference. It is the pith and marrow of every\nsubstance, every relation, and every process. All things with which\nwe deal, preach to us. What is a farm but a mute gospel? The chaff\nand the wheat, weeds and plants, blight, rain, insects, sun,--it is a\nsacred emblem from the first furrow of spring to the last stack which\nthe snow of winter overtakes in the fields. But the sailor, the\nshepherd, the miner, the merchant, in their several resorts, have each\nan experience precisely parallel, and leading to the same conclusion:\nbecause all organizations are radically alike. Nor can it be doubted\nthat this moral sentiment which thus scents the air, grows in the\ngrain, and impregnates the waters of the world, is caught by man\nand sinks into his soul. The moral influence of nature upon every\nindividual is that amount of truth which it illustrates to him. Who\ncan estimate this? Who can guess how much firmness the sea-beaten\nrock has taught the fisherman? how much tranquillity has been\nreflected to man from the azure sky, over whose unspotted deeps the\nwinds forevermore drive flocks of stormy clouds, and leave no\nwrinkle or stain? how much industry and providence and affection\nwe have caught from the pantomime of brutes? What a searching\npreacher of self-command is the varying phenomenon of Health!\nHerein is especially apprehended the unity of Nature,--the unity in\nvariety,--which meets us everywhere. All the endless variety of\nthings make an identical impression. Xenophanes complained in his\nold age, that, look where he would, all things hastened back to Unity.\nHe was weary of seeing the same entity in the tedious variety of\nforms. The fable of Proteus has a cordial truth. A leaf, a drop, a\ncrystal, a moment of time is related to the whole, and partakes of the\nperfection of the whole. Each particle is a microcosm, and faithfully\nrenders the likeness of the world.\nNot only resemblances exist in things whose analogy is obvious, as\nwhen we detect the type of the human hand in the flipper of the\nfossil saurus, but also in objects wherein there is great superficial\nunlikeness. Thus architecture is called \"frozen music,\" by De Stael\nand Goethe. Vitruvius thought an architect should be a musician. \"A\nGothic church,\" said Coleridge, \"is a petrified religion.\" Michael\nAngelo maintained, that, to an architect, a knowledge of anatomy is\nessential. In Haydn's oratorios, the notes present to the imagination\nnot only motions, as, of the snake, the stag, and the elephant, but\ncolors also; as the green grass. The law of harmonic sounds\nreappears in the harmonic colors. The granite is differenced in its\nlaws only by the more or less of heat, from the river that wears it\naway. The river, as it flows, resembles the air that flows over it; the\nair resembles the light which traverses it with more subtile currents;\nthe light resembles the heat which rides with it through Space. Each\ncreature is only a modification of the other; the likeness in them is\nmore than the difference, and their radical law is one and the same.\nA rule of one art, or a law of one organization, holds true throughout\nnature. So intimate is this Unity, that, it is easily seen, it lies under\nthe undermost garment of nature, and betrays its source in Universal\nSpirit. For, it pervades Thought also. Every universal truth which we\nexpress in words, implies or supposes every other truth. _Omne\nverum vero consonat_. It is like a great circle on a sphere,\ncomprising all possible circles; which, however, may be drawn, and\ncomprise it, in like manner. Every such truth is the absolute Ens\nseen from one side. But it has innumerable sides.\nThe central Unity is still more conspicuous in actions. Words are\nfinite organs of the infinite mind. They cannot cover the dimensions\nof what is in truth. They break, chop, and impoverish it. An action is\nthe perfection and publication of thought. A right action seems to fill\nthe eye, and to be related to all nature. \"The wise man, in doing one\nthing, does all; or, in the one thing he does rightly, he sees the\nlikeness of all which is done rightly.\"\nWords and actions are not the attributes of brute nature. They\nintroduce us to the human form, of which all other organizations\nappear to be degradations. When this appears among so many that\nsurround it, the spirit prefers it to all others. It says, 'From such as\nthis, have I drawn joy and knowledge; in such as this, have I found\nand beheld myself; I will speak to it; it can speak again; it can yield\nme thought already formed and alive.' In fact, the eye,--the mind,--is\nalways accompanied by these forms, male and female; and these are\nincomparably the richest informations of the power and order that\nlie at the heart of things. Unfortunately, every one of them bears the\nmarks as of some injury; is marred and superficially defective.\nNevertheless, far different from the deaf and dumb nature around\nthem, these all rest like fountain-pipes on the unfathomed sea of\nthought and virtue whereto they alone, of all organizations, are the\nentrances.\nIt were a pleasant inquiry to follow into detail their ministry to our\neducation, but where would it stop? We are associated in adolescent\nand adult life with some friends, who, like skies and waters, are\ncoextensive with our idea; who, answering each to a certain\naffection of the soul, satisfy our desire on that side; whom we lack\npower to put at such focal distance from us, that we can mend or\neven analyze them. We cannot choose but love them. When much\nintercourse with a friend has supplied us with a standard of\nexcellence, and has increased our respect for the resources of God\nwho thus sends a real person to outgo our ideal; when he has,\nmoreover, become an object of thought, and, whilst his character\nretains all its unconscious effect, is converted in the mind into solid\nand sweet wisdom,--it is a sign to us that his office is closing, and he\nis commonly withdrawn from our sight in a short time.\nCHAPTER VI.\nIDEALISM.\nTHUS is the unspeakable but intelligible and practicable meaning of\nthe world conveyed to man, the immortal pupil, in every object of\nsense. To this one end of Discipline, all parts of nature conspire.\nA noble doubt perpetually suggests itself, whether this end be not\nthe Final Cause of the Universe; and whether nature outwardly\nexists. It is a sufficient account of that Appearance we call the\nWorld, that God will teach a human mind, and so makes it the\nreceiver of a certain number of congruent sensations, which we call\nsun and moon, man and woman, house and trade. In my utter\nimpotence to test the authenticity of the report of my senses, to\nknow whether the impressions they make on me correspond with\noutlying objects, what difference does it make, whether Orion is up\nthere in heaven, or some god paints the image in the firmament of\nthe soul? The relations of parts and the end of the whole remaining\nthe same, what is the difference, whether land and sea interact, and\nworlds revolve and intermingle without number or end,--deep\nyawning under deep, and galaxy balancing galaxy, throughout\nabsolute space,--or, whether, without relations of time and space, the\nsame appearances are inscribed in the constant faith of man?\nWhether nature enjoy a substantial existence without, or is only in\nthe apocalypse of the mind, it is alike useful and alike venerable to\nme. Be it what it may, it is ideal to me, so long as I cannot try the\naccuracy of my senses.\nThe frivolous make themselves merry with the Ideal theory, if its\nconsequences were burlesque; as if it affected the stability of nature.\nIt surely does not. God never jests with us, and will not compromise\nthe end of nature, by permitting any inconsequence in its procession.\nAny distrust of the permanence of laws, would paralyze the faculties\nof man. Their permanence is sacredly respected, and his faith therein\nis perfect. The wheels and springs of man are all set to the\nhypothesis of the permanence of nature. We are not built like a ship\nto be tossed, but like a house to stand. It is a natural consequence of\nthis structure, that, so long as the active powers predominate over\nthe reflective, we resist with indignation any hint that nature is more\nshort-lived or mutable than spirit. The broker, the wheelwright, the\ncarpenter, the toll-man, are much displeased at the intimation.\nBut whilst we acquiesce entirely in the permanence of natural laws,\nthe question of the absolute existence of nature still remains open. It\nis the uniform effect of culture on the human mind, not to shake our\nfaith in the stability of particular phenomena, as of heat, water, azote;\nbut to lead us to regard nature as a phenomenon, not a substance; to\nattribute necessary existence to spirit; to esteem nature as an\naccident and an effect.\nTo the senses and the unrenewed understanding, belongs a sort of\ninstinctive belief in the absolute existence of nature. In their view,\nman and nature are indissolubly joined. Things are ultimates, and\nthey never look beyond their sphere. The presence of Reason mars\nthis faith. The first effort of thought tends to relax this despotism of\nthe senses, which binds us to nature as if we were a part of it, and\nshows us nature aloof, and, as it were, afloat. Until this higher\nagency intervened, the animal eye sees, with wonderful accuracy,\nsharp outlines and colored surfaces. When the eye of Reason opens,\nto outline and surface are at once added, grace and expression.\nThese proceed from imagination and affection, and abate somewhat\nof the angular distinctness of objects. If the Reason be stimulated to\nmore earnest vision, outlines and surfaces become transparent, and\nare no longer seen; causes and spirits are seen through them. The\nbest moments of life are these delicious awakenings of the higher\npowers, and the reverential withdrawing of nature before its God.\nLet us proceed to indicate the effects of culture. 1. Our first\ninstitution in the Ideal philosophy is a hint from nature herself.\nNature is made to conspire with spirit to emancipate us. Certain\nmechanical changes, a small alteration in our local position apprizes\nus of a dualism. We are strangely affected by seeing the shore from\na moving ship, from a balloon, or through the tints of an unusual sky.\nThe least change in our point of view, gives the whole world a\npictorial air. A man who seldom rides, needs only to get into a coach\nand traverse his own town, to turn the street into a puppet-show. The\nmen, the women,--talking, running, bartering, fighting,--the earnest\nmechanic, the lounger, the beggar, the boys, the dogs, are unrealized\nat once, or, at least, wholly detached from all relation to the observer,\nand seen as apparent, not substantial beings. What new thoughts are\nsuggested by seeing a face of country quite familiar, in the rapid\nmovement of the rail-road car! Nay, the most wonted objects, (make\na very slight change in the point of vision,) please us most. In a\ncamera obscura, the butcher's cart, and the figure of one of our own\nfamily amuse us. So a portrait of a well-known face gratifies us.\nTurn the eyes upside down, by looking at the landscape through\nyour legs, and how agreeable is the picture, though you have seen it\nany time these twenty years!\nIn these cases, by mechanical means, is suggested the difference\nbetween the observer and the spectacle,--between man and nature.\nHence arises a pleasure mixed with awe; I may say, a low degree of\nthe sublime is felt from the fact, probably, that man is hereby\napprized, that, whilst the world is a spectacle, something in himself\nis stable.\n2. In a higher manner, the poet communicates the same pleasure. By\na few strokes he delineates, as on air, the sun, the mountain, the\ncamp, the city, the hero, the maiden, not different from what we\nknow them, but only lifted from the ground and afloat before the eye.\nHe unfixes the land and the sea, makes them revolve around the axis\nof his primary thought, and disposes them anew. Possessed himself\nby a heroic passion, he uses matter as symbols of it. The sensual\nman conforms thoughts to things; the poet conforms things to his\nthoughts. The one esteems nature as rooted and fast; the other, as\nfluid, and impresses his being thereon. To him, the refractory world\nis ductile and flexible; he invests dust and stones with humanity, and\nmakes them the words of the Reason. The Imagination may be\ndefined to be, the use which the Reason makes of the material world.\nShakspeare possesses the power of subordinating nature for the\npurposes of expression, beyond all poets. His imperial muse tosses\nthe creation like a bauble from hand to hand, and uses it to embody\nany caprice of thought that is upper-most in his mind. The remotest\nspaces of nature are visited, and the farthest sundered things are\nbrought together, by a subtle spiritual connection. We are made\naware that magnitude of material things is relative, and all objects\nshrink and expand to serve the passion of the poet. Thus, in his\nsonnets, the lays of birds, the scents and dyes of flowers, he finds to\nbe the _shadow_ of his beloved; time, which keeps her from him, is\nhis _chest_; the suspicion she has awakened, is her _ornament_;\nThe ornament of beauty is Suspect,\nA crow which flies in heaven's sweetest air.\nHis passion is not the fruit of chance; it swells, as he speaks, to a\ncity, or a state.\nNo, it was builded far from accident;\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the brow of thralling discontent;\nIt fears not policy, that heretic,\nThat works on leases of short numbered hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic.\nIn the strength of his constancy, the Pyramids seem to him recent\nand transitory. The freshness of youth and love dazzles him with its\nresemblance to morning.\nTake those lips away\nWhich so sweetly were forsworn;\nAnd those eyes,--the break of day,\nLights that do mislead the morn.\nThe wild beauty of this hyperbole, I may say, in passing, it would\nnot be easy to match in literature.\nThis transfiguration which all material objects undergo through the\npassion of the poet,--this power which he exerts to dwarf the great,\nto magnify the small,--might be illustrated by a thousand examples\nfrom his Plays. I have before me the Tempest, and will cite only\nthese few lines.\nARIEL. The strong based promontory\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up\nThe pine and cedar.\nProspero calls for music to soothe the frantic Alonzo, and his\ncompanions;\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains\nNow useless, boiled within thy skull.\nAgain;\nThe charm dissolves apace,\nAnd, as the morning steals upon the night,\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\nTheir clearer reason.\nTheir understanding\nBegins to swell: and the approaching tide\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shores\nThat now lie foul and muddy.\nThe perception of real affinities between events, (that is to say, of\n_ideal_ affinities, for those only are real,) enables the poet thus to\nmake free with the most imposing forms and phenomena of the\nworld, and to assert the predominance of the soul.\n3. Whilst thus the poet animates nature with his own thoughts, he\ndiffers from the philosopher only herein, that the one proposes\nBeauty as his main end; the other Truth. But the philosopher, not\nless than the poet, postpones the apparent order and relations of\nthings to the empire of thought. \"The problem of philosophy,\"\naccording to Plato, \"is, for all that exists conditionally, to find a\nground unconditioned and absolute.\" It proceeds on the faith that a\nlaw determines all phenomena, which being known, the phenomena\ncan be predicted. That law, when in the mind, is an idea. Its beauty\nis infinite. The true philosopher and the true poet are one, and a\nbeauty, which is truth, and a truth, which is beauty, is the aim of\nboth. Is not the charm of one of Plato's or Aristotle's definitions,\nstrictly like that of the Antigone of Sophocles? It is, in both cases,\nthat a spiritual life has been imparted to nature; that the solid\nseeming block of matter has been pervaded and dissolved by a\nthought; that this feeble human being has penetrated the vast masses\nof nature with an informing soul, and recognised itself in their\nharmony, that is, seized their law. In physics, when this is attained,\nthe memory disburthens itself of its cumbrous catalogues of\nparticulars, and carries centuries of observation in a single formula.\nThus even in physics, the material is degraded before the spiritual.\nThe astronomer, the geometer, rely on their irrefragable analysis,\nand disdain the results of observation. The sublime remark of Euler\non his law of arches, \"This will be found contrary to all experience,\nyet is true;\" had already transferred nature into the mind, and left\nmatter like an outcast corpse.\n4. Intellectual science has been observed to beget invariably a doubt\nof the existence of matter. Turgot said, \"He that has never doubted\nthe existence of matter, may be assured he has no aptitude for\nmetaphysical inquiries.\" It fastens the attention upon immortal\nnecessary uncreated natures, that is, upon Ideas; and in their\npresence, we feel that the outward circumstance is a dream and a\nshade. Whilst we wait in this Olympus of gods, we think of nature as\nan appendix to the soul. We ascend into their region, and know that\nthese are the thoughts of the Supreme Being. \"These are they who\nwere set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth\nwas. When he prepared the heavens, they were there; when he\nestablished the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of\nthe deep. Then they were by him, as one brought up with him. Of\nthem took he counsel.\"\nTheir influence is proportionate. As objects of science, they are\naccessible to few men. Yet all men are capable of being raised by\npiety or by passion, into their region. And no man touches these\ndivine natures, without becoming, in some degree, himself divine.\nLike a new soul, they renew the body. We become physically\nnimble and lightsome; we tread on air; life is no longer irksome, and\nwe think it will never be so. No man fears age or misfortune or death,\nin their serene company, for he is transported out of the district of\nchange. Whilst we behold unveiled the nature of Justice and Truth,\nwe learn the difference between the absolute and the conditional or\nrelative. We apprehend the absolute. As it were, for the first time,\n_we exist_. We become immortal, for we learn that time and space\nare relations of matter; that, with a perception of truth, or a virtuous\nwill, they have no affinity.\n5. Finally, religion and ethics, which may be fitly called,--the\npractice of ideas, or the introduction of ideas into life,--have an\nanalogous effect with all lower culture, in degrading nature and\nsuggesting its dependence on spirit. Ethics and religion differ herein;\nthat the one is the system of human duties commencing from man;\nthe other, from God. Religion includes the personality of God;\nEthics does not. They are one to our present design. They both put\nnature under foot. The first and last lesson of religion is, \"The things\nthat are seen, are temporal; the things that are unseen, are eternal.\" It\nputs an affront upon nature. It does that for the unschooled, which\nphilosophy does for Berkeley and Viasa. The uniform language that\nmay be heard in the churches of the most ignorant sects, is,\n--\"Contemn the unsubstantial shows of the world; they are vanities,\ndreams, shadows, unrealities; seek the realities of religion.\" The\ndevotee flouts nature. Some theosophists have arrived at a certain\nhostility and indignation towards matter, as the Manichean and\nPlotinus. They distrusted in themselves any looking back to these\nflesh-pots of Egypt. Plotinus was ashamed of his body. In short, they\nmight all say of matter, what Michael Angelo said of external beauty,\n\"it is the frail and weary weed, in which God dresses the soul, which\nhe has called into time.\"\nIt appears that motion, poetry, physical and intellectual science, and\nreligion, all tend to affect our convictions of the reality of the\nexternal world. But I own there is something ungrateful in\nexpanding too curiously the particulars of the general proposition,\nthat all culture tends to imbue us with idealism. I have no hostility to\nnature, but a child's love to it. I expand and live in the warm day like\ncorn and melons. Let us speak her fair. I do not wish to fling stones\nat my beautiful mother, nor soil my gentle nest. I only wish to\nindicate the true position of nature in regard to man, wherein to\nestablish man, all right education tends; as the ground which to\nattain is the object of human life, that is, of man's connection with\nnature. Culture inverts the vulgar views of nature, and brings the\nmind to call that apparent, which it uses to call real, and that real,\nwhich it uses to call visionary. Children, it is true, believe in the\nexternal world. The belief that it appears only, is an afterthought, but\nwith culture, this faith will as surely arise on the mind as did the first.\nThe advantage of the ideal theory over the popular faith, is this, that\nit presents the world in precisely that view which is most desirable\nto the mind. It is, in fact, the view which Reason, both speculative\nand practical, that is, philosophy and virtue, take. For, seen in the\nlight of thought, the world always is phenomenal; and virtue\nsubordinates it to the mind. Idealism sees the world in God. It\nbeholds the whole circle of persons and things, of actions and events,\nof country and religion, not as painfully accumulated, atom after\natom, act after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one vast picture,\nwhich God paints on the instant eternity, for the contemplation of\nthe soul. Therefore the soul holds itself off from a too trivial and\nmicroscopic study of the universal tablet. It respects the end too\nmuch, to immerse itself in the means. It sees something more\nimportant in Christianity, than the scandals of ecclesiastical history,\nor the niceties of criticism; and, very incurious concerning persons\nor miracles, and not at all disturbed by chasms of historical evidence,\nit accepts from God the phenomenon, as it finds it, as the pure and\nawful form of religion in the world. It is not hot and passionate at\nthe appearance of what it calls its own good or bad fortune, at the\nunion or opposition of other persons. No man is its enemy. It accepts\nwhatsoever befalls, as part of its lesson. It is a watcher more than a\ndoer, and it is a doer, only that it may the better watch.\nCHAPTER VII.\nSPIRIT.\nIT is essential to a true theory of nature and of man, that it should\ncontain somewhat progressive. Uses that are exhausted or that may\nbe, and facts that end in the statement, cannot be all that is true of\nthis brave lodging wherein man is harbored, and wherein all his\nfaculties find appropriate and endless exercise. And all the uses of\nnature admit of being summed in one, which yields the activity of\nman an infinite scope. Through all its kingdoms, to the suburbs and\noutskirts of things, it is faithful to the cause whence it had its origin.\nIt always speaks of Spirit. It suggests the absolute. It is a perpetual\neffect. It is a great shadow pointing always to the sun behind us.\nThe aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands\nwith bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest\nman is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship.\nOf that ineffable essence which we call Spirit, he that thinks most,\nwill say least. We can foresee God in the coarse, and, as it were,\ndistant phenomena of matter; but when we try to define and describe\nhimself, both language and thought desert us, and we are as helpless\nas fools and savages. That essence refuses to be recorded in\npropositions, but when man has worshipped him intellectually, the\nnoblest ministry of nature is to stand as the apparition of God. It is\nthe organ through which the universal spirit speaks to the individual,\nand strives to lead back the individual to it.\nWhen we consider Spirit, we see that the views already presented do\nnot include the whole circumference of man. We must add some\nrelated thoughts.\nThree problems are put by nature to the mind; What is matter?\nWhence is it? and Whereto? The first of these questions only, the\nideal theory answers. Idealism saith: matter is a phenomenon, not a\nsubstance. Idealism acquaints us with the total disparity between the\nevidence of our own being, and the evidence of the world's being.\nThe one is perfect; the other, incapable of any assurance; the mind is\na part of the nature of things; the world is a divine dream, from\nwhich we may presently awake to the glories and certainties of day.\nIdealism is a hypothesis to account for nature by other principles\nthan those of carpentry and chemistry. Yet, if it only deny the\nexistence of matter, it does not satisfy the demands of the spirit. It\nleaves God out of me. It leaves me in the splendid labyrinth of my\nperceptions, to wander without end. Then the heart resists it, because\nit balks the affections in denying substantive being to men and\nwomen. Nature is so pervaded with human life, that there is\nsomething of humanity in all, and in every particular. But this theory\nmakes nature foreign to me, and does not account for that\nconsanguinity which we acknowledge to it.\nLet it stand, then, in the present state of our knowledge, merely as a\nuseful introductory hypothesis, serving to apprize us of the eternal\ndistinction between the soul and the world.\nBut when, following the invisible steps of thought, we come to\ninquire, Whence is matter? and Whereto? many truths arise to us out\nof the recesses of consciousness. We learn that the highest is present\nto the soul of man, that the dread universal essence, which is not\nwisdom, or love, or beauty, or power, but all in one, and each\nentirely, is that for which all things exist, and that by which they are;\nthat spirit creates; that behind nature, throughout nature, spirit is\npresent; one and not compound, it does not act upon us from without,\nthat is, in space and time, but spiritually, or through ourselves:\ntherefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up\nnature around us, but puts it forth through us, as the life of the tree\nputs forth new branches and leaves through the pores of the old. As\na plant upon the earth, so a man rests upon the bosom of God; he is\nnourished by unfailing fountains, and draws, at his need,\ninexhaustible power. Who can set bounds to the possibilities of man?\nOnce inhale the upper air, being admitted to behold the absolute\nnatures of justice and truth, and we learn that man has access to the\nentire mind of the Creator, is himself the creator in the finite. This\nview, which admonishes me where the sources of wisdom and\npower lie, and points to virtue as to\n\"The golden key\nWhich opes the palace of eternity,\"\ncarries upon its face the highest certificate of truth, because it\nanimates me to create my own world through the purification of my\nsoul.\nThe world proceeds from the same spirit as the body of man. It is a\nremoter and inferior incarnation of God, a projection of God in the\nunconscious. But it differs from the body in one important respect. It\nis not, like that, now subjected to the human will. Its serene order is\ninviolable by us. It is, therefore, to us, the present expositor of the\ndivine mind. It is a fixed point whereby we may measure our\ndeparture. As we degenerate, the contrast between us and our house\nis more evident. We are as much strangers in nature, as we are aliens\nfrom God. We do not understand the notes of birds. The fox and the\ndeer run away from us; the bear and tiger rend us. We do not know\nthe uses of more than a few plants, as corn and the apple, the potato\nand the vine. Is not the landscape, every glimpse of which hath a\ngrandeur, a face of him? Yet this may show us what discord is\nbetween man and nature, for you cannot freely admire a noble\nlandscape, if laborers are digging in the field hard by. The poet finds\nsomething ridiculous in his delight, until he is out of the sight of\nmen.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nPROSPECTS.\nIN inquiries respecting the laws of the world and the frame of things,\nthe highest reason is always the truest. That which seems faintly\npossible--it is so refined, is often faint and dim because it is deepest\nseated in the mind among the eternal verities. Empirical science is\napt to cloud the sight, and, by the very knowledge of functions and\nprocesses, to bereave the student of the manly contemplation of the\nwhole. The savant becomes unpoetic. But the best read naturalist\nwho lends an entire and devout attention to truth, will see that there\nremains much to learn of his relation to the world, and that it is not\nto be learned by any addition or subtraction or other comparison of\nknown quantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit,\nby a continual self-recovery, and by entire humility. He will\nperceive that there are far more excellent qualities in the student\nthan preciseness and infallibility; that a guess is often more fruitful\nthan an indisputable affirmation, and that a dream may let us deeper\ninto the secret of nature than a hundred concerted experiments.\nFor, the problems to be solved are precisely those which the\nphysiologist and the naturalist omit to state. It is not so pertinent to\nman to know all the individuals of the animal kingdom, as it is to\nknow whence and whereto is this tyrannizing unity in his\nconstitution, which evermore separates and classifies things,\nendeavoring to reduce the most diverse to one form. When I behold\na rich landscape, it is less to my purpose to recite correctly the order\nand superposition of the strata, than to know why all thought of\nmultitude is lost in a tranquil sense of unity. I cannot greatly honor\nminuteness in details, so long as there is no hint to explain\nthe relation between things and thoughts; no ray upon the\n_metaphysics_ of conchology, of botany, of the arts, to show the\nrelation of the forms of flowers, shells, animals, architecture, to the\nmind, and build science upon ideas. In a cabinet of natural history,\nwe become sensible of a certain occult recognition and sympathy in\nregard to the most unwieldly and eccentric forms of beast, fish, and\ninsect. The American who has been confined, in his own country, to\nthe sight of buildings designed after foreign models, is surprised on\nentering York Minster or St. Peter's at Rome, by the feeling that\nthese structures are imitations also,--faint copies of an invisible\narchetype. Nor has science sufficient humanity, so long as the\nnaturalist overlooks that wonderful congruity which subsists\nbetween man and the world; of which he is lord, not because he is\nthe most subtile inhabitant, but because he is its head and heart, and\nfinds something of himself in every great and small thing, in every\nmountain stratum, in every new law of color, fact of astronomy, or\natmospheric influence which observation or analysis lay open. A\nperception of this mystery inspires the muse of George Herbert, the\nbeautiful psalmist of the seventeenth century. The following lines\nare part of his little poem on Man.\n\"Man is all symmetry,\nFull of proportions, one limb to another,\nAnd to all the world besides.\nEach part may call the farthest, brother;\nFor head with foot hath private amity,\nAnd both with moons and tides.\n\"Nothing hath got so far\nBut man hath caught and kept it as his prey;\nHis eyes dismount the highest star;\nHe is in little all the sphere.\nHerbs gladly cure our flesh, because that they\nFind their acquaintance there.\n\"For us, the winds do blow,\nThe earth doth rest, heaven move, and fountains flow;\nNothing we see, but means our good,\nAs our delight, or as our treasure;\nThe whole is either our cupboard of food,\nOr cabinet of pleasure.\n\"The stars have us to bed:\nNight draws the curtain; which the sun withdraws.\nMusic and light attend our head.\nAll things unto our flesh are kind,\nIn their descent and being; to our mind,\nIn their ascent and cause.\n\"More servants wait on man\nThan he'll take notice of. In every path,\nHe treads down that which doth befriend him\nWhen sickness makes him pale and wan.\nOh mighty love! Man is one world, and hath\nAnother to attend him.\"\nThe perception of this class of truths makes the attraction which\ndraws men to science, but the end is lost sight of in attention to the\nmeans. In view of this half-sight of science, we accept the sentence\nof Plato, that, \"poetry comes nearer to vital truth than history.\"\nEvery surmise and vaticination of the mind is entitled to a certain\nrespect, and we learn to prefer imperfect theories, and sentences,\nwhich contain glimpses of truth, to digested systems which have no\none valuable suggestion. A wise writer will feel that the ends\nof study and composition are best answered by announcing\nundiscovered regions of thought, and so communicating, through\nhope, new activity to the torpid spirit.\nI shall therefore conclude this essay with some traditions of man and\nnature, which a certain poet sang to me; and which, as they have\nalways been in the world, and perhaps reappear to every bard, may\nbe both history and prophecy.\n'The foundations of man are not in matter, but in spirit. But the\nelement of spirit is eternity. To it, therefore, the longest series of\nevents, the oldest chronologies are young and recent. In the cycle of\nthe universal man, from whom the known individuals proceed,\ncenturies are points, and all history is but the epoch of one\ndegradation.\n'We distrust and deny inwardly our sympathy with nature. We own\nand disown our relation to it, by turns. We are, like Nebuchadnezzar,\ndethroned, bereft of reason, and eating grass like an ox. But who can\nset limits to the remedial force of spirit?\n'A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer,\nand shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.\nNow, the world would be insane and rabid, if these disorganizations\nshould last for hundreds of years. It is kept in check by death and\ninfancy. Infancy is the perpetual Messiah, which comes into the\narms of fallen men, and pleads with them to return to paradise.\n'Man is the dwarf of himself. Once he was permeated and dissolved\nby spirit. He filled nature with his overflowing currents. Out from\nhim sprang the sun and moon; from man, the sun; from woman, the\nmoon. The laws of his mind, the periods of his actions externized\nthemselves into day and night, into the year and the seasons. But,\nhaving made for himself this huge shell, his waters retired; he no\nlonger fills the veins and veinlets; he is shrunk to a drop. He sees,\nthat the structure still fits him, but fits him colossally. Say, rather,\nonce it fitted him, now it corresponds to him from far and on high.\nHe adores timidly his own work. Now is man the follower of the sun,\nand woman the follower of the moon. Yet sometimes he starts in his\nslumber, and wonders at himself and his house, and muses strangely\nat the resemblance betwixt him and it. He perceives that if his law is\nstill paramount, if still he have elemental power, if his word is\nsterling yet in nature, it is not conscious power, it is not inferior but\nsuperior to his will. It is Instinct.' Thus my Orphic poet sang.\nAt present, man applies to nature but half his force. He works on the\nworld with his understanding alone. He lives in it, and masters it by\na penny-wisdom; and he that works most in it, is but a half-man, and\nwhilst his arms are strong and his digestion good, his mind is\nimbruted, and he is a selfish savage. His relation to nature, his power\nover it, is through the understanding; as by manure; the economic\nuse of fire, wind, water, and the mariner's needle; steam, coal,\nchemical agriculture; the repairs of the human body by the dentist\nand the surgeon. This is such a resumption of power, as if a banished\nking should buy his territories inch by inch, instead of vaulting at\nonce into his throne. Meantime, in the thick darkness, there are not\nwanting gleams of a better light,--occasional examples of the action\nof man upon nature with his entire force,--with reason as well as\nunderstanding. Such examples are; the traditions of miracles in the\nearliest antiquity of all nations; the history of Jesus Christ; the\nachievements of a principle, as in religious and political revolutions,\nand in the abolition of the Slave-trade; the miracles of enthusiasm,\nas those reported of Swedenborg, Hohenlohe, and the Shakers; many\nobscure and yet contested facts, now arranged under the name of\nAnimal Magnetism; prayer; eloquence; self-healing; and the wisdom\nof children. These are examples of Reason's momentary grasp of the\nsceptre; the exertions of a power which exists not in time or space,\nbut an instantaneous in-streaming causing power. The difference\nbetween the actual and the ideal force of man is happily figured by\nthe schoolmen, in saying, that the knowledge of man is an evening\nknowledge, _vespertina cognitio_, but that of God is a morning\nknowledge, _matutina cognitio_.\nThe problem of restoring to the world original and eternal beauty, is\nsolved by the redemption of the soul. The ruin or the blank, that we\nsee when we look at nature, is in our own eye. The axis of vision is\nnot coincident with the axis of things, and so they appear not\ntransparent but opake. The reason why the world lacks unity, and\nlies broken and in heaps, is, because man is disunited with himself.\nHe cannot be a naturalist, until he satisfies all the demands of the\nspirit. Love is as much its demand, as perception. Indeed, neither\ncan be perfect without the other. In the uttermost meaning of the\nwords, thought is devout, and devotion is thought. Deep calls unto\ndeep. But in actual life, the marriage is not celebrated. There are\ninnocent men who worship God after the tradition of their fathers,\nbut their sense of duty has not yet extended to the use of all their\nfaculties. And there are patient naturalists, but they freeze their\nsubject under the wintry light of the understanding. Is not prayer\nalso a study of truth,--a sally of the soul into the unfound infinite?\nNo man ever prayed heartily, without learning something. But when\na faithful thinker, resolute to detach every object from personal\nrelations, and see it in the light of thought, shall, at the same time,\nkindle science with the fire of the holiest affections, then will God\ngo forth anew into the creation.\nIt will not need, when the mind is prepared for study, to search for\nobjects. The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in\nthe common. What is a day? What is a year? What is summer? What\nis woman? What is a child? What is sleep? To our blindness, these\nthings seem unaffecting. We make fables to hide the baldness of the\nfact and conform it, as we say, to the higher law of the mind. But\nwhen the fact is seen under the light of an idea, the gaudy fable\nfades and shrivels. We behold the real higher law. To the wise,\ntherefore, a fact is true poetry, and the most beautiful of fables.\nThese wonders are brought to our own door. You also are a man.\nMan and woman, and their social life, poverty, labor, sleep, fear,\nfortune, are known to you. Learn that none of these things is\nsuperficial, but that each phenomenon has its roots in the faculties\nand affections of the mind. Whilst the abstract question occupies\nyour intellect, nature brings it in the concrete to be solved by your\nhands. It were a wise inquiry for the closet, to compare, point by\npoint, especially at remarkable crises in life, our daily history, with\nthe rise and progress of ideas in the mind.\nSo shall we come to look at the world with new eyes. It shall answer\nthe endless inquiry of the intellect,--What is truth? and of the\naffections,--What is good? by yielding itself passive to the educated\nWill. Then shall come to pass what my poet said; 'Nature is not\nfixed but fluid. Spirit alters, moulds, makes it. The immobility or\nbruteness of nature, is the absence of spirit; to pure spirit, it is fluid,\nit is volatile, it is obedient. Every spirit builds itself a house; and\nbeyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven. Know\nthen, that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon\nperfect. What we are, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all\nthat Caesar could, you have and can do. Adam called his house,\nheaven and earth; Caesar called his house, Rome; you perhaps call\nyours, a cobler's trade; a hundred acres of ploughed land; or a\nscholar's garret. Yet line for line and point for point, your dominion\nis as great as theirs, though without fine names. Build, therefore,\nyour own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in\nyour mind, that will unfold its great proportions. A correspondent\nrevolution in things will attend the influx of the spirit. So fast will\ndisagreeable appearances, swine, spiders, snakes, pests, madhouses,\nprisons, enemies, vanish; they are temporary and shall be no more\nseen. The sordor and filths of nature, the sun shall dry up, and the\nwind exhale. As when the summer comes from the south; the\nsnow-banks melt, and the face of the earth becomes green before it, so\nshall the advancing spirit create its ornaments along its path, and\ncarry with it the beauty it visits, and the song which enchants it; it\nshall draw beautiful faces, warm hearts, wise discourse, and heroic\nacts, around its way, until evil is no more seen. The kingdom of man\nover nature, which cometh not with observation,--a dominion such\nas now is beyond his dream of God,--he shall enter without more\nwonder than the blind man feels who is gradually restored to perfect\nsight.'", "source": "nature.txt"}
{"text": "I. THE POET.\nThose who are esteemed umpires of taste are often persons who have\nacquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures, and have an\ninclination for whatever is elegant; but if you inquire whether they are\nbeautiful souls, and whether their own acts are like fair pictures, you\nlearn that they are selfish and sensual. Their cultivation is local, as\nif you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire, all the\nrest remaining cold. Their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of\nrules and particulars, or some limited judgment of color or form, which\nis exercised for amusement or for show. It is a proof of the shallowness\nof the doctrine of beauty as it lies in the minds of our amateurs, that\nmen seem to have lost the perception of the instant dependence of form\nupon soul. There is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy. We were\nput into our bodies, as fire is put into a pan to be carried about; but\nthere is no accurate adjustment between the spirit and the organ, much\nless is the latter the germination of the former. So in regard to other\nforms, the intellectual men do not believe in any essential dependence\nof the material world on thought and volition. Theologians think it a\npretty air-castle to talk of the Spiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud,\nof a city or a contract, but they prefer to come again to the solid\nground of historical evidence; and even the poets are contented with a\ncivil and conformed manner of living, and to write poems from the fancy,\nat a safe distance from their own experience. But the highest minds of\nthe world have never ceased to explore the double meaning, or shall\nI say the quadruple or the centuple or much more manifold meaning, of\nevery sensuous fact; Orpheus, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Plato, Plutarch,\nDante, Swedenborg, and the masters of sculpture, picture, and poetry.\nFor we are not pans and barrows, nor even porters of the fire and\ntorch-bearers, but children of the fire, made of it, and only the same\ndivinity transmuted and at two or three removes, when we know least\nabout it. And this hidden truth, that the fountains whence all this\nriver of Time and its creatures floweth are intrinsically ideal and\nbeautiful, draws us to the consideration of the nature and functions of\nthe Poet, or the man of Beauty; to the means and materials he uses, and\nto the general aspect of the art in the present time.\nThe breadth of the problem is great, for the poet is representative. He\nstands among partial men for the complete man, and apprises us not\nof his wealth, but of the common wealth. The young man reveres men of\ngenius, because, to speak truly, they are more himself than he is. They\nreceive of the soul as he also receives, but they more. Nature enhances\nher beauty, to the eye of loving men, from their belief that the poet\nis beholding her shows at the same time. He is isolated among his\ncontemporaries by truth and by his art, but with this consolation in his\npursuits, that they will draw all men sooner or later. For all men live\nby truth and stand in need of expression. In love, in art, in avarice,\nin politics, in labor, in games, we study to utter our painful secret.\nThe man is only half himself, the other half is his expression.\nNotwithstanding this necessity to be published, adequate expression is\nrare. I know not how it is that we need an interpreter, but the great\nmajority of men seem to be minors, who have not yet come into possession\nof their own, or mutes, who cannot report the conversation they have\nhad with nature. There is no man who does not anticipate a supersensual\nutility in the sun and stars, earth and water. These stand and wait to\nrender him a peculiar service. But there is some obstruction or some\nexcess of phlegm in our constitution, which does not suffer them to\nyield the due effect. Too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to\nmake us artists. Every touch should thrill. Every man should be so much\nan artist that he could report in conversation what had befallen him.\nYet, in our experience, the rays or appulses have sufficient force to\narrive at the senses, but not enough to reach the quick and compel the\nreproduction of themselves in speech. The poet is the person in whom\nthese powers are in balance, the man without impediment, who sees\nand handles that which others dream of, traverses the whole scale of\nexperience, and is representative of man, in virtue of being the largest\npower to receive and to impart.\nFor the Universe has three children, born at one time, which reappear\nunder different names in every system of thought, whether they be called\ncause, operation, and effect; or, more poetically, Jove, Pluto, Neptune;\nor, theologically, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son; but which\nwe will call here the Knower, the Doer, and the Sayer. These stand\nrespectively for the love of truth, for the love of good, and for\nthe love of beauty. These three are equal. Each is that which he is\nessentially, so that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and each of\nthese three has the power of the others latent in him, and his own,\npatent.\nThe poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty. He is a\nsovereign, and stands on the centre. For the world is not painted or\nadorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God has not made some\nbeautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe. Therefore\nthe poet is not any permissive potentate, but is emperor in his own\nright. Criticism is infested with a cant of materialism, which assumes\nthat manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men, and\ndisparages such as say and do not, overlooking the fact that some men,\nnamely poets, are natural sayers, sent into the world to the end of\nexpression, and confounds them with those whose province is action but\nwho quit it to imitate the sayers. But Homer's words are as costly and\nadmirable to Homer as Agamemnon's victories are to Agamemnon. The poet\ndoes not wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and think\nprimarily, so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken,\nreckoning the others, though primaries also, yet, in respect to him,\nsecondaries and servants; as sitters or models in the studio of a\npainter, or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect.\nFor poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so\nfinely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air\nis music, we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down,\nbut we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of\nour own, and thus miswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear write\ndown these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though\nimperfect, become the songs of the nations. For nature is as truly\nbeautiful as it is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much appear\nas it must be done, or be known. Words and deeds are quite indifferent\nmodes of the divine energy. Words are also actions, and actions are a\nkind of words.\nThe sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no\nman foretold. He is the true and only doctor; he knows and tells; he is\nthe only teller of news, for he was present and privy to the appearance\nwhich he describes. He is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the\nnecessary and causal. For we do not speak now of men of poetical\ntalents, or of industry and skill in metre, but of the true poet. I\ntook part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of\nlyrics, a man of subtle mind, whose head appeared to be a music-box of\ndelicate tunes and rhythms, and whose skill and command of language, we\ncould not sufficiently praise. But when the question arose whether he\nwas not only a lyrist but a poet, we were obliged to confess that he is\nplainly a contemporary, not an eternal man. He does not stand out of our\nlow limitations, like a Chimborazo under the line, running up from the\ntorrid Base through all the climates of the globe, with belts of the\nherbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides; but this genius\nis the landscape-garden of a modern house, adorned with fountains and\nstatues, with well-bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks\nand terraces. We hear, through all the varied music, the ground-tone of\nconventional life. Our poets are men of talents who sing, and not the\nchildren of music. The argument is secondary, the finish of the verses\nis primary.\nFor it is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem,--a\nthought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an\nanimal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new\nthing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in\nthe order of genesis the thought is prior to the form. The poet has a\nnew thought; he has a whole new experience to unfold; he will tell us\nhow it was with him, and all men will be the richer in his fortune. For\nthe experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world\nseems always waiting for its poet. I remember when I was young how much\nI was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth\nwho sat near me at table. He had left his work and gone rambling none\nknew whither, and had written hundreds of lines, but could not tell\nwhether that which was in him was therein told; he could tell nothing\nbut that all was changed,--man, beast, heaven, earth and sea. How gladly\nwe listened! how credulous! Society seemed to be compromised. We sat\nin the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars. Boston\nseemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before, or was much\nfarther than that. Rome,--what was Rome? Plutarch and Shakspeare were\nin the yellow leaf, and Homer no more should be heard of. It is much to\nknow that poetry has been written this very day, under this very roof,\nby your side. What! that wonderful spirit has not expired! These stony\nmoments are still sparkling and animated! I had fancied that the oracles\nwere all silent, and nature had spent her fires; and behold! all night,\nfrom every pore, these fine auroras have been streaming. Every one has\nsome interest in the advent of the poet, and no one knows how much it\nmay concern him. We know that the secret of the world is profound, but\nwho or what shall be our interpreter, we know not. A mountain ramble,\na new style of face, a new person, may put the key into our hands.\nOf course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report.\nTalent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds. Mankind in good\nearnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work,\nthat the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news. It is the\ntruest word ever spoken, and the phrase will be the fittest, most\nmusical, and the unerring voice of the world for that time.\nAll that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is\nthe principal event in chronology. Man, never so often deceived, still\nwatches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth\nuntil he has made it his own. With what joy I begin to read a poem which\nI confide in as an inspiration! And now my chains are to be broken; I\nshall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in which I live,--opaque,\nthough they seem transparent,--and from the heaven of truth I shall see\nand comprehend my relations. That will reconcile me to life and renovate\nnature, to see trifles animated by a tendency, and to know what I am\ndoing. Life will no more be a noise; now I shall see men and women, and\nknow the signs by which they may be discerned from fools and satans.\nThis day shall be better than my birthday: then I became an animal; now\nI am invited into the science of the real. Such is the hope, but the\nfruition is postponed. Oftener it falls that this winged man, who will\ncarry me into the heaven, whirls me into mists, then leaps and frisks\nabout with me as it were from cloud to cloud, still affirming that he\nis bound heavenward; and I, being myself a novice, am slow in perceiving\nthat he does not know the way into the heavens, and is merely bent that\nI should admire his skill to rise like a fowl or a flying fish, a little\nway from the ground or the water; but the all-piercing, all-feeding, and\nocular air of heaven that man shall never inhabit. I tumble down again\nsoon into my old nooks, and lead the life of exaggerations as before,\nand have lost my faith in the possibility of any guide who can lead me\nthither where I would be.\nBut, leaving these victims of vanity, let us, with new hope, observe\nhow nature, by worthier impulses, has ensured the poet's fidelity to his\noffice of announcement and affirming, namely by the beauty of things,\nwhich becomes a new and higher beauty when expressed. Nature offers\nall her creatures to him as a picture-language. Being used as a type,\na second wonderful value appears in the object, far better than its old\nvalue; as the carpenter's stretched cord, if you hold your ear close\nenough, is musical in the breeze. \"Things more excellent than every\nimage,\" says Jamblichus, \"are expressed through images.\" Things admit of\nbeing used as symbols because nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in\nevery part. Every line we can draw in the sand has expression; and\nthere is no body without its spirit or genius. All form is an effect of\ncharacter; all condition, of the quality of the life; all harmony,\nof health; and for this reason a perception of beauty should be\nsympathetic, or proper only to the good. The beautiful rests on the\nfoundations of the necessary. The soul makes the body, as the wise\nSpenser teaches:--\n\"So every spirit, as it is most pure,\nAnd hath in it the more of heavenly light,\nSo it the fairer body doth procure\nTo habit in, and it more fairly dight,\nWith cheerful grace and amiable sight.\nFor, of the soul, the body form doth take,\nFor soul is form, and doth the body make.\"\nHere we find ourselves suddenly not in a critical speculation but in a\nholy place, and should go very warily and reverently. We stand before\nthe secret of the world, there where Being passes into Appearance and\nUnity into Variety.\nThe Universe is the externization of the soul. Wherever the life is,\nthat bursts into appearance around it. Our science is sensual, and\ntherefore superficial. The earth and the heavenly bodies, physics, and\nchemistry, we sensually treat, as if they were self-existent; but\nthese are the retinue of that Being we have. \"The mighty heaven,\"\nsaid Proclus, \"exhibits, in its transfigurations, clear images of the\nsplendor of intellectual perceptions; being moved in conjunction with\nthe unapparent periods of intellectual natures.\" Therefore science\nalways goes abreast with the just elevation of the man, keeping step\nwith religion and metaphysics; or the state of science is an index of\nour self-knowledge. Since everything in nature answers to a moral power,\nif any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is that the corresponding\nfaculty in the observer is not yet active.\nNo wonder then, if these waters be so deep, that we hover over them with\na religious regard. The beauty of the fable proves the importance of the\nsense; to the poet, and to all others; or, if you please, every man is\nso far a poet as to be susceptible of these enchantments of nature; for\nall men have the thoughts whereof the universe is the celebration. I\nfind that the fascination resides in the symbol. Who loves nature? Who\ndoes not? Is it only poets, and men of leisure and cultivation, who live\nwith her? No; but also hunters, farmers, grooms, and butchers, though\nthey express their affection in their choice of life and not in their\nchoice of words. The writer wonders what the coachman or the hunter\nvalues in riding, in horses and dogs. It is not superficial qualities.\nWhen you talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as you. His\nworship is sympathetic; he has no definitions, but he is commanded\nin nature, by the living power which he feels to be there present. No\nimitation or playing of these things would content him; he loves the\nearnest of the north wind, of rain, of stone, and wood, and iron. A\nbeauty not explicable is dearer than a beauty which we can see to the\nend of. It is nature the symbol, nature certifying the supernatural,\nbody overflowed by life which he worships with coarse but sincere rites.\nThe inwardness and mystery of this attachment drives men of every class\nto the use of emblems. The schools of poets and philosophers are not\nmore intoxicated with their symbols than the populace with theirs. In\nour political parties, compute the power of badges and emblems. See\nthe great ball which they roll from Baltimore to Bunker hill! In the\npolitical processions, Lowell goes in a loom, and Lynn in a shoe,\nand Salem in a ship. Witness the cider-barrel, the log-cabin, the\nhickory-stick, the palmetto, and all the cognizances of party. See the\npower of national emblems. Some stars, lilies, leopards, a crescent, a\nlion, an eagle, or other figure which came into credit God knows how, on\nan old rag of bunting, blowing in the wind on a fort at the ends of\nthe earth, shall make the blood tingle under the rudest or the most\nconventional exterior. The people fancy they hate poetry, and they are\nall poets and mystics!\nBeyond this universality of the symbolic language, we are apprised of\nthe divineness of this superior use of things, whereby the world is a\ntemple whose walls are covered with emblems, pictures, and commandments\nof the Deity,--in this, that there is no fact in nature which does not\ncarry the whole sense of nature; and the distinctions which we make in\nevents and in affairs, of low and high, honest and base, disappear when\nnature is used as a symbol. Thought makes everything fit for use. The\nvocabulary of an omniscient man would embrace words and images excluded\nfrom polite conversation. What would be base, or even obscene, to the\nobscene, becomes illustrious, spoken in a new connexion of thought. The\npiety of the Hebrew prophets purges their grossness. The circumcision is\nan example of the power of poetry to raise the low and offensive. Small\nand mean things serve as well as great symbols. The meaner the type by\nwhich a law is expressed, the more pungent it is, and the more lasting\nin the memories of men: just as we choose the smallest box or case in\nwhich any needful utensil can be carried. Bare lists of words are found\nsuggestive to an imaginative and excited mind; as it is related of Lord\nChatham that he was accustomed to read in Bailey's Dictionary when he\nwas preparing to speak in Parliament. The poorest experience is rich\nenough for all the purposes of expressing thought. Why covet a knowledge\nof new facts? Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few\nactions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles. We are\nfar from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use.\nWe can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity. It does not\nneed that a poem should be long. Every word was once a poem. Every new\nrelation is a new word. Also we use defects and deformities to a sacred\npurpose, so expressing our sense that the evils of the world are such\nonly to the evil eye. In the old mythology, mythologists observe,\ndefects are ascribed to divine natures, as lameness to Vulcan, blindness\nto Cupid, and the like,--to signify exuberances.\nFor as it is dislocation and detachment from the life of God that\nmakes things ugly, the poet, who re-attaches things to nature and the\nWhole,--re-attaching even artificial things and violations of nature,\nto nature, by a deeper insight,--disposes very easily of the most\ndisagreeable facts. Readers of poetry see the factory-village and the\nrailway, and fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken up by\nthese; for these works of art are not yet consecrated in their reading;\nbut the poet sees them fall within the great Order not less than the\nbeehive or the spider's geometrical web. Nature adopts them very fast\ninto her vital circles, and the gliding train of cars she loves like\nher own. Besides, in a centred mind, it signifies nothing how many\nmechanical inventions you exhibit. Though you add millions, and never so\nsurprising, the fact of mechanics has not gained a grain's weight. The\nspiritual fact remains unalterable, by many or by few particulars; as no\nmountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere.\nA shrewd country-boy goes to the city for the first time, and the\ncomplacent citizen is not satisfied with his little wonder. It is not\nthat he does not see all the fine houses and know that he never saw such\nbefore, but he disposes of them as easily as the poet finds place for\nthe railway. The chief value of the new fact is to enhance the great and\nconstant fact of Life, which can dwarf any and every circumstance, and\nto which the belt of wampum and the commerce of America are alike.\nThe world being thus put under the mind for verb and noun, the poet is\nhe who can articulate it. For though life is great, and fascinates, and\nabsorbs; and though all men are intelligent of the symbols through which\nit is named; yet they cannot originally use them. We are symbols and\ninhabit symbols; workmen, work, and tools, words and things, birth and\ndeath, all are emblems; but we sympathize with the symbols, and being\ninfatuated with the economical uses of things, we do not know that they\nare thoughts. The poet, by an ulterior intellectual perception, gives\nthem a power which makes their old use forgotten, and puts eyes and\na tongue into every dumb and inanimate object. He perceives the\nindependence of the thought on the symbol, the stability of the thought,\nthe accidency and fugacity of the symbol. As the eyes of Lyncaeus were\nsaid to see through the earth, so the poet turns the world to glass, and\nshows us all things in their right series and procession. For through\nthat better perception he stands one step nearer to things, and sees\nthe flowing or metamorphosis; perceives that thought is multiform; that\nwithin the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend\ninto a higher form; and following with his eyes the life, uses the forms\nwhich express that life, and so his speech flows with the flowing of\nnature. All the facts of the animal economy, sex, nutriment, gestation,\nbirth, growth, are symbols of the passage of the world into the soul\nof man, to suffer there a change and reappear a new and higher fact. He\nuses forms according to the life, and not according to the form. This is\ntrue science. The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation\nand animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as\nsigns. He knows why the plain or meadow of space was strewn with these\nflowers we call suns and moons and stars; why the great deep is adorned\nwith animals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks he rides\non them as the horses of thought.\nBy virtue of this science the poet is the Namer or Language-maker,\nnaming things sometimes after their appearance, sometimes after their\nessence, and giving to every one its own name and not another's, thereby\nrejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachment or boundary. The\npoets made all the words, and therefore language is the archives of\nhistory, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses. For though\nthe origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first\na stroke of genius, and obtained currency because for the moment\nit symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer. The\netymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant\npicture. Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent\nconsists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language\nis made up of images or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have\nlong ceased to remind us of their poetic origin. But the poet names the\nthing because he sees it, or comes one step nearer to it than any other.\nThis expression or naming is not art, but a second nature, grown out\nof the first, as a leaf out of a tree. What we call nature is a certain\nself-regulated motion or change; and nature does all things by her own\nhands, and does not leave another to baptize her but baptizes herself;\nand this through the metamorphosis again. I remember that a certain poet\ndescribed it to me thus:\nGenius is the activity which repairs the decays of things, whether\nwholly or partly of a material and finite kind. Nature, through all her\nkingdoms, insures herself. Nobody cares for planting the poor fungus; so\nshe shakes down from the gills of one agaric countless spores, any one\nof which, being preserved, transmits new billions of spores to-morrow or\nnext day. The new agaric of this hour has a chance which the old one had\nnot. This atom of seed is thrown into a new place, not subject to the\naccidents which destroyed its parent two rods off. She makes a man;\nand having brought him to ripe age, she will no longer run the risk of\nlosing this wonder at a blow, but she detaches from him a new self, that\nthe kind may be safe from accidents to which the individual is exposed.\nSo when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought, she\ndetaches and sends away from it its poems or songs,--a fearless,\nsleepless, deathless progeny, which is not exposed to the accidents of\nthe weary kingdom of time; a fearless, vivacious offspring, clad with\nwings (such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came) which\ncarry them fast and far, and infix them irrecoverably into the hearts\nof men. These wings are the beauty of the poet's soul. The songs, thus\nflying immortal from their mortal parent, are pursued by clamorous\nflights of censures, which swarm in far greater numbers and threaten to\ndevour them; but these last are not winged. At the end of a very short\nleap they fall plump down and rot, having received from the souls out of\nwhich they came no beautiful wings. But the melodies of the poet ascend\nand leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time.\nSo far the bard taught me, using his freer speech. But nature has a\nhigher end, in the production of New individuals, than security, namely\nascension, or the passage of the soul into higher forms. I knew in my\nyounger days the sculptor who made the statue of the youth which stands\nin the public garden. He was, as I remember, unable to tell directly,\nwhat made him happy or unhappy, but by wonderful indirections he could\ntell. He rose one day, according to his habit, before the dawn, and saw\nthe morning break, grand as the eternity out of which it came, and for\nmany days after, he strove to express this tranquillity, and lo! his\nchisel had fashioned out of marble the form of a beautiful youth,\nPhosphorus, whose aspect is such that it is said all persons who look\non it become silent. The poet also resigns himself to his mood, and that\nthought which agitated him is expressed, but alter idem, in a manner\ntotally new. The expression is organic, or the new type which things\nthemselves take when liberated. As, in the sun, objects paint their\nimages on the retina of the eye, so they, sharing the aspiration of the\nwhole universe, tend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence\nin his mind. Like the metamorphosis of things into higher organic forms\nis their change into melodies. Over everything stands its daemon or\nsoul, and, as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the\nsoul of the thing is reflected by a melody. The sea, the mountain-ridge,\nNiagara, and every flower-bed, pre-exist, or super-exist, in\npre-cantations, which sail like odors in the air, and when any man goes\nby with an ear sufficiently fine, he overhears them and endeavors to\nwrite down the notes without diluting or depraving them. And herein is\nthe legitimation of criticism, in the mind's faith that the poems are a\ncorrupt version of some text in nature with which they ought to be made\nto tally. A rhyme in one of our sonnets should not be less pleasing than\nthe iterated nodes of a sea-shell, or the resembling difference of a\ngroup of flowers. The pairing of the birds is an idyl, not tedious as\nour idyls are; a tempest is a rough ode, without falsehood or rant;\na summer, with its harvest sown, reaped, and stored, is an epic song,\nsubordinating how many admirably executed parts. Why should not the\nsymmetry and truth that modulate these, glide into our spirits, and we\nparticipate the invention of nature?\nThis insight, which expresses itself by what is called Imagination, is\na very high sort of seeing, which does not come by study, but by the\nintellect being where and what it sees; by sharing the path or circuit\nof things through forms, and so making them translucid to others. The\npath of things is silent. Will they suffer a speaker to go with them? A\nspy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet, is the transcendency of their\nown nature,--him they will suffer. The condition of true naming, on the\npoet's part, is his resigning himself to the divine aura which breathes\nthrough forms, and accompanying that.\nIt is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns, that, beyond\nthe energy of his possessed and conscious intellect he is capable of a\nnew energy (as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment to the\nnature of things; that beside his privacy of power as an individual man,\nthere is a great public power on which he can draw, by unlocking, at\nall risks, his human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to roll\nand circulate through him; then he is caught up into the life of the\nUniverse, his speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words are\nuniversally intelligible as the plants and animals. The poet knows that\nhe speaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or, \"with\nthe flower of the mind;\" not with the intellect used as an organ, but\nwith the intellect released from all service and suffered to take its\ndirection from its celestial life; or as the ancients were wont to\nexpress themselves, not with intellect alone but with the intellect\ninebriated by nectar. As the traveller who has lost his way throws his\nreins on his horse's neck and trusts to the instinct of the animal\nto find his road, so must we do with the divine animal who carries us\nthrough this world. For if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct,\nnew passages are opened for us into nature; the mind flows into and\nthrough things hardest and highest, and the metamorphosis is possible.\nThis is the reason why bards love wine, mead, narcotics, coffee, tea,\nopium, the fumes of sandal-wood and tobacco, or whatever other procurers\nof animal exhilaration. All men avail themselves of such means as they\ncan, to add this extraordinary power to their normal powers; and to\nthis end they prize conversation, music, pictures, sculpture, dancing,\ntheatres, travelling, war, mobs, fires, gaming, politics, or love, or\nscience, or animal intoxication,--which are several coarser or\nfiner quasi-mechanical substitutes for the true nectar, which is the\nravishment of the intellect by coming nearer to the fact. These are\nauxiliaries to the centrifugal tendency of a man, to his passage out\ninto free space, and they help him to escape the custody of that body\nin which he is pent up, and of that jail-yard of individual relations\nin which he is enclosed. Hence a great number of such as were\nprofessionally expressers of Beauty, as painters, poets, musicians, and\nactors, have been more than others wont to lead a life of pleasure and\nindulgence; all but the few who received the true nectar; and, as it was\na spurious mode of attaining freedom, as it was an emancipation not into\nthe heavens but into the freedom of baser places, they were punished for\nthat advantage they won, by a dissipation and deterioration. But never\ncan any advantage be taken of nature by a trick. The spirit of the\nworld, the great calm presence of the Creator, comes not forth to the\nsorceries of opium or of wine. The sublime vision comes to the pure\nand simple soul in a clean and chaste body. That is not an inspiration,\nwhich we owe to narcotics, but some counterfeit excitement and fury.\nMilton says that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but\nthe epic poet, he who shall sing of the gods and their descent unto men,\nmust drink water out of a wooden bowl. For poetry is not 'Devil's wine,'\nbut God's wine. It is with this as it is with toys. We fill the hands\nand nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls, drums, and\nhorses; withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and sufficing objects\nof nature, the sun, and moon, the animals, the water, and stones, which\nshould be their toys. So the poet's habit of living should be set on\na key so low that the common influences should delight him. His\ncheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice\nfor his inspiration, and he should be tipsy with water. That spirit\nwhich suffices quiet hearts, which seems to come forth to such from\nevery dry knoll of sere grass, from every pine-stump and half-imbedded\nstone on which the dull March sun shines, comes forth to the poor and\nhungry, and such as are of simple taste. If thou fill thy brain with\nBoston and New York, with fashion and covetousness, and wilt stimulate\nthy jaded senses with wine and French coffee, thou shalt find no\nradiance of wisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods.\nIf the imagination intoxicates the poet, it is not inactive in other\nmen. The metamorphosis excites in the beholder an emotion of joy. The\nuse of symbols has a certain power of emancipation and exhilaration for\nall men. We seem to be touched by a wand which makes us dance and run\nabout happily, like children. We are like persons who come out of a cave\nor cellar into the open air. This is the effect on us of tropes, fables,\noracles, and all poetic forms. Poets are thus liberating gods. Men have\nreally got a new sense, and found within their world another world, or\nnest of worlds; for, the metamorphosis once seen, we divine that it\ndoes not stop. I will not now consider how much this makes the charm\nof algebra and the mathematics, which also have their tropes, but it\nis felt in every definition; as when Aristotle defines space to be an\nimmovable vessel in which things are contained;--or when Plato defines\na line to be a flowing point; or figure to be a bound of solid; and\nmany the like. What a joyful sense of freedom we have when Vitruvius\nannounces the old opinion of artists that no architect can build any\nhouse well who does not know something of anatomy. When Socrates, in\nCharmides, tells us that the soul is cured of its maladies by certain\nincantations, and that these incantations are beautiful reasons, from\nwhich temperance is generated in souls; when Plato calls the world an\nanimal; and Timaeus affirms that the plants also are animals; or affirms\na man to be a heavenly tree, growing with his root, which is his head,\nupward; and, as George Chapman, following him, writes,--\n\"So in our tree of man, whose nervie root\nSprings in his top;\"--\nwhen Orpheus speaks of hoariness as \"that white flower which marks\nextreme old age;\" when Proclus calls the universe the statue of the\nintellect; when Chaucer, in his praise of 'Gentilesse,' compares good\nblood in mean condition to fire, which, though carried to the darkest\nhouse betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus, will yet hold its natural\noffice and burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it behold; when\nJohn saw, in the Apocalypse, the ruin of the world through evil, and the\nstars fall from heaven as the figtree casteth her untimely fruit; when\nAesop reports the whole catalogue of common daily relations through\nthe masquerade of birds and beasts;--we take the cheerful hint of the\nimmortality of our essence and its versatile habit and escapes, as when\nthe gypsies say \"it is in vain to hang them, they cannot die.\"\nThe poets are thus liberating gods. The ancient British bards had for\nthe title of their order, \"Those Who are free throughout the world.\"\nThey are free, and they make free. An imaginative book renders us\nmuch more service at first, by stimulating us through its tropes, than\nafterward when we arrive at the precise sense of the author. I think\nnothing is of any value in books excepting the transcendental and\nextraordinary. If a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought, to\nthat degree that he forgets the authors and the public and heeds only\nthis one dream which holds him like an insanity, let me read his paper,\nand you may have all the arguments and histories and criticism. All\nthe value which attaches to Pythagoras, Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa,\nCardan, Kepler, Swedenborg, Schelling, Oken, or any other who introduces\nquestionable facts into his cosmogony, as angels, devils, magic,\nastrology, palmistry, mesmerism, and so on, is the certificate we have\nof departure from routine, and that here is a new witness. That also is\nthe best success in conversation, the magic of liberty, which puts the\nworld like a ball in our hands. How cheap even the liberty then seems;\nhow mean to study, when an emotion communicates to the intellect the\npower to sap and upheave nature; how great the perspective! nations,\ntimes, systems, enter and disappear like threads in tapestry of large\nfigure and many colors; dream delivers us to dream, and while the\ndrunkenness lasts we will sell our bed, our philosophy, our religion, in\nour opulence.\nThere is good reason why we should prize this liberation. The fate of\nthe poor shepherd, who, blinded and lost in the snow-storm, perishes in\na drift within a few feet of his cottage door, is an emblem of the state\nof man. On the brink of the waters of life and truth, we are miserably\ndying. The inaccessibleness of every thought but that we are in, is\nwonderful. What if you come near to it; you are as remote when you are\nnearest as when you are farthest. Every thought is also a prison; every\nheaven is also a prison. Therefore we love the poet, the inventor, who\nin any form, whether in an ode or in an action or in looks and behavior\nhas yielded us a new thought. He unlocks our chains and admits us to a\nnew scene.\nThis emancipation is dear to all men, and the power to impart it, as\nit must come from greater depth and scope of thought, is a measure of\nintellect. Therefore all books of the imagination endure, all which\nascend to that truth that the writer sees nature beneath him, and uses\nit as his exponent. Every verse or sentence possessing this virtue will\ntake care of its own immortality. The religions of the world are the\nejaculations of a few imaginative men.\nBut the quality of the imagination is to flow, and not to freeze. The\npoet did not stop at the color or the form, but read their meaning;\nneither may he rest in this meaning, but he makes the same objects\nexponents of his new thought. Here is the difference betwixt the poet\nand the mystic, that the last nails a symbol to one sense, which was a\ntrue sense for a moment, but soon becomes old and false. For all symbols\nare fluxional; all language is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as\nferries and horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are,\nfor homestead. Mysticism consists in the mistake of an accidental and\nindividual symbol for an universal one. The morning-redness happens to\nbe the favorite meteor to the eyes of Jacob Behmen, and comes to stand\nto him for truth and faith; and, he believes, should stand for the same\nrealities to every reader. But the first reader prefers as naturally the\nsymbol of a mother and child, or a gardener and his bulb, or a jeweller\npolishing a gem. Either of these, or of a myriad more, are equally\ngood to the person to whom they are significant. Only they must be held\nlightly, and be very willingly translated into the equivalent terms\nwhich others use. And the mystic must be steadily told,--All that you\nsay is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it.\nLet us have a little algebra, instead of this trite rhetoric,--universal\nsigns, instead of these village symbols,--and we shall both be gainers.\nThe history of hierarchies seems to show that all religious error\nconsisted in making the symbol too stark and solid, and was at last\nnothing but an excess of the organ of language.\nSwedenborg, of all men in the recent ages, stands eminently for the\ntranslator of nature into thought. I do not know the man in history to\nwhom things stood so uniformly for words. Before him the metamorphosis\ncontinually plays. Everything on which his eye rests, obeys the impulses\nof moral nature. The figs become grapes whilst he eats them. When\nsome of his angels affirmed a truth, the laurel twig which they held\nblossomed in their hands. The noise which at a distance appeared like\ngnashing and thumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice of\ndisputants. The men in one of his visions, seen in heavenly light,\nappeared like dragons, and seemed in darkness; but to each other they\nappeared as men, and when the light from heaven shone into their cabin,\nthey complained of the darkness, and were compelled to shut the window\nthat they might see.\nThere was this perception in him which makes the poet or seer an object\nof awe and terror, namely that the same man or society of men may wear\none aspect to themselves and their companions, and a different aspect to\nhigher intelligences. Certain priests, whom he describes as conversing\nvery learnedly together, appeared to the children who were at some\ndistance, like dead horses; and many the like misappearances. And\ninstantly the mind inquires whether these fishes under the bridge,\nyonder oxen in the pasture, those dogs in the yard, are immutably\nfishes, oxen, and dogs, or only so appear to me, and perchance to\nthemselves appear upright men; and whether I appear as a man to all\neyes. The Bramins and Pythagoras propounded the same question, and\nif any poet has witnessed the transformation he doubtless found it\nin harmony with various experiences. We have all seen changes as\nconsiderable in wheat and caterpillars. He is the poet and shall draw us\nwith love and terror, who sees through the flowing vest the firm nature,\nand can declare it.\nI look in vain for the poet whom I describe. We do not with sufficient\nplainness or sufficient profoundness address ourselves to life, nor dare\nwe chaunt our own times and social circumstance. If we filled the day\nwith bravery, we should not shrink from celebrating it. Time and nature\nyield us many gifts, but not yet the timely man, the new religion, the\nreconciler, whom all things await. Dante's praise is that he dared to\nwrite his autobiography in colossal cipher, or into universality. We\nhave yet had no genius in America, with tyrannous eye, which knew the\nvalue of our incomparable materials, and saw, in the barbarism and\nmaterialism of the times, another carnival of the same gods whose\npicture he so much admires in Homer; then in the Middle Age; then in\nCalvinism. Banks and tariffs, the newspaper and caucus, Methodism and\nUnitarianism, are flat and dull to dull people, but rest on the same\nfoundations of wonder as the town of Troy and the temple of Delphi,\nand are as swiftly passing away. Our logrolling, our stumps and their\npolitics, our fisheries, our Negroes and Indians, our boats and our\nrepudiations, the wrath of rogues and the pusillanimity of honest men,\nthe northern trade, the southern planting, the western clearing, Oregon\nand Texas, are yet unsung. Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample\ngeography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.\nIf I have not found that excellent combination of gifts in my countrymen\nwhich I seek, neither could I aid myself to fix the idea of the poet\nby reading now and then in Chalmers's collection of five centuries of\nEnglish poets. These are wits more than poets, though there have been\npoets among them. But when we adhere to the ideal of the poet, we have\nour difficulties even with Milton and Homer. Milton is too literary, and\nHomer too literal and historical.\nBut I am not wise enough for a national criticism, and must use the old\nlargeness a little longer, to discharge my errand from the muse to the\npoet concerning his art.\nArt is the path of the creator to his work. The paths or methods are\nideal and eternal, though few men ever see them; not the artist himself\nfor years, or for a lifetime, unless he come into the conditions. The\npainter, the sculptor, the composer, the epic rhapsodist, the orator,\nall partake one desire, namely to express themselves symmetrically\nand abundantly, not dwarfishly and fragmentarily. They found or put\nthemselves in certain conditions, as, the painter and sculptor before\nsome impressive human figures; the orator, into the assembly of the\npeople; and the others in such scenes as each has found exciting to his\nintellect; and each presently feels the new desire. He hears a voice,\nhe sees a beckoning. Then he is apprised, with wonder, what herds of\ndaemons hem him in. He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter,\n\"By God, it is in me and must go forth of me.\" He pursues a beauty,\nhalf seen, which flies before him. The poet pours out verses in every\nsolitude. Most of the things he says are conventional, no doubt; but by\nand by he says something which is original and beautiful. That charms\nhim. He would say nothing else but such things. In our way of talking\nwe say 'That is yours, this is mine;' but the poet knows well that it is\nnot his; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to you; he would\nfain hear the like eloquence at length. Once having tasted this immortal\nichor, he cannot have enough of it, and as an admirable creative power\nexists in these intellections, it is of the last importance that these\nthings get spoken. What a little of all we know is said! What drops of\nall the sea of our science are baled up! and by what accident it is\nthat these are exposed, when so many secrets sleep in nature! Hence the\nnecessity of speech and song; hence these throbs and heart-beatings in\nthe orator, at the door of the assembly, to the end namely that thought\nmay be ejaculated as Logos, or Word.\nDoubt not, O poet, but persist. Say 'It is in me, and shall out.' Stand\nthere, balked and dumb, stuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted,\nstand and strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that dream-power\nwhich every night shows thee is thine own; a power transcending all\nlimit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of\nthe whole river of electricity. Nothing walks, or creeps, or grows, or\nexists, which must not in turn arise and walk before him as exponent\nof his meaning. Comes he to that power, his genius is no longer\nexhaustible. All the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into his mind\nas into a Noah's ark, to come forth again to people a new world. This is\nlike the stock of air for our respiration or for the combustion of\nour fireplace; not a measure of gallons, but the entire atmosphere if\nwanted. And therefore the rich poets, as Homer, Chaucer, Shakspeare, and\nRaphael, have obviously no limits to their works except the limits of\ntheir lifetime, and resemble a mirror carried through the street, ready\nto render an image of every created thing.\nO poet! a new nobility is conferred in groves and pastures, and not in\ncastles or by the sword-blade any longer. The conditions are hard, but\nequal. Thou shalt leave the world, and know the muse only. Thou shalt\nnot know any longer the times, customs, graces, politics, or opinions of\nmen, but shalt take all from the muse. For the time of towns is tolled\nfrom the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the universal hours are\ncounted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants, and by growth of joy\non joy. God wills also that thou abdicate a manifold and duplex life,\nand that thou be content that others speak for thee. Others shall be thy\ngentlemen and shall represent all courtesy and worldly life for thee;\nothers shall do the great and resounding actions also. Thou shalt lie\nclose hid with nature, and canst not be afforded to the Capitol or the\nExchange. The world is full of renunciations and apprenticeships, and\nthis is thine: thou must pass for a fool and a churl for a long\nseason. This is the screen and sheath in which Pan has protected his\nwell-beloved flower, and thou shalt be known only to thine own, and they\nshall console thee with tenderest love. And thou shalt not be able to\nrehearse the names of thy friends in thy verse, for an old shame before\nthe holy ideal. And this is the reward; that the ideal shall be real\nto thee, and the impressions of the actual world shall fall like summer\nrain, copious, but not troublesome, to thy invulnerable essence. Thou\nshalt have the whole land for thy park and manor, the sea for thy bath\nand navigation, without tax and without envy; the woods and the rivers\nthou shalt own; and thou shalt possess that wherein others are only\ntenants and boarders. Thou true land-lord! sea-lord! air-lord! Wherever\nsnow falls or water flows or birds fly, wherever day and night meet in\ntwilight, wherever the blue heaven is hung by clouds or sown with stars,\nwherever are forms with transparent boundaries, wherever are outlets\ninto celestial space, wherever is danger, and awe, and love,--there is\nBeauty, plenteous as rain, shed for thee, and though thou shouldest walk\nthe world over, thou shalt not be able to find a condition inopportune\nor ignoble.\n*****\nEXPERIENCE.\nTHE lords of life, the lords of life,--\nI saw them pass,\nIn their own guise,\nLike and unlike,\nPortly and grim,\nUse and Surprise,\nSurface and Dream,\nSuccession swift, and spectral Wrong,\nTemperament without a tongue,\nAnd the inventor of the game\nOmnipresent without name;--\nSome to see, some to be guessed,\nThey marched from east to west:\nLittle man, least of all,\nAmong the legs of his guardians tall,\nWalked about with puzzled look:--\nHim by the hand dear Nature took;\nDearest Nature, strong and kind,\nWhispered, 'Darling, never mind!\nTomorrow they will wear another face,\nThe founder thou! these are thy race!'\nII. EXPERIENCE.\nWHERE do we find ourselves? In a series of which we do not know the\nextremes, and believe that it has none. We wake and find ourselves on a\nstair; there are stairs below us, which we seem to have ascended; there\nare stairs above us, many a one, which go upward and out of sight. But\nthe Genius which according to the old belief stands at the door by which\nwe enter, and gives us the lethe to drink, that we may tell no tales,\nmixed the cup too strongly, and we cannot shake off the lethargy now at\nnoonday. Sleep lingers all our lifetime about our eyes, as night hovers\nall day in the boughs of the fir-tree. All things swim and glitter. Our\nlife is not so much threatened as our perception. Ghostlike we glide\nthrough nature, and should not know our place again. Did our birth\nfall in some fit of indigence and frugality in nature, that she was so\nsparing of her fire and so liberal of her earth that it appears to us\nthat we lack the affirmative principle, and though we have health and\nreason, yet we have no superfluity of spirit for new creation? We have\nenough to live and bring the year about, but not an ounce to impart or\nto invest. Ah that our Genius were a little more of a genius! We are\nlike millers on the lower levels of a stream, when the factories above\nthem have exhausted the water. We too fancy that the upper people must\nhave raised their dams.\nIf any of us knew what we were doing, or where we are going, then when\nwe think we best know! We do not know to-day whether we are busy or\nidle. In times when we thought ourselves indolent, we have afterwards\ndiscovered that much was accomplished, and much was begun in us. All our\ndays are so unprofitable while they pass, that 'tis wonderful where or\nwhen we ever got anything of this which we call wisdom, poetry, virtue.\nWe never got it on any dated calendar day. Some heavenly days must have\nbeen intercalated somewhere, like those that Hermes won with dice of the\nMoon, that Osiris might be born. It is said all martyrdoms looked mean\nwhen they were suffered. Every ship is a romantic object, except that\nwe sail in. Embark, and the romance quits our vessel and hangs on every\nother sail in the horizon. Our life looks trivial, and we shun to\nrecord it. Men seem to have learned of the horizon the art of perpetual\nretreating and reference. 'Yonder uplands are rich pasturage, and my\nneighbor has fertile meadow, but my field,' says the querulous farmer,\n'only holds the world together.' I quote another man's saying; unluckily\nthat other withdraws himself in the same way, and quotes me. 'Tis\nthe trick of nature thus to degrade to-day; a good deal of buzz, and\nsomewhere a result slipped magically in. Every roof is agreeable to\nthe eye until it is lifted; then we find tragedy and moaning women and\nhard-eyed husbands and deluges of lethe, and the men ask, 'What's the\nnews?' as if the old were so bad. How many individuals can we count in\nsociety? how many actions? how many opinions? So much of our time is\npreparation, so much is routine, and so much retrospect, that the pith\nof each man's genius contracts itself to a very few hours. The\nhistory of literature--take the net result of Tiraboschi, Warton, or\nSchlegel,--is a sum of very few ideas and of very few original tales;\nall the rest being variation of these. So in this great society wide\nlying around us, a critical analysis would find very few spontaneous\nactions. It is almost all custom and gross sense. There are even few\nopinions, and these seem organic in the speakers, and do not disturb the\nuniversal necessity.\nWhat opium is instilled into all disaster! It shows formidable as we\napproach it, but there is at last no rough rasping friction, but the\nmost slippery sliding surfaces. We fall soft on a thought; Ate Dea is\ngentle,--\n\"Over men's heads walking aloft,\nWith tender feet treading so soft.\"\nPeople grieve and bemoan themselves, but it is not half so bad with them\nas they say. There are moods in which we court suffering, in the hope\nthat here at least we shall find reality, sharp peaks and edges of\ntruth. But it turns out to be scene-painting and counterfeit. The only\nthing grief has taught me is to know how shallow it is. That, like all\nthe rest, plays about the surface, and never introduces me into the\nreality, for contact with which we would even pay the costly price of\nsons and lovers. Was it Boscovich who found out that bodies never come\nin contact? Well, souls never touch their objects. An innavigable\nsea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and\nconverse with. Grief too will make us idealists. In the death of my son,\nnow more than two years ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate,--no\nmore. I cannot get it nearer to me. If to-morrow I should be informed of\nthe bankruptcy of my principal debtors, the loss of my property would be\na great inconvenience to me, perhaps, for many years; but it would\nleave me as it found me,--neither better nor worse. So is it with this\ncalamity: it does not touch me; something which I fancied was a part of\nme, which could not be torn away without tearing me nor enlarged without\nenriching me, falls off from me and leaves no scar. It was caducous. I\ngrieve that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real\nnature. The Indian who was laid under a curse that the wind should not\nblow on him, nor water flow to him, nor fire burn him, is a type of us\nall. The dearest events are summer-rain, and we the Para coats that shed\nevery drop. Nothing is left us now but death. We look to that with a\ngrim satisfaction, saying There at least is reality that will not dodge\nus.\nI take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects, which lets them\nslip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest, to be the most\nunhandsome part of our condition. Nature does not like to be observed,\nand likes that we should be her fools and playmates. We may have the\nsphere for our cricket-ball, but not a berry for our philosophy. Direct\nstrokes she never gave us power to make; all our blows glance, all our\nhits are accidents. Our relations to each other are oblique and casual.\nDream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to illusion. Life is a\ntrain of moods like a string of beads, and as we pass through them they\nprove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and\neach shows only what lies in its focus. From the mountain you see the\nmountain. We animate what we can, and we see only what we animate.\nNature and books belong to the eyes that see them. It depends on the\nmood of the man whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem. There\nare always sunsets, and there is always genius; but only a few hours so\nserene that we can relish nature or criticism. The more or less depends\non structure or temperament. Temperament is the iron wire on which\nthe beads are strung. Of what use is fortune or talent to a cold and\ndefective nature? Who cares what sensibility or discrimination a man has\nat some time shown, if he falls asleep in his chair? or if he laugh and\ngiggle? or if he apologize? or is infected with egotism? or thinks of\nhis dollar? or cannot go by food? or has gotten a child in his boyhood?\nOf what use is genius, if the organ is too convex or too concave and\ncannot find a focal distance within the actual horizon of human life? Of\nwhat use, if the brain is too cold or too hot, and the man does not care\nenough for results to stimulate him to experiment, and hold him up in\nit? or if the web is too finely woven, too irritable by pleasure and\npain, so that life stagnates from too much reception without due\noutlet? Of what use to make heroic vows of amendment, if the same old\nlaw-breaker is to keep them? What cheer can the religious sentiment\nyield, when that is suspected to be secretly dependent on the seasons of\nthe year and the state of the blood? I knew a witty physician who found\nthe creed in the biliary duct, and used to affirm that if there was\ndisease in the liver, the man became a Calvinist, and if that organ\nwas sound, he became a Unitarian. Very mortifying is the reluctant\nexperience that some unfriendly excess or imbecility neutralizes the\npromise of genius. We see young men who owe us a new world, so readily\nand lavishly they promise, but they never acquit the debt; they die\nyoung and dodge the account; or if they live they lose themselves in the\ncrowd.\nTemperament also enters fully into the system of illusions and shuts us\nin a prison of glass which we cannot see. There is an optical illusion\nabout every person we meet. In truth they are all creatures of given\ntemperament, which will appear in a given character, whose boundaries\nthey will never pass: but we look at them, they seem alive, and we\npresume there is impulse in them. In the moment it seems impulse; in the\nyear, in the lifetime, it turns out to be a certain uniform tune\nwhich the revolving barrel of the music-box must play. Men resist the\nconclusion in the morning, but adopt it as the evening wears on, that\ntemper prevails over everything of time, place, and condition, and is\ninconsumable in the flames of religion. Some modifications the moral\nsentiment avails to impose, but the individual texture holds its\ndominion, if not to bias the moral judgments, yet to fix the measure of\nactivity and of enjoyment.\nI thus express the law as it is read from the platform of ordinary\nlife, but must not leave it without noticing the capital exception. For\ntemperament is a power which no man willingly hears any one praise but\nhimself. On the platform of physics we cannot resist the contracting\ninfluences of so-called science. Temperament puts all divinity to rout.\nI know the mental proclivity of physicians. I hear the chuckle of the\nphrenologists. Theoretic kidnappers and slave-drivers, they esteem each\nman the victim of another, who winds him round his finger by knowing the\nlaw of his being; and by such cheap signboards as the color of his beard\nor the slope of his occiput, reads the inventory of his fortunes and\ncharacter. The grossest ignorance does not disgust like this impudent\nknowingness. The physicians say they are not materialists; but they\nare:--Spirit is matter reduced to an extreme thinness: O so thin!--But\nthe definition of spiritual should be, that which is its own evidence.\nWhat notions do they attach to love! what to religion! One would not\nwillingly pronounce these words in their hearing, and give them the\noccasion to profane them. I saw a gracious gentleman who adapts his\nconversation to the form of the head of the man he talks with! I had\nfancied that the value of life lay in its inscrutable possibilities; in\nthe fact that I never know, in addressing myself to a new individual,\nwhat may befall me. I carry the keys of my castle in my hand, ready to\nthrow them at the feet of my lord, whenever and in what disguise\nsoever he shall appear. I know he is in the neighborhood hidden among\nvagabonds. Shall I preclude my future by taking a high seat and kindly\nadapting my conversation to the shape of heads? When I come to that, the\ndoctors shall buy me for a cent.--'But, sir, medical history; the report\nto the Institute; the proven facts!'--I distrust the facts and\nthe inferences. Temperament is the veto or limitation-power in the\nconstitution, very justly applied to restrain an opposite excess in the\nconstitution, but absurdly offered as a bar to original equity. When\nvirtue is in presence, all subordinate powers sleep. On its own level,\nor in view of nature, temperament is final. I see not, if one be once\ncaught in this trap of so-called sciences, any escape for the man from\nthe links of the chain of physical necessity. Given such an embryo,\nsuch a history must follow. On this platform one lives in a sty of\nsensualism, and would soon come to suicide. But it is impossible that\nthe creative power should exclude itself. Into every intelligence there\nis a door which is never closed, through which the creator passes. The\nintellect, seeker of absolute truth, or the heart, lover of absolute\ngood, intervenes for our succor, and at one whisper of these high powers\nwe awake from ineffectual struggles with this nightmare. We hurl it into\nits own hell, and cannot again contract ourselves to so base a state.\nThe secret of the illusoriness is in the necessity of a succession\nof moods or objects. Gladly we would anchor, but the anchorage is\nquicksand. This onward trick of nature is too strong for us: Pero si\nmuove. When at night I look at the moon and stars, I seem stationary,\nand they to hurry. Our love of the real draws us to permanence, but\nhealth of body consists in circulation, and sanity of mind in variety\nor facility of association. We need change of objects. Dedication to\none thought is quickly odious. We house with the insane, and must humor\nthem; then conversation dies out. Once I took such delight in Montaigne,\nthat I thought I should not need any other book; before that, in\nShakspeare; then in Plutarch; then in Plotinus; at one time in Bacon;\nafterwards in Goethe; even in Bettine; but now I turn the pages of\neither of them languidly, whilst I still cherish their genius. So with\npictures; each will bear an emphasis of attention once, which it cannot\nretain, though we fain would continue to be pleased in that manner. How\nstrongly I have felt of pictures that when you have seen one well, you\nmust take your leave of it; you shall never see it again. I have had\ngood lessons from pictures which I have since seen without emotion or\nremark. A deduction must be made from the opinion which even the wise\nexpress of a new book or occurrence. Their opinion gives me tidings of\ntheir mood, and some vague guess at the new fact, but is nowise to be\ntrusted as the lasting relation between that intellect and that thing.\nThe child asks, 'Mamma, why don't I like the story as well as when\nyou told it me yesterday?' Alas! child it is even so with the oldest\ncherubim of knowledge. But will it answer thy question to say, Because\nthou wert born to a whole and this story is a particular? The reason\nof the pain this discovery causes us (and we make it late in respect to\nworks of art and intellect), is the plaint of tragedy which murmurs from\nit in regard to persons, to friendship and love.\nThat immobility and absence of elasticity which we find in the arts,\nwe find with more pain in the artist. There is no power of expansion in\nmen. Our friends early appear to us as representatives of certain ideas\nwhich they never pass or exceed. They stand on the brink of the ocean of\nthought and power, but they never take the single step that would bring\nthem there. A man is like a bit of Labrador spar, which has no lustre as\nyou turn it in your hand until you come to a particular angle; then it\nshows deep and beautiful colors. There is no adaptation or universal\napplicability in men, but each has his special talent, and the mastery\nof successful men consists in adroitly keeping themselves where and when\nthat turn shall be oftenest to be practised. We do what we must, and\ncall it by the best names we can, and would fain have the praise of\nhaving intended the result which ensues. I cannot recall any form of man\nwho is not superfluous sometimes. But is not this pitiful? Life is not\nworth the taking, to do tricks in.\nOf course it needs the whole society to give the symmetry we seek. The\nparty-colored wheel must revolve very fast to appear white. Something is\nearned too by conversing with so much folly and defect. In fine, whoever\nloses, we are always of the gaining party. Divinity is behind our\nfailures and follies also. The plays of children are nonsense, but very\neducative nonsense. So it is with the largest and solemnest things, with\ncommerce, government, church, marriage, and so with the history of every\nman's bread, and the ways by which he is to come by it. Like a bird\nwhich alights nowhere, but hops perpetually from bough to bough, is the\nPower which abides in no man and in no woman, but for a moment speaks\nfrom this one, and for another moment from that one.\nBut what help from these fineries or pedantries? What help from thought?\nLife is not dialectics. We, I think, in these times, have had lessons\nenough of the futility of criticism. Our young people have thought and\nwritten much on labor and reform, and for all that they have written,\nneither the world nor themselves have got on a step. Intellectual\ntasting of life will not supersede muscular activity. If a man should\nconsider the nicety of the passage of a piece of bread down his throat,\nhe would starve. At Education-Farm, the noblest theory of life sat\non the noblest figures of young men and maidens, quite powerless and\nmelancholy. It would not rake or pitch a ton of hay; it would not\nrub down a horse; and the men and maidens it left pale and hungry. A\npolitical orator wittily compared our party promises to western roads,\nwhich opened stately enough, with planted trees on either side to\ntempt the traveller, but soon became narrow and narrower and ended in\na squirrel-track and ran up a tree. So does culture with us; it ends in\nheadache. Unspeakably sad and barren does life look to those who a few\nmonths ago were dazzled with the splendor of the promise of the times.\n\"There is now no longer any right course of action nor any self-devotion\nleft among the Iranis.\" Objections and criticism we have had our fill\nof. There are objections to every course of life and action, and the\npractical wisdom infers an indifferency, from the omnipresence of\nobjection. The whole frame of things preaches indifferency. Do not craze\nyourself with thinking, but go about your business anywhere. Life is not\nintellectual or critical, but sturdy. Its chief good is for well-mixed\npeople who can enjoy what they find, without question. Nature hates\npeeping, and our mothers speak her very sense when they say, \"Children,\neat your victuals, and say no more of it.\" To fill the hour,--that is\nhappiness; to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an\napproval. We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to skate\nwell on them. Under the oldest mouldiest conventions a man of native\nforce prospers just as well as in the newest world, and that by skill\nof handling and treatment. He can take hold anywhere. Life itself is a\nmixture of power and form, and will not bear the least excess of either.\nTo finish the moment, to find the journey's end in every step of the\nroad, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom. It is not\nthe part of men, but of fanatics, or of mathematicians if you will,\nto say that the shortness of life considered, it is not worth caring\nwhether for so short a duration we were sprawling in want or sitting\nhigh. Since our office is with moments, let us husband them. Five\nminutes of today are worth as much to me as five minutes in the next\nmillennium. Let us be poised, and wise, and our own, today. Let us treat\nthe men and women well; treat them as if they were real; perhaps they\nare. Men live in their fancy, like drunkards whose hands are too soft\nand tremulous for successful labor. It is a tempest of fancies, and the\nonly ballast I know is a respect to the present hour. Without any shadow\nof doubt, amidst this vertigo of shows and politics, I settle myself\never the firmer in the creed that we should not postpone and refer and\nwish, but do broad justice where we are, by whomsoever we deal with,\naccepting our actual companions and circumstances, however humble or\nodious as the mystic officials to whom the universe has delegated\nits whole pleasure for us. If these are mean and malignant, their\ncontentment, which is the last victory of justice, is a more satisfying\necho to the heart than the voice of poets and the casual sympathy of\nadmirable persons. I think that however a thoughtful man may suffer\nfrom the defects and absurdities of his company, he cannot without\naffectation deny to any set of men and women a sensibility to\nextraordinary merit. The coarse and frivolous have an instinct of\nsuperiority, if they have not a sympathy, and honor it in their blind\ncapricious way with sincere homage.\nThe fine young people despise life, but in me, and in such as with me\nare free from dyspepsia, and to whom a day is a sound and solid good, it\nis a great excess of politeness to look scornful and to cry for company.\nI am grown by sympathy a little eager and sentimental, but leave me\nalone and I should relish every hour and what it brought me, the potluck\nof the day, as heartily as the oldest gossip in the bar-room. I am\nthankful for small mercies. I compared notes with one of my friends who\nexpects everything of the universe and is disappointed when anything\nis less than the best, and I found that I begin at the other extreme,\nexpecting nothing, and am always full of thanks for moderate goods. I\naccept the clangor and jangle of contrary tendencies. I find my account\nin sots and bores also. They give a reality to the circumjacent picture\nwhich such a vanishing meteorous appearance can ill spare. In the\nmorning I awake and find the old world, wife, babes, and mother, Concord\nand Boston, the dear old spiritual world and even the dear old devil not\nfar off. If we will take the good we find, asking no questions, we\nshall have heaping measures. The great gifts are not got by analysis.\nEverything good is on the highway. The middle region of our being is\nthe temperate zone. We may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure\ngeometry and lifeless science, or sink into that of sensation. Between\nthese extremes is the equator of life, of thought, of spirit, of\npoetry,--a narrow belt. Moreover, in popular experience everything\ngood is on the highway. A collector peeps into all the picture-shops of\nEurope for a landscape of Poussin, a crayon-sketch of Salvator; but the\nTransfiguration, the Last Judgment, the Communion of St. Jerome, and\nwhat are as transcendent as these, are on the walls of the Vatican, the\nUffizii, or the Louvre, where every footman may see them; to say nothing\nof Nature's pictures in every street, of sunsets and sunrises every day,\nand the sculpture of the human body never absent. A collector recently\nbought at public auction, in London, for one hundred and fifty-seven\nguineas, an autograph of Shakspeare; but for nothing a school-boy\ncan read Hamlet and can detect secrets of highest concernment yet\nunpublished therein. I think I will never read any but the commonest\nbooks,--the Bible, Homer, Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton. Then we are\nimpatient of so public a life and planet, and run hither and thither for\nnooks and secrets. The imagination delights in the woodcraft of Indians,\ntrappers, and bee-hunters. We fancy that we are strangers, and not so\nintimately domesticated in the planet as the wild man and the wild beast\nand bird. But the exclusion reaches them also; reaches the climbing,\nflying, gliding, feathered and four-footed man. Fox and woodchuck, hawk\nand snipe and bittern, when nearly seen, have no more root in the deep\nworld than man, and are just such superficial tenants of the globe. Then\nthe new molecular philosophy shows astronomical interspaces betwixt atom\nand atom, shows that the world is all outside; it has no inside.\nThe mid-world is best. Nature, as we know her, is no saint. The lights\nof the church, the ascetics, Gentoos, and corn-eaters, she does not\ndistinguish by any favor. She comes eating and drinking and sinning. Her\ndarlings, the great, the strong, the beautiful, are not children of our\nlaw; do not come out of the Sunday School, nor weigh their food, nor\npunctually keep the commandments. If we will be strong with her strength\nwe must not harbor such disconsolate consciences, borrowed too from the\nconsciences of other nations. We must set up the strong present tense\nagainst all the rumors of wrath, past or to come. So many things are\nunsettled which it is of the first importance to settle;--and, pending\ntheir settlement, we will do as we do. Whilst the debate goes forward on\nthe equity of commerce, and will not be closed for a century or two,\nNew and Old England may keep shop. Law of copyright and international\ncopyright is to be discussed, and in the interim we will sell our books\nfor the most we can. Expediency of literature, reason of literature,\nlawfulness of writing down a thought, is questioned; much is to say on\nboth sides, and, while the fight waxes hot, thou, dearest scholar, stick\nto thy foolish task, add a line every hour, and between whiles add\na line. Right to hold land, right of property, is disputed, and the\nconventions convene, and before the vote is taken, dig away in your\ngarden, and spend your earnings as a waif or godsend to all serene and\nbeautiful purposes. Life itself is a bubble and a skepticism, and a\nsleep within a sleep. Grant it, and as much more as they will,--but\nthou, God's darling! heed thy private dream; thou wilt not be missed in\nthe scorning and skepticism; there are enough of them; stay there in\nthy closet and toil until the rest are agreed what to do about it. Thy\nsickness, they say, and thy puny habit require that thou do this or\navoid that, but know that thy life is a flitting state, a tent for a\nnight, and do thou, sick or well, finish that stint. Thou art sick, but\nshalt not be worse, and the universe, which holds thee dear, shall be\nthe better.\nHuman life is made up of the two elements, power and form, and the\nproportion must be invariably kept if we would have it sweet and sound.\nEach of these elements in excess makes a mischief as hurtful as its\ndefect. Everything runs to excess; every good quality is noxious if\nunmixed, and, to carry the danger to the edge of ruin, nature causes\neach man's peculiarity to superabound. Here, among the farms, we adduce\nthe scholars as examples of this treachery. They are nature's victims of\nexpression. You who see the artist, the orator, the poet, too near, and\nfind their life no more excellent than that of mechanics or farmers, and\nthemselves victims of partiality, very hollow and haggard, and pronounce\nthem failures, not heroes, but quacks,--conclude very reasonably that\nthese arts are not for man, but are disease. Yet nature will not bear\nyou out. Irresistible nature made men such, and makes legions more\nof such, every day. You love the boy reading in a book, gazing at a\ndrawing, or a cast; yet what are these millions who read and behold, but\nincipient writers and sculptors? Add a little more of that quality which\nnow reads and sees, and they will seize the pen and chisel. And if one\nremembers how innocently he began to be an artist, he perceives that\nnature joined with his enemy. A man is a golden impossibility. The line\nhe must walk is a hair's breadth. The wise through excess of wisdom is\nmade a fool.\nHow easily, if fate would suffer it, we might keep forever these\nbeautiful limits, and adjust ourselves, once for all, to the perfect\ncalculation of the kingdom of known cause and effect. In the street\nand in the newspapers, life appears so plain a business that manly\nresolution and adherence to the multiplication-table through all\nweathers will insure success. But ah! presently comes a day, or is\nit only a half-hour, with its angel-whispering,--which discomfits the\nconclusions of nations and of years! Tomorrow again everything looks\nreal and angular, the habitual standards are reinstated, common sense is\nas rare as genius,--is the basis of genius, and experience is hands and\nfeet to every enterprise;--and yet, he who should do his business on\nthis understanding would be quickly bankrupt. Power keeps quite another\nroad than the turnpikes of choice and will; namely the subterranean and\ninvisible tunnels and channels of life. It is ridiculous that we are\ndiplomatists, and doctors, and considerate people: there are no dupes\nlike these. Life is a series of surprises, and would not be worth taking\nor keeping if it were not. God delights to isolate us every day, and\nhide from us the past and the future. We would look about us, but with\ngrand politeness he draws down before us an impenetrable screen\nof purest sky, and another behind us of purest sky. 'You will not\nremember,' he seems to say, `and you will not expect.' All good\nconversation, manners, and action, come from a spontaneity which forgets\nusages and makes the moment great. Nature hates calculators; her methods\nare saltatory and impulsive. Man lives by pulses; our organic movements\nare such; and the chemical and ethereal agents are undulatory and\nalternate; and the mind goes antagonizing on, and never prospers but by\nfits. We thrive by casualties. Our chief experiences have been casual.\nThe most attractive class of people are those who are powerful obliquely\nand not by the direct stroke; men of genius, but not yet accredited; one\ngets the cheer of their light without paying too great a tax. Theirs\nis the beauty of the bird or the morning light, and not of art. In the\nthought of genius there is always a surprise; and the moral sentiment is\nwell called \"the newness,\" for it is never other; as new to the oldest\nintelligence as to the young child;--\"the kingdom that cometh without\nobservation.\" In like manner, for practical success, there must not be\ntoo much design. A man will not be observed in doing that which he\ncan do best. There is a certain magic about his properest action which\nstupefies your powers of observation, so that though it is done before\nyou, you wist not of it. The art of life has a pudency, and will not\nbe exposed. Every man is an impossibility until he is born; every thing\nimpossible until we see a success. The ardors of piety agree at last\nwith the coldest skepticism,--that nothing is of us or our works,--that\nall is of God. Nature will not spare us the smallest leaf of laurel.\nAll writing comes by the grace of God, and all doing and having. I would\ngladly be moral and keep due metes and bounds, which I dearly love, and\nallow the most to the will of man; but I have set my heart on honesty in\nthis chapter, and I can see nothing at last, in success or failure, than\nmore or less of vital force supplied from the Eternal. The results of\nlife are uncalculated and uncalculable. The years teach much which the\ndays never know. The persons who compose our company, converse, and come\nand go, and design and execute many things, and somewhat comes of it\nall, but an unlooked-for result. The individual is always mistaken.\nHe designed many things, and drew in other persons as coadjutors,\nquarrelled with some or all, blundered much, and something is done; all\nare a little advanced, but the individual is always mistaken. It turns\nout somewhat new and very unlike what he promised himself.\nThe ancients, struck with this irreducibleness of the elements of human\nlife to calculation, exalted Chance into a divinity; but that is to\nstay too long at the spark, which glitters truly at one point, but the\nuniverse is warm with the latency of the same fire. The miracle of life\nwhich will not be expounded but will remain a miracle, introduces a new\nelement. In the growth of the embryo, Sir Everard Home I think noticed\nthat the evolution was not from one central point, but coactive from\nthree or more points. Life has no memory. That which proceeds in\nsuccession might be remembered, but that which is coexistent, or\nejaculated from a deeper cause, as yet far from being conscious, knows\nnot its own tendency. So is it with us, now skeptical or without unity,\nbecause immersed in forms and effects all seeming to be of equal yet\nhostile value, and now religious, whilst in the reception of spiritual\nlaw. Bear with these distractions, with this coetaneous growth of the\nparts; they will one day be members, and obey one will. On that one\nwill, on that secret cause, they nail our attention and hope. Life\nis hereby melted into an expectation or a religion. Underneath the\ninharmonious and trivial particulars, is a musical perfection; the\nIdeal journeying always with us, the heaven without rent or seam. Do but\nobserve the mode of our illumination. When I converse with a profound\nmind, or if at any time being alone I have good thoughts, I do not at\nonce arrive at satisfactions, as when, being thirsty, I drink water;\nor go to the fire, being cold; no! but I am at first apprised of my\nvicinity to a new and excellent region of life. By persisting to read\nor to think, this region gives further sign of itself, as it were in\nflashes of light, in sudden discoveries of its profound beauty and\nrepose, as if the clouds that covered it parted at intervals and showed\nthe approaching traveller the inland mountains, with the tranquil\neternal meadows spread at their base, whereon flocks graze and shepherds\npipe and dance. But every insight from this realm of thought is felt as\ninitial, and promises a sequel. I do not make it; I arrive there,\nand behold what was there already. I make! O no! I clap my hands in\ninfantine joy and amazement before the first opening to me of this\naugust magnificence, old with the love and homage of innumerable ages,\nyoung with the life of life, the sunbright Mecca of the desert. And what\na future it opens! I feel a new heart beating with the love of the new\nbeauty. I am ready to die out of nature and be born again into this new\nyet unapproachable America I have found in the West:--\n\"Since neither now nor yesterday began\nThese thoughts, which have been ever, nor yet can\nA man be found who their first entrance knew.\"\nIf I have described life as a flux of moods, I must now add that there\nis that in us which changes not and which ranks all sensations and\nstates of mind. The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which\nidentifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the flesh of his\nbody; life above life, in infinite degrees. The sentiment from which it\nsprung determines the dignity of any deed, and the question ever is, not\nwhat you have done or forborne, but at whose command you have done or\nforborne it.\nFortune, Minerva, Muse, Holy Ghost,--these are quaint names, too narrow\nto cover this unbounded substance. The baffled intellect must still\nkneel before this cause, which refuses to be named,--ineffable cause,\nwhich every fine genius has essayed to represent by some emphatic\nsymbol, as, Thales by water, Anaximenes by air, Anaxagoras by (Nous)\nthought, Zoroaster by fire, Jesus and the moderns by love; and the\nmetaphor of each has become a national religion. The Chinese Mencius has\nnot been the least successful in his generalization. \"I fully understand\nlanguage,\" he said, \"and nourish well my vast-flowing vigor.\"--\"I beg\nto ask what you call vast-flowing vigor?\"--said his companion. \"The\nexplanation,\" replied Mencius, \"is difficult. This vigor is supremely\ngreat, and in the highest degree unbending. Nourish it correctly and do\nit no injury, and it will fill up the vacancy between heaven and earth.\nThis vigor accords with and assists justice and reason, and leaves no\nhunger.\"--In our more correct writing we give to this generalization the\nname of Being, and thereby confess that we have arrived as far as we can\ngo. Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we have not arrived at a\nwall, but at interminable oceans. Our life seems not present so much as\nprospective; not for the affairs on which it is wasted, but as a hint of\nthis vast-flowing vigor. Most of life seems to be mere advertisement of\nfaculty; information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap; that\nwe are very great. So, in particulars, our greatness is always in a\ntendency or direction, not in an action. It is for us to believe in the\nrule, not in the exception. The noble are thus known from the ignoble.\nSo in accepting the leading of the sentiments, it is not what we believe\nconcerning the immortality of the soul or the like, but the universal\nimpulse to believe, that is the material circumstance and is the\nprincipal fact in the history of the globe. Shall we describe this cause\nas that which works directly? The spirit is not helpless or needful\nof mediate organs. It has plentiful powers and direct effects. I am\nexplained without explaining, I am felt without acting, and where I am\nnot. Therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise.\nThey refuse to explain themselves, and are content that new actions\nshould do them that office. They believe that we communicate without\nspeech and above speech, and that no right action of ours is quite\nunaffecting to our friends, at whatever distance; for the influence of\naction is not to be measured by miles. Why should I fret myself because\na circumstance has occurred which hinders my presence where I was\nexpected? If I am not at the meeting, my presence where I am should be\nas useful to the commonwealth of friendship and wisdom, as would be my\npresence in that place. I exert the same quality of power in all places.\nThus journeys the mighty Ideal before us; it never was known to fall\ninto the rear. No man ever came to an experience which was satiating,\nbut his good is tidings of a better. Onward and onward! In liberated\nmoments we know that a new picture of life and duty is already possible;\nthe elements already exist in many minds around you of a doctrine of\nlife which shall transcend any written record we have. The new statement\nwill comprise the skepticisms as well as the faiths of society, and out\nof unbeliefs a creed shall be formed. For skepticisms are not gratuitous\nor lawless, but are limitations of the affirmative statement, and the\nnew philosophy must take them in and make affirmations outside of them,\njust as much as it must include the oldest beliefs.\nIt is very unhappy, but too late to be helped, the discovery we have\nmade that we exist. That discovery is called the Fall of Man. Ever\nafterwards we suspect our instruments. We have learned that we do not\nsee directly, but mediately, and that we have no means of correcting\nthese colored and distorting lenses which we are, or of computing the\namount of their errors. Perhaps these subject-lenses have a creative\npower; perhaps there are no objects. Once we lived in what we saw;\nnow, the rapaciousness of this new power, which threatens to absorb all\nthings, engages us. Nature, art, persons, letters, religions, objects,\nsuccessively tumble in, and God is but one of its ideas. Nature and\nliterature are subjective phenomena; every evil and every good thing is\na shadow which we cast. The street is full of humiliations to the proud.\nAs the fop contrived to dress his bailiffs in his livery and make them\nwait on his guests at table, so the chagrins which the bad heart gives\noff as bubbles, at once take form as ladies and gentlemen in the street,\nshopmen or bar-keepers in hotels, and threaten or insult whatever is\nthreatenable and insultable in us. 'Tis the same with our idolatries.\nPeople forget that it is the eye which makes the horizon, and\nthe rounding mind's eye which makes this or that man a type or\nrepresentative of humanity, with the name of hero or saint. Jesus, the\n\"providential man,\" is a good man on whom many people are agreed\nthat these optical laws shall take effect. By love on one part and\nby forbearance to press objection on the other part, it is for a time\nsettled, that we will look at him in the centre of the horizon, and\nascribe to him the properties that will attach to any man so seen. But\nthe longest love or aversion has a speedy term. The great and crescive\nself, rooted in absolute nature, supplants all relative existence and\nruins the kingdom of mortal friendship and love. Marriage (in what is\ncalled the spiritual world) is impossible, because of the inequality\nbetween every subject and every object. The subject is the receiver of\nGodhead, and at every comparison must feel his being enhanced by that\ncryptic might. Though not in energy, yet by presence, this magazine of\nsubstance cannot be otherwise than felt; nor can any force of intellect\nattribute to the object the proper deity which sleeps or wakes forever\nin every subject. Never can love make consciousness and ascription\nequal in force. There will be the same gulf between every me and thee as\nbetween the original and the picture. The universe is the bride of the\nsoul. All private sympathy is partial. Two human beings are like globes,\nwhich can touch only in a point, and whilst they remain in contact,\nall other points of each of the spheres are inert; their turn must\nalso come, and the longer a particular union lasts the more energy of\nappetency the parts not in union acquire.\nLife will be imaged, but cannot be divided nor doubled. Any invasion\nof its unity would be chaos. The soul is not twin-born but the only\nbegotten, and though revealing itself as child in time, child in\nappearance, is of a fatal and universal power, admitting no co-life.\nEvery day, every act betrays the ill-concealed deity. We believe in\nourselves as we do not believe in others. We permit all things to\nourselves, and that which we call sin in others is experiment for us. It\nis an instance of our faith in ourselves that men never speak of crime\nas lightly as they think; or every man thinks a latitude safe for\nhimself which is nowise to be indulged to another. The act looks very\ndifferently on the inside and on the outside; in its quality and in its\nconsequences. Murder in the murderer is no such ruinous thought as poets\nand romancers will have it; it does not unsettle him or fright him\nfrom his ordinary notice of trifles; it is an act quite easy to be\ncontemplated; but in its sequel it turns out to be a horrible jangle\nand confounding of all relations. Especially the crimes that spring from\nlove seem right and fair from the actor's point of view, but when acted\nare found destructive of society. No man at last believes that he can be\nlost, nor that the crime in him is as black as in the felon. Because the\nintellect qualifies in our own case the moral judgments. For there is\nno crime to the intellect. That is antinomian or hypernomian, and judges\nlaw as well as fact. \"It is worse than a crime, it is a blunder,\" said\nNapoleon, speaking the language of the intellect. To it, the world is\na problem in mathematics or the science of quantity, and it leaves out\npraise and blame and all weak emotions. All stealing is comparative. If\nyou come to absolutes, pray who does not steal? Saints are sad, because\nthey behold sin (even when they speculate), from the point of view of\nthe conscience, and not of the intellect; a confusion of thought.\nSin, seen from the thought, is a diminution, or less: seen from the\nconscience or will, it is pravity or bad. The intellect names it\nshade, absence of light, and no essence. The conscience must feel it as\nessence, essential evil. This it is not; it has an objective existence,\nbut no subjective.\nThus inevitably does the universe wear our color, and every object fall\nsuccessively into the subject itself. The subject exists, the subject\nenlarges; all things sooner or later fall into place. As I am, so I see;\nuse what language we will, we can never say anything but what we are;\nHermes, Cadmus, Columbus, Newton, Bonaparte, are the mind's ministers.\nInstead of feeling a poverty when we encounter a great man, let us treat\nthe new comer like a travelling geologist who passes through our estate\nand shows us good slate, or limestone, or anthracite, in our brush\npasture. The partial action of each strong mind in one direction is a\ntelescope for the objects on which it is pointed. But every other part\nof knowledge is to be pushed to the same extravagance, ere the soul\nattains her due sphericity. Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily\nher own tail? If you could look with her eyes you might see her\nsurrounded with hundreds of figures performing complex dramas, with\ntragic and comic issues, long conversations, many characters, many ups\nand downs of fate,--and meantime it is only puss and her tail. How long\nbefore our masquerade will end its noise of tambourines, laughter, and\nshouting, and we shall find it was a solitary performance? A subject and\nan object,--it takes so much to make the galvanic circuit complete, but\nmagnitude adds nothing. What imports it whether it is Kepler and the\nsphere, Columbus and America, a reader and his book, or puss with her\ntail?\nIt is true that all the muses and love and religion hate these\ndevelopments, and will find a way to punish the chemist who publishes in\nthe parlor the secrets of the laboratory. And we cannot say too little\nof our constitutional necessity of seeing things under private aspects,\nor saturated with our humors. And yet is the God the native of these\nbleak rocks. That need makes in morals the capital virtue of self-trust.\nWe must hold hard to this poverty, however scandalous, and by more\nvigorous self-recoveries, after the sallies of action, possess our axis\nmore firmly. The life of truth is cold and so far mournful; but it\nis not the slave of tears, contritions and perturbations. It does not\nattempt another's work, nor adopt another's facts. It is a main lesson\nof wisdom to know your own from another's. I have learned that I cannot\ndispose of other people's facts; but I possess such a key to my own as\npersuades me, against all their denials, that they also have a key to\ntheirs. A sympathetic person is placed in the dilemma of a swimmer among\ndrowning men, who all catch at him, and if he give so much as a leg or a\nfinger they will drown him. They wish to be saved from the mischiefs of\ntheir vices, but not from their vices. Charity would be wasted on this\npoor waiting on the symptoms. A wise and hardy physician will say, Come\nout of that, as the first condition of advice.\nIn this our talking America we are ruined by our good nature and\nlistening on all sides. This compliance takes away the power of being\ngreatly useful. A man should not be able to look other than directly\nand forthright. A preoccupied attention is the only answer to the\nimportunate frivolity of other people; an attention, and to an aim which\nmakes their wants frivolous. This is a divine answer, and leaves no\nappeal and no hard thoughts. In Flaxman's drawing of the Eumenides of\nAeschylus, Orestes supplicates Apollo, whilst the Furies sleep on\nthe threshold. The face of the god expresses a shade of regret and\ncompassion, but is calm with the conviction of the irreconcilableness\nof the two spheres. He is born into other politics, into the eternal and\nbeautiful. The man at his feet asks for his interest in turmoils of the\nearth, into which his nature cannot enter. And the Eumenides there\nlying express pictorially this disparity. The god is surcharged with his\ndivine destiny.\nIllusion, Temperament, Succession, Surface, Surprise, Reality,\nSubjectiveness,--these are threads on the loom of time, these are the\nlords of life. I dare not assume to give their order, but I name them as\nI find them in my way. I know better than to claim any completeness for\nmy picture. I am a fragment, and this is a fragment of me. I can very\nconfidently announce one or another law, which throws itself into relief\nand form, but I am too young yet by some ages to compile a code. I\ngossip for my hour concerning the eternal politics. I have seen many\nfair pictures not in vain. A wonderful time I have lived in. I am not\nthe novice I was fourteen, nor yet seven years ago. Let who will\nask Where is the fruit? I find a private fruit sufficient. This is\na fruit,--that I should not ask for a rash effect from meditations,\ncounsels and the hiving of truths. I should feel it pitiful to demand a\nresult on this town and county, an overt effect on the instant month and\nyear. The effect is deep and secular as the cause. It works on periods\nin which mortal lifetime is lost. All I know is reception; I am and I\nhave: but I do not get, and when I have fancied I had gotten anything,\nI found I did not. I worship with wonder the great Fortune. My reception\nhas been so large, that I am not annoyed by receiving this or that\nsuperabundantly. I say to the Genius, if he will pardon the proverb,\nIn for a mill, in for a million. When I receive a new gift, I do not\nmacerate my body to make the account square, for if I should die I could\nnot make the account square. The benefit overran the merit the first\nday, and has overrun the merit ever since. The merit itself, so-called,\nI reckon part of the receiving.\nAlso that hankering after an overt or practical effect seems to me an\napostasy. In good earnest I am willing to spare this most unnecessary\ndeal of doing. Life wears to me a visionary face. Hardest roughest\naction is visionary also. It is but a choice between soft and turbulent\ndreams. People disparage knowing and the intellectual life, and urge\ndoing. I am very content with knowing, if only I could know. That is\nan august entertainment, and would suffice me a great while. To know a\nlittle would be worth the expense of this world. I hear always the law\nof Adrastia, \"that every soul which had acquired any truth, should be\nsafe from harm until another period.\"\nI know that the world I converse with in the city and in the farms, is\nnot the world I think. I observe that difference, and shall observe it.\nOne day I shall know the value and law of this discrepance. But I have\nnot found that much was gained by manipular attempts to realize the\nworld of thought. Many eager persons successively make an experiment\nin this way, and make themselves ridiculous. They acquire democratic\nmanners, they foam at the mouth, they hate and deny. Worse, I observe\nthat in the history of mankind there is never a solitary example of\nsuccess,--taking their own tests of success. I say this polemically, or\nin reply to the inquiry, Why not realize your world? But far be from me\nthe despair which prejudges the law by a paltry empiricism;--since there\nnever was a right endeavor but it succeeded. Patience and patience, we\nshall win at the last. We must be very suspicious of the deceptions of\nthe element of time. It takes a good deal of time to eat or to sleep,\nor to earn a hundred dollars, and a very little time to entertain a hope\nand an insight which becomes the light of our life. We dress our garden,\neat our dinners, discuss the household with our wives, and these things\nmake no impression, are forgotten next week; but, in the solitude to\nwhich every man is always returning, he has a sanity and revelations\nwhich in his passage into new worlds he will carry with him. Never mind\nthe ridicule, never mind the defeat; up again, old heart!--it seems to\nsay,--there is victory yet for all justice; and the true romance which\nthe world exists to realize will be the transformation of genius into\npractical power.\n*****\nCHARACTER.\nThe sun set; but set not his hope:\nStars rose; his faith was earlier up:\nFixed on the enormous galaxy,\nDeeper and older seemed his eye:\nAnd matched his sufferance sublime\nThe taciturnity of time.\nHe spoke, and words more soft than rain\nBrought the Age of Gold again:\nHis action won such reverence sweet,\nAs hid all measure of the feat.\nWork of his hand\nHe nor commends nor grieves\nPleads for itself the fact;\nAs unrepenting Nature leaves\nHer every act.\nIII. CHARACTER.\nI HAVE read that those who listened to Lord Chatham felt that there was\nsomething finer in the man than any thing which he said. It has been\ncomplained of our brilliant English historian of the French Revolution\nthat when he has told all his facts about Mirabeau, they do not justify\nhis estimate of his genius. The Gracchi, Agis, Cleomenes, and others of\nPlutarch's heroes, do not in the record of facts equal their own fame.\nSir Philip Sidney, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh, are men of\ngreat figure and of few deeds. We cannot find the smallest part of the\npersonal weight of Washington in the narrative of his exploits. The\nauthority of the name of Schiller is too great for his books. This\ninequality of the reputation to the works or the anecdotes is not\naccounted for by saying that the reverberation is longer than the\nthunder-clap, but somewhat resided in these men which begot an\nexpectation that outran all their performance. The largest part of their\npower was latent. This is that which we call Character,--a reserved\nforce which acts directly by presence, and without means. It is\nconceived of as a certain undemonstrable force, a Familiar or Genius,\nby whose impulses the man is guided but whose counsels he cannot impart;\nwhich is company for him, so that such men are often solitary, or\nif they chance to be social, do not need society but can entertain\nthemselves very well alone. The purest literary talent appears at one\ntime great, at another time small, but character is of a stellar and\nundiminishable greatness. What others effect by talent or by eloquence,\nthis man accomplishes by some magnetism. \"Half his strength he put not\nforth.\" His victories are by demonstration of superiority, and not by\ncrossing of bayonets. He conquers because his arrival alters the face of\naffairs. \"O Iole! how did you know that Hercules was a god?\" \"Because,\"\nanswered Iole, \"I was content the moment my eyes fell on him. When I\nbeheld Theseus, I desired that I might see him offer battle, or at least\nguide his horses in the chariot-race; but Hercules did not wait for a\ncontest; he conquered whether he stood, or walked, or sat, or whatever\nthing he did.\" Man, ordinarily a pendant to events, only half attached,\nand that awkwardly, to the world he lives in, in these examples appears\nto share the life of things, and to be an expression of the same laws\nwhich control the tides and the sun, numbers and quantities.\nBut to use a more modest illustration and nearer home, I observe that in\nour political elections, where this element, if it appears at all,\ncan only occur in its coarsest form, we sufficiently understand\nits incomparable rate. The people know that they need in their\nrepresentative much more than talent, namely the power to make his\ntalent trusted. They cannot come at their ends by sending to Congress a\nlearned, acute, and fluent speaker, if he be not one who, before he was\nappointed by the people to represent them, was appointed by Almighty God\nto stand for a fact,--invincibly persuaded of that fact in himself,--so\nthat the most confident and the most violent persons learn that here is\nresistance on which both impudence and terror are wasted, namely faith\nin a fact. The men who carry their points do not need to inquire of\ntheir constituents what they should say, but are themselves the country\nwhich they represent; nowhere are its emotions or opinions so instant\nand true as in them; nowhere so pure from a selfish infusion. The\nconstituency at home hearkens to their words, watches the color of\ntheir cheek, and therein, as in a glass, dresses its own. Our public\nassemblies are pretty good tests of manly force. Our frank countrymen of\nthe west and south have a taste for character, and like to know whether\nthe New Englander is a substantial man, or whether the hand can pass\nthrough him.\nThe same motive force appears in trade. There are geniuses in trade,\nas well as in war, or the State, or letters; and the reason why this or\nthat man is fortunate is not to be told. It lies in the man; that is all\nanybody can tell you about it. See him and you will know as easily why\nhe succeeds, as, if you see Napoleon, you would comprehend his fortune.\nIn the new objects we recognize the old game, the Habit of fronting the\nfact, and not dealing with it at second hand, through the perceptions of\nsomebody else. Nature seems to authorize trade, as soon as you see the\nnatural merchant, who appears not so much a private agent as her factor\nand Minister of Commerce. His natural probity combines with his insight\ninto the fabric of society to put him above tricks, and he communicates\nto all his own faith that contracts are of no private interpretation.\nThe habit of his mind is a reference to standards of natural equity and\npublic advantage; and he inspires respect and the wish to deal with\nhim, both for the quiet spirit of honor which attends him, and for the\nintellectual pastime which the spectacle of so much ability affords.\nThis immensely stretched trade, which makes the capes of the Southern\nOcean his wharves, and the Atlantic Sea his familiar port, centres in\nhis brain only; and nobody in the universe can make his place good. In\nhis parlor I see very well that he has been at hard work this morning,\nwith that knitted brow and that settled humor, which all his desire to\nbe courteous cannot shake off. I see plainly how many firm acts have\nbeen done; how many valiant noes have this day been spoken, when others\nwould have uttered ruinous yeas. I see, with the pride of art and\nskill of masterly arithmetic and power of remote combination, the\nconsciousness of being an agent and playfellow of the original laws of\nthe world. He too believes that none can supply him, and that a man must\nbe born to trade or he cannot learn it.\nThis virtue draws the mind more when it appears in action to ends not\nso mixed. It works with most energy in the smallest companies and in\nprivate relations. In all cases it is an extraordinary and incomputable\nagent. The excess of physical strength is paralyzed by it. Higher\nnatures overpower lower ones by affecting them with a certain sleep. The\nfaculties are locked up, and offer no resistance. Perhaps that is the\nuniversal law. When the high cannot bring up the low to itself, it\nbenumbs it, as man charms down the resistance of the lower animals. Men\nexert on each other a similar occult power. How often has the influence\nof a true master realized all the tales of magic! A river of command\nseemed to run down from his eyes into all those who beheld him, a\ntorrent of strong sad light, like an Ohio or Danube, which pervaded them\nwith his thoughts and colored all events with the hue of his mind. \"What\nmeans did you employ?\" was the question asked of the wife of Concini,\nin regard to her treatment of Mary of Medici; and the answer was, \"Only\nthat influence which every strong mind has over a weak one.\" Cannot\nCaesar in irons shuffle off the irons and transfer them to the person\nof Hippo or Thraso the turnkey? Is an iron handcuff so immutable a bond?\nSuppose a slaver on the coast of Guinea should take on board a gang\nof negroes which should contain persons of the stamp of Toussaint\nL'Ouverture: or, let us fancy, under these swarthy masks he has a gang\nof Washingtons in chains. When they arrive at Cuba, will the relative\norder of the ship's company be the same? Is there nothing but rope and\niron? Is there no love, no reverence? Is there never a glimpse of right\nin a poor slave-captain's mind; and cannot these be supposed available\nto break or elude or in any manner overmatch the tension of an inch or\ntwo of iron ring?\nThis is a natural power, like light and heat, and all nature cooperates\nwith it. The reason why we feel one man's presence and do not feel\nanother's is as simple as gravity. Truth is the summit of being; justice\nis the application of it to affairs. All individual natures stand in a\nscale, according to the purity of this element in them. The will of the\npure runs down from them into other natures as water runs down from\na higher into a lower vessel. This natural force is no more to be\nwithstood than any other natural force. We can drive a stone upward for\na moment into the air, but it is yet true that all stones will forever\nfall; and whatever instances can be quoted of unpunished theft, or of\na lie which somebody credited, justice must prevail, and it is the\nprivilege of truth to make itself believed. Character is this moral\norder seen through the medium of an individual nature. An individual is\nan encloser. Time and space, liberty and necessity, truth and thought,\nare left at large no longer. Now, the universe is a close or pound. All\nthings exist in the man tinged with the manners of his soul. With what\nquality is in him he infuses all nature that he can reach; nor does he\ntend to lose himself in vastness, but, at how long a curve soever, all\nhis regards return into his own good at last. He animates all he can,\nand he sees only what he animates. He encloses the world, as the patriot\ndoes his country, as a material basis for his character, and a theatre\nfor action. A healthy soul stands united with the Just and the True,\nas the magnet arranges itself with the pole; so that he stands to all\nbeholders like a transparent object betwixt them and the sun, and whoso\njourneys towards the sun, journeys towards that person. He is thus the\nmedium of the highest influence to all who are not on the same level.\nThus, men of character are the conscience of the society to which they\nbelong.\nThe natural measure of this power is the resistance of circumstances.\nImpure men consider life as it is reflected in opinions, events, and\npersons. They cannot see the action until it is done. Yet its moral\nelement preexisted in the actor, and its quality as right or wrong it\nwas easy to predict. Everything in nature is bipolar, or has a positive\nand negative pole. There is a male and a female, a spirit and a fact,\na north and a south. Spirit is the positive, the event is the negative.\nWill is the north, action the south pole. Character may be ranked as\nhaving its natural place in the north. It shares the magnetic currents\nof the system. The feeble souls are drawn to the south or negative\npole. They look at the profit or hurt of the action. They never behold a\nprinciple until it is lodged in a person. They do not wish to be lovely,\nbut to be loved. Men of character like to hear of their faults; the\nother class do not like to hear of faults; they worship events; secure\nto them a fact, a connection, a certain chain of circumstances, and they\nwill ask no more. The hero sees that the event is ancillary; it must\nfollow him. A given order of events has no power to secure to him the\nsatisfaction which the imagination attaches to it; the soul of goodness\nescapes from any set of circumstances; whilst prosperity belongs to a\ncertain mind, and will introduce that power and victory which is its\nnatural fruit, into any order of events. No change of circumstances\ncan repair a defect of character. We boast our emancipation from many\nsuperstitions; but if we have broken any idols it is through a transfer\nof the idolatry. What have I gained, that I no longer immolate a bull to\nJove or to Neptune, or a mouse to Hecate; that I do not tremble\nbefore the Eumenides, or the Catholic Purgatory, or the Calvinistic\nJudgment-day,--if I quake at opinion, the public opinion, as we call it;\nor at the threat of assault, or contumely, or bad neighbors, or poverty,\nor mutilation, or at the rumor of revolution, or of murder? If I quake,\nwhat matters it what I quake at? Our proper vice takes form in one or\nanother shape, according to the sex, age, or temperament of the\nperson, and, if we are capable of fear, will readily find terrors. The\ncovetousness or the malignity which saddens me when I ascribe it to\nsociety, is my own. I am always environed by myself. On the other part,\nrectitude is a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy but by\nserenity, which is joy fixed or habitual. It is disgraceful to fly to\nevents for confirmation of our truth and worth. The capitalist does not\nrun every hour to the broker to coin his advantages into current money\nof the realm; he is satisfied to read in the quotations of the market\nthat his stocks have risen. The same transport which the occurrence of\nthe best events in the best order would occasion me, I must learn to\ntaste purer in the perception that my position is every hour meliorated,\nand does already command those events I desire. That exultation is only\nto be checked by the foresight of an order of things so excellent as to\nthrow all our prosperities into the deepest shade.\nThe face which character wears to me is self-sufficingness. I revere the\nperson who is riches; so that I cannot think of him as alone, or poor,\nor exiled, or unhappy, or a client, but as perpetual patron, benefactor,\nand beatified man. Character is centrality, the impossibility of being\ndisplaced or overset. A man should give us a sense of mass. Society\nis frivolous, and shreds its day into scraps, its conversation into\nceremonies and escapes. But if I go to see an ingenious man I shall\nthink myself poorly entertained if he give me nimble pieces of\nbenevolence and etiquette; rather he shall stand stoutly in his place\nand let me apprehend if it were only his resistance; know that I have\nencountered a new and positive quality;--great refreshment for both of\nus. It is much that he does not accept the conventional opinions and\npractices. That nonconformity will remain a goad and remembrancer, and\nevery inquirer will have to dispose of him, in the first place. There is\nnothing real or useful that is not a seat of war. Our houses ring with\nlaughter and personal and critical gossip, but it helps little. But the\nuncivil, unavailable man, who is a problem and a threat to society, whom\nit cannot let pass in silence but must either worship or hate,--and\nto whom all parties feel related, both the leaders of opinion and the\nobscure and eccentric,--he helps; he puts America and Europe in the\nwrong, and destroys the skepticism which says, 'man is a doll, let us\neat and drink, 'tis the best we can do,' by illuminating the untried\nand unknown. Acquiescence in the establishment and appeal to the public,\nindicate infirm faith, heads which are not clear, and which must see a\nhouse built, before they can comprehend the plan of it. The wise man\nnot only leaves out of his thought the many, but leaves out the few.\nFountains, the self-moved, the absorbed, the commander because he is\ncommanded, the assured, the primary,--they are good; for these announce\nthe instant presence of supreme power.\nOur action should rest mathematically on our substance. In nature, there\nare no false valuations. A pound of water in the ocean-tempest has no\nmore gravity than in a midsummer pond. All things work exactly according\nto their quality and according to their quantity; attempt nothing they\ncannot do, except man only. He has pretension; he wishes and attempts\nthings beyond his force. I read in a book of English memoirs, \"Mr. Fox\n(afterwards Lord Holland) said, he must have the Treasury; he had served\nup to it, and would have it.\" Xenophon and his Ten Thousand were quite\nequal to what they attempted, and did it; so equal, that it was not\nsuspected to be a grand and inimitable exploit. Yet there stands that\nfact unrepeated, a high-water mark in military history. Many have\nattempted it since, and not been equal to it. It is only on reality that\nany power of action can be based. No institution will be better than the\ninstitutor. I knew an amiable and accomplished person who undertook a\npractical reform, yet I was never able to find in him the enterprise of\nlove he took in hand. He adopted it by ear and by the understanding from\nthe books he had been reading. All his action was tentative, a piece of\nthe city carried out into the fields, and was the city still, and no new\nfact, and could not inspire enthusiasm. Had there been something latent\nin the man, a terrible undemonstrated genius agitating and embarrassing\nhis demeanor, we had watched for its advent. It is not enough that the\nintellect should see the evils and their remedy. We shall still postpone\nour existence, nor take the ground to which we are entitled, whilst\nit is only a thought and not a spirit that incites us. We have not yet\nserved up to it.\nThese are properties of life, and another trait is the notice of\nincessant growth. Men should be intelligent and earnest. They must also\nmake us feel that they have a controlling happy future opening before\nthem, whose early twilights already kindle in the passing hour. The hero\nis misconceived and misreported; he cannot therefore wait to unravel any\nman's blunders; he is again on his road, adding new powers and honors to\nhis domain and new claims on your heart, which will bankrupt you if you\nhave loitered about the old things and have not kept your relation to\nhim by adding to your wealth. New actions are the only apologies\nand explanations of old ones which the noble can bear to offer or to\nreceive. If your friend has displeased you, you shall not sit down to\nconsider it, for he has already lost all memory of the passage, and\nhas doubled his power to serve you, and ere you can rise up again will\nburden you with blessings.\nWe have no pleasure in thinking of a benevolence that is only measured\nby its works. Love is inexhaustible, and if its estate is wasted, its\ngranary emptied, still cheers and enriches, and the man, though he\nsleep, seems to purify the air and his house to adorn the landscape and\nstrengthen the laws. People always recognize this difference. We know\nwho is benevolent, by quite other means than the amount of subscription\nto soup-societies. It is only low merits that can be enumerated.\nFear, when your friends say to you what you have done well, and say it\nthrough; but when they stand with uncertain timid looks of respect and\nhalf-dislike, and must suspend their judgment for years to come, you may\nbegin to hope. Those who live to the future must always appear selfish\nto those who live to the present. Therefore it was droll in the good\nRiemer, who has written memoirs of Goethe, to make out a list of his\ndonations and good deeds, as, so many hundred thalers given to Stilling,\nto Hegel, to Tischbein; a lucrative place found for Professor Voss,\na post under the Grand Duke for Herder, a pension for Meyer, two\nprofessors recommended to foreign universities; &c., &c. The longest\nlist of specifications of benefit would look very short. A man is a\npoor creature if he is to be measured so. For all these of course\nare exceptions, and the rule and hodiernal life of a good man is\nbenefaction. The true charity of Goethe is to be inferred from the\naccount he gave Dr. Eckermann of the way in which he had spent his\nfortune. \"Each bon-mot of mine has cost a purse of gold. Half a million\nof my own money, the fortune I inherited, my salary and the large income\nderived from my writings for fifty years back, have been expended to\ninstruct me in what I now know. I have besides seen,\" &c.\nI own it is but poor chat and gossip to go to enumerate traits of this\nsimple and rapid power, and we are painting the lightning with charcoal;\nbut in these long nights and vacations I like to console myself so.\nNothing but itself can copy it. A word warm from the heart enriches me.\nI surrender at discretion. How death-cold is literary genius before this\nfire of life! These are the touches that reanimate my heavy soul and\ngive it eyes to pierce the dark of nature. I find, where I thought\nmyself poor, there was I most rich. Thence comes a new intellectual\nexaltation, to be again rebuked by some new exhibition of character.\nStrange alternation of attraction and repulsion! Character repudiates\nintellect, yet excites it; and character passes into thought, is\npublished so, and then is ashamed before new flashes of moral worth.\nCharacter is nature in the highest form. It is of no use to ape it or to\ncontend with it. Somewhat is possible of resistance, and of persistence,\nand of creation, to this power, which will foil all emulation.\nThis masterpiece is best where no hands but nature's have been laid on\nit. Care is taken that the greatly-destined shall slip up into life in\nthe shade, with no thousand-eyed Athens to watch and blazon every new\nthought, every blushing emotion of young genius. Two persons lately,\nvery young children of the most high God, have given me occasion for\nthought. When I explored the source of their sanctity and charm for the\nimagination, it seemed as if each answered, 'From my nonconformity; I\nnever listened to your people's law, or to what they call their gospel,\nand wasted my time. I was content with the simple rural poverty of my\nown; hence this sweetness; my work never reminds you of that;--is pure\nof that.' And nature advertises me in such persons that in\ndemocratic America she will not be democratized. How cloistered and\nconstitutionally sequestered from the market and from scandal! It was\nonly this morning that I sent away some wild flowers of these wood-gods.\nThey are a relief from literature,--these fresh draughts from the\nsources of thought and sentiment; as we read, in an age of polish and\ncriticism, the first lines of written prose and verse of a nation.\nHow captivating is their devotion to their favorite books, whether\nAeschylus, Dante, Shakspeare, or Scott, as feeling that they have a\nstake in that book; who touches that, touches them;--and especially\nthe total solitude of the critic, the Patmos of thought from which\nhe writes, in unconsciousness of any eyes that shall ever read\nthis writing. Could they dream on still, as angels, and not wake to\ncomparisons, and to be flattered! Yet some natures are too good to be\nspoiled by praise, and wherever the vein of thought reaches down into\nthe profound, there is no danger from vanity. Solemn friends will\nwarn them of the danger of the head's being turned by the flourish of\ntrumpets, but they can afford to smile. I remember the indignation of an\neloquent Methodist at the kind admonitions of a Doctor of Divinity,--'My\nfriend, a man can neither be praised nor insulted.' But forgive the\ncounsels; they are very natural. I remember the thought which occurred\nto me when some ingenious and spiritual foreigners came to America, was,\nHave you been victimized in being brought hither?--or, prior to that,\nanswer me this, 'Are you victimizable?'\nAs I have said, Nature keeps these sovereignties in her own hands, and\nhowever pertly our sermons and disciplines would divide some share of\ncredit, and teach that the laws fashion the citizen, she goes her own\ngait and puts the wisest in the wrong. She makes very light of gospels\nand prophets, as one who has a great many more to produce and no excess\nof time to spare on any one. There is a class of men, individuals of\nwhich appear at long intervals, so eminently endowed with insight and\nvirtue that they have been unanimously saluted as divine, and who seem\nto be an accumulation of that power we consider. Divine persons are\ncharacter born, or, to borrow a phrase from Napoleon, they are victory\norganized. They are usually received with ill-will, because they are new\nand because they set a bound to the exaggeration that has been made\nof the personality of the last divine person. Nature never rhymes her\nchildren, nor makes two men alike. When we see a great man we fancy a\nresemblance to some historical person, and predict the sequel of his\ncharacter and fortune; a result which he is sure to disappoint. None\nwill ever solve the problem of his character according to our prejudice,\nbut only in his own high unprecedented way. Character wants room; must\nnot be crowded on by persons nor be judged from glimpses got in the\npress of affairs or on few occasions. It needs perspective, as a great\nbuilding. It may not, probably does not, form relations rapidly; and we\nshould not require rash explanation, either on the popular ethics, or on\nour own, of its action.\nI look on Sculpture as history. I do not think the Apollo and the Jove\nimpossible in flesh and blood. Every trait which the artist recorded in\nstone he had seen in life, and better than his copy. We have seen many\ncounterfeits, but we are born believers in great men. How easily we\nread in old books, when men were few, of the smallest action of the\npatriarchs. We require that a man should be so large and columnar in\nthe landscape, that it should deserve to be recorded that he arose, and\ngirded up his loins, and departed to such a place. The most credible\npictures are those of majestic men who prevailed at their entrance, and\nconvinced the senses; as happened to the eastern magian who was sent to\ntest the merits of Zertusht or Zoroaster. When the Yunani sage arrived\nat Balkh, the Persians tell us, Gushtasp appointed a day on which the\nMobeds of every country should assemble, and a golden chair was placed\nfor the Yunani sage. Then the beloved of Yezdam, the prophet Zertusht,\nadvanced into the midst of the assembly. The Yunani sage, on seeing that\nchief, said, \"This form and this gait cannot lie, and nothing but truth\ncan proceed from them.\" Plato said it was impossible not to believe in\nthe children of the gods, \"though they should speak without probable\nor necessary arguments.\" I should think myself very unhappy in my\nassociates if I could not credit the best things in history. \"John\nBradshaw,\" says Milton, \"appears like a consul, from whom the fasces\nare not to depart with the year; so that not on the tribunal only, but\nthroughout his life, you would regard him as sitting in judgment upon\nkings.\" I find it more credible, since it is anterior information, that\none man should know heaven, as the Chinese say, than that so many men\nshould know the world. \"The virtuous prince confronts the gods, without\nany misgiving. He waits a hundred ages till a sage comes, and does not\ndoubt. He who confronts the gods, without any misgiving, knows heaven;\nhe who waits a hundred ages until a sage comes, without doubting, knows\nmen. Hence the virtuous prince moves, and for ages shows empire the\nway.\" But there is no need to seek remote examples. He is a dull\nobserver whose experience has not taught him the reality and force of\nmagic, as well as of chemistry. The coldest precisian cannot go abroad\nwithout encountering inexplicable influences. One man fastens an eye on\nhim and the graves of the memory render up their dead; the secrets that\nmake him wretched either to keep or to betray must be yielded;--another,\nand he cannot speak, and the bones of his body seem to lose their\ncartilages; the entrance of a friend adds grace, boldness, and eloquence\nto him; and there are persons he cannot choose but remember, who gave a\ntranscendent expansion to his thought, and kindled another life in his\nbosom.\nWhat is so excellent as strict relations of amity, when they spring from\nthis deep root? The sufficient reply to the skeptic who doubts the power\nand the furniture of man, is in that possibility of joyful intercourse\nwith persons, which makes the faith and practice of all reasonable men.\nI know nothing which life has to offer so satisfying as the profound\ngood understanding which can subsist after much exchange of good\noffices, between two virtuous men, each of whom is sure of himself\nand sure of his friend. It is a happiness which postpones all other\ngratifications, and makes politics, and commerce, and churches, cheap.\nFor when men shall meet as they ought, each a benefactor, a shower\nof stars, clothed with thoughts, with deeds, with accomplishments, it\nshould be the festival of nature which all things announce. Of such\nfriendship, love in the sexes is the first symbol, as all other things\nare symbols of love. Those relations to the best men, which, at one\ntime, we reckoned the romances of youth, become, in the progress of the\ncharacter, the most solid enjoyment.\nIf it were possible to live in right relations with men!--if we could\nabstain from asking anything of them, from asking their praise, or help,\nor pity, and content us with compelling them through the virtue of\nthe eldest laws! Could we not deal with a few persons,--with one\nperson,--after the unwritten statutes, and make an experiment of their\nefficacy? Could we not pay our friend the compliment of truth, of\nsilence, of forbearing? Need we be so eager to seek him? If we are\nrelated, we shall meet. It was a tradition of the ancient world that no\nmetamorphosis could hide a god from a god; and there is a Greek verse\nwhich runs,--\n\"The Gods are to each other not unknown.\"\nFriends also follow the laws of divine necessity; they gravitate to each\nother, and cannot otherwise:--\nWhen each the other shall avoid,\nShall each by each be most enjoyed.\nTheir relation is not made, but allowed. The gods must seat themselves\nwithout seneschal in our Olympus, and as they can instal themselves\nby seniority divine. Society is spoiled if pains are taken, if the\nassociates are brought a mile to meet. And if it be not society, it is a\nmischievous, low, degrading jangle, though made up of the best. All the\ngreatness of each is kept back and every foible in painful activity, as\nif the Olympians should meet to exchange snuff-boxes.\nLife goes headlong. We chase some flying scheme, or we are hunted by\nsome fear or command behind us. But if suddenly we encounter a friend,\nwe pause; our heat and hurry look foolish enough; now pause, now\npossession is required, and the power to swell the moment from the\nresources of the heart. The moment is all, in all noble relations.\nA divine person is the prophecy of the mind; a friend is the hope of the\nheart. Our beatitude waits for the fulfilment of these two in one. The\nages are opening this moral force. All force is the shadow or symbol of\nthat. Poetry is joyful and strong as it draws its inspiration thence.\nMen write their names on the world as they are filled with this. History\nhas been mean; our nations have been mobs; we have never seen a man:\nthat divine form we do not yet know, but only the dream and prophecy\nof such: we do not know the majestic manners which belong to him, which\nappease and exalt the beholder. We shall one day see that the most\nprivate is the most public energy, that quality atones for quantity, and\ngrandeur of character acts in the dark, and succors them who never saw\nit. What greatness has yet appeared is beginnings and encouragements\nto us in this direction. The history of those gods and saints which the\nworld has written and then worshipped, are documents of character. The\nages have exulted in the manners of a youth who owed nothing to fortune,\nand who was hanged at the Tyburn of his nation, who, by the pure quality\nof his nature, shed an epic splendor around the facts of his death which\nhas transfigured every particular into an universal symbol for the eyes\nof mankind. This great defeat is hitherto our highest fact. But the\nmind requires a victory to the senses; a force of character which will\nconvert judge, jury, soldier, and king; which will rule animal and\nmineral virtues, and blend with the courses of sap, of rivers, of winds,\nof stars, and of moral agents.\nIf we cannot attain at a bound to these grandeurs, at least let us do\nthem homage. In society, high advantages are set down to the possessor\nas disadvantages. It requires the more wariness in our private\nestimates. I do not forgive in my friends the failure to know a fine\ncharacter and to entertain it with thankful hospitality. When at last\nthat which we have always longed for is arrived and shines on us with\nglad rays out of that far celestial land, then to be coarse, then to be\ncritical and treat such a visitant with the jabber and suspicion of the\nstreets, argues a vulgarity that seems to shut the doors of heaven. This\nis confusion, this the right insanity, when the soul no longer knows\nits own, nor where its allegiance, its religion, are due. Is there any\nreligion but this, to know that wherever in the wide desert of being the\nholy sentiment we cherish has opened into a flower, it blooms for me? if\nnone sees it, I see it; I am aware, if I alone, of the greatness of the\nfact. Whilst it blooms, I will keep sabbath or holy time, and suspend my\ngloom and my folly and jokes. Nature is indulged by the presence of this\nguest. There are many eyes that can detect and honor the prudent and\nhousehold virtues; there are many that can discern Genius on his\nstarry track, though the mob is incapable; but when that love which is\nall-suffering, all-abstaining, all-aspiring, which has vowed to itself\nthat it will be a wretch and also a fool in this world sooner than\nsoil its white hands by any compliances, comes into our streets and\nhouses,--only the pure and aspiring can know its face, and the only\ncompliment they can pay it is to own it.\n*****\nMANNERS.\n\"HOW near to good is what is fair!\nWhich we no sooner see,\nBut with the lines and outward air\nOur senses taken be.\nAgain yourselves compose,\nAnd now put all the aptness on\nOf Figure, that Proportion\nOr Color can disclose;\nThat if those silent arts were lost,\nDesign and Picture, they might boast\nFrom you a newer ground,\nInstructed by the heightening sense\nOf dignity and reverence\nIn their true motions found.\"\nBEN JONSON\nIV. MANNERS.\nHALF the world, it is said, knows not how the other half live. Our\nExploring Expedition saw the Feejee islanders getting their dinner off\nhuman bones; and they are said to eat their own wives and children. The\nhusbandry of the modern inhabitants of Gournou (west of old Thebes)\nis philosophical to a fault. To set up their housekeeping nothing is\nrequisite but two or three earthen pots, a stone to grind meal, and a\nmat which is the bed. The house, namely a tomb, is ready without rent\nor taxes. No rain can pass through the roof, and there is no door, for\nthere is no want of one, as there is nothing to lose. If the house do\nnot please them, they walk out and enter another, as there are several\nhundreds at their command. \"It is somewhat singular,\" adds Belzoni, to\nwhom we owe this account, \"to talk of happiness among people who live in\nsepulchres, among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they\nknow nothing of.\" In the deserts of Borgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell\nin caves, like cliff-swallows, and the language of these negroes\nis compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats and to the\nwhistling of birds. Again, the Bornoos have no proper names; individuals\nare called after their height, thickness, or other accidental quality,\nand have nicknames merely. But the salt, the dates, the ivory, and the\ngold, for which these horrible regions are visited, find their way into\ncountries where the purchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one\nrace with these cannibals and man-stealers; countries where man serves\nhimself with metals, wood, stone, glass, gum, cotton, silk, and wool;\nhonors himself with architecture; writes laws, and contrives to execute\nhis will through the hands of many nations; and, especially, establishes\na select society, running through all the countries of intelligent\nmen, a self-constituted aristocracy, or fraternity of the best, which,\nwithout written law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates itself,\ncolonizes every new-planted island and adopts and makes its own whatever\npersonal beauty or extraordinary native endowment anywhere appears.\nWhat fact more conspicuous in modern history than the creation of\nthe gentleman? Chivalry is that, and loyalty is that, and, in English\nliterature, half the drama, and all the novels, from Sir Philip Sidney\nto Sir Walter Scott, paint this figure. The word gentleman, which, like\nthe word Christian, must hereafter characterize the present and the few\npreceding centuries by the importance attached to it, is a homage\nto personal and incommunicable properties. Frivolous and fantastic\nadditions have got associated with the name, but the steady interest\nof mankind in it must be attributed to the valuable properties which\nit designates. An element which unites all the most forcible persons of\nevery country; makes them intelligible and agreeable to each other, and\nis somewhat so precise that it is at once felt if an individual lack\nthe masonic sign,--cannot be any casual product, but must be an average\nresult of the character and faculties universally found in men. It\nseems a certain permanent average; as the atmosphere is a permanent\ncomposition, whilst so many gases are combined only to be decompounded.\nComme il faut, is the Frenchman's description of good Society: as we\nmust be. It is a spontaneous fruit of talents and feelings of precisely\nthat class who have most vigor, who take the lead in the world of this\nhour, and though far from pure, far from constituting the gladdest and\nhighest tone of human feeling, is as good as the whole society permits\nit to be. It is made of the spirit, more than of the talent of men,\nand is a compound result into which every great force enters as an\ningredient, namely virtue, wit, beauty, wealth, and power.\nThere is something equivocal in all the words in use to express the\nexcellence of manners and social cultivation, because the quantities are\nfluxional, and the last effect is assumed by the senses as the cause.\nThe word gentleman has not any correlative abstract to express the\nquality. Gentility is mean, and gentilesse is obsolete. But we must\nkeep alive in the vernacular the distinction between fashion, a word of\nnarrow and often sinister meaning, and the heroic character which the\ngentleman imports. The usual words, however, must be respected;\nthey will be found to contain the root of the matter. The point of\ndistinction in all this class of names, as courtesy, chivalry, fashion,\nand the like, is that the flower and fruit, not the grain of the tree,\nare contemplated. It is beauty which is the aim this time, and not\nworth. The result is now in question, although our words intimate well\nenough the popular feeling that the appearance supposes a substance.\nThe gentleman is a man of truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing\nthat lordship in his behavior, not in any manner dependent and servile,\neither on persons, or opinions, or possessions. Beyond this fact of\ntruth and real force, the word denotes good-nature or benevolence:\nmanhood first, and then gentleness. The popular notion certainly adds a\ncondition of ease and fortune; but that is a natural result of personal\nforce and love, that they should possess and dispense the goods of the\nworld. In times of violence, every eminent person must fall in with many\nopportunities to approve his stoutness and worth; therefore every man's\nname that emerged at all from the mass in the feudal ages, rattles in\nour ear like a flourish of trumpets. But personal force never goes out\nof fashion. That is still paramount to-day, and in the moving crowd of\ngood society the men of valor and reality are known and rise to their\nnatural place. The competition is transferred from war to politics\nand trade, but the personal force appears readily enough in these new\narenas.\nPower first, or no leading class. In politics and in trade, bruisers and\npirates are of better promise than talkers and clerks. God knows\nthat all sorts of gentlemen knock at the door; but whenever used in\nstrictness and with any emphasis, the name will be found to point\nat original energy. It describes a man standing in his own right and\nworking after untaught methods. In a good lord there must first be\na good animal, at least to the extent of yielding the incomparable\nadvantage of animal spirits. The ruling class must have more, but they\nmust have these, giving in every company the sense of power, which\nmakes things easy to be done which daunt the wise. The society of the\nenergetic class, in their friendly and festive meetings, is full of\ncourage and of attempts which intimidate the pale scholar. The courage\nwhich girls exhibit is like a battle of Lundy's Lane, or a sea-fight.\nThe intellect relies on memory to make some supplies to face these\nextemporaneous squadrons. But memory is a base mendicant with basket and\nbadge, in the presence of these sudden masters. The rulers of society\nmust be up to the work of the world, and equal to their versatile\noffice: men of the right Caesarian pattern, who have great range of\naffinity. I am far from believing the timid maxim of Lord Falkland\n(\"that for ceremony there must go two to it; since a bold fellow will go\nthrough the cunningest forms\"), and am of opinion that the gentleman is\nthe bold fellow whose forms are not to be broken through; and only that\nplenteous nature is rightful master which is the complement of whatever\nperson it converses with. My gentleman gives the law where he is; he\nwill outpray saints in chapel, outgeneral veterans in the field, and\noutshine all courtesy in the hall. He is good company for pirates\nand good with academicians; so that it is useless to fortify yourself\nagainst him; he has the private entrance to all minds, and I could as\neasily exclude myself, as him. The famous gentlemen of Asia and Europe\nhave been of this strong type; Saladin, Sapor, the Cid, Julius Caesar,\nScipio, Alexander, Pericles, and the lordliest personages. They sat very\ncarelessly in their chairs, and were too excellent themselves, to value\nany condition at a high rate.\nA plentiful fortune is reckoned necessary, in the popular judgment, to\nthe completion of this man of the world; and it is a material deputy\nwhich walks through the dance which the first has led. Money is not\nessential, but this wide affinity is, which transcends the habits of\nclique and caste and makes itself felt by men of all classes. If the\naristocrat is only valid in fashionable circles and not with truckmen,\nhe will never be a leader in fashion; and if the man of the people\ncannot speak on equal terms with the gentleman, so that the gentleman\nshall perceive that he is already really of his own order, he is not\nto be feared. Diogenes, Socrates, and Epaminondas, are gentlemen of the\nbest blood who have chosen the condition of poverty when that of wealth\nwas equally open to them. I use these old names, but the men I speak of\nare my contemporaries. Fortune will not supply to every generation one\nof these well-appointed knights, but every collection of men furnishes\nsome example of the class; and the politics of this country, and the\ntrade of every town, are controlled by these hardy and irresponsible\ndoers, who have invention to take the lead, and a broad sympathy which\nputs them in fellowship with crowds, and makes their action popular.\nThe manners of this class are observed and caught with devotion by men\nof taste. The association of these masters with each other and with men\nintelligent of their merits, is mutually agreeable and stimulating. The\ngood forms, the happiest expressions of each, are repeated and adopted.\nBy swift consent everything superfluous is dropped, everything graceful\nis renewed. Fine manners show themselves formidable to the uncultivated\nman. They are a subtler science of defence to parry and intimidate; but\nonce matched by the skill of the other party, they drop the point of the\nsword,--points and fences disappear, and the youth finds himself in a\nmore transparent atmosphere, wherein life is a less troublesome game,\nand not a misunderstanding rises between the players. Manners aim to\nfacilitate life, to get rid of impediments and bring the man pure\nto energize. They aid our dealing and conversation as a railway aids\ntravelling, by getting rid of all avoidable obstructions of the road and\nleaving nothing to be conquered but pure space. These forms very soon\nbecome fixed, and a fine sense of propriety is cultivated with the more\nheed that it becomes a badge of social and civil distinctions. Thus\ngrows up Fashion, an equivocal semblance, the most puissant, the most\nfantastic and frivolous, the most feared and followed, and which morals\nand violence assault in vain.\nThere exists a strict relation between the class of power and the\nexclusive and polished circles. The last are always filled or filling\nfrom the first. The strong men usually give some allowance even to the\npetulances of fashion, for that affinity they find in it. Napoleon,\nchild of the revolution, destroyer of the old noblesse, never ceased to\ncourt the Faubourg St. Germain; doubtless with the feeling that fashion\nis a homage to men of his stamp. Fashion, though in a strange way,\nrepresents all manly virtue. It is virtue gone to seed: it is a kind of\nposthumous honor. It does not often caress the great, but the children\nof the great: it is a hall of the Past. It usually sets its face against\nthe great of this hour. Great men are not commonly in its halls; they\nare absent in the field: they are working, not triumphing. Fashion is\nmade up of their children; of those who through the value and virtue\nof somebody, have acquired lustre to their name, marks of distinction,\nmeans of cultivation and generosity, and, in their physical organization\na certain health and excellence which secures to them, if not the\nhighest power to work, yet high power to enjoy. The class of power, the\nworking heroes, the Cortez, the Nelson, the Napoleon, see that this is\nthe festivity and permanent celebration of such as they; that fashion is\nfunded talent; is Mexico, Marengo, and Trafalgar beaten out thin; that\nthe brilliant names of fashion run back to just such busy names as their\nown, fifty or sixty years ago. They are the sowers, their sons shall\nbe the reapers, and their sons, in the ordinary course of things, must\nyield the possession of the harvest to new competitors with keener eyes\nand stronger frames. The city is recruited from the country. In the year\n1805, it is said, every legitimate monarch in Europe was imbecile. The\ncity would have died out, rotted, and exploded, long ago, but that it\nwas reinforced from the fields. It is only country which came to town\nday before yesterday that is city and court today.\nAristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable results. These mutual\nselections are indestructible. If they provoke anger in the least\nfavored class, and the excluded majority revenge themselves on the\nexcluding minority by the strong hand and kill them, at once a new class\nfinds itself at the top, as certainly as cream rises in a bowl of milk:\nand if the people should destroy class after class, until two men only\nwere left, one of these would be the leader and would be involuntarily\nserved and copied by the other. You may keep this minority out of sight\nand out of mind, but it is tenacious of life, and is one of the estates\nof the realm. I am the more struck with this tenacity, when I see its\nwork. It respects the administration of such unimportant matters, that\nwe should not look for any durability in its rule. We sometimes meet\nmen under some strong moral influence, as a patriotic, a literary, a\nreligious movement, and feel that the moral sentiment rules man and\nnature. We think all other distinctions and ties will be slight and\nfugitive, this of caste or fashion for example; yet come from year to\nyear and see how permanent that is, in this Boston or New York life\nof man, where too it has not the least countenance from the law of the\nland. Not in Egypt or in India a firmer or more impassable line. Here\nare associations whose ties go over and under and through it, a\nmeeting of merchants, a military corps, a college class, a fire-club,\na professional association, a political, a religious convention;--the\npersons seem to draw inseparably near; yet, that assembly once\ndispersed, its members will not in the year meet again. Each returns to\nhis degree in the scale of good society, porcelain remains porcelain,\nand earthen earthen. The objects of fashion may be frivolous, or fashion\nmay be objectless, but the nature of this union and selection can\nbe neither frivolous nor accidental. Each man's rank in that perfect\ngraduation depends on some symmetry in his structure or some\nagreement in his structure to the symmetry of society. Its doors\nunbar instantaneously to a natural claim of their own kind. A natural\ngentleman finds his way in, and will keep the oldest patrician out who\nhas lost his intrinsic rank. Fashion understands itself; good-breeding\nand personal superiority of whatever country readily fraternize with\nthose of every other. The chiefs of savage tribes have distinguished\nthemselves in London and Paris, by the purity of their tournure.\nTo say what good of fashion we can, it rests on reality, and hates\nnothing so much as pretenders; to exclude and mystify pretenders and\nsend them into everlasting 'Coventry,' is its delight. We contemn in\nturn every other gift of men of the world; but the habit even in little\nand the least matters of not appealing to any but our own sense of\npropriety, constitutes the foundation of all chivalry. There is almost\nno kind of self-reliance, so it be sane and proportioned, which fashion\ndoes not occasionally adopt and give it the freedom of its saloons. A\nsainted soul is always elegant, and, if it will, passes unchallenged\ninto the most guarded ring. But so will Jock the teamster pass, in some\ncrisis that brings him thither, and find favor, as long as his head is\nnot giddy with the new circumstance, and the iron shoes do not wish to\ndance in waltzes and cotillons. For there is nothing settled in manners,\nbut the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the individual. The\nmaiden at her first ball, the country-man at a city dinner, believes\nthat there is a ritual according to which every act and compliment must\nbe performed, or the failing party must be cast out of this presence.\nLater they learn that good sense and character make their own forms\nevery moment, and speak or abstain, take wine or refuse it, stay or go,\nsit in a chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or stand on their\nhead, or what else soever, in a new and aboriginal way; and that strong\nwill is always in fashion, let who will be unfashionable. All that\nfashion demands is composure and self-content. A circle of men perfectly\nwell-bred would be a company of sensible persons in which every man's\nnative manners and character appeared. If the fashionist have not this\nquality, he is nothing. We are such lovers of self-reliance that we\nexcuse in a man many sins if he will show us a complete satisfaction\nin his position, which asks no leave to be, of mine, or any man's good\nopinion. But any deference to some eminent man or woman of the world,\nforfeits all privilege of nobility. He is an underling: I have nothing\nto do with him; I will speak with his master. A man should not go where\nhe cannot carry his whole sphere or society with him,--not bodily, the\nwhole circle of his friends, but atmospherically. He should preserve in\na new company the same attitude of mind and reality of relation which\nhis daily associates draw him to, else he is shorn of his best beams,\nand will be an orphan in the merriest club. \"If you could see Vich\nIan Vohr with his tail on!--\" But Vich Ian Vohr must always carry his\nbelongings in some fashion, if not added as honor, then severed as\ndisgrace.\nThere will always be in society certain persons who are mercuries of its\napprobation, and whose glance will at any time determine for the curious\ntheir standing in the world. These are the chamberlains of the lesser\ngods. Accept their coldness as an omen of grace with the loftier\ndeities, and allow them all their privilege. They are clear in their\noffice, nor could they be thus formidable without their own merits.\nBut do not measure the importance of this class by their pretension, or\nimagine that a fop can be the dispenser of honor and shame. They pass\nalso at their just rate; for how can they otherwise, in circles which\nexist as a sort of herald's office for the sifting of character?\nAs the first thing man requires of man is reality, so that appears\nin all the forms of society. We pointedly, and by name, introduce the\nparties to each other. Know you before all heaven and earth, that this\nis Andrew, and this is Gregory,--they look each other in the eye; they\ngrasp each other's hand, to identify and signalize each other. It is\na great satisfaction. A gentleman never dodges; his eyes look straight\nforward, and he assures the other party, first of all, that he has been\nmet. For what is it that we seek, in so many visits and hospitalities?\nIs it your draperies, pictures, and decorations? Or do we not insatiably\nask, Was a man in the house? I may easily go into a great household\nwhere there is much substance, excellent provision for comfort,\nluxury, and taste, and yet not encounter there any Amphitryon who shall\nsubordinate these appendages. I may go into a cottage, and find a\nfarmer who feels that he is the man I have come to see, and fronts\nme accordingly. It was therefore a very natural point of old feudal\netiquette that a gentleman who received a visit, though it were of his\nsovereign, should not leave his roof, but should wait his arrival at\nthe door of his house. No house, though it were the Tuileries or the\nEscurial, is good for anything without a master. And yet we are not\noften gratified by this hospitality. Every body we know surrounds\nhimself with a fine house, fine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage\nand all manner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself and his\nguest. Does it not seem as if man was of a very sly, elusive nature,\nand dreaded nothing so much as a full rencontre front to front with his\nfellow? It were unmerciful, I know, quite to abolish the use of these\nscreens, which are of eminent convenience, whether the guest is too\ngreat or too little. We call together many friends who keep each other\nin play, or by luxuries and ornaments we amuse the young people, and\nguard our retirement. Or if perchance a searching realist comes to our\ngate, before whose eye we have no care to stand, then again we run to\nour curtain, and hide ourselves as Adam at the voice of the Lord God\nin the garden. Cardinal Caprara, the Pope's legate at Paris, defended\nhimself from the glances of Napoleon by an immense pair of green\nspectacles. Napoleon remarked them, and speedily managed to rally them\noff: and yet Napoleon, in his turn, was not great enough with eight\nhundred thousand troops at his back, to face a pair of freeborn eyes,\nbut fenced himself with etiquette and within triple barriers of reserve;\nand, as all the world knows from Madame de Stael, was wont, when he\nfound himself observed, to discharge his face of all expression. But\nemperors and rich men are by no means the most skilful masters of\ngood manners. No rentroll nor army-list can dignify skulking and\ndissimulation; and the first point of courtesy must always be truth, as\nreally all the forms of good-breeding point that way.\nI have just been reading, in Mr. Hazlitt's translation, Montaigne's\naccount of his journey into Italy, and am struck with nothing more\nagreeably than the self-respecting fashions of the time. His arrival in\neach place, the arrival of a gentleman of France, is an event of some\nconsequence. Wherever he goes he pays a visit to whatever prince or\ngentleman of note resides upon his road, as a duty to himself and to\ncivilization. When he leaves any house in which he has lodged for a few\nweeks, he causes his arms to be painted and hung up as a perpetual sign\nto the house, as was the custom of gentlemen.\nThe complement of this graceful self-respect, and that of all the points\nof good breeding I most require and insist upon, is deference. I\nlike that every chair should be a throne, and hold a king. I prefer\na tendency to stateliness to an excess of fellowship. Let the\nincommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man\nteach us independence. Let us not be too much acquainted. I would have\na man enter his house through a hall filled with heroic and sacred\nsculptures, that he might not want the hint of tranquillity and\nself-poise. We should meet each morning as from foreign countries,\nand, spending the day together, should depart at night, as into foreign\ncountries. In all things I would have the island of a man inviolate. Let\nus sit apart as the gods, talking from peak to peak all round Olympus.\nNo degree of affection need invade this religion. This is myrrh and\nrosemary to keep the other sweet. Lovers Should guard their strangeness.\nIf they forgive too much, all slides into confusion and meanness. It\nis easy to push this deference to a Chinese etiquette; but coolness and\nabsence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities. A gentleman makes no\nnoise; a lady is serene. Proportionate is our disgust at those invaders\nwho fill a studious house with blast and running, to secure some\npaltry convenience. Not less I dislike a low sympathy of each with his\nneighbor's needs. Must we have a good understanding with one another's\npalates? as foolish people who have lived long together know when each\nwants salt or sugar. I pray my companion, if he wishes for bread, to ask\nme for bread, and if he wishes for sassafras or arsenic, to ask me for\nthem, and not to hold out his plate as if I knew already. Every natural\nfunction can be dignified by deliberation and privacy. Let us leave\nhurry to slaves. The compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should\nsignify, however remotely, the recollection of the grandeur of our\ndestiny.\nThe flower of courtesy does not very well bide handling, but if we dare\nto open another leaf and explore what parts go to its conformation,\nwe shall find also an intellectual quality. To the leaders of men, the\nbrain as well as the flesh and the heart must furnish a proportion.\nDefect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions. Men are too\ncoarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage and customs. It\nis not quite sufficient to good-breeding, a union of kindness and\nindependence. We imperatively require a perception of, and a homage to\nbeauty in our companions. Other virtues are in request in the field and\nworkyard, but a certain degree of taste is not to be spared in those we\nsit with. I could better eat with one who did not respect the truth or\nthe laws than with a sloven and unpresentable person. Moral qualities\nrule the world, but at short distances the senses are despotic. The same\ndiscrimination of fit and fair runs out, if with less rigor, into all\nparts of life. The average spirit of the energetic class is good sense,\nacting under certain limitations and to certain ends. It entertains\nevery natural gift. Social in its nature, it respects everything which\ntends to unite men. It delights in measure. The love of beauty is mainly\nthe love of measure or proportion. The person who screams, or uses the\nsuperlative degree, or converses with heat, puts whole drawing-rooms to\nflight. If you wish to be loved, love measure. You must have genius or\na prodigious usefulness if you will hide the want of measure. This\nperception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of the social\ninstrument. Society will pardon much to genius and special gifts, but,\nbeing in its nature a convention, it loves what is conventional, or\nwhat belongs to coming together. That makes the good and bad of manners,\nnamely what helps or hinders fellowship. For fashion is not good\nsense absolute, but relative; not good sense private, but good sense\nentertaining company. It hates corners and sharp points of character,\nhates quarrelsome, egotistical, solitary, and gloomy people; hates\nwhatever can interfere with total blending of parties; whilst it values\nall peculiarities as in the highest degree refreshing, which can\nconsist with good fellowship. And besides the general infusion of wit\nto heighten civility, the direct splendor of intellectual power is ever\nwelcome in fine society as the costliest addition to its rule and its\ncredit.\nThe dry light must shine in to adorn our festival, but it must be\ntempered and shaded, or that will also offend. Accuracy is essential\nto beauty, and quick perceptions to politeness, but not too quick\nperceptions. One may be too punctual and too precise. He must leave the\nomniscience of business at the door, when he comes into the palace of\nbeauty. Society loves creole natures, and sleepy languishing manners, so\nthat they cover sense, grace and good-will: the air of drowsy strength,\nwhich disarms criticism; perhaps because such a person seems to reserve\nhimself for the best of the game, and not spend himself on surfaces;\nan ignoring eye, which does not see the annoyances, shifts, and\ninconveniences that cloud the brow and smother the voice of the\nsensitive.\nTherefore besides personal force and so much perception as constitutes\nunerring taste, society demands in its patrician class another element\nalready intimated, which it significantly terms good-nature,--expressing\nall degrees of generosity, from the lowest willingness and faculty to\noblige, up to the heights of magnanimity and love. Insight we must have,\nor we shall run against one another and miss the way to our food; but\nintellect is selfish and barren. The secret of success in society is a\ncertain heartiness and sympathy. A man who is not happy in the company\ncannot find any word in his memory that will fit the occasion. All his\ninformation is a little impertinent. A man who is happy there, finds\nin every turn of the conversation equally lucky occasions for the\nintroduction of that which he has to say. The favorites of society, and\nwhat it calls whole souls, are able men and of more spirit than wit,\nwho have no uncomfortable egotism, but who exactly fill the hour and the\ncompany; contented and contenting, at a marriage or a funeral, a ball\nor a jury, a water-party or a shooting-match. England, which is rich in\ngentlemen, furnished, in the beginning of the present century, a good\nmodel of that genius which the world loves, in Mr. Fox, who added to\nhis great abilities the most social disposition and real love of men.\nParliamentary history has few better passages than the debate in which\nBurke and Fox separated in the House of Commons; when Fox urged on his\nold friend the claims of old friendship with such tenderness that the\nhouse was moved to tears. Another anecdote is so close to my matter,\nthat I must hazard the story. A tradesman who had long dunned him for\na note of three hundred guineas, found him one day counting gold, and\ndemanded payment:--\"No,\" said Fox, \"I owe this money to Sheridan; it is\na debt of honor; if an accident should happen to me, he has nothing\nto show.\" \"Then,\" said the creditor, \"I change my debt into a debt\nof honor,\" and tore the note in pieces. Fox thanked the man for his\nconfidence and paid him, saying, \"his debt was of older standing, and\nSheridan must wait.\" Lover of liberty, friend of the Hindoo, friend\nof the African slave, he possessed a great personal popularity; and\nNapoleon said of him on the occasion of his visit to Paris, in 1805,\n\"Mr. Fox will always hold the first place in an assembly at the\nTuileries.\"\nWe may easily seem ridiculous in our eulogy of courtesy, whenever we\ninsist on benevolence as its foundation. The painted phantasm Fashion\nrises to cast a species of derision on what we say. But I will neither\nbe driven from some allowance to Fashion as a symbolic institution, nor\nfrom the belief that love is the basis of courtesy. We must obtain that,\nif we can; but by all means we must affirm this. Life owes much of its\nspirit to these sharp contrasts. Fashion, which affects to be honor, is\noften, in all men's experience, only a ballroom-code. Yet so long as\nit is the highest circle in the imagination of the best heads on the\nplanet, there is something necessary and excellent in it; for it is\nnot to be supposed that men have agreed to be the dupes of anything\npreposterous; and the respect which these mysteries inspire in the most\nrude and sylvan characters, and the curiosity with which details of\nhigh life are read, betray the universality of the love of cultivated\nmanners. I know that a comic disparity would be felt, if we should enter\nthe acknowledged 'first circles' and apply these terrific standards of\njustice, beauty, and benefit to the individuals actually found there.\nMonarchs and heroes, sages and lovers, these gallants are not. Fashion\nhas many classes and many rules of probation and admission, and not\nthe best alone. There is not only the right of conquest, which genius\npretends,--the individual demonstrating his natural aristocracy best\nof the best;--but less claims will pass for the time; for Fashion loves\nlions, and points like Circe to her horned company. This gentleman is\nthis afternoon arrived from Denmark; and that is my Lord Ride, who came\nyesterday from Bagdat; here is Captain Friese, from Cape Turnagain; and\nCaptain Symmes, from the interior of the earth; and Monsieur Jovaire,\nwho came down this morning in a balloon; Mr. Hobnail, the reformer; and\nReverend Jul Bat, who has converted the whole torrid zone in his Sunday\nschool; and Signor Torre del Greco, who extinguished Vesuvius by pouring\ninto it the Bay of Naples; Spahi, the Persian ambassador; and Tul Wil\nShan, the exiled nabob of Nepaul, whose saddle is the new moon.--But\nthese are monsters of one day, and to-morrow will be dismissed to\ntheir holes and dens; for in these rooms every chair is waited for. The\nartist, the scholar, and, in general, the clerisy, wins their way up\ninto these places and get represented here, somewhat on this footing of\nconquest. Another mode is to pass through all the degrees, spending a\nyear and a day in St. Michael's Square, being steeped in Cologne water,\nand perfumed, and dined, and introduced, and properly grounded in all\nthe biography and politics and anecdotes of the boudoirs.\nYet these fineries may have grace and wit. Let there be grotesque\nsculpture about the gates and offices of temples. Let the creed\nand commandments even have the saucy homage of parody. The forms of\npoliteness universally express benevolence in superlative degrees.\nWhat if they are in the mouths of selfish men, and used as means of\nselfishness? What if the false gentleman almost bows the true out Of the\nworld? What if the false gentleman contrives so to address his companion\nas civilly to exclude all others from his discourse, and also to make\nthem feel excluded? Real service will not lose its nobleness. All\ngenerosity is not merely French and sentimental; nor is it to be\nconcealed that living blood and a passion of kindness does at last\ndistinguish God's gentleman from Fashion's. The epitaph of Sir Jenkin\nGrout is not wholly unintelligible to the present age: \"Here lies Sir\nJenkin Grout, who loved his friend and persuaded his enemy: what his\nmouth ate, his hand paid for: what his servants robbed, he restored: if\na woman gave him pleasure, he supported her in pain: he never forgot his\nchildren; and whoso touched his finger, drew after it his whole body.\"\nEven the line of heroes is not utterly extinct. There is still ever some\nadmirable person in plain clothes, standing on the wharf, who jumps\nin to rescue a drowning man; there is still some absurd inventor of\ncharities; some guide and comforter of runaway slaves; some friend of\nPoland; some Philhellene; some fanatic who plants shade-trees for the\nsecond and third generation, and orchards when he is grown old; some\nwell-concealed piety; some just man happy in an ill fame; some youth\nashamed of the favors of fortune and impatiently casting them on other\nshoulders. And these are the centres of society, on which it returns for\nfresh impulses. These are the creators of Fashion, which is an attempt\nto organize beauty of behavior. The beautiful and the generous are, in\nthe theory, the doctors and apostles of this church: Scipio, and the\nCid, and Sir Philip Sidney, and Washington, and every pure and valiant\nheart who worshipped Beauty by word and by deed. The persons who\nconstitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the actual\naristocracy, or only on its edge; as the chemical energy of the spectrum\nis found to be greatest just outside of the spectrum. Yet that is the\ninfirmity of the seneschals, who do not know their sovereign when he\nappears. The theory of society supposes the existence and sovereignty of\nthese. It divines afar off their coming. It says with the elder gods,--\n\"As Heaven and Earth are fairer far\nThan Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;\nAnd as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth,\nIn form and shape compact and beautiful;\nSo, on our heels a fresh perfection treads;\nA power, more strong in beauty, born of us,\nAnd fated to excel us, as we pass\nIn glory that old Darkness:\n-------- for, 'tis the eternal law,\nThat first in beauty shall be first in might.\"\nTherefore, within the ethnical circle of good society there is a\nnarrower and higher circle, concentration of its light, and flower\nof courtesy, to which there is always a tacit appeal of pride and\nreference, as to its inner and imperial court; the parliament of love\nand chivalry. And this is constituted of those persons in whom heroic\ndispositions are native; with the love of beauty, the delight in\nsociety, and the power to embellish the passing day. If the individuals\nwho compose the purest circles of aristocracy in Europe, the guarded\nblood of centuries, should pass in review, in such manner as that we\ncould at leisure and critically inspect their behavior, we might find no\ngentleman and no lady; for although excellent specimens of courtesy and\nhigh-breeding would gratify us in the assemblage, in the particulars\nwe should detect offence. Because elegance comes of no breeding, but\nof birth. There must be romance of character, or the most fastidious\nexclusion of impertinencies will not avail. It must be genius which\ntakes that direction: it must be not courteous, but courtesy. High\nbehavior is as rare in fiction as it is in fact. Scott is praised for\nthe fidelity with which he painted the demeanor and conversation of the\nsuperior classes. Certainly, kings and queens, nobles and great ladies,\nhad some right to complain of the absurdity that had been put in their\nmouths before the days of Waverley; but neither does Scott's dialogue\nbear criticism. His lords brave each other in smart epigramatic\nspeeches, but the dialogue is in costume, and does not please on the\nsecond reading: it is not warm with life. In Shakspeare alone the\nspeakers do not strut and bridle, the dialogue is easily great, and he\nadds to so many titles that of being the best-bred man in England and in\nChristendom. Once or twice in a lifetime we are permitted to enjoy the\ncharm of noble manners, in the presence of a man or woman who have no\nbar in their nature, but whose character emanates freely in their\nword and gesture. A beautiful form is better than a beautiful face; a\nbeautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form: it gives a higher\npleasure than statues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine arts. A\nman is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature, yet,\nby the moral quality radiating from his countenance he may abolish all\nconsiderations of magnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the\nworld. I have seen an individual whose manners, though wholly within\nthe conventions of elegant society, were never learned there, but were\noriginal and commanding and held out protection and prosperity; one who\ndid not need the aid of a court-suit, but carried the holiday in his\neye; who exhilarated the fancy by flinging wide the doors of new modes\nof existence; who shook off the captivity of etiquette, with happy,\nspirited bearing, good-natured and free as Robin Hood; yet with the port\nof an emperor, if need be,--calm, serious, and fit to stand the gaze of\nmillions.\nThe open air and the fields, the street and public chambers are the\nplaces where Man executes his will; let him yield or divide the\nsceptre at the door of the house. Woman, with her instinct of behavior,\ninstantly detects in man a love of trifles, any coldness or imbecility,\nor, in short, any want of that large, flowing, and magnanimous\ndeportment which is indispensable as an exterior in the hall. Our\nAmerican institutions have been friendly to her, and at this moment I\nesteem it a chief felicity of this country, that it excels in women. A\ncertain awkward consciousness of inferiority in the men may give rise\nto the new chivalry in behalf of Woman's Rights. Certainly let her be as\nmuch better placed in the laws and in social forms as the most zealous\nreformer can ask, but I confide so entirely in her inspiring and musical\nnature, that I believe only herself can show us how she shall be served.\nThe wonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at times into\nheroical and godlike regions, and verifies the pictures of Minerva,\nJuno, or Polymnia; and by the firmness with which she treads her upward\npath, she convinces the coarsest calculators that another road exists\nthan that which their feet know. But besides those who make good in\nour imagination the place of muses and of Delphic Sibyls, are there not\nwomen who fill our vase with wine and roses to the brim, so that the\nwine runs over and fills the house with perfume; who inspire us with\ncourtesy; who unloose our tongues and we speak; who anoint our eyes and\nwe see? We say things we never thought to have said; for once, our walls\nof habitual reserve vanished and left us at large; we were children\nplaying with children in a wide field of flowers. Steep us, we cried, in\nthese influences, for days, for weeks, and we shall be sunny poets and\nwill write out in many-colored words the romance that you are. Was it\nHafiz or Firdousi that said of his Persian Lilla, She was an elemental\nforce, and astonished me by her amount of life, when I saw her day after\nday radiating, every instant, redundant joy and grace on all around her.\nShe was a solvent powerful to reconcile all heterogeneous persons into\none society: like air or water, an element of such a great range of\naffinities that it combines readily with a thousand substances. Where\nshe is present all others will be more than they are wont. She was a\nunit and whole, so that whatsoever she did, became her. She had too much\nsympathy and desire to please, than that you could say her manners were\nmarked with dignity, yet no princess could surpass her clear and erect\ndemeanor on each occasion. She did not study the Persian grammar, nor\nthe books of the seven poets, but all the poems of the seven seemed\nto be written upon her. For though the bias of her nature was not to\nthought, but to sympathy, yet was she so perfect in her own nature as to\nmeet intellectual persons by the fulness of her heart, warming them by\nher sentiments; believing, as she did, that by dealing nobly with all,\nall would show themselves noble.\nI know that this Byzantine pile of chivalry or Fashion, which seems so\nfair and picturesque to those who look at the contemporary facts for\nscience or for entertainment, is not equally pleasant to all spectators.\nThe constitution of our society makes it a giant's castle to the\nambitious youth who have not found their names enrolled in its Golden\nBook, and whom it has excluded from its coveted honors and privileges.\nThey have yet to learn that its seeming grandeur is shadowy and\nrelative: it is great by their allowance; its proudest gates will\nfly open at the approach of their courage and virtue. For the present\ndistress, however, of those who are predisposed to suffer from the\ntyrannies of this caprice, there are easy remedies. To remove your\nresidence a couple of miles, or at most four, will commonly relieve the\nmost extreme susceptibility. For the advantages which fashion values\nare plants which thrive in very confined localities, in a few streets\nnamely. Out of this precinct they go for nothing; are of no use in the\nfarm, in the forest, in the market, in war, in the nuptial society, in\nthe literary or scientific circle, at sea, in friendship, in the heaven\nof thought or virtue.\nBut we have lingered long enough in these painted courts. The worth of\nthe thing signified must vindicate our taste for the emblem. Everything\nthat is called fashion and courtesy humbles itself before the cause and\nfountain of honor, creator of titles and dignities, namely the heart of\nlove. This is the royal blood, this the fire, which, in all countries\nand contingencies, will work after its kind and conquer and expand\nall that approaches it. This gives new meanings to every fact. This\nimpoverishes the rich, suffering no grandeur but its own. What is rich?\nAre you rich enough to help anybody? to succor the unfashionable and the\neccentric? rich enough to make the Canadian in his wagon, the itinerant\nwith his consul's paper which commends him \"To the charitable,\" the\nswarthy Italian with his few broken words of English, the lame pauper\nhunted by overseers from town to town, even the poor insane or besotted\nwreck of man or woman, feel the noble exception of your presence and\nyour house from the general bleakness and stoniness; to make such feel\nthat they were greeted with a voice which made them both remember and\nhope? What is vulgar but to refuse the claim on acute and conclusive\nreasons? What is gentle, but to allow it, and give their heart and yours\none holiday from the national caution? Without the rich heart, wealth is\nan ugly beggar. The king of Schiraz could not afford to be so bountiful\nas the poor Osman who dwelt at his gate. Osman had a humanity so broad\nand deep that although his speech was so bold and free with the Koran\nas to disgust all the dervishes, yet was there never a poor outcast,\neccentric, or insane man, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who\nhad been mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his brain, but\nfled at once to him; that great heart lay there so sunny and hospitable\nin the centre of the country, that it seemed as if the instinct of all\nsufferers drew them to his side. And the madness which he harbored he\ndid not share. Is not this to be rich? this only to be rightly rich?\nBut I shall hear without pain that I play the courtier very ill, and\ntalk of that which I do not well understand. It is easy to see, that\nwhat is called by distinction society and fashion has good laws as well\nas bad, has much that is necessary, and much that is absurd. Too good\nfor banning, and too bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition\nof the pagan mythology, in any attempt to settle its character. 'I\noverheard Jove, one day,' said Silenus, 'talking of destroying the\nearth; he said it had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, who went\nfrom bad to worse, as fast as the days succeeded each other. Minerva\nsaid she hoped not; they were only ridiculous little creatures, with\nthis odd circumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate aspect,\nseen far or seen near; if you called them bad, they would appear so; if\nyou called them good, they would appear so; and there was no one person\nor action among them, which would not puzzle her owl, much more all\nOlympus, to know whether it was fundamentally bad or good.'\n*****\nGIFTS.\nGifts of one who loved me,--\n'T was high time they came;\nWhen he ceased to love me,\nTime they stopped for shame.\nV. GIFTS.\nIT is said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy; that the world\nowes the world more than the world can pay, and ought to go into\nchancery and be sold. I do not think this general insolvency, which\ninvolves in some sort all the population, to be the reason of the\ndifficulty experienced at Christmas and New Year and other times, in\nbestowing gifts; since it is always so pleasant to be generous, though\nvery vexatious to pay debts. But the impediment lies in the choosing.\nIf at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to\nsomebody, I am puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone.\nFlowers and fruits are always fit presents; flowers, because they are a\nproud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the\nworld. These gay natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of\nordinary nature: they are like music heard out of a work-house.\nNature does not cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not fond;\neverything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal\nlaws. Yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference\nof love and beauty. Men use to tell us that we love flattery even though\nwe are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance\nenough to be courted. Something like that pleasure, the flowers give us:\nwhat am I to whom these sweet hints are addressed? Fruits are acceptable\ngifts, because they are the flower of commodities, and admit of\nfantastic values being attached to them. If a man should send to me to\ncome a hundred miles to visit him and should set before me a basket of\nfine summer-fruit, I should think there was some proportion between the\nlabor and the reward.\nFor common gifts, necessity makes pertinences and beauty every day, and\none is glad when an imperative leaves him no option; since if the man\nat the door have no shoes, you have not to consider whether you could\nprocure him a paint-box. And as it is always pleasing to see a man eat\nbread, or drink water, in the house or out of doors, so it is always\na great satisfaction to supply these first wants. Necessity does\neverything well. In our condition of universal dependence it seems\nheroic to let the petitioner be the judge of his necessity, and to give\nall that is asked, though at great inconvenience. If it be a fantastic\ndesire, it is better to leave to others the office of punishing him. I\ncan think of many parts I should prefer playing to that of the Furies.\nNext to things of necessity, the rule for a gift, which one of my\nfriends prescribed, is that we might convey to some person that which\nproperly belonged to his character, and was easily associated with him\nin thought. But our tokens of compliment and love are for the most\npart barbarous. Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for\ngifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself. Thou must bleed for me.\nTherefore the poet brings his poem; the shepherd, his lamb; the farmer,\ncorn; the miner, a gem; the sailor, coral and shells; the painter, his\npicture; the girl, a handkerchief of her own sewing. This is right and\npleasing, for it restores society in so far to its primary basis, when\na man's biography is conveyed in his gift, and every man's wealth is an\nindex of his merit. But it is a cold lifeless business when you go to\nthe shops to buy me something which does not represent your life and\ntalent, but a goldsmith's. This is fit for kings, and rich men who\nrepresent kings, and a false state of property, to make presents of gold\nand silver stuffs, as a kind of symbolical sin-offering, or payment of\nblack-mail.\nThe law of benefits is a difficult channel, which requires careful\nsailing, or rude boats. It is not the office of a man to receive gifts.\nHow dare you give them? We wish to be self-sustained. We do not quite\nforgive a giver. The hand that feeds us is in some danger of being\nbitten. We can receive anything from love, for that is a way of\nreceiving it from ourselves; but not from any one who assumes to bestow.\nWe sometimes hate the meat which we eat, because there seems something\nof degrading dependence in living by it:--\n\"Brother, if Jove to thee a present make,\nTake heed that from his hands thou nothing take.\"\nWe ask the whole. Nothing less will content us. We arraign society if\nit do not give us, besides earth and fire and water, opportunity, love,\nreverence, and objects of veneration.\nHe is a good man who can receive a gift well. We are either glad or\nsorry at a gift, and both emotions are unbecoming. Some violence I think\nis done, some degradation borne, when I rejoice or grieve at a gift. I\nam sorry when my independence is invaded, or when a gift comes from such\nas do not know my spirit, and so the act is not supported; and if the\ngift pleases me overmuch, then I should be ashamed that the donor should\nread my heart, and see that I love his commodity, and not him. The gift,\nto be true, must be the flowing of the giver unto me, correspondent to\nmy flowing unto him. When the waters are at level, then my goods pass\nto him, and his to me. All his are mine, all mine his. I say to him, How\ncan you give me this pot of oil or this flagon of wine when all your oil\nand wine is mine, which belief of mine this gift seems to deny? Hence\nthe fitness of beautiful, not useful things, for gifts. This giving is\nflat usurpation, and therefore when the beneficiary is ungrateful, as\nall beneficiaries hate all Timons, not at all considering the value of\nthe gift but looking back to the greater store it was taken from,--I\nrather sympathize with the beneficiary than with the anger of my lord\nTimon. For the expectation of gratitude is mean, and is continually\npunished by the total insensibility of the obliged person. It is a great\nhappiness to get off without injury and heart-burning from one who has\nhad the ill-luck to be served by you. It is a very onerous business,\nthis of being served, and the debtor naturally wishes to give you a\nslap. A golden text for these gentlemen is that which I so admire in\nthe Buddhist, who never thanks, and who says, \"Do not flatter your\nbenefactors.\"\nThe reason of these discords I conceive to be that there is no\ncommensurability between a man and any gift. You cannot give anything to\na magnanimous person. After you have served him he at once puts you in\ndebt by his magnanimity. The service a man renders his friend is trivial\nand selfish compared with the service he knows his friend stood in\nreadiness to yield him, alike before he had begun to serve his friend,\nand now also. Compared with that good-will I bear my friend, the benefit\nit is in my power to render him seems small. Besides, our action on each\nother, good as well as evil, is so incidental and at random that we can\nseldom hear the acknowledgments of any person who would thank us for\na benefit, without some shame and humiliation. We can rarely strike a\ndirect stroke, but must be content with an oblique one; we seldom\nhave the satisfaction of yielding a direct benefit which is directly\nreceived. But rectitude scatters favors on every side without knowing\nit, and receives with wonder the thanks of all people.\nI fear to breathe any treason against the majesty of love, which is the\ngenius and god of gifts, and to whom we must not affect to prescribe.\nLet him give kingdoms or flower-leaves indifferently. There are persons\nfrom whom we always expect fairy-tokens; let us not cease to expect\nthem. This is prerogative, and not to be limited by our municipal rules.\nFor the rest, I like to see that we cannot be bought and sold. The best\nof hospitality and of generosity is also not in the will, but in fate. I\nfind that I am not much to you; you do not need me; you do not feel me;\nthen am I thrust out of doors, though you proffer me house and lands. No\nservices are of any value, but only likeness. When I have attempted to\njoin myself to others by services, it proved an intellectual trick,--no\nmore. They eat your service like apples, and leave you out. But love\nthem, and they feel you and delight in you all the time.\n*****\nNATURE.\nThe rounded world is fair to see,\nNine times folded in mystery:\nThough baffled seers cannot impart\nThe secret of its laboring heart,\nThrob thine with Nature's throbbing breast,\nAnd all is clear from east to west.\nSpirit that lurks each form within\nBeckons to spirit of its kin;\nSelf-kindled every atom glows,\nAnd hints the future which it owes.\nVI. NATURE.\nTHERE are days which occur in this climate, at almost any season of\nthe year, wherein the world reaches its perfection; when the air,\nthe heavenly bodies and the earth, make a harmony, as if nature would\nindulge her offspring; when, in these bleak upper sides of the planet,\nnothing is to desire that we have heard of the happiest latitudes, and\nwe bask in the shining hours of Florida and Cuba; when everything that\nhas life gives sign of satisfaction, and the cattle that lie on the\nground seem to have great and tranquil thoughts. These halcyons may be\nlooked for with a little more assurance in that pure October weather\nwhich we distinguish by the name of the Indian summer. The day,\nimmeasurably long, sleeps over the broad hills and warm wide fields.\nTo have lived through all its sunny hours, seems longevity enough. The\nsolitary places do not seem quite lonely. At the gates of the forest,\nthe surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates of\ngreat and small, wise and foolish. The knapsack of custom falls off his\nback with the first step he makes into these precincts. Here is sanctity\nwhich shames our religions, and reality which discredits our heroes.\nHere we find Nature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every other\ncircumstance, and judges like a god all men that come to her. We have\ncrept out of our close and crowded houses into the night and morning,\nand we see what majestic beauties daily wrap us in their bosom. How\nwillingly we would escape the barriers which render them comparatively\nimpotent, escape the sophistication and second thought, and suffer\nnature to intrance us. The tempered light of the woods is like a\nperpetual morning, and is stimulating and heroic. The anciently reported\nspells of these places creep on us. The stems of pines, hemlocks, and\noaks almost gleam like iron on the excited eye. The incommunicable trees\nbegin to persuade us to live with them, and quit our life of solemn\ntrifles. Here no history, or church, or state, is interpolated on the\ndivine sky and the immortal year. How easily we might walk onward into\nthe opening landscape, absorbed by new pictures and by thoughts fast\nsucceeding each other, until by degrees the recollection of home was\ncrowded out of the mind, all memory obliterated by the tyranny of the\npresent, and we were led in triumph by nature.\nThese enchantments are medicinal, they sober and heal us. These are\nplain pleasures, kindly and native to us. We come to our own, and make\nfriends with matter, which the ambitious chatter of the schools would\npersuade us to despise. We never can part with it; the mind loves its\nold home: as water to our thirst, so is the rock, the ground, to our\neyes and hands and feet. It is firm water; it is cold flame; what\nhealth, what affinity! Ever an old friend, ever like a dear friend and\nbrother when we chat affectedly with strangers, comes in this honest\nface, and takes a grave liberty with us, and shames us out of our\nnonsense. Cities give not the human senses room enough. We go out daily\nand nightly to feed the eyes on the horizon, and require so much scope,\njust as we need water for our bath. There are all degrees of natural\ninfluence, from these quarantine powers of nature, up to her dearest\nand gravest ministrations to the imagination and the soul. There is the\nbucket of cold water from the spring, the wood-fire to which the chilled\ntraveller rushes for safety,--and there is the sublime moral of autumn\nand of noon. We nestle in nature, and draw our living as parasites from\nher roots and grains, and we receive glances from the heavenly bodies,\nwhich call us to solitude and foretell the remotest future. The blue\nzenith is the point in which romance and reality meet. I think if\nwe should be rapt away into all that we dream of heaven, and should\nconverse with Gabriel and Uriel, the upper sky would be all that would\nremain of our furniture.\nIt seems as if the day was not wholly profane in which we have given\nheed to some natural object. The fall of snowflakes in a still air,\npreserving to each crystal its perfect form; the blowing of sleet over\na wide sheet of water, and over plains; the waving ryefield; the mimic\nwaving of acres of houstonia, whose innumerable florets whiten and\nripple before the eye; the reflections of trees and flowers in glassy\nlakes; the musical steaming odorous south wind, which converts all trees\nto windharps; the crackling and spurting of hemlock in the flames, or\nof pine logs, which yield glory to the walls and faces in the\nsittingroom,--these are the music and pictures of the most ancient\nreligion. My house stands in low land, with limited outlook, and on the\nskirt of the village. But I go with my friend to the shore of our little\nriver, and with one stroke of the paddle I leave the village politics\nand personalities, yes, and the world of villages and personalities\nbehind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight, too\nbright almost for spotted man to enter without novitiate and probation.\nWe penetrate bodily this incredible beauty; we dip our hands in this\npainted element; our eyes are bathed in these lights and forms.\nA holiday, a villeggiatura, a royal revel, the proudest, most\nheart-rejoicing festival that valor and beauty, power and taste, ever\ndecked and enjoyed, establishes itself on the instant. These sunset\nclouds, these delicately emerging stars, with their private and\nineffable glances, signify it and proffer it. I am taught the poorness\nof our invention, the ugliness of towns and palaces. Art and luxury\nhave early learned that they must work as enhancement and sequel to this\noriginal beauty. I am overinstructed for my return. Henceforth I shall\nbe hard to please. I cannot go back to toys. I am grown expensive and\nsophisticated. I can no longer live without elegance, but a countryman\nshall be my master of revels. He who knows the most; he who knows\nwhat sweets and virtues are in the ground, the waters, the plants, the\nheavens, and how to come at these enchantments,--is the rich and royal\nman. Only as far as the masters of the world have called in nature\nto their aid, can they reach the height of magnificence. This is the\nmeaning of their hanging-gardens, villas, garden-houses, islands,\nparks and preserves, to back their faulty personality with these\nstrong accessories. I do not wonder that the landed interest should be\ninvincible in the State with these dangerous auxiliaries. These bribe\nand invite; not kings, not palaces, not men, not women, but these tender\nand poetic stars, eloquent of secret promises. We heard what the rich\nman said, we knew of his villa, his grove, his wine and his company, but\nthe provocation and point of the invitation came out of these beguiling\nstars. In their soft glances I see what men strove to realize in some\nVersailles, or Paphos, or Ctesiphon. Indeed, it is the magical lights of\nthe horizon and the blue sky for the background which save all our works\nof art, which were otherwise bawbles. When the rich tax the poor with\nservility and obsequiousness, they should consider the effect of men\nreputed to be the possessors of nature, on imaginative minds. Ah! if\nthe rich were rich as the poor fancy riches! A boy hears a military\nband play on the field at night, and he has kings and queens and famous\nchivalry palpably before him. He hears the echoes of a horn in a\nhill country, in the Notch Mountains, for example, which converts the\nmountains into an Aeolian harp,--and this supernatural tiralira restores\nto him the Dorian mythology, Apollo, Diana, and all divine hunters and\nhuntresses. Can a musical note be so lofty, so haughtily beautiful!\nTo the poor young poet, thus fabulous is his picture of society; he\nis loyal; he respects the rich; they are rich for the sake of his\nimagination; how poor his fancy would be, if they were not rich! That\nthey have some high-fenced grove which they call a park; that they live\nin larger and better-garnished saloons than he has visited, and go in\ncoaches, keeping only the society of the elegant, to watering-places\nand to distant cities,--these make the groundwork from which he\nhas delineated estates of romance, compared with which their actual\npossessions are shanties and paddocks. The muse herself betrays her son,\nand enhances the gifts of wealth and well-born beauty by a radiation\nout of the air, and clouds, and forests that skirt the road,--a certain\nhaughty favor, as if from patrician genii to patricians, a kind of\naristocracy in nature, a prince of the power of the air.\nThe moral sensibility which makes Edens and Tempes so easily, may not be\nalways found, but the material landscape is never far off. We can\nfind these enchantments without visiting the Como Lake, or the Madeira\nIslands. We exaggerate the praises of local scenery. In every landscape\nthe point of astonishment is the meeting of the sky and the earth,\nand that is seen from the first hillock as well as from the top of the\nAlleghanies. The stars at night stoop down over the brownest, homeliest\ncommon with all the spiritual magnificence which they shed on the\nCampagna, or on the marble deserts of Egypt. The uprolled clouds and the\ncolors of morning and evening will transfigure maples and alders. The\ndifference between landscape and landscape is small, but there is\ngreat difference in the beholders. There is nothing so wonderful in any\nparticular landscape as the necessity of being beautiful under which\nevery landscape lies. Nature cannot be surprised in undress. Beauty\nbreaks in everywhere.\nBut it is very easy to outrun the sympathy of readers on this topic,\nwhich schoolmen called natura naturata, or nature passive. One can\nhardly speak directly of it without excess. It is as easy to broach in\nmixed companies what is called \"the subject of religion.\" A susceptible\nperson does not like to indulge his tastes in this kind without the\napology of some trivial necessity: he goes to see a wood-lot, or to look\nat the crops, or to fetch a plant or a mineral from a remote locality,\nor he carries a fowling-piece or a fishing-rod. I suppose this shame\nmust have a good reason. A dilettantism in nature is barren and\nunworthy. The fop of fields is no better than his brother of Broadway.\nMen are naturally hunters and inquisitive of wood-craft, and I suppose\nthat such a gazetteer as wood-cutters and Indians should furnish facts\nfor, would take place in the most sumptuous drawing-rooms of all the\n\"Wreaths\" and \"Flora's chaplets\" of the bookshops; yet ordinarily,\nwhether we are too clumsy for so subtle a topic, or from whatever\ncause, as soon as men begin to write on nature, they fall into euphuism.\nFrivolity is a most unfit tribute to Pan, who ought to be represented\nin the mythology as the most continent of gods. I would not be frivolous\nbefore the admirable reserve and prudence of time, yet I cannot renounce\nthe right of returning often to this old topic. The multitude of false\nchurches accredits the true religion. Literature, poetry, science are\nthe homage of man to this unfathomed secret, concerning which no sane\nman can affect an indifference or incuriosity. Nature is loved by what\nis best in us. It is loved as the city of God, although, or rather\nbecause there is no citizen. The sunset is unlike anything that is\nunderneath it: it wants men. And the beauty of nature must always seem\nunreal and mocking, until the landscape has human figures that are\nas good as itself. If there were good men, there would never be this\nrapture in nature. If the king is in the palace, nobody looks at the\nwalls. It is when he is gone, and the house is filled with grooms and\ngazers, that we turn from the people to find relief in the majestic men\nthat are suggested by the pictures and the architecture. The critics who\ncomplain of the sickly separation of the beauty of nature from the\nthing to be done, must consider that our hunting of the picturesque\nis inseparable from our protest against false society. Man is fallen;\nnature is erect, and serves as a differential thermometer, detecting\nthe presence or absence of the divine sentiment in man. By fault of our\ndulness and selfishness we are looking up to nature, but when we are\nconvalescent, nature will look up to us. We see the foaming brook with\ncompunction: if our own life flowed with the right energy, we should\nshame the brook. The stream of zeal sparkles with real fire, and not\nwith reflex rays of sun and moon. Nature may be as selfishly studied as\ntrade. Astronomy to the selfish becomes astrology; psychology, mesmerism\n(with intent to show where our spoons are gone); and anatomy and\nphysiology become phrenology and palmistry.\nBut taking timely warning, and leaving many things unsaid on this\ntopic, let us not longer omit our homage to the Efficient Nature, natura\nnaturans, the quick cause before which all forms flee as the driven\nsnows; itself secret, its works driven before it in flocks and\nmultitudes, (as the ancient represented nature by Proteus, a shepherd,)\nand in undescribable variety. It publishes itself in creatures, reaching\nfrom particles and spiculae through transformation on transformation to\nthe highest symmetries, arriving at consummate results without a\nshock or a leap. A little heat, that is a little motion, is all that\ndifferences the bald, dazzling white and deadly cold poles of the earth\nfrom the prolific tropical climates. All changes pass without violence,\nby reason of the two cardinal conditions of boundless space and\nboundless time. Geology has initiated us into the secularity of nature,\nand taught us to disuse our dame-school measures, and exchange our\nMosaic and Ptolemaic schemes for her large style. We knew nothing\nrightly, for want of perspective. Now we learn what patient periods\nmust round themselves before the rock is formed; then before the rock\nis broken, and the first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest\nexternal plate into soil, and opened the door for the remote Flora,\nFauna, Ceres, and Pomona to come in. How far off yet is the trilobite!\nhow far the quadruped! how inconceivably remote is man! All duly arrive,\nand then race after race of men. It is a long way from granite to the\noyster; farther yet to Plato and the preaching of the immortality of the\nsoul. Yet all must come, as surely as the first atom has two sides.\nMotion or change and identity or rest are the first and second secrets\nof nature:--Motion and Rest. The whole code of her laws may be written\non the thumbnail, or the signet of a ring. The whirling bubble on the\nsurface of a brook admits us to the secret of the mechanics of the sky.\nEvery shell on the beach is a key to it. A little water made to rotate\nin a cup explains the formation of the simpler shells; the addition of\nmatter from year to year, arrives at last at the most complex forms; and\nyet so poor is nature with all her craft, that from the beginning to the\nend of the universe she has but one stuff,--but one stuff with its two\nends, to serve up all her dream-like variety. Compound it how she will,\nstar, sand, fire, water, tree, man, it is still one stuff, and betrays\nthe same properties.\nNature is always consistent, though she feigns to contravene her own\nlaws. She keeps her laws, and seems to transcend them. She arms and\nequips an animal to find its place and living in the earth, and at the\nsame time she arms and equips another animal to destroy it. Space exists\nto divide creatures; but by clothing the sides of a bird with a few\nfeathers she gives him a petty omnipresence. The direction is forever\nonward, but the artist still goes back for materials and begins again\nwith the first elements on the most advanced stage: otherwise all goes\nto ruin. If we look at her work, we seem to catch a glance of a system\nin transition. Plants are the young of the world, vessels of health and\nvigor; but they grope ever upward towards consciousness; the trees are\nimperfect men, and seem to bemoan their imprisonment, rooted in the\nground. The animal is the novice and probationer of a more advanced\norder. The men, though young, having tasted the first drop from the\ncup of thought, are already dissipated: the maples and ferns are still\nuncorrupt; yet no doubt when they come to consciousness they too will\ncurse and swear. Flowers so strictly belong to youth that we adult men\nsoon come to feel that their beautiful generations concern not us: we\nhave had our day; now let the children have theirs. The flowers jilt us,\nand we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness.\nThings are so strictly related, that according to the skill of the\neye, from any one object the parts and properties of any other may be\npredicted. If we had eyes to see it, a bit of stone from the city wall\nwould certify us of the necessity that man must exist, as readily as\nthe city. That identity makes us all one, and reduces to nothing great\nintervals on our customary scale. We talk of deviations from natural\nlife, as if artificial life were not also natural. The smoothest curled\ncourtier in the boudoirs of a palace has an animal nature, rude and\naboriginal as a white bear, omnipotent to its own ends, and is\ndirectly related, there amid essences and billetsdoux, to Himmaleh\nmountain-chains and the axis of the globe. If we consider how much\nwe are nature's, we need not be superstitious about towns, as if that\nterrific or benefic force did not find us there also, and fashion\ncities. Nature, who made the mason, made the house. We may easily hear\ntoo much of rural influences. The cool disengaged air of natural objects\nmakes them enviable to us, chafed and irritable creatures with red\nfaces, and we think we shall be as grand as they if we camp out and eat\nroots; but let us be men instead of woodchucks and the oak and the elm\nshall gladly serve us, though we sit in chairs of ivory on carpets of\nsilk.\nThis guiding identity runs through all the surprises and contrasts of\nthe piece, and characterizes every law. Man carries the world in his\nhead, the whole astronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought. Because\nthe history of nature is charactered in his brain, therefore is he\nthe prophet and discoverer of her secrets. Every known fact in natural\nscience was divined by the presentiment of somebody, before it was\nactually verified. A man does not tie his shoe without recognizing laws\nwhich bind the farthest regions of nature: moon, plant, gas, crystal,\nare concrete geometry and numbers. Common sense knows its own, and\nrecognizes the fact at first sight in chemical experiment. The common\nsense of Franklin, Dalton, Davy and Black, is the same common sense\nwhich made the arrangements which now it discovers.\nIf the identity expresses organized rest, the counter action runs also\ninto organization. The astronomers said, 'Give us matter and a little\nmotion and we will construct the universe. It is not enough that we\nshould have matter, we must also have a single impulse, one shove\nto launch the mass and generate the harmony of the centrifugal and\ncentripetal forces. Once heave the ball from the hand, and we can show\nhow all this mighty order grew.'--'A very unreasonable postulate,' said\nthe metaphysicians, 'and a plain begging of the question. Could you not\nprevail to know the genesis of projection, as well as the continuation\nof it?' Nature, meanwhile, had not waited for the discussion, but, right\nor wrong, bestowed the impulse, and the balls rolled. It was no great\naffair, a mere push, but the astronomers were right in making much of\nit, for there is no end to the consequences of the act. That famous\naboriginal push propagates itself through all the balls of the\nsystem, and through every atom of every ball; through all the races of\ncreatures, and through the history and performances of every individual.\nExaggeration is in the course of things. Nature sends no creature, no\nman into the world without adding a small excess of his proper quality.\nGiven the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so to every\ncreature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path,\na shove to put it on its way; in every instance a slight generosity, a\ndrop too much. Without electricity the air would rot, and without this\nviolence of direction which men and women have, without a spice of bigot\nand fanatic, no excitement, no efficiency. We aim above the mark to hit\nthe mark. Every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration in it. And when\nnow and then comes along some sad, sharp-eyed man, who sees how paltry a\ngame is played, and refuses to play, but blabs the secret;--how then? Is\nthe bird flown? O no, the wary Nature sends a new troop of fairer forms,\nof lordlier youths, with a little more excess of direction to hold\nthem fast to their several aim; makes them a little wrongheaded in that\ndirection in which they are rightest, and on goes the game again with\nnew whirl, for a generation or two more. The child with his sweet\npranks, the fool of his senses, commanded by every sight and sound,\nwithout any power to compare and rank his sensations, abandoned to\na whistle or a painted chip, to a lead dragoon or a gingerbread-dog,\nindividualizing everything, generalizing nothing, delighted with every\nnew thing, lies down at night overpowered by the fatigue which this day\nof continual pretty madness has incurred. But Nature has answered her\npurpose with the curly, dimpled lunatic. She has tasked every faculty,\nand has secured the symmetrical growth of the bodily frame by all these\nattitudes and exertions,--an end of the first importance, which could\nnot be trusted to any care less perfect than her own. This glitter, this\nopaline lustre plays round the top of every toy to his eye to insure\nhis fidelity, and he is deceived to his good. We are made alive and kept\nalive by the same arts. Let the stoics say what they please, we do\nnot eat for the good of living, but because the meat is savory and\nthe appetite is keen. The vegetable life does not content itself with\ncasting from the flower or the tree a single seed, but it fills the\nair and earth with a prodigality of seeds, that, if thousands perish,\nthousands may plant themselves; that hundreds may come up, that tens may\nlive to maturity; that at least one may replace the parent. All things\nbetray the same calculated profusion. The excess of fear with which the\nanimal frame is hedged round, shrinking from cold, starting at sight\nof a snake, or at a sudden noise, protects us, through a multitude of\ngroundless alarms, from some one real danger at last. The lover seeks in\nmarriage his private felicity and perfection, with no prospective end;\nand nature hides in his happiness her own end, namely, progeny, or the\nperpetuity of the race.\nBut the craft with which the world is made, runs also into the mind and\ncharacter of men. No man is quite sane; each has a vein of folly in his\ncomposition, a slight determination of blood to the head, to make sure\nof holding him hard to some one point which nature had taken to heart.\nGreat causes are never tried on their merits; but the cause is reduced\nto particulars to suit the size of the partisans, and the contention is\never hottest on minor matters. Not less remarkable is the overfaith of\neach man in the importance of what he has to do or say. The poet, the\nprophet, has a higher value for what he utters than any hearer, and\ntherefore it gets spoken. The strong, self-complacent Luther declares\nwith an emphasis not to be mistaken, that \"God himself cannot do without\nwise men.\" Jacob Behmen and George Fox betray their egotism in the\npertinacity of their controversial tracts, and James Naylor once\nsuffered himself to be worshipped as the Christ. Each prophet comes\npresently to identify himself with his thought, and to esteem his hat\nand shoes sacred. However this may discredit such persons with the\njudicious, it helps them with the people, as it gives heat, pungency,\nand publicity to their words. A similar experience is not infrequent\nin private life. Each young and ardent person writes a diary, in which,\nwhen the hours of prayer and penitence arrive, he inscribes his soul.\nThe pages thus written are to him burning and fragrant; he reads them\non his knees by midnight and by the morning star; he wets them with his\ntears; they are sacred; too good for the world, and hardly yet to be\nshown to the dearest friend. This is the man-child that is born to the\nsoul, and her life still circulates in the babe. The umbilical cord\nhas not yet been cut. After some time has elapsed, he begins to wish to\nadmit his friend to this hallowed experience, and with hesitation, yet\nwith firmness, exposes the pages to his eye. Will they not burn his\neyes? The friend coldly turns them over, and passes from the writing to\nconversation, with easy transition, which strikes the other party with\nastonishment and vexation. He cannot suspect the writing itself. Days\nand nights of fervid life, of communion with angels of darkness and of\nlight have engraved their shadowy characters on that tear-stained book.\nHe suspects the intelligence or the heart of his friend. Is there then\nno friend? He cannot yet credit that one may have impressive experience\nand yet may not know how to put his private fact into literature; and\nperhaps the discovery that wisdom has other tongues and ministers than\nwe, that though we should hold our peace the truth would not the less be\nspoken, might check injuriously the flames of our zeal. A man can\nonly speak so long as he does not feel his speech to be partial and\ninadequate. It is partial, but he does not see it to be so whilst he\nutters it. As soon as he is released from the instinctive and particular\nand sees its partiality, he shuts his mouth in disgust. For no man can\nwrite anything who does not think that what he writes is for the time\nthe history of the world; or do anything well who does not esteem his\nwork to be of importance. My work may be of none, but I must not think\nit of none, or I shall not do it with impunity.\nIn like manner, there is throughout nature something mocking, something\nthat leads us on and on, but arrives nowhere; keeps no faith with\nus. All promise outruns the performance. We live in a system of\napproximations. Every end is prospective of some other end, which is\nalso temporary; a round and final success nowhere. We are encamped in\nnature, not domesticated. Hunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to\ndrink; but bread and wine, mix and cook them how you will, leave us\nhungry and thirsty, after the stomach is full. It is the same with all\nour arts and performances. Our music, our poetry, our language itself\nare not satisfactions, but suggestions. The hunger for wealth, which\nreduces the planet to a garden, fools the eager pursuer. What is the end\nsought? Plainly to secure the ends of good sense and beauty, from the\nintrusion of deformity or vulgarity of any kind. But what an operose\nmethod! What a train of means to secure a little conversation! This\npalace of brick and stone, these servants, this kitchen, these stables,\nhorses and equipage, this bank-stock and file of mortgages; trade to all\nthe world, country-house and cottage by the waterside, all for a little\nconversation, high, clear, and spiritual! Could it not be had as well\nby beggars on the highway? No, all these things came from successive\nefforts of these beggars to remove friction from the wheels of life, and\ngive opportunity. Conversation, character, were the avowed ends; wealth\nwas good as it appeased the animal cravings, cured the smoky chimney,\nsilenced the creaking door, brought friends together in a warm and\nquiet room, and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different\napartment. Thought, virtue, beauty, were the ends; but it was known that\nmen of thought and virtue sometimes had the headache, or wet feet, or\ncould lose good time whilst the room was getting warm in winter days.\nUnluckily, in the exertions necessary to remove these inconveniences,\nthe main attention has been diverted to this object; the old aims have\nbeen lost sight of, and to remove friction has come to be the end. That\nis the ridicule of rich men, and Boston, London, Vienna, and now the\ngovernments generally of the world are cities and governments of the\nrich; and the masses are not men, but poor men, that is, men who would\nbe rich; this is the ridicule of the class, that they arrive with pains\nand sweat and fury nowhere; when all is done, it is for nothing. They\nare like one who has interrupted the conversation of a company to make\nhis speech, and now has forgotten what he went to say. The appearance\nstrikes the eye everywhere of an aimless society, of aimless nations.\nWere the ends of nature so great and cogent as to exact this immense\nsacrifice of men?\nQuite analogous to the deceits in life, there is, as might be expected,\na similar effect on the eye from the face of external nature. There is\nin woods and waters a certain enticement and flattery, together with a\nfailure to yield a present satisfaction. This disappointment is felt\nin every landscape. I have seen the softness and beauty of the summer\nclouds floating feathery overhead, enjoying, as it seemed, their height\nand privilege of motion, whilst yet they appeared not so much the\ndrapery of this place and hour, as forelooking to some pavilions and\ngardens of festivity beyond. It is an odd jealousy, but the poet finds\nhimself not near enough to his object. The pine-tree, the river, the\nbank of flowers before him, does not seem to be nature. Nature is still\nelsewhere. This or this is but outskirt and far-off reflection and echo\nof the triumph that has passed by and is now at its glancing splendor\nand heyday, perchance in the neighboring fields, or, if you stand in\nthe field, then in the adjacent woods. The present object shall give you\nthis sense of stillness that follows a pageant which has just gone by.\nWhat splendid distance, what recesses of ineffable pomp and loveliness\nin the sunset! But who can go where they are, or lay his hand or plant\nhis foot thereon? Off they fall from the round world forever and ever.\nIt is the same among the men and women as among the silent trees; always\na referred existence, an absence, never a presence and satisfaction.\nIs it that beauty can never be grasped? in persons and in landscape\nis equally inaccessible? The accepted and betrothed lover has lost the\nwildest charm of his maiden in her acceptance of him. She was heaven\nwhilst he pursued her as a star: she cannot be heaven if she stoops to\nsuch a one as he.\nWhat shall we say of this omnipresent appearance of that first\nprojectile impulse, of this flattery and balking of so many well-meaning\ncreatures? Must we not suppose somewhere in the universe a slight\ntreachery and derision? Are we not engaged to a serious resentment of\nthis use that is made of us? Are we tickled trout, and fools of nature?\nOne look at the face of heaven and earth lays all petulance at rest,\nand soothes us to wiser convictions. To the intelligent, nature converts\nitself into a vast promise, and will not be rashly explained. Her secret\nis untold. Many and many an Oedipus arrives; he has the whole mystery\nteeming in his brain. Alas! the same sorcery has spoiled his skill;\nno syllable can he shape on his lips. Her mighty orbit vaults like the\nfresh rainbow into the deep, but no archangel's wing was yet strong\nenough to follow it and report of the return of the curve. But it\nalso appears that our actions are seconded and disposed to greater\nconclusions than we designed. We are escorted on every hand through life\nby spiritual agents, and a beneficent purpose lies in wait for us.\nWe cannot bandy words with Nature, or deal with her as we deal with\npersons. If we measure our individual forces against hers we may easily\nfeel as if we were the sport of an insuperable destiny. But if, instead\nof identifying ourselves with the work, we feel that the soul of the\nworkman streams through us, we shall find the peace of the morning\ndwelling first in our hearts, and the fathomless powers of gravity\nand chemistry, and, over them, of life, preexisting within us in their\nhighest form.\nThe uneasiness which the thought of our helplessness in the chain of\ncauses occasions us, results from looking too much at one condition\nof nature, namely, Motion. But the drag is never taken from the wheel.\nWherever the impulse exceeds, the Rest or Identity insinuates its\ncompensation. All over the wide fields of earth grows the prunella or\nself-heal. After every foolish day we sleep off the fumes and furies of\nits hours; and though we are always engaged with particulars, and\noften enslaved to them, we bring with us to every experiment the innate\nuniversal laws. These, while they exist in the mind as ideas, stand\naround us in nature forever embodied, a present sanity to expose and\ncure the insanity of men. Our servitude to particulars betrays into a\nhundred foolish expectations. We anticipate a new era from the invention\nof a locomotive, or a balloon; the new engine brings with it the old\nchecks. They say that by electro-magnetism your salad shall be grown\nfrom the seed whilst your fowl is roasting for dinner; it is a symbol of\nour modern aims and endeavors, of our condensation and acceleration of\nobjects;--but nothing is gained; nature cannot be cheated; man's life\nis but seventy salads long, grow they swift or grow they slow. In these\nchecks and impossibilities however we find our advantage, not less than\nin the impulses. Let the victory fall where it will, we are on that\nside. And the knowledge that we traverse the whole scale of being,\nfrom the centre to the poles of nature, and have some stake in every\npossibility, lends that sublime lustre to death, which philosophy and\nreligion have too outwardly and literally striven to express in the\npopular doctrine of the immortality of the soul. The reality is more\nexcellent than the report. Here is no ruin, no discontinuity, no spent\nball. The divine circulations never rest nor linger. Nature is the\nincarnation of a thought, and turns to a thought again, as ice becomes\nwater and gas. The world is mind precipitated, and the volatile essence\nis forever escaping again into the state of free thought. Hence the\nvirtue and pungency of the influence on the mind of natural objects,\nwhether inorganic or organized. Man imprisoned, man crystallized,\nman vegetative, speaks to man impersonated. That power which does not\nrespect quantity, which makes the whole and the particle its equal\nchannel, delegates its smile to the morning, and distils its essence\ninto every drop of rain. Every moment instructs, and every object: for\nwisdom is infused into every form. It has been poured into us as blood;\nit convulsed us as pain; it slid into us as pleasure; it enveloped us\nin dull, melancholy days, or in days of cheerful labor; we did not guess\nits essence until after a long time.\n*****\nPOLITICS.\nGold and iron are good\nTo buy iron and gold;\nAll earth's fleece and food\nFor their like are sold.\nBoded Merlin wise,\nProved Napoleon great,--\nNor kind nor coinage buys\nAught above its rate.\nFear, Craft, and Avarice\nCannot rear a State.\nOut of dust to build\nWhat is more than dust,--\nWalls Amphion piled\nPhoebus stablish must.\nWhen the Muses nine\nWith the Virtues meet,\nFind to their design\nAn Atlantic seat,\nBy green orchard boughs\nFended from the heat,\nWhere the statesman ploughs\nFurrow for the wheat;\nWhen the Church is social worth,\nWhen the state-house is the hearth,\nThen the perfect State is come,\nThe republican at home.\nVII. POLITICS.\nIn dealing with the State we ought to remember that its institution are\nnot aboriginal, though they existed before we were born; that they are\nnot superior to the citizen; that every one of them was once the act\nof a single man; every law and usage was a man's expedient to meet a\nparticular case; that they all are imitable, all alterable; we may\nmake as good, we may make better. Society is an illusion to the young\ncitizen. It lies before him in rigid repose, with certain names, men\nand institutions rooted like oak-trees to the centre, round which all\narrange themselves the best they can. But the old statesman knows that\nsociety is fluid; there are no such roots and centres, but any particle\nmay suddenly become the centre of the movement and compel the system\nto gyrate round it; as every man of strong will, like Pisistratus, or\nCromwell, does for a time, and every man of truth, like Plato or Paul,\ndoes forever. But politics rest on necessary foundations, and cannot be\ntreated with levity. Republics abound in young civilians, who believe\nthat the laws make the city, that grave modifications of the policy\nand modes of living and employments of the population, that commerce,\neducation, and religion, may be voted in or out; and that any measure,\nthough it were absurd, may be imposed on a people if only you can get\nsufficient voices to make it a law. But the wise know that foolish\nlegislation is a rope of sand which perishes in the twisting; that\nthe State must follow and not lead the character and progress of the\ncitizen; the strongest usurper is quickly got rid of; and they only\nwho build on Ideas, build for eternity; and that the form of government\nwhich prevails is the expression of what cultivation exists in the\npopulation which permits it. The law is only a memorandum. We are\nsuperstitious, and esteem the statute somewhat: so much life as it has\nin the character of living men is its force. The statute stands there to\nsay, Yesterday we agreed so and so, but how feel ye this article to-day?\nOur statute is a currency which we stamp with our own portrait: it soon\nbecomes unrecognizable, and in process of time will return to the mint.\nNature is not democratic, nor limited-monarchical, but despotic, and\nwill not be fooled or abated of any jot of her authority by the\npertest of her sons; and as fast as the public mind is opened to more\nintelligence, the code is seen to be brute and stammering. It speaks not\narticulately, and must be made to. Meantime the education of the general\nmind never stops. The reveries of the true and simple are prophetic.\nWhat the tender poetic youth dreams, and prays, and paints to-day, but\nshuns the ridicule of saying aloud, shall presently be the resolutions\nof public bodies; then shall be carried as grievance and bill of\nrights through conflict and war, and then shall be triumphant law and\nestablishment for a hundred years, until it gives place in turn to\nnew prayers and pictures. The history of the State sketches in coarse\noutline the progress of thought, and follows at a distance the delicacy\nof culture and of aspiration.\nThe theory of politics which has possessed the mind of men, and which\nthey have expressed the best they could in their laws and in their\nrevolutions, considers persons and property as the two objects for whose\nprotection government exists. Of persons, all have equal rights, in\nvirtue of being identical in nature. This interest of course with its\nwhole power demands a democracy. Whilst the rights of all as persons are\nequal, in virtue of their access to reason, their rights in property are\nvery unequal. One man owns his clothes, and another owns a county. This\naccident, depending primarily on the skill and virtue of the parties,\nof which there is every degree, and secondarily on patrimony, falls\nunequally, and its rights of course are unequal. Personal rights,\nuniversally the same, demand a government framed on the ratio of the\ncensus; property demands a government framed on the ratio of owners and\nof owning. Laban, who has flocks and herds, wishes them looked after by\nan officer on the frontiers, lest the Midianites shall drive them off;\nand pays a tax to that end. Jacob has no flocks or herds and no fear of\nthe Midianites, and pays no tax to the officer. It seemed fit that Laban\nand Jacob should have equal rights to elect the officer who is to defend\ntheir persons, but that Laban and not Jacob should elect the officer\nwho is to guard the sheep and cattle. And if question arise whether\nadditional officers or watch-towers should be provided, must not Laban\nand Isaac, and those who must sell part of their herds to buy protection\nfor the rest, judge better of this, and with more right, than Jacob,\nwho, because he is a youth and a traveller, eats their bread and not his\nown?\nIn the earliest society the proprietors made their own wealth, and so\nlong as it comes to the owners in the direct way, no other opinion would\narise in any equitable community than that property should make the law\nfor property, and persons the law for persons.\nBut property passes through donation or inheritance to those who do not\ncreate it. Gift, in one case, makes it as really the new owner's, as\nlabor made it the first owner's: in the other case, of patrimony, the\nlaw makes an ownership which will be valid in each man's view according\nto the estimate which he sets on the public tranquillity.\nIt was not however found easy to embody the readily admitted principle\nthat property should make law for property, and persons for persons;\nsince persons and property mixed themselves in every transaction.\nAt last it seemed settled that the rightful distinction was that the\nproprietors should have more elective franchise than non-proprietors,\non the Spartan principle of \"calling that which is just, equal; not that\nwhich is equal, just.\"\nThat principle no longer looks so self-evident as it appeared in former\ntimes, partly, because doubts have arisen whether too much weight had\nnot been allowed in the laws to property, and such a structure given to\nour usages as allowed the rich to encroach on the poor, and to keep them\npoor; but mainly because there is an instinctive sense, however obscure\nand yet inarticulate, that the whole constitution of property, on\nits present tenures, is injurious, and its influence on persons\ndeteriorating and degrading; that truly the only interest for the\nconsideration of the State is persons; that property will always follow\npersons; that the highest end of government is the culture of men; and\nif men can be educated, the institutions will share their improvement\nand the moral sentiment will write the law of the land.\nIf it be not easy to settle the equity of this question, the peril is\nless when we take note of our natural defences. We are kept by better\nguards than the vigilance of such magistrates as we commonly elect.\nSociety always consists in greatest part of young and foolish persons.\nThe old, who have seen through the hypocrisy of courts and statesmen,\ndie and leave no wisdom to their sons. They believe their own newspaper,\nas their fathers did at their age. With such an ignorant and deceivable\nmajority, States would soon run to ruin, but that there are limitations\nbeyond which the folly and ambition of governors cannot go. Things\nhave their laws, as well as men; and things refuse to be trifled with.\nProperty will be protected. Corn will not grow unless it is planted and\nmanured; but the farmer will not plant or hoe it unless the chances\nare a hundred to one that he will cut and harvest it. Under any forms,\npersons and property must and will have their just sway. They exert\ntheir power, as steadily as matter its attraction. Cover up a pound of\nearth never so cunningly, divide and subdivide it; melt it to liquid,\nconvert it to gas; it will always weigh a pound; it will always attract\nand resist other matter by the full virtue of one pound weight:--and\nthe attributes of a person, his wit and his moral energy, will exercise,\nunder any law or extinguishing tyranny, their proper force,--if not\novertly, then covertly; if not for the law, then against it; if not\nwholesomely, then poisonously; with right, or by might.\nThe boundaries of personal influence it is impossible to fix, as persons\nare organs of moral or supernatural force. Under the dominion of an\nidea which possesses the minds of multitudes, as civil freedom, or the\nreligious sentiment, the powers of persons are no longer subjects of\ncalculation. A nation of men unanimously bent on freedom or conquest\ncan easily confound the arithmetic of statists, and achieve extravagant\nactions, out of all proportion to their means; as the Greeks, the\nSaracens, the Swiss, the Americans, and the French have done.\nIn like manner to every particle of property belongs its own attraction.\nA cent is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other\ncommodity. Its value is in the necessities of the animal man. It is so\nmuch warmth, so much bread, so much water, so much land. The law may\ndo what it will with the owner of property; its just power will still\nattach to the cent. The law may in a mad freak say that all shall\nhave power except the owners of property; they shall have no vote.\nNevertheless, by a higher law, the property will, year after year, write\nevery statute that respects property. The non-proprietor will be the\nscribe of the proprietor. What the owners wish to do, the whole power of\nproperty will do, either through the law or else in defiance of it. Of\ncourse I speak of all the property, not merely of the great estates.\nWhen the rich are outvoted, as frequently happens, it is the joint\ntreasury of the poor which exceeds their accumulations. Every man owns\nsomething, if it is only a cow, or a wheel-barrow, or his arms, and so\nhas that property to dispose of.\nThe same necessity which secures the rights of person and property\nagainst the malignity or folly of the magistrate, determines the form\nand methods of governing, which are proper to each nation and to its\nhabit of thought, and nowise transferable to other states of society. In\nthis country we are very vain of our political institutions, which are\nsingular in this, that they sprung, within the memory of living men,\nfrom the character and condition of the people, which they still express\nwith sufficient fidelity,--and we ostentatiously prefer them to any\nother in history. They are not better, but only fitter for us. We may be\nwise in asserting the advantage in modern times of the democratic\nform, but to other states of society, in which religion consecrated the\nmonarchical, that and not this was expedient. Democracy is better for\nus, because the religious sentiment of the present time accords better\nwith it. Born democrats, we are nowise qualified to judge of monarchy,\nwhich, to our fathers living in the monarchical idea, was also\nrelatively right. But our institutions, though in coincidence with the\nspirit of the age, have not any exemption from the practical defects\nwhich have discredited other forms. Every actual State is corrupt. Good\nmen must not obey the laws too well. What satire on government can equal\nthe severity of censure conveyed in the word politic, which now for ages\nhas signified cunning, intimating that the State is a trick?\nThe same benign necessity and the same practical abuse appear in\nthe parties, into which each State divides itself, of opponents and\ndefenders of the administration of the government. Parties are also\nfounded on instincts, and have better guides to their own humble aims\nthan the sagacity of their leaders. They have nothing perverse in their\norigin, but rudely mark some real and lasting relation. We might as\nwisely reprove the east wind or the frost, as a political party, whose\nmembers, for the most part, could give no account of their position, but\nstand for the defence of those interests in which they find themselves.\nOur quarrel with them begins when they quit this deep natural ground at\nthe bidding of some leader, and obeying personal considerations, throw\nthemselves into the maintenance and defence of points nowise belonging\nto their system. A party is perpetually corrupted by personality. Whilst\nwe absolve the association from dishonesty, we cannot extend the same\ncharity to their leaders. They reap the rewards of the docility and zeal\nof the masses which they direct. Ordinarily our parties are parties of\ncircumstance, and not of principle; as the planting interest in conflict\nwith the commercial; the party of capitalists and that of operatives;\nparties which are identical in their moral character, and which can\neasily change ground with each other in the support of many of their\nmeasures. Parties of principle, as, religious sects, or the party of\nfree-trade, of universal suffrage, of abolition of slavery, of abolition\nof capital punishment,--degenerate into personalities, or would inspire\nenthusiasm. The vice of our leading parties in this country (which may\nbe cited as a fair specimen of these societies of opinion) is that they\ndo not plant themselves on the deep and necessary grounds to which they\nare respectively entitled, but lash themselves to fury in the carrying\nof some local and momentary measure, nowise useful to the commonwealth.\nOf the two great parties which at this hour almost share the nation\nbetween them, I should say that one has the best cause, and the other\ncontains the best men. The philosopher, the poet, or the religious man\nwill of course wish to cast his vote with the democrat, for free-trade,\nfor wide suffrage, for the abolition of legal cruelties in the penal\ncode, and for facilitating in every manner the access of the young and\nthe poor to the sources of wealth and power. But he can rarely\naccept the persons whom the so-called popular party propose to him as\nrepresentatives of these liberalities. They have not at heart the ends\nwhich give to the name of democracy what hope and virtue are in it. The\nspirit of our American radicalism is destructive and aimless: it is not\nloving; it has no ulterior and divine ends, but is destructive only out\nof hatred and selfishness. On the other side, the conservative party,\ncomposed of the most moderate, able, and cultivated part of the\npopulation, is timid, and merely defensive of property. It vindicates\nno right, it aspires to no real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no\ngenerous policy; it does not build, nor write, nor cherish the arts,\nnor foster religion, nor establish schools, nor encourage science,\nnor emancipate the slave, nor befriend the poor, or the Indian, or the\nimmigrant. From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit\nto expect in science, art, or humanity, at all commensurate with the\nresources of the nation.\nI do not for these defects despair of our republic. We are not at the\nmercy of any waves of chance. In the strife of ferocious parties, human\nnature always finds itself cherished; as the children of the convicts\nat Botany Bay are found to have as healthy a moral sentiment as other\nchildren. Citizens of feudal states are alarmed at our democratic\ninstitutions lapsing into anarchy, and the older and more cautious among\nourselves are learning from Europeans to look with some terror at our\nturbulent freedom. It is said that in our license of construing the\nConstitution, and in the despotism of public opinion, we have no anchor;\nand one foreign observer thinks he has found the safeguard in the\nsanctity of Marriage among us; and another thinks he has found it in our\nCalvinism. Fisher Ames expressed the popular security more wisely,\nwhen he compared a monarchy and a republic, saying that a monarchy is a\nmerchantman, which sails well, but will sometimes strike on a rock and\ngo to the bottom; whilst a republic is a raft, which would never sink,\nbut then your feet are always in water. No forms can have any dangerous\nimportance whilst we are befriended by the laws of things. It makes no\ndifference how many tons weight of atmosphere presses on our heads, so\nlong as the same pressure resists it within the lungs. Augment the mass\na thousand fold, it cannot begin to crush us, as long as reaction is\nequal to action. The fact of two poles, of two forces, centripetal and\ncentrifugal, is universal, and each force by its own activity develops\nthe other. Wild liberty develops iron conscience. Want of liberty,\nby strengthening law and decorum, stupefies conscience. 'Lynch-law'\nprevails only where there is greater hardihood and self-subsistency in\nthe leaders. A mob cannot be a permanency; everybody's interest requires\nthat it should not exist, and only justice satisfies all.\nWe must trust infinitely to the beneficent necessity which\nshines through all laws. Human nature expresses itself in them as\ncharacteristically as in statues, or songs, or railroads; and an\nabstract of the codes of nations would be a transcript of the common\nconscience. Governments have their origin in the moral identity of men.\nReason for one is seen to be reason for another, and for every other.\nThere is a middle measure which satisfies all parties, be they never so\nmany or so resolute for their own. Every man finds a sanction for his\nsimplest claims and deeds in decisions of his own mind, which he calls\nTruth and Holiness. In these decisions all the citizens find a perfect\nagreement, and only in these; not in what is good to eat, good to wear,\ngood use of time, or what amount of land or of public aid, each is\nentitled to claim. This truth and justice men presently endeavor to make\napplication of to the measuring of land, the apportionment of service,\nthe protection of life and property. Their first endeavors, no doubt,\nare very awkward. Yet absolute right is the first governor; or, every\ngovernment is an impure theocracy. The idea after which each community\nis aiming to make and mend its law, is the will of the wise man. The\nwise man it cannot find in nature, and it makes awkward but earnest\nefforts to secure his government by contrivance; as by causing the\nentire people to give their voices on every measure; or by a double\nchoice to get the representation of the whole; or, by a selection of the\nbest citizens; or to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal\npeace by confiding the government to one, who may himself select his\nagents. All forms of government symbolize an immortal government, common\nto all dynasties and independent of numbers, perfect where two men\nexist, perfect where there is only one man.\nEvery man's nature is a sufficient advertisement to him of the character\nof his fellows. My right and my wrong is their right and their wrong.\nWhilst I do what is fit for me, and abstain from what is unfit, my\nneighbor and I shall often agree in our means, and work together for\na time to one end. But whenever I find my dominion over myself not\nsufficient for me, and undertake the direction of him also, I overstep\nthe truth, and come into false relations to him. I may have so much more\nskill or strength than he that he cannot express adequately his sense of\nwrong, but it is a lie, and hurts like a lie both him and me. Love\nand nature cannot maintain the assumption; it must be executed by a\npractical lie, namely by force. This undertaking for another is the\nblunder which stands in colossal ugliness in the governments of the\nworld. It is the same thing in numbers, as in a pair, only not quite\nso intelligible. I can see well enough a great difference between my\nsetting myself down to a self-control, and my going to make somebody\nelse act after my views; but when a quarter of the human race assume to\ntell me what I must do, I may be too much disturbed by the circumstances\nto see so clearly the absurdity of their command. Therefore all public\nends look vague and quixotic beside private ones. For any laws but those\nwhich men make for themselves, are laughable. If I put myself in the\nplace of my child, and we stand in one thought and see that things are\nthus or thus, that perception is law for him and me. We are both there,\nboth act. But if, without carrying him into the thought, I look over\ninto his plot, and, guessing how it is with him, ordain this or that,\nhe will never obey me. This is the history of governments,--one man does\nsomething which is to bind another. A man who cannot be acquainted with\nme, taxes me; looking from afar at me ordains that a part of my labor\nshall go to this or that whimsical end,--not as I, but as he happens to\nfancy. Behold the consequence. Of all debts men are least willing to pay\nthe taxes. What a satire is this on government! Everywhere they think\nthey get their money's worth, except for these.\nHence the less government we have the better,--the fewer laws, and the\nless confided power. The antidote to this abuse of formal Government is\nthe influence of private character, the growth of the Individual; the\nappearance of the principal to supersede the proxy; the appearance of\nthe wise man; of whom the existing government is, it must be owned, but\na shabby imitation. That which all things tend to educe; which freedom,\ncultivation, intercourse, revolutions, go to form and deliver, is\ncharacter; that is the end of Nature, to reach unto this coronation\nof her king. To educate the wise man the State exists, and with\nthe appearance of the wise man the State expires. The appearance of\ncharacter makes the State unnecessary. The wise man is the State. He\nneeds no army, fort, or navy,--he loves men too well; no bribe,\nor feast, or palace, to draw friends to him; no vantage ground, no\nfavorable circumstance. He needs no library, for he has not done\nthinking; no church, for he is a prophet; no statute book, for he has\nthe lawgiver; no money, for he is value; no road, for he is at home\nwhere he is; no experience, for the life of the creator shoots through\nhim, and looks from his eyes. He has no personal friends, for he who\nhas the spell to draw the prayer and piety of all men unto him needs not\nhusband and educate a few to share with him a select and poetic life.\nHis relation to men is angelic; his memory is myrrh to them; his\npresence, frankincense and flowers.\nWe think our civilization near its meridian, but we are yet only at\nthe cock-crowing and the morning star. In our barbarous society the\ninfluence of character is in its infancy. As a political power, as\nthe rightful lord who is to tumble all rulers from their chairs, its\npresence is hardly yet suspected. Malthus and Ricardo quite omit it; the\nAnnual Register is silent; in the Conversations' Lexicon it is not set\ndown; the President's Message, the Queen's Speech, have not mentioned\nit; and yet it is never nothing. Every thought which genius and piety\nthrow into the world, alters the world. The gladiators in the lists\nof power feel, through all their frocks of force and simulation, the\npresence of worth. I think the very strife of trade and ambition are\nconfession of this divinity; and successes in those fields are the poor\namends, the fig-leaf with which the shamed soul attempts to hide its\nnakedness. I find the like unwilling homage in all quarters. It is\nbecause we know how much is due from us that we are impatient to\nshow some petty talent as a substitute for worth. We are haunted by a\nconscience of this right to grandeur of character, and are false to it.\nBut each of us has some talent, can do somewhat useful, or graceful,\nor formidable, or amusing, or lucrative. That we do, as an apology to\nothers and to ourselves for not reaching the mark of a good and equal\nlife. But it does not satisfy us, whilst we thrust it on the notice of\nour companions. It may throw dust in their eyes, but does not smooth our\nown brow, or give us the tranquillity of the strong when we walk abroad.\nWe do penance as we go. Our talent is a sort of expiation, and we\nare constrained to reflect on our splendid moment with a certain\nhumiliation, as somewhat too fine, and not as one act of many acts, a\nfair expression of our permanent energy. Most persons of ability meet\nin society with a kind of tacit appeal. Each seems to say, 'I am not all\nhere.' Senators and presidents have climbed so high with pain enough,\nnot because they think the place specially agreeable, but as an apology\nfor real worth, and to vindicate their manhood in our eyes. This\nconspicuous chair is their compensation to themselves for being of a\npoor, cold, hard nature. They must do what they can. Like one class\nof forest animals, they have nothing but a prehensile tail; climb they\nmust, or crawl. If a man found himself so rich-natured that he could\nenter into strict relations with the best persons and make life serene\naround him by the dignity and sweetness of his behavior, could he afford\nto circumvent the favor of the caucus and the press, and covet relations\nso hollow and pompous as those of a politician? Surely nobody would be a\ncharlatan who could afford to be sincere.\nThe tendencies of the times favor the idea of self-government, and leave\nthe individual, for all code, to the rewards and penalties of his own\nconstitution; which work with more energy than we believe whilst we\ndepend on artificial restraints. The movement in this direction has been\nvery marked in modern history. Much has been blind and discreditable,\nbut the nature of the revolution is not affected by the vices of the\nrevolters; for this is a purely moral force. It was never adopted by any\nparty in history, neither can be. It separates the individual from\nall party, and unites him at the same time to the race. It promises\na recognition of higher rights than those of personal freedom, or the\nsecurity of property. A man has a right to be employed, to be trusted,\nto be loved, to be revered. The power of love, as the basis of a State,\nhas never been tried. We must not imagine that all things are lapsing\ninto confusion if every tender protestant be not compelled to bear his\npart in certain social conventions; nor doubt that roads can be built,\nletters carried, and the fruit of labor secured, when the government\nof force is at an end. Are our methods now so excellent that all\ncompetition is hopeless? could not a nation of friends even devise\nbetter ways? On the other hand, let not the most conservative and timid\nfear anything from a premature surrender of the bayonet and the system\nof force. For, according to the order of nature, which is quite superior\nto our will, it stands thus; there will always be a government of force\nwhere men are selfish; and when they are pure enough to abjure the code\nof force they will be wise enough to see how these public ends of the\npost-office, of the highway, of commerce and the exchange of property,\nof museums and libraries, of institutions of art and science can be\nanswered.\nWe live in a very low state of the world, and pay unwilling tribute to\ngovernments founded on force. There is not, among the most religious and\ninstructed men of the most religious and civil nations, a reliance on\nthe moral sentiment and a sufficient belief in the unity of things,\nto persuade them that society can be maintained without artificial\nrestraints, as well as the solar system; or that the private citizen\nmight be reasonable and a good neighbor, without the hint of a jail or a\nconfiscation. What is strange too, there never was in any man sufficient\nfaith in the power of rectitude to inspire him with the broad design of\nrenovating the State on the principle of right and love. All those\nwho have pretended this design have been partial reformers, and have\nadmitted in some manner the supremacy of the bad State. I do not call to\nmind a single human being who has steadily denied the authority of the\nlaws, on the simple ground of his own moral nature. Such designs, full\nof genius and full of fate as they are, are not entertained except\navowedly as air-pictures. If the individual who exhibits them dare to\nthink them practicable, he disgusts scholars and churchmen; and men of\ntalent and women of superior sentiments cannot hide their contempt.\nNot the less does nature continue to fill the heart of youth with\nsuggestions of this enthusiasm, and there are now men,--if indeed I can\nspeak in the plural number,--more exactly, I will say, I have just been\nconversing with one man, to whom no weight of adverse experience will\nmake it for a moment appear impossible that thousands of human beings\nmight exercise towards each other the grandest and simplest sentiments,\nas well as a knot of friends, or a pair of lovers.\n*****\nNOMINALIST AND REALIST.\nIn countless upward-striving waves\nThe moon-drawn tide-wave strives:\nIn thousand far-transplanted grafts\nThe parent fruit survives;\nSo, in the new-born millions,\nThe perfect Adam lives.\nNot less are summer-mornings dear\nTo every child they wake,\nAnd each with novel life his sphere\nFills for his proper sake.\nVIII. NONIMALIST AND REALIST.\nI CANNOT often enough say that a man is only a relative and\nrepresentative nature. Each is a hint of the truth, but far enough from\nbeing that truth which yet he quite newly and inevitably suggests to us.\nIf I seek it in him I shall not find it. Could any man conduct into me\nthe pure stream of that which he pretends to be! Long afterwards I\nfind that quality elsewhere which he promised me. The genius of the\nPlatonists is intoxicating to the student, yet how few particulars of\nit can I detach from all their books. The man momentarily stands for\nthe thought, but will not bear examination; and a society of men will\ncursorily represent well enough a certain quality and culture, for\nexample, chivalry or beauty of manners; but separate them and there is\nno gentleman and no lady in the group. The least hint sets us on the\npursuit of a character which no man realizes. We have such exorbitant\neyes that on seeing the smallest arc we complete the curve, and when the\ncurtain is lifted from the diagram which it seemed to veil, we are vexed\nto find that no more was drawn than just that fragment of an arc which\nwe first beheld. We are greatly too liberal in our construction of each\nother's faculty and promise. Exactly what the parties have already done\nthey shall do again; but that which we inferred from their nature and\ninception, they will not do. That is in nature, but not in them. That\nhappens in the world, which we often witness in a public debate. Each\nof the speakers expresses himself imperfectly; no one of them hears much\nthat another says, such is the preoccupation of mind of each; and the\naudience, who have only to hear and not to speak, judge very wisely and\nsuperiorly how wrongheaded and unskilful is each of the debaters to his\nown affair. Great men or men of great gifts you shall easily find,\nbut symmetrical men never. When I meet a pure intellectual force or a\ngenerosity of affection, I believe here then is man; and am presently\nmortified by the discovery that this individual is no more available to\nhis own or to the general ends than his companions; because the power\nwhich drew my respect is not supported by the total symphony of his\ntalents. All persons exist to society by some shining trait of beauty or\nutility which they have. We borrow the proportions of the man from that\none fine feature, and finish the portrait symmetrically; which is false,\nfor the rest of his body is small or deformed. I observe a person who\nmakes a good public appearance, and conclude thence the perfection of\nhis private character, on which this is based; but he has no private\ncharacter. He is a graceful cloak or lay-figure for holidays. All our\npoets, heroes, and saints, fail utterly in some one or in many parts to\nsatisfy our idea, fail to draw our spontaneous interest, and so leave us\nwithout any hope of realization but in our own future. Our exaggeration\nof all fine characters arises from the fact that we identify each in\nturn with the soul. But there are no such men as we fable; no Jesus, nor\nPericles, nor Caesar, nor Angelo, nor Washington, such as we have made.\nWe consecrate a great deal of nonsense because it was allowed by great\nmen. There is none without his foible. I verily believe if an angel\nshould come to chant the chorus of the moral law, he would eat too much\ngingerbread, or take liberties with private letters, or do some precious\natrocity. It is bad enough that our geniuses cannot do anything useful,\nbut it is worse that no man is fit for society who has fine traits. He\nis admired at a distance, but he cannot come near without appearing a\ncripple. The men of fine parts protect themselves by solitude, or by\ncourtesy, or by satire, or by an acid worldly manner, each concealing as\nhe best can his incapacity for useful association, but they want either\nlove or self-reliance.\nOur native love of reality joins with this experience to teach us a\nlittle reserve, and to dissuade a too sudden surrender to the brilliant\nqualities of persons. Young people admire talents or particular\nexcellences; as we grow older we value total powers and effects, as the\nimpression, the quality, the spirit of men and things. The genius is\nall. The man,--it is his system: we do not try a solitary word or act,\nbut his habit. The acts which you praise, I praise not, since they are\ndepartures from his faith, and are mere compliances. The magnetism which\narranges tribes and races in one polarity is alone to be respected; the\nmen are steel-filings. Yet we unjustly select a particle, and say,\n'O steel-filing number one! what heart-drawings I feel to thee! what\nprodigious virtues are these of thine! how constitutional to thee, and\nincommunicable.' Whilst we speak the loadstone is withdrawn; down falls\nour filing in a heap with the rest, and we continue our mummery to the\nwretched shaving. Let us go for universals; for the magnetism, not for\nthe needles. Human life and its persons are poor empirical pretensions.\nA personal influence is an ignis fatuus. If they say it is great, it is\ngreat; if they say it is small, it is small; you see it, and you see it\nnot, by turns; it borrows all its size from the momentary estimation of\nthe speakers: the Will-of-the-wisp vanishes if you go too near, vanishes\nif you go too far, and only blazes at one angle. Who can tell if\nWashington be a great man or no? Who can tell if Franklin be? Yes, or\nany but the twelve, or six, or three great gods of fame? And they too\nloom and fade before the eternal.\nWe are amphibious creatures, weaponed for two elements, having two sets\nof faculties, the particular and the catholic. We adjust our instrument\nfor general observation, and sweep the heavens as easily as we pick out\na single figure in the terrestrial landscape. We are practically skilful\nin detecting elements for which we have no place in our theory, and no\nname. Thus we are very sensible of an atmospheric influence in men and\nin bodies of men, not accounted for in an arithmetical addition of all\ntheir measurable properties. There is a genius of a nation, which is\nnot to be found in the numerical citizens, but which characterizes the\nsociety. England, strong, punctual, practical, well-spoken England\nI should not find if I should go to the island to seek it. In the\nparliament, in the play-house, at dinner-tables, I might see a great\nnumber of rich, ignorant, book-read, conventional, proud men,--many\nold women,--and not anywhere the Englishman who made the good speeches,\ncombined the accurate engines, and did the bold and nervous deeds. It\nis even worse in America, where, from the intellectual quickness of the\nrace, the genius of the country is more splendid in its promise and more\nslight in its performance. Webster cannot do the work of Webster. We\nconceive distinctly enough the French, the Spanish, the German genius,\nand it is not the less real that perhaps we should not meet in either\nof those nations a single individual who corresponded with the type. We\ninfer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which\nis a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of\nmany hundred years has contributed a stone. And, universally, a good\nexample of this social force is the veracity of language, which cannot\nbe debauched. In any controversy concerning morals, an appeal may be\nmade with safety to the sentiments which the language of the people\nexpresses. Proverbs, words, and grammar-inflections convey the public\nsense with more purity and precision than the wisest individual.\nIn the famous dispute with the Nominalists, the Realists had a good deal\nof reason. General ideas are essences. They are our gods: they round\nand ennoble the most partial and sordid way of living. Our proclivity\nto details cannot quite degrade our life and divest it of poetry. The\nday-laborer is reckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale, yet\nhe is saturated with the laws of the world. His measures are the hours;\nmorning and night, solstice and equinox, geometry, astronomy and all\nthe lovely accidents of nature play through his mind. Money, which\nrepresents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors\nwithout an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.\nProperty keeps the accounts of the world, and is always moral. The\nproperty will be found where the labor, the wisdom, and the virtue have\nbeen in nations, in classes, and (the whole life-time considered, with\nthe compensations) in the individual also. How wise the world appears,\nwhen the laws and usages of nations are largely detailed, and the\ncompleteness of the municipal system is considered! Nothing is left\nout. If you go into the markets and the custom-houses, the insurers' and\nnotaries' offices, the offices of sealers of weights and measures, of\ninspection of provisions,--it will appear as if one man had made it\nall. Wherever you go, a wit like your own has been before you, and\nhas realized its thought. The Eleusinian mysteries, the Egyptian\narchitecture, the Indian astronomy, the Greek sculpture, show that there\nalways were seeing and knowing men in the planet. The world is full of\nmasonic ties, of guilds, of secret and public legions of honor; that\nof scholars, for example; and that of gentlemen, fraternizing with the\nupper class of every country and every culture.\nI am very much struck in literature by the appearance that one person\nwrote all the books; as if the editor of a journal planted his body of\nreporters in different parts of the field of action, and relieved some\nby others from time to time; but there is such equality and identity\nboth of judgment and point of view in the narrative that it is plainly\nthe work of one all-seeing, all-hearing gentleman. I looked into Pope's\nOdyssey yesterday: it is as correct and elegant after our canon of\nto-day as if it were newly written. The modernness of all good books\nseems to give me an existence as wide as man. What is well done I feel\nas if I did; what is ill done I reck not of. Shakspeare's passages of\npassion (for example, in Lear and Hamlet) are in the very dialect of the\npresent year. I am faithful again to the whole over the members in my\nuse of books. I find the most pleasure in reading a book in a manner\nleast flattering to the author. I read Proclus, and sometimes Plato, as\nI might read a dictionary, for a mechanical help to the fancy and the\nimagination. I read for the lustres, as if one should use a fine picture\nin a chromatic experiment, for its rich colors. 'Tis not Proclus, but a\npiece of nature and fate that I explore. It is a greater joy to see\nthe author's author, than himself. A higher pleasure of the same kind I\nfound lately at a concert, where I went to hear Handel's Messiah. As the\nmaster overpowered the littleness and incapableness of the performers\nand made them conductors of his electricity, so it was easy to observe\nwhat efforts nature was making, through so many hoarse, wooden, and\nimperfect persons, to produce beautiful voices, fluid and soul-guided\nmen and women. The genius of nature was paramount at the oratorio.\nThis preference of the genius to the parts is the secret of that\ndeification of art, which is found in all superior minds. Art, in the\nartist, is proportion, or a habitual respect to the whole by an eye\nloving beauty in details. And the wonder and charm of it is the sanity\nin insanity which it denotes. Proportion is almost impossible to human\nbeings. There is no one who does not exaggerate. In conversation, men\nare encumbered with personality, and talk too much. In modern sculpture,\npicture, and poetry, the beauty is miscellaneous; the artist works here\nand there and at all points, adding and adding, instead of unfolding the\nunit of his thought. Beautiful details we must have, or no artist; but\nthey must be means and never other. The eye must not lose sight for a\nmoment of the purpose. Lively boys write to their ear and eye, and the\ncool reader finds nothing but sweet jingles in it. When they grow older,\nthey respect the argument.\nWe obey the same intellectual integrity when we study in exceptions the\nlaw of the world. Anomalous facts, as the never quite obsolete rumors\nof magic and demonology, and the new allegations of phrenologists and\nneurologists, are of ideal use. They are good indications. Homoeopathy\nis insignificant as an art of healing, but of great value as criticism\non the hygeia or medical practice of the time. So with Mesmerism,\nSwedenborgism, Fourierism, and the Millennial Church; they are poor\npretensions enough, but good criticism on the science, philosophy, and\npreaching of the day. For these abnormal insights of the adepts ought to\nbe normal, and things of course.\nAll things show us that on every side we are very near to the best.\nIt seems not worth while to execute with too much pains some one\nintellectual, or aesthetical, or civil feat, when presently the dream\nwill scatter, and we shall burst into universal power. The reason of\nidleness and of crime is the deferring of our hopes. Whilst we are\nwaiting we beguile the time with jokes, with sleep, with eating, and\nwith crimes.\nThus we settle it in our cool libraries, that all the agents with which\nwe deal are subalterns, which we can well afford to let pass, and life\nwill be simpler when we live at the centre and flout the surfaces. I\nwish to speak with all respect of persons, but sometimes I must pinch\nmyself to keep awake and preserve the due decorum. They melt so fast\ninto each other that they are like grass and trees, and it needs an\neffort to treat them as individuals. Though the uninspired man certainly\nfinds persons a conveniency in household matters, the divine man does\nnot respect them; he sees them as a rack of clouds, or a fleet of\nripples which the wind drives over the surface of the water. But this is\nflat rebellion. Nature will not be Buddhist: she resents generalizing,\nand insults the philosopher in every moment with a million of fresh\nparticulars. It is all idle talking: as much as a man is a whole, so is\nhe also a part; and it were partial not to see it. What you say in your\npompous distribution only distributes you into your class and section.\nYou have not got rid of parts by denying them, but are the more partial.\nYou are one thing, but Nature is one thing and the other thing, in the\nsame moment. She will not remain orbed in a thought, but rushes into\npersons; and when each person, inflamed to a fury of personality, would\nconquer all things to his poor crotchet, she raises up against him\nanother person, and by many persons incarnates again a sort of whole.\nShe will have all. Nick Bottom cannot play all the parts, work it how\nhe may; there will be somebody else, and the world will be round.\nEverything must have its flower or effort at the beautiful, coarser or\nfiner according to its stuff. They relieve and recommend each other,\nand the sanity of society is a balance of a thousand insanities. She\npunishes abstractionists, and will only forgive an induction which\nis rare and casual. We like to come to a height of land and see the\nlandscape, just as we value a general remark in conversation. But it\nis not the intention of Nature that we should live by general views. We\nfetch fire and water, run about all day among the shops and markets, and\nget our clothes and shoes made and mended, and are the victims of these\ndetails; and once in a fortnight we arrive perhaps at a rational moment.\nIf we were not thus infatuated, if we saw the real from hour to hour, we\nshould not be here to write and to read, but should have been burned\nor frozen long ago. She would never get anything done, if she suffered\nadmirable Crichtons and universal geniuses. She loves better a\nwheelwright who dreams all night of wheels, and a groom who is part\nof his horse; for she is full of work, and these are her hands. As the\nfrugal farmer takes care that his cattle shall eat down the rowen,\nand swine shall eat the waste of his house, and poultry shall pick the\ncrumbs,--so our economical mother dispatches a new genius and habit\nof mind into every district and condition of existence, plants an eye\nwherever a new ray of light can fall, and gathering up into some man\nevery property in the universe, establishes thousandfold occult mutual\nattractions among her offspring, that all this wash and waste of power\nmay be imparted and exchanged.\nGreat dangers undoubtedly accrue from this incarnation and distribution\nof the godhead, and hence Nature has her maligners, as if she were\nCirce; and Alphonso of Castille fancied he could have given useful\nadvice. But she does not go unprovided; she has hellebore at the bottom\nof the cup. Solitude would ripen a plentiful crop of despots. The\nrecluse thinks of men as having his manner, or as not having his manner;\nand as having degrees of it, more and less. But when he comes into a\npublic assembly he sees that men have very different manners from his\nown, and in their way admirable. In his childhood and youth he has\nhad many checks and censures, and thinks modestly enough of his\nown endowment. When afterwards he comes to unfold it in propitious\ncircumstance, it seems the only talent; he is delighted with his\nsuccess, and accounts himself already the fellow of the great. But he\ngoes into a mob, into a banking house, into a mechanic's shop, into a\nmill, into a laboratory, into a ship, into a camp, and in each new place\nhe is no better than an idiot; other talents take place, and rule the\nhour. The rotation which whirls every leaf and pebble to the meridian,\nreaches to every gift of man, and we all take turns at the top.\nFor Nature, who abhors mannerism, has set her heart on breaking up all\nstyles and tricks, and it is so much easier to do what one has done\nbefore than to do a new thing, that there is a perpetual tendency to a\nset mode. In every conversation, even the highest, there is a certain\ntrick, which may be soon learned by an acute person and then that\nparticular style continued indefinitely. Each man too is a tyrant in\ntendency, because he would impose his idea on others; and their trick is\ntheir natural defence. Jesus would absorb the race; but Tom Paine or\nthe coarsest blasphemer helps humanity by resisting this exuberance of\npower. Hence the immense benefit of party in politics, as it reveals\nfaults of character in a chief, which the intellectual force of the\npersons, with ordinary opportunity and not hurled into aphelion by\nhatred, could not have seen. Since we are all so stupid, what benefit\nthat there should be two stupidities! It is like that brute advantage so\nessential to astronomy, of having the diameter of the earth's orbit for\na base of its triangles. Democracy is morose, and runs to anarchy,\nbut in the State and in the schools it is indispensable to resist the\nconsolidation of all men into a few men. If John was perfect, why are\nyou and I alive? As long as any man exists, there is some need of him;\nlet him fight for his own. A new poet has appeared; a new character\napproached us; why should we refuse to eat bread until we have found his\nregiment and section in our old army-files? Why not a new man? Here is\na new enterprise of Brook Farm, of Skeneateles, of Northampton: why so\nimpatient to baptize them Essenes, or Port-Royalists, or Shakers, or by\nany known and effete name? Let it be a new way of living. Why have only\ntwo or three ways of life, and not thousands? Every man is wanted, and\nno man is wanted much. We came this time for condiments, not for\ncorn. We want the great genius only for joy; for one star more in our\nconstellation, for one tree more in our grove. But he thinks we wish\nto belong to him, as he wishes to occupy us. He greatly mistakes us. I\nthink I have done well if I have acquired a new word from a good author;\nand my business with him is to find my own, though it were only to melt\nhim down into an epithet or an image for daily use:--\n\"Into paint will I grind thee, my bride!\"\nTo embroil the confusion, and make it impossible to arrive at any\ngeneral statement,--when we have insisted on the imperfection of\nindividuals, our affections and our experience urge that every\nindividual is entitled to honor, and a very generous treatment is sure\nto be repaid. A recluse sees only two or three persons, and allows them\nall their room; they spread themselves at large. The statesman looks at\nmany, and compares the few habitually with others, and these look less.\nYet are they not entitled to this generosity of reception? and is not\nmunificence the means of insight? For though gamesters say that the\ncards beat all the players, though they were never so skilful, yet in\nthe contest we are now considering, the players are also the game, and\nshare the power of the cards. If you criticise a fine genius, the odds\nare that you are out of your reckoning, and instead of the poet, are\ncensuring your own caricature of him. For there is somewhat spheral and\ninfinite in every man, especially in every genius, which, if you can\ncome very near him, sports with all your limitations. For rightly every\nman is a channel through which heaven floweth, and whilst I fancied I\nwas criticising him, I was censuring or rather terminating my own soul.\nAfter taxing Goethe as a courtier, artificial, unbelieving, worldly,--I\ntook up this book of Helena, and found him an Indian of the wilderness,\na piece of pure nature like an apple or an oak, large as morning or\nnight, and virtuous as a brier-rose.\nBut care is taken that the whole tune shall be played. If we were not\nkept among surfaces, every thing would be large and universal; now the\nexcluded attributes burst in on us with the more brightness that they\nhave been excluded. \"Your turn now, my turn next,\" is the rule of the\ngame. The universality being hindered in its primary form, comes in\nthe secondary form of all sides; the points come in succession to the\nmeridian, and by the speed of rotation a new whole is formed. Nature\nkeeps herself whole and her representation complete in the experience\nof each mind. She suffers no seat to be vacant in her college. It is\nthe secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die but only\nretire a little from sight and afterwards return again. Whatever does\nnot concern us is concealed from us. As soon as a person is no longer\nrelated to our present well-being, he is concealed, or dies, as we say.\nReally, all things and persons are related to us, but according to our\nnature they act on us not at once but in succession, and we are made\naware of their presence one at a time. All persons, all things which we\nhave known, are here present, and many more than we see; the world is\nfull. As the ancient said, the world is a plenum or solid; and if we saw\nall things that really surround us we should be imprisoned and unable to\nmove. For though nothing is impassable to the soul, but all things are\npervious to it and like highways, yet this is only whilst the soul does\nnot see them. As soon as the soul sees any object, it stops before that\nobject. Therefore, the divine Providence which keeps the universe open\nin every direction to the soul, conceals all the furniture and all the\npersons that do not concern a particular soul, from the senses of that\nindividual. Through solidest eternal things the man finds his road as if\nthey did not subsist, and does not once suspect their being. As soon as\nhe needs a new object, suddenly he beholds it, and no longer attempts\nto pass through it, but takes another way. When he has exhausted for\nthe time the nourishment to be drawn from any one person or thing,\nthat object is withdrawn from his observation, and though still in his\nimmediate neighborhood, he does not suspect its presence. Nothing is\ndead: men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful\nobituaries, and there they stand looking out of the window, sound and\nwell, in some new and strange disguise. Jesus is not dead; he is very\nwell alive: nor John, nor Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at times\nwe believe we have seen them all, and could easily tell the names under\nwhich they go.\nIf we cannot make voluntary and conscious steps in the admirable science\nof universals, let us see the parts wisely, and infer the genius of\nnature from the best particulars with a becoming charity. What is best\nin each kind is an index of what should be the average of that thing.\nLove shows me the opulence of nature, by disclosing to me in my friend\na hidden wealth, and I infer an equal depth of good in every other\ndirection. It is commonly said by farmers that a good pear or apple\ncosts no more time or pains to rear than a poor one; so I would have no\nwork of art, no speech, or action, or thought, or friend, but the best.\nThe end and the means, the gamester and the game,--life is made up\nof the intermixture and reaction of these two amicable powers, whose\nmarriage appears beforehand monstrous, as each denies and tends to\nabolish the other. We must reconcile the contradictions as we can, but\ntheir discord and their concord introduce wild absurdities into our\nthinking and speech. No sentence will hold the whole truth, and the only\nway in which we can be just, is by giving ourselves the lie; Speech is\nbetter than silence; silence is better than speech;--All things are in\ncontact; every atom has a sphere of repulsion;--Things are, and are not,\nat the same time;--and the like. All the universe over, there is but one\nthing, this old Two-Face, creator-creature, mind-matter, right-wrong, of\nwhich any proposition may be affirmed or denied. Very fitly therefore\nI assert that every man is a partialist, that nature secures him as an\ninstrument by self-conceit, preventing the tendencies to religion and\nscience; and now further assert, that, each man's genius being nearly\nand affectionately explored, he is justified in his individuality, as\nhis nature is found to be immense; and now I add that every man is a\nuniversalist also, and, as our earth, whilst it spins on its own axis,\nspins all the time around the sun through the celestial spaces, so\nthe least of its rational children, the most dedicated to his private\naffair, works out, though as it were under a disguise, the universal\nproblem. We fancy men are individuals; so are pumpkins; but every\npumpkin in the field goes through every point of pumpkin history. The\nrabid democrat, as soon as he is senator and rich man, has ripened\nbeyond possibility of sincere radicalism, and unless he can resist the\nsun, he must be conservative the remainder of his days. Lord Eldon said\nin his old age that \"if he were to begin life again, he would be damned\nbut he would begin as agitator.\"\nWe hide this universality if we can, but it appears at all points. We\nare as ungrateful as children. There is nothing we cherish and strive to\ndraw to us but in some hour we turn and rend it. We keep a running\nfire of sarcasm at ignorance and the life of the senses; then goes by,\nperchance, a fair girl, a piece of life, gay and happy, and making the\ncommonest offices beautiful by the energy and heart with which she does\nthem; and seeing this we admire and love her and them, and say, 'Lo! a\ngenuine creature of the fair earth, not dissipated or too early ripened\nby books, philosophy, religion, society, or care!' insinuating a\ntreachery and contempt for all we had so long loved and wrought in\nourselves and others.\nIf we could have any security against moods! If the profoundest prophet\ncould be holden to his words, and the hearer who is ready to sell\nall and join the crusade could have any certificate that tomorrow his\nprophet shall not unsay his testimony! But the Truth sits veiled there\non the Bench, and never interposes an adamantine syllable; and the\nmost sincere and revolutionary doctrine, put as if the ark of God were\ncarried forward some furlongs, and planted there for the succor of the\nworld, shall in a few weeks be coldly set aside by the same speaker,\nas morbid; \"I thought I was right, but I was not,\"--and the same\nimmeasurable credulity demanded for new audacities. If we were not of\nall opinions! if we did not in any moment shift the platform on which\nwe stand, and look and speak from another! if there could be any\nregulation, any 'one-hour-rule,' that a man should never leave his\npoint of view without sound of trumpet. I am always insincere, as always\nknowing there are other moods.\nHow sincere and confidential we can be, saying all that lies in\nthe mind, and yet go away feeling that all is yet unsaid, from the\nincapacity of the parties to know each other, although they use the same\nwords! My companion assumes to know my mood and habit of thought, and we\ngo on from explanation to explanation until all is said which words can,\nand we leave matters just as they were at first, because of that vicious\nassumption. Is it that every man believes every other to be an incurable\npartialist, and himself a universalist? I talked yesterday with a pair\nof philosophers; I endeavored to show my good men that I love everything\nby turns and nothing long; that I loved the centre, but doated on the\nsuperficies; that I loved man, if men seemed to me mice and rats; that\nI revered saints, but woke up glad that the old pagan world stood its\nground and died hard; that I was glad of men of every gift and nobility,\nbut would not live in their arms. Could they but once understand that\nI loved to know that they existed, and heartily wished them God-speed,\nyet, out of my poverty of life and thought, had no word or welcome for\nthem when they came to see me, and could well consent to their living in\nOregon, for any claim I felt on them,--it would be a great satisfaction.\n*****\nNEW ENGLAND REFORMERS.\nIn the suburb, in the town,\nOn the railway, in the square,\nCame a beam of goodness down\nDoubling daylight everywhere:\nPeace now each for malice takes,\nBeauty for his sinful weeks,\nFor the angel Hope aye makes\nHim an angel whom she leads.\nNEW ENGLAND REFORMERS.\nA LECTURE READ BEFORE THE SOCIETY IN AMORY HALL, ON SUNDAY, MARCH 3,\n1844.\nWHOEVER has had opportunity of acquaintance with society in New England\nduring the last twenty-five years, with those middle and with those\nleading sections that may constitute any just representation of the\ncharacter and aim of the community, will have been struck with the great\nactivity of thought and experimenting. His attention must be commanded\nby the signs that the Church, or religious party, is falling from\nthe Church nominal, and is appearing in temperance and non-resistance\nsocieties; in movements of abolitionists and of socialists; and in very\nsignificant assemblies called Sabbath and Bible Conventions; composed of\nultraists, of seekers, of all the soul of the soldiery of dissent,\nand meeting to call in question the authority of the Sabbath, of the\npriesthood, and of the Church. In these movements nothing was more\nremarkable than the discontent they begot in the movers. The spirit of\nprotest and of detachment drove the members of these Conventions to\nbear testimony against the Church, and immediately afterward, to declare\ntheir discontent with these Conventions, their independence of their\ncolleagues, and their impatience of the methods whereby they were\nworking. They defied each other, like a congress of kings, each of\nwhom had a realm to rule, and a way of his own that made concert\nunprofitable. What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the\nworld! One apostle thought all men should go to farming, and another\nthat no man should buy or sell, that the use of money was the cardinal\nevil; another that the mischief was in our diet, that we eat and drink\ndamnation. These made unleavened bread, and were foes to the death to\nfermentation. It was in vain urged by the housewife that God made yeast,\nas well as dough, and loves fermentation just as dearly as he loves\nvegetation; that fermentation develops the saccharine element in the\ngrain, and makes it more palatable and more digestible. No; they wish\nthe pure wheat, and will die but it shall not ferment. Stop, dear\nnature, these incessant advances of thine; let us scotch these\never-rolling wheels! Others attacked the system of agriculture, the use\nof animal manures in farming, and the tyranny of man over brute nature;\nthese abuses polluted his food. The ox must be taken from the plough and\nthe horse from the cart, the hundred acres of the farm must be spaded,\nand the man must walk, wherever boats and locomotives will not carry\nhim. Even the insect world was to be defended,--that had been too long\nneglected, and a society for the protection of ground-worms, slugs, and\nmosquitos was to be incorporated without delay. With these appeared the\nadepts of homoeopathy, of hydropathy, of mesmerism, of phrenology, and\ntheir wonderful theories of the Christian miracles! Others assailed\nparticular vocations, as that of the lawyer, that of the merchant, of\nthe manufacturer, of the clergyman, of the scholar. Others attacked the\ninstitution of marriage as the fountain of social evils. Others devoted\nthemselves to the worrying of churches and meetings for public worship;\nand the fertile forms of antinomianism among the elder puritans seemed\nto have their match in the plenty of the new harvest of reform.\nWith this din of opinion and debate there was a keener scrutiny of\ninstitutions and domestic life than any we had known; there was sincere\nprotesting against existing evils, and there were changes of employment\ndictated by conscience. No doubt there was plentiful vaporing, and cases\nof backsliding might occur. But in each of these movements emerged\na good result, a tendency to the adoption of simpler methods, and an\nassertion of the sufficiency of the private man. Thus it was directly in\nthe spirit and genius of the age, what happened in one instance when a\nchurch censured and threatened to excommunicate one of its members on\naccount of the somewhat hostile part to the church which his conscience\nled him to take in the anti-slavery business; the threatened individual\nimmediately excommunicated the church in a public and formal process.\nThis has been several times repeated: it was excellent when it was done\nthe first time, but of course loses all value when it is copied. Every\nproject in the history of reform, no matter how violent and surprising,\nis good when it is the dictate of a man's genius and constitution, but\nvery dull and suspicious when adopted from another. It is right and\nbeautiful in any man to say, 'I will take this coat, or this book, or\nthis measure of corn of yours,'--in whom we see the act to be original,\nand to flow from the whole spirit and faith of him; for then that taking\nwill have a giving as free and divine; but we are very easily disposed\nto resist the same generosity of speech when we miss originality and\ntruth to character in it.\nThere was in all the practical activities of New England for the last\nquarter of a century, a gradual withdrawal of tender consciences from\nthe social organizations. There is observable throughout, the contest\nbetween mechanical and spiritual methods, but with a steady tendency of\nthe thoughtful and virtuous to a deeper belief and reliance on spiritual\nfacts.\nIn politics for example it is easy to see the progress of dissent. The\ncountry is full of rebellion; the country is full of kings. Hands off!\nlet there be no control and no interference in the administration of the\naffairs of this kingdom of me. Hence the growth of the doctrine and of\nthe party of Free Trade, and the willingness to try that experiment, in\nthe face of what appear incontestable facts. I confess, the motto of\nthe Globe newspaper is so attractive to me that I can seldom find much\nappetite to read what is below it in its columns: \"The world is governed\ntoo much.\" So the country is frequently affording solitary examples of\nresistance to the government, solitary nullifiers, who throw themselves\non their reserved rights; nay, who have reserved all their rights; who\nreply to the assessor and to the clerk of court that they do not\nknow the State, and embarrass the courts of law by non-juring and the\ncommander-in-chief of the militia by non-resistance.\nThe same disposition to scrutiny and dissent appeared in civil, festive,\nneighborly, and domestic society. A restless, prying, conscientious\ncriticism broke out in unexpected quarters. Who gave me the money with\nwhich I bought my coat? Why should professional labor and that of the\ncounting-house be paid so disproportionately to the labor of the porter\nand woodsawyer? This whole business of Trade gives me to pause and\nthink, as it constitutes false relations between men; inasmuch as I am\nprone to count myself relieved of any responsibility to behave well and\nnobly to that person whom I pay with money; whereas if I had not that\ncommodity, I should be put on my good behavior in all companies, and man\nwould be a benefactor to man, as being himself his only certificate that\nhe had a right to those aids and services which each asked of the other.\nAm I not too protected a person? is there not a wide disparity between\nthe lot of me and the lot of thee, my poor brother, my poor sister? Am\nI not defrauded of my best culture in the loss of those gymnastics which\nmanual labor and the emergencies of poverty constitute? I find nothing\nhealthful or exalting in the smooth conventions of society; I do\nnot like the close air of saloons. I begin to suspect myself to be a\nprisoner, though treated with all this courtesy and luxury. I pay a\ndestructive tax in my conformity.\nThe same insatiable criticism may be traced in the efforts for the\nreform of Education. The popular education has been taxed with a want of\ntruth and nature. It was complained that an education to things was\nnot given. We are students of words: we are shut up in schools, and\ncolleges, and recitation-rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out\nat last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing.\nWe cannot use our hands, or our legs, or our eyes, or our arms. We do\nnot know an edible root in the woods, we cannot tell our course by the\nstars, nor the hour of the day by the sun. It is well if we can swim and\nskate. We are afraid of a horse, of a cow, of a dog, of a snake, of\na spider. The Roman rule was to teach a boy nothing that he could not\nlearn standing. The old English rule was, 'All summer in the field,\nand all winter in the study.' And it seems as if a man should learn to\nplant, or to fish, or to hunt, that he might secure his subsistence\nat all events, and not be painful to his friends and fellow-men. The\nlessons of science should be experimental also. The sight of the planet\nthrough a telescope is worth all the course on astronomy; the shock of\nthe electric spark in the elbow, outvalues all the theories; the taste\nof the nitrous oxide, the firing of an artificial volcano, are better\nthan volumes of chemistry.\nOne of the traits of the new spirit is the inquisition it fixed on our\nscholastic devotion to the dead languages. The ancient languages, with\ngreat beauty of structure, contain wonderful remains of genius, which\ndraw, and always will draw, certain likeminded men,--Greek men, and\nRoman men,--in all countries, to their study; but by a wonderful\ndrowsiness of usage they had exacted the study of all men. Once (say two\ncenturies ago), Latin and Greek had a strict relation to all the science\nand culture there was in Europe, and the Mathematics had a momentary\nimportance at some era of activity in physical science. These things\nbecame stereotyped as education, as the manner of men is. But the Good\nSpirit never cared for the colleges, and though all men and boys were\nnow drilled in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics, it had quite left these\nshells high and dry on the beach, and was now creating and feeding other\nmatters at other ends of the world. But in a hundred high schools and\ncolleges this warfare against common sense still goes on. Four, or six,\nor ten years, the pupil is parsing Greek and Latin, and as soon as he\nleaves the University, as it is ludicrously called, he shuts those books\nfor the last time. Some thousands of young men are graduated at our\ncolleges in this country every year, and the persons who, at forty\nyears, still read Greek, can all be counted on your hand. I never met\nwith ten. Four or five persons I have seen who read Plato.\nBut is not this absurd, that the whole liberal talent of this country\nshould be directed in its best years on studies which lead to nothing?\nWhat was the consequence? Some intelligent persons said or thought,\n'Is that Greek and Latin some spell to conjure with, and not words of\nreason? If the physician, the lawyer, the divine, never use it to come\nat their ends, I need never learn it to come at mine. Conjuring is gone\nout of fashion, and I will omit this conjugating, and go straight to\naffairs.' So they jumped the Greek and Latin, and read law, medicine, or\nsermons, without it. To the astonishment of all, the self-made men took\neven ground at once with the oldest of the regular graduates, and in\na few months the most conservative circles of Boston and New York had\nquite forgotten who of their gownsmen was college-bred, and who was not.\nOne tendency appears alike in the philosophical speculation and in the\nrudest democratical movements, through all the petulance and all the\npuerility, the wish, namely, to cast aside the superfluous and arrive\nat short methods; urged, as I suppose, by an intuition that the human\nspirit is equal to all emergencies, alone, and that man is more often\ninjured than helped by the means he uses.\nI conceive this gradual casting off of material aids, and the indication\nof growing trust in the private self-supplied powers of the individual,\nto be the affirmative principle of the recent philosophy, and that it is\nfeeling its own profound truth and is reaching forward at this very hour\nto the happiest conclusions. I readily concede that in this, as in every\nperiod of intellectual activity, there has been a noise of denial and\nprotest; much was to be resisted, much was to be got rid of by those\nwho were reared in the old, before they could begin to affirm and to\nconstruct. Many a reformer perishes in his removal of rubbish; and that\nmakes the offensiveness of the class. They are partial; they are not\nequal to the work they pretend. They lose their way; in the assault on\nthe kingdom of darkness they expend all their energy on some accidental\nevil, and lose their sanity and power of benefit. It is of little moment\nthat one or two or twenty errors of our social system be corrected, but\nof much that the man be in his senses.\nThe criticism and attack on institutions, which we have witnessed,\nhas made one thing plain, that society gains nothing whilst a man, not\nhimself renovated, attempts to renovate things around him: he has become\ntediously good in some particular but negligent or narrow in the rest;\nand hypocrisy and vanity are often the disgusting result.\nIt is handsomer to remain in the establishment better than the\nestablishment, and conduct that in the best manner, than to make a sally\nagainst evil by some single improvement, without supporting it by a\ntotal regeneration. Do not be so vain of your one objection. Do you\nthink there is only one? Alas! my good friend, there is no part of\nsociety or of life better than any other part. All our things are right\nand wrong together. The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike.\nDo you complain of our Marriage? Our marriage is no worse than our\neducation, our diet, our trade, our social customs. Do you complain of\nthe laws of Property? It is a pedantry to give such importance to them.\nCan we not play the game of life with these counters, as well as with\nthose? in the institution of property, as well as out of it? Let into\nit the new and renewing principle of love, and property will be\nuniversality. No one gives the impression of superiority to the\ninstitution, which he must give who will reform it. It makes no\ndifference what you say, you must make me feel that you are aloof from\nit; by your natural and supernatural advantages do easily see to the end\nof it,--do see how man can do without it. Now all men are on one side.\nNo man deserves to be heard against property. Only Love, only an Idea,\nis against property as we hold it.\nI cannot afford to be irritable and captious, nor to waste all my\ntime in attacks. If I should go out of church whenever I hear a false\nsentiment I could never stay there five minutes. But why come out? the\nstreet is as false as the church, and when I get to my house, or to my\nmanners, or to my speech, I have not got away from the lie. When we see\nan eager assailant of one of these wrongs, a special reformer, we feel\nlike asking him, What right have you, sir, to your one virtue? Is virtue\npiecemeal? This is a jewel amidst the rags of a beggar.\nIn another way the right will be vindicated. In the midst of abuses, in\nthe heart of cities, in the aisles of false churches, alike in one place\nand in another,--wherever, namely, a just and heroic soul finds itself,\nthere it will do what is next at hand, and by the new quality of\ncharacter it shall put forth it shall abrogate that old condition, law\nor school in which it stands, before the law of its own mind.\nIf partiality was one fault of the movement party, the other defect was\ntheir reliance on Association. Doubts such as those I have intimated\ndrove many good persons to agitate the questions of social reform. But\nthe revolt against the spirit of commerce, the spirit of aristocracy,\nand the inveterate abuses of cities, did not appear possible to\nindividuals; and to do battle against numbers they armed themselves with\nnumbers, and against concert they relied on new concert.\nFollowing or advancing beyond the ideas of St. Simon, of Fourier, and\nof Owen, three communities have already been formed in Massachusetts on\nkindred plans, and many more in the country at large. They aim to give\nevery member a share in the manual labor, to give an equal reward to\nlabor and to talent, and to unite a liberal culture with an education\nto labor. The scheme offers, by the economies of associated labor and\nexpense, to make every member rich, on the same amount of property,\nthat, in separate families, would leave every member poor. These new\nassociations are composed of men and women of superior talents and\nsentiments; yet it may easily be questioned whether such a community\nwill draw, except in its beginnings, the able and the good; whether\nthose who have energy will not prefer their chance of superiority\nand power in the world, to the humble certainties of the association;\nwhether such a retreat does not promise to become an asylum to those who\nhave tried and failed, rather than a field to the strong; and whether\nthe members will not necessarily be fractions of men, because each\nfinds that he cannot enter it, without some compromise. Friendship and\nassociation are very fine things, and a grand phalanx of the best of\nthe human race, banded for some catholic object; yes, excellent; but\nremember that no society can ever be so large as one man. He, in his\nfriendship, in his natural and momentary associations, doubles or\nmultiplies himself; but in the hour in which he mortgages himself to two\nor ten or twenty, he dwarfs himself below the stature of one.\nBut the men of less faith could not thus believe, and to such, concert\nappears the sole specific of strength. I have failed, and you have\nfailed, but perhaps together we shall not fail. Our housekeeping is not\nsatisfactory to us, but perhaps a phalanx, a community, might be. Many\nof us have differed in opinion, and we could find no man who could make\nthe truth plain, but possibly a college, or an ecclesiastical council\nmight. I have not been able either to persuade my brother or to prevail\non myself, to disuse the traffic or the potation of brandy, but\nperhaps a pledge of total abstinence might effectually restrain us. The\ncandidate my party votes for is not to be trusted with a dollar, but he\nwill be honest in the Senate, for we can bring public opinion to bear on\nhim. Thus concert was the specific in all cases. But concert is neither\nbetter nor worse, neither more nor less potent than individual force.\nAll the men in the world cannot make a statue walk and speak, cannot\nmake a drop of blood, or a blade of grass, any more than one man can.\nBut let there be one man, let there be truth in two men, in ten men,\nthen is concert for the first time possible; because the force which\nmoves the world is a new quality, and can never be furnished by adding\nwhatever quantities of a different kind. What is the use of the concert\nof the false and the disunited? There can be no concert in two, where\nthere is no concert in one. When the individual is not individual, but\nis dual; when his thoughts look one way and his actions another; when\nhis faith is traversed by his habits; when his will, enlightened by\nreason, is warped by his sense; when with one hand he rows and with the\nother backs water, what concert can be?\nI do not wonder at the interest these projects inspire. The world is\nawaking to the idea of union, and these experiments show what it is\nthinking of. It is and will be magic. Men will live and communicate, and\nplough, and reap, and govern, as by added ethereal power, when once they\nare united; as in a celebrated experiment, by expiration and respiration\nexactly together, four persons lift a heavy man from the ground by the\nlittle finger only, and without sense of weight. But this union must be\ninward, and not one of covenants, and is to be reached by a reverse of\nthe methods they use. The union is only perfect when all the uniters are\nisolated. It is the union of friends who live in different streets or\ntowns. Each man, if he attempts to join himself to others, is on all\nsides cramped and diminished of his proportion; and the stricter the\nunion the smaller and the more pitiful he is. But leave him alone, to\nrecognize in every hour and place the secret soul; he will go up and\ndown doing the works of a true member, and, to the astonishment of all,\nthe work will be done with concert, though no man spoke. Government will\nbe adamantine without any governor. The union must be ideal in actual\nindividualism.\nI pass to the indication in some particulars of that faith in man, which\nthe heart is preaching to us in these days, and which engages the more\nregard, from the consideration that the speculations of one generation\nare the history of the next following.\nIn alluding just now to our system of education, I spoke of the deadness\nof its details. But it is open to graver criticism than the palsy of\nits members: it is a system of despair. The disease with which the\nhuman mind now labors is want of faith. Men do not believe in a power of\neducation. We do not think we can speak to divine sentiments in man, and\nwe do not try. We renounce all high aims. We believe that the defects of\nso many perverse and so many frivolous people who make up society, are\norganic, and society is a hospital of incurables. A man of good sense\nbut of little faith, whose compassion seemed to lead him to church as\noften as he went there, said to me that \"he liked to have concerts, and\nfairs, and churches, and other public amusements go on.\" I am afraid the\nremark is too honest, and comes from the same origin as the maxim of the\ntyrant, \"If you would rule the world quietly, you must keep it amused.\"\nI notice too that the ground on which eminent public servants urge the\nclaims of popular education is fear; 'This country is filling up with\nthousands and millions of voters, and you must educate them to keep them\nfrom our throats.' We do not believe that any education, any system of\nphilosophy, any influence of genius, will ever give depth of insight to\na superficial mind. Having settled ourselves into this infidelity, our\nskill is expended to procure alleviations, diversion, opiates. We adorn\nthe victim with manual skill, his tongue with languages, his body with\ninoffensive and comely manners. So have we cunningly hid the tragedy of\nlimitation and inner death we cannot avert. Is it strange that society\nshould be devoured by a secret melancholy which breaks through all its\nsmiles and all its gayety and games?\nBut even one step farther our infidelity has gone. It appears that some\ndoubt is felt by good and wise men whether really the happiness\nand probity of men is increased by the culture of the mind in those\ndisciplines to which we give the name of education. Unhappily too the\ndoubt comes from scholars, from persons who have tried these methods.\nIn their experience the scholar was not raised by the sacred thoughts\namongst which he dwelt, but used them to selfish ends. He was a profane\nperson, and became a showman, turning his gifts to a marketable use, and\nnot to his own sustenance and growth. It was found that the intellect\ncould be independently developed, that is, in separation from the man,\nas any single organ can be invigorated, and the result was monstrous. A\ncanine appetite for knowledge was generated, which must still be fed but\nwas never satisfied, and this knowledge, not being directed on action,\nnever took the character of substantial, humane truth, blessing those\nwhom it entered. It gave the scholar certain powers of expression, the\npower of speech, the power of poetry, of literary art, but it did not\nbring him to peace or to beneficence.\nWhen the literary class betray a destitution of faith, it is not strange\nthat society should be disheartened and sensualized by unbelief. What\nremedy? Life must be lived on a higher plane. We must go up to a higher\nplatform, to which we are always invited to ascend; there, the whole\naspect of things changes. I resist the skepticism of our education and\nof our educated men. I do not believe that the differences of opinion\nand character in men are organic. I do not recognize, beside the class\nof the good and the wise, a permanent class of skeptics, or a class of\nconservatives, or of malignants, or of materialists. I do not believe\nin two classes. You remember the story of the poor woman who importuned\nKing Philip of Macedon to grant her justice, which Philip refused: the\nwoman exclaimed, \"I appeal:\" the king, astonished, asked to whom she\nappealed: the woman replied, \"From Philip drunk to Philip sober.\" The\ntext will suit me very well. I believe not in two classes of men, but in\nman in two moods, in Philip drunk and Philip sober. I think, according\nto the good-hearted word of Plato, \"Unwillingly the soul is deprived of\ntruth.\" Iron conservative, miser, or thief, no man is but by a supposed\nnecessity which he tolerates by shortness or torpidity of sight. The\nsoul lets no man go without some visitations and holydays of a diviner\npresence. It would be easy to show, by a narrow scanning of any man's\nbiography, that we are not so wedded to our paltry performances of\nevery kind but that every man has at intervals the grace to scorn\nhis performances, in comparing them with his belief of what he should\ndo;--that he puts himself on the side of his enemies, listening gladly\nto what they say of him, and accusing himself of the same things.\nWhat is it men love in Genius, but its infinite hope, which degrades all\nit has done? Genius counts all its miracles poor and short. Its own idea\nit never executed. The Iliad, the Hamlet, the Doric column, the Roman\narch, the Gothic minster, the German anthem, when they are ended, the\nmaster casts behind him. How sinks the song in the waves of melody which\nthe universe pours over his soul! Before that gracious Infinite out of\nwhich he drew these few strokes, how mean they look, though the praises\nof the world attend them. From the triumphs of his art he turns with\ndesire to this greater defeat. Let those admire who will. With silent\njoy he sees himself to be capable of a beauty that eclipses all which\nhis hands have done; all which human hands have ever done.\nWell, we are all the children of genius, the children of virtue,--and\nfeel their inspirations in our happier hours. Is not every man sometimes\na radical in politics? Men are conservatives when they are least\nvigorous, or when they are most luxurious. They are conservatives after\ndinner, or before taking their rest; when they are sick, or aged: in the\nmorning, or when their intellect or their conscience has been aroused;\nwhen they hear music, or when they read poetry, they are radicals. In\nthe circle of the rankest tories that could be collected in England, Old\nor New, let a powerful and stimulating intellect, a man of great heart\nand mind, act on them, and very quickly these frozen conservators will\nyield to the friendly influence, these hopeless will begin to hope,\nthese haters will begin to love, these immovable statues will begin to\nspin and revolve. I cannot help recalling the fine anecdote which Warton\nrelates of Bishop Berkeley, when he was preparing to leave England\nwith his plan of planting the gospel among the American savages. \"Lord\nBathurst told me that the members of the Scriblerus club being met at\nhis house at dinner, they agreed to rally Berkeley, who was also his\nguest, on his scheme at Bermudas. Berkeley, having listened to the\nmany lively things they had to say, begged to be heard in his turn,\nand displayed his plan with such an astonishing and animating force of\neloquence and enthusiasm, that they were struck dumb, and, after some\npause, rose up all together with earnestness, exclaiming, 'Let us set\nout with him immediately.'\" Men in all ways are better than they seem.\nThey like flattery for the moment, but they know the truth for their\nown. It is a foolish cowardice which keeps us from trusting them and\nspeaking to them rude truth. They resent your honesty for an instant,\nthey will thank you for it always. What is it we heartily wish of each\nother? Is it to be pleased and flattered? No, but to be convicted and\nexposed, to be shamed out of our nonsense of all kinds, and made men\nof, instead of ghosts and phantoms. We are weary of gliding ghostlike\nthrough the world, which is itself so slight and unreal. We crave a\nsense of reality, though it come in strokes of pain. I explain so,--by\nthis manlike love of truth,--those excesses and errors into which souls\nof great vigor, but not equal insight, often fall. They feel the poverty\nat the bottom of all the seeming affluence of the world. They know the\nspeed with which they come straight through the thin masquerade, and\nconceive a disgust at the indigence of nature: Rousseau, Mirabeau,\nCharles Fox, Napoleon, Byron,--and I could easily add names nearer home,\nof raging riders, who drive their steeds so hard, in the violence of\nliving to forget its illusion: they would know the worst, and tread\nthe floors of hell. The heroes of ancient and modern fame, Cimon,\nThemistocles, Alcibiades, Alexander, Caesar, have treated life and\nfortune as a game to be well and skilfully played, but the stake not\nto be so valued but that any time it could be held as a trifle light\nas air, and thrown up. Caesar, just before the battle of Pharsalia,\ndiscourses with the Egyptian priest concerning the fountains of the\nNile, and offers to quit the army, the empire, and Cleopatra, if he will\nshow him those mysterious sources.\nThe same magnanimity shows itself in our social relations, in the\npreference, namely, which each man gives to the society of superiors\nover that of his equals. All that a man has will he give for right\nrelations with his mates. All that he has will he give for an erect\ndemeanor in every company and on each occasion. He aims at such things\nas his neighbors prize, and gives his days and nights, his talents and\nhis heart, to strike a good stroke, to acquit himself in all men's sight\nas a man. The consideration of an eminent citizen, of a noted merchant,\nof a man of mark in his profession; a naval and military honor, a\ngeneral's commission, a marshal's baton, a ducal coronet, the laurel of\npoets, and, anyhow procured, the acknowledgment of eminent merit,--have\nthis lustre for each candidate that they enable him to walk erect and\nunashamed in the presence of some persons before whom he felt himself\ninferior. Having raised himself to this rank, having established his\nequality with class after class of those with whom he would live well,\nhe still finds certain others before whom he cannot possess himself,\nbecause they have somewhat fairer, somewhat grander, somewhat purer,\nwhich extorts homage of him. Is his ambition pure? then will his laurels\nand his possessions seem worthless: instead of avoiding these men who\nmake his fine gold dim, he will cast all behind him and seek their\nsociety only, woo and embrace this his humiliation and mortification,\nuntil he shall know why his eye sinks, his voice is husky, and his\nbrilliant talents are paralyzed in this presence. He is sure that the\nsoul which gives the lie to all things will tell none. His constitution\nwill not mislead him. If it cannot carry itself as it ought, high and\nunmatchable in the presence of any man; if the secret oracles whose\nwhisper makes the sweetness and dignity of his life do here withdraw and\naccompany him no longer,--it is time to undervalue what he has valued,\nto dispossess himself of what he has acquired, and with Caesar to take\nin his hand the army, the empire, and Cleopatra, and say, \"All these\nwill I relinquish, if you will show me the fountains of the Nile.\" Dear\nto us are those who love us; the swift moments we spend with them are\na compensation for a great deal of misery; they enlarge our life;--but\ndearer are those who reject us as unworthy, for they add another life:\nthey build a heaven before us whereof we had not dreamed, and thereby\nsupply to us new powers out of the recesses of the spirit, and urge us\nto new and unattempted performances.\nAs every man at heart wishes the best and not inferior society, wishes\nto be convicted of his error and to come to himself,--so he wishes that\nthe same healing should not stop in his thought, but should penetrate\nhis will or active power. The selfish man suffers more from his\nselfishness than he from whom that selfishness withholds some important\nbenefit. What he most wishes is to be lifted to some higher platform,\nthat he may see beyond his present fear the transalpine good, so that\nhis fear, his coldness, his custom may be broken up like fragments of\nice, melted and carried away in the great stream of good will. Do\nyou ask my aid? I also wish to be a benefactor. I wish more to be a\nbenefactor and servant than you wish to be served by me; and surely the\ngreatest good fortune that could befall me is precisely to be so moved\nby you that I should say, 'Take me and all mine, and use me and mine\nfreely to your ends'! for I could not say it otherwise than because a\ngreat enlargement had come to my heart and mind, which made me superior\nto my fortunes. Here we are paralyzed with fear; we hold on to our\nlittle properties, house and land, office and money, for the bread which\nthey have in our experience yielded us, although we confess that our\nbeing does not flow through them. We desire to be made great; we desire\nto be touched with that fire which shall command this ice to stream, and\nmake our existence a benefit. If therefore we start objections to your\nproject, O friend of the slave, or friend of the poor, or of the race,\nunderstand well that it is because we wish to drive you to drive us into\nyour measures. We wish to hear ourselves confuted. We are haunted with\na belief that you have a secret which it would highliest advantage us to\nlearn, and we would force you to impart it to us, though it should bring\nus to prison, or to worse extremity.\nNothing shall warp me from the belief that every man is a lover\nof truth. There is no pure lie, no pure malignity in nature. The\nentertainment of the proposition of depravity is the last profligacy and\nprofanation. There is no skepticism, no atheism but that. Could it be\nreceived into common belief, suicide would unpeople the planet. It has\nhad a name to live in some dogmatic theology, but each man's innocence\nand his real liking of his neighbor have kept it a dead letter. I\nremember standing at the polls one day when the anger of the political\ncontest gave a certain grimness to the faces of the independent\nelectors, and a good man at my side, looking on the people, remarked, \"I\nam satisfied that the largest part of these men, on either side, mean to\nvote right.\" I suppose considerate observers, looking at the masses of\nmen in their blameless and in their equivocal actions, will assent, that\nin spite of selfishness and frivolity, the general purpose in the great\nnumber of persons is fidelity. The reason why any one refuses his assent\nto your opinion, or his aid to your benevolent design, is in you: he\nrefuses to accept you as a bringer of truth, because, though you think\nyou have it, he feels that you have it not. You have not given him the\nauthentic sign.\nIf it were worth while to run into details this general doctrine of\nthe latent but ever soliciting Spirit, it would be easy to adduce\nillustration in particulars of a man's equality to the Church, of his\nequality to the State, and of his equality to every other man. It is\nyet in all men's memory that, a few years ago, the liberal churches\ncomplained that the Calvinistic church denied to them the name of\nChristian. I think the complaint was confession: a religious church\nwould not complain. A religious man like Behmen, Fox, or Swedenborg\nis not irritated by wanting the sanction of the Church, but the Church\nfeels the accusation of his presence and belief.\nIt only needs that a just man should walk in our streets to make it\nappear how pitiful and inartificial a contrivance is our legislation.\nThe man whose part is taken and who does not wait for society in\nanything, has a power which society cannot choose but feel. The familiar\nexperiment called the hydrostatic paradox, in which a capillary column\nof water balances the ocean, is a symbol of the relation of one man\nto the whole family of men. The wise Dandamis, on hearing the lives of\nSocrates, Pythagoras and Diogenes read, \"judged them to be great men\nevery way, excepting, that they were too much subjected to the reverence\nof the laws, which to second and authorize, true virtue must abate very\nmuch of its original vigor.\"\nAnd as a man is equal to the Church and equal to the State, so he\nis equal to every other man. The disparities of power in men are\nsuperficial; and all frank and searching conversation, in which a man\nlays himself open to his brother, apprises each of their radical unity.\nWhen two persons sit and converse in a thoroughly good understanding,\nthe remark is sure to be made, See how we have disputed about words! Let\na clear, apprehensive mind, such as every man knows among his friends,\nconverse with the most commanding poetic genius, I think it would appear\nthat there was no inequality such as men fancy, between them; that a\nperfect understanding, a like receiving, a like perceiving, abolished\ndifferences; and the poet would confess that his creative imagination\ngave him no deep advantage, but only the superficial one that he could\nexpress himself and the other could not; that his advantage was a knack,\nwhich might impose on indolent men but could not impose on lovers of\ntruth; for they know the tax of talent, or what a price of greatness the\npower of expression too often pays. I believe it is the conviction of\nthe purest men, that the net amount of man and man does not much vary.\nEach is incomparably superior to his companion in some faculty. His want\nof skill in other directions has added to his fitness for his own work.\nEach seems to have some compensation yielded to him by his infirmity,\nand every hindrance operates as a concentration of his force.\nThese and the like experiences intimate that man stands in strict\nconnection with a higher fact never yet manifested. There is power over\nand behind us, and we are the channels of its communications. We seek\nto say thus and so, and over our head some spirit sits which contradicts\nwhat we say. We would persuade our fellow to this or that; another self\nwithin our eyes dissuades him. That which we keep back, this reveals.\nIn vain we compose our faces and our words; it holds uncontrollable\ncommunication with the enemy, and he answers civilly to us, but believes\nthe spirit. We exclaim, 'There's a traitor in the house!' but at last it\nappears that he is the true man, and I am the traitor. This open channel\nto the highest life is the first and last reality, so subtle, so quiet,\nyet so tenacious, that although I have never expressed the truth, and\nalthough I have never heard the expression of it from any other, I\nknow that the whole truth is here for me. What if I cannot answer your\nquestions? I am not pained that I cannot frame a reply to the question,\nWhat is the operation we call Providence? There lies the unspoken thing,\npresent, omnipresent. Every time we converse we seek to translate it\ninto speech, but whether we hit or whether we miss, we have the fact.\nEvery discourse is an approximate answer: but it is of small consequence\nthat we do not get it into verbs and nouns, whilst it abides for\ncontemplation forever.\nIf the auguries of the prophesying heart shall make themselves good in\ntime, the man who shall be born, whose advent men and events prepare and\nforeshow, is one who shall enjoy his connection with a higher life, with\nthe man within man; shall destroy distrust by his trust, shall use his\nnative but forgotten methods, shall not take counsel of flesh and blood,\nbut shall rely on the Law alive and beautiful which works over our heads\nand under our feet. Pitiless, it avails itself of our success when\nwe obey it, and of our ruin when we contravene it. Men are all secret\nbelievers in it, else the word justice would have no meaning: they\nbelieve that the best is the true; that right is done at last; or chaos\nwould come. It rewards actions after their nature, and not after the\ndesign of the agent. 'Work,' it saith to man, 'in every hour, paid or\nunpaid, see only that thou work, and thou canst not escape the reward:\nwhether thy work be fine or coarse, planting corn or writing epics, so\nonly it be honest work, done to thine own approbation, it shall earn\na reward to the senses as well as to the thought: no matter how often\ndefeated, you are born to victory. The reward of a thing well done, is\nto have done it.'\nAs soon as a man is wonted to look beyond surfaces, and to see how\nthis high will prevails without an exception or an interval, he settles\nhimself into serenity. He can already rely on the laws of gravity, that\nevery stone will fall where it is due; the good globe is faithful, and\ncarries us securely through the celestial spaces, anxious or resigned,\nwe need not interfere to help it on: and he will learn one day the mild\nlesson they teach, that our own orbit is all our task, and we need not\nassist the administration of the universe. Do not be so impatient to\nset the town right concerning the unfounded pretensions and the false\nreputation of certain men of standing. They are laboring harder to\nset the town right concerning themselves, and will certainly succeed.\nSuppress for a few days your criticism on the insufficiency of this\nor that teacher or experimenter, and he will have demonstrated his\ninsufficiency to all men's eyes. In like manner, let a man fall into the\ndivine circuits, and he is enlarged. Obedience to his genius is the only\nliberating influence. We wish to escape from subjection and a sense of\ninferiority, and we make self-denying ordinances, we drink water, we\neat grass, we refuse the laws, we go to jail: it is all in vain; only\nby obedience to his genius, only by the freest activity in the way\nconstitutional to him, does an angel seem to arise before a man and lead\nhim by the hand out of all the wards of the prison.\nThat which befits us, embosomed in beauty and wonder as we are, is\ncheerfulness and courage, and the endeavor to realize our aspirations.\nThe life of man is the true romance, which when it is valiantly\nconducted will yield the imagination a higher joy than any fiction.\nAll around us what powers are wrapped up under the coarse mattings of\ncustom, and all wonder prevented. It is so wonderful to our neurologists\nthat a man can see without his eyes, that it does not occur to them that\nit is just as wonderful that he should see with them; and that is ever\nthe difference between the wise and the unwise: the latter wonders at\nwhat is unusual, the wise man wonders at the usual. Shall not the heart\nwhich has received so much, trust the Power by which it lives? May it\nnot quit other leadings, and listen to the Soul that has guided it so\ngently and taught it so much, secure that the future will be worthy of\nthe past?", "source": "essays_second_series.txt"}

ART\nNext Volume\nI.\nHISTORY\nThere is no great and no small\nTo the Soul that maketh all:\nAnd where it cometh, all things are\nAnd it cometh everywhere.\nI am owner of the sphere,\nOf the seven stars and the solar year,\nOf C\u00e6sar\u2019s hand, and Plato\u2019s brain,\nOf Lord Christ\u2019s heart, and Shakspeare\u2019s strain.\nHISTORY\nThere is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet\nto the same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the\nright of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has\nthought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any\ntime has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this\nuniversal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is\nthe only and sovereign agent.\nOf the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is\nillustrated by the entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing\nless than all his history. Without hurry, without rest, the human\nspirit goes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every\nthought, every emotion, which belongs to it, in appropriate events. But\nthe thought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history\npreexist in the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances\npredominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time.\nA man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts. The creation of a thousand\nforests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain,\nAmerica, lie folded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp,\nkingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his\nmanifold spirit to the manifold world.\nThis human mind wrote history, and this must read it. The Sphinx must\nsolve her own riddle. If the whole of history is in one man, it is all\nto be explained from individual experience. There is a relation between\nthe hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe\nis drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book\nis yielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise\nof my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal\nforces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages\nexplained by the hours. Of the universal mind each individual man is\none more incarnation. All its properties consist in him. Each new fact\nin his private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men\nhave done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises. Every\nrevolution was first a thought in one man\u2019s mind, and when the same\nthought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era. Every reform\nwas once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion\nagain it will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must\ncorrespond to something in me to be credible or intelligible. We, as we\nread, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and\nexecutioner; must fasten these images to some reality in our secret\nexperience, or we shall learn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or\nC\u00e6sar Borgia is as much an illustration of the mind\u2019s powers and\ndepravations as what has befallen us. Each new law and political\nmovement has meaning for you. Stand before each of its tablets and say,\n\u2018Under this mask did my Proteus nature hide itself.\u2019 This remedies the\ndefect of our too great nearness to ourselves. This throws our actions\ninto perspective; and as crabs, goats, scorpions, the balance and the\nwaterpot lose their meanness when hung as signs in the zodiac, so I can\nsee my own vices without heat in the distant persons of Solomon,\nAlcibiades, and Catiline.\nIt is the universal nature which gives worth to particular men and\nthings. Human life, as containing this, is mysterious and inviolable,\nand we hedge it round with penalties and laws. All laws derive hence\ntheir ultimate reason; all express more or less distinctly some command\nof this supreme, illimitable essence. Property also holds of the soul,\ncovers great spiritual facts, and instinctively we at first hold to it\nwith swords and laws and wide and complex combinations. The obscure\nconsciousness of this fact is the light of all our day, the claim of\nclaims; the plea for education, for justice, for charity; the\nfoundation of friendship and love and of the heroism and grandeur which\nbelong to acts of self-reliance. It is remarkable that involuntarily we\nalways read as superior beings. Universal history, the poets, the\nromancers, do not in their stateliest pictures,\u2014in the sacerdotal, the\nimperial palaces, in the triumphs of will or of genius,\u2014anywhere lose\nour ear, anywhere make us feel that we intrude, that this is for better\nmen; but rather is it true that in their grandest strokes we feel most\nat home. All that Shakspeare says of the king, yonder slip of a boy\nthat reads in the corner feels to be true of himself. We sympathize in\nthe great moments of history, in the great discoveries, the great\nresistances, the great prosperities of men;\u2014because there law was\nenacted, the sea was searched, the land was found, or the blow was\nstruck, _for us_, as we ourselves in that place would have done or\napplauded.\nWe have the same interest in condition and character. We honor the rich\nbecause they have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we\nfeel to be proper to man, proper to us. So all that is said of the wise\nman by Stoic or Oriental or modern essayist, describes to each reader\nhis own idea, describes his unattained but attainable self. All\nliterature writes the character of the wise man. Books, monuments,\npictures, conversation, are portraits in which he finds the lineaments\nhe is forming. The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost him,\nand he is stimulated wherever he moves, as by personal allusions. A\ntrue aspirant therefore never needs look for allusions personal and\nlaudatory in discourse. He hears the commendation, not of himself, but,\nmore sweet, of that character he seeks, in every word that is said\nconcerning character, yea further in every fact and circumstance,\u2014in\nthe running river and the rustling corn. Praise is looked, homage\ntendered, love flows, from mute nature, from the mountains and the\nlights of the firmament.\nThese hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night, let us use in\nbroad day. The student is to read history actively and not passively;\nto esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary. Thus\ncompelled, the Muse of history will utter oracles, as never to those\nwho do not respect themselves. I have no expectation that any man will\nread history aright who thinks that what was done in a remote age, by\nmen whose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense than what he\nis doing to-day.\nThe world exists for the education of each man. There is no age or\nstate of society or mode of action in history to which there is not\nsomewhat corresponding in his life. Every thing tends in a wonderful\nmanner to abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him. He should\nsee that he can live all history in his own person. He must sit solidly\nat home, and not suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires, but\nknow that he is greater than all the geography and all the government\nof the world; he must transfer the point of view from which history is\ncommonly read, from Rome and Athens and London, to himself, and not\ndeny his conviction that he is the court, and if England or Egypt have\nany thing to say to him he will try the case; if not, let them for ever\nbe silent. He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts\nyield their secret sense, and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct\nof the mind, the purpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make\nof the signal narrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether\nthe solid angularity of facts. No anchor, no cable, no fences avail to\nkeep a fact a fact. Babylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome\nare passing already into fiction. The Garden of Eden, the sun standing\nstill in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations. Who cares what\nthe fact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven\nan immortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go the same way.\n\u201cWhat is history,\u201d said Napoleon, \u201cbut a fable agreed upon?\u201d This life\nof ours is stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War,\nColonization, Church, Court and Commerce, as with so many flowers and\nwild ornaments grave and gay. I will not make more account of them. I\nbelieve in Eternity. I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain and the\nIslands,\u2014the genius and creative principle of each and of all eras, in\nmy own mind.\nWe are always coming up with the emphatic facts of history in our\nprivate experience and verifying them here. All history becomes\nsubjective; in other words there is properly no history, only\nbiography. Every mind must know the whole lesson for itself,\u2014must go\nover the whole ground. What it does not see, what it does not live, it\nwill not know. What the former age has epitomized into a formula or\nrule for manipular convenience, it will lose all the good of verifying\nfor itself, by means of the wall of that rule. Somewhere, sometime, it\nwill demand and find compensation for that loss, by doing the work\nitself. Ferguson discovered many things in astronomy which had long\nbeen known. The better for him.\nHistory must be this or it is nothing. Every law which the state enacts\nindicates a fact in human nature; that is all. We must in ourselves see\nthe necessary reason of every fact,\u2014see how it could and must be. So\nstand before every public and private work; before an oration of Burke,\nbefore a victory of Napoleon, before a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of\nSidney, of Marmaduke Robinson; before a French Reign of Terror, and a\nSalem hanging of witches; before a fanatic Revival and the Animal\nMagnetism in Paris, or in Providence. We assume that we under like\ninfluence should be alike affected, and should achieve the like; and we\naim to master intellectually the steps and reach the same height or the\nsame degradation that our fellow, our proxy has done.\nAll inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting the Pyramids, the\nexcavated cities, Stonehenge, the Ohio Circles, Mexico, Memphis,\u2014is the\ndesire to do away this wild, savage, and preposterous There or Then,\nand introduce in its place the Here and the Now. Belzoni digs and\nmeasures in the mummy-pits and pyramids of Thebes, until he can see the\nend of the difference between the monstrous work and himself. When he\nhas satisfied himself, in general and in detail, that it was made by\nsuch a person as he, so armed and so motived, and to ends to which he\nhimself should also have worked, the problem is solved; his thought\nlives along the whole line of temples and sphinxes and catacombs,\npasses through them all with satisfaction, and they live again to the\nmind, or are now.\nA Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and not done by us.\nSurely it was by man, but we find it not in our man. But we apply\nourselves to the history of its production. We put ourselves into the\nplace and state of the builder. We remember the forest-dwellers, the\nfirst temples, the adherence to the first type, and the decoration of\nit as the wealth of the nation increased; the value which is given to\nwood by carving led to the carving over the whole mountain of stone of\na cathedral. When we have gone through this process, and added thereto\nthe Catholic Church, its cross, its music, its processions, its Saints\u2019\ndays and image-worship, we have as it were been the man that made the\nminster; we have seen how it could and must be. We have the sufficient\nreason.\nThe difference between men is in their principle of association. Some\nmen classify objects by color and size and other accidents of\nappearance; others by intrinsic likeness, or by the relation of cause\nand effect. The progress of the intellect is to the clearer vision of\ncauses, which neglects surface differences. To the poet, to the\nphilosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all\nevents profitable, all days holy, all men divine. For the eye is\nfastened on the life, and slights the circumstance. Every chemical\nsubstance, every plant, every animal in its growth, teaches the unity\nof cause, the variety of appearance.\nUpborne and surrounded as we are by this all-creating nature, soft and\nfluid as a cloud or the air, why should we be such hard pedants, and\nmagnify a few forms? Why should we make account of time, or of\nmagnitude, or of figure? The soul knows them not, and genius, obeying\nits law, knows how to play with them as a young child plays with\ngraybeards and in churches. Genius studies the causal thought, and far\nback in the womb of things sees the rays parting from one orb, that\ndiverge, ere they fall, by infinite diameters. Genius watches the monad\nthrough all his masks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature.\nGenius detects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the\ngrub, through the egg, the constant individual; through countless\nindividuals the fixed species; through many species the genus; through\nall genera the steadfast type; through all the kingdoms of organized\nlife the eternal unity. Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and\nnever the same. She casts the same thought into troops of forms, as a\npoet makes twenty fables with one moral. Through the bruteness and\ntoughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will.\nThe adamant streams into soft but precise form before it, and whilst I\nlook at it its outline and texture are changed again. Nothing is so\nfleeting as form; yet never does it quite deny itself. In man we still\ntrace the remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of servitude in\nthe lower races; yet in him they enhance his nobleness and grace; as\nIo, in \u00c6schylus, transformed to a cow, offends the imagination; but how\nchanged when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-Jove, a beautiful woman\nwith nothing of the metamorphosis left but the lunar horns as the\nsplendid ornament of her brows!\nThe identity of history is equally intrinsic, the diversity equally\nobvious. There is, at the surface, infinite variety of things; at the\ncentre there is simplicity of cause. How many are the acts of one man\nin which we recognize the same character! Observe the sources of our\ninformation in respect to the Greek genius. We have the _civil history_\nof that people, as Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch have\ngiven it; a very sufficient account of what manner of persons they were\nand what they did. We have the same national mind expressed for us\nagain in their _literature_, in epic and lyric poems, drama, and\nphilosophy; a very complete form. Then we have it once more in their\n_architecture_, a beauty as of temperance itself, limited to the\nstraight line and the square,\u2014a builded geometry. Then we have it once\nagain in _sculpture_, the \u201ctongue on the balance of expression,\u201d a\nmultitude of forms in the utmost freedom of action and never\ntransgressing the ideal serenity; like votaries performing some\nreligious dance before the gods, and, though in convulsive pain or\nmortal combat, never daring to break the figure and decorum of their\ndance. Thus of the genius of one remarkable people we have a fourfold\nrepresentation: and to the senses what more unlike than an ode of\nPindar, a marble centaur, the peristyle of the Parthenon, and the last\nactions of Phocion?\nEvery one must have observed faces and forms which, without any\nresembling feature, make a like impression on the beholder. A\nparticular picture or copy of verses, if it do not awaken the same\ntrain of images, will yet superinduce the same sentiment as some wild\nmountain walk, although the resemblance is nowise obvious to the\nsenses, but is occult and out of the reach of the understanding. Nature\nis an endless combination and repetition of a very few laws. She hums\nthe old well-known air through innumerable variations.\nNature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her works, and\ndelights in startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected\nquarters. I have seen the head of an old sachem of the forest which at\nonce reminded the eye of a bald mountain summit, and the furrows of the\nbrow suggested the strata of the rock. There are men whose manners have\nthe same essential splendor as the simple and awful sculpture on the\nfriezes of the Parthenon and the remains of the earliest Greek art. And\nthere are compositions of the same strain to be found in the books of\nall ages. What is Guido\u2019s Rospigliosi Aurora but a morning thought, as\nthe horses in it are only a morning cloud? If any one will but take\npains to observe the variety of actions to which he is equally inclined\nin certain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse, he will see\nhow deep is the chain of affinity.\nA painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort\nbecoming a tree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form\nmerely,\u2014but, by watching for a time his motions and plays, the painter\nenters into his nature and can then draw him at will in every attitude.\nSo Roos \u201centered into the inmost nature of a sheep.\u201d I knew a\ndraughtsman employed in a public survey who found that he could not\nsketch the rocks until their geological structure was first explained\nto him. In a certain state of thought is the common origin of very\ndiverse works. It is the spirit and not the fact that is identical. By\na deeper apprehension, and not primarily by a painful acquisition of\nmany manual skills, the artist attains the power of awakening other\nsouls to a given activity.\nIt has been said that \u201ccommon souls pay with what they do, nobler souls\nwith that which they are.\u201d And why? Because a profound nature awakens\nin us by its actions and words, by its very looks and manners, the same\npower and beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses.\nCivil and natural history, the history of art and of literature, must\nbe explained from individual history, or must remain words. There is\nnothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest\nus,\u2014kingdom, college, tree, horse, or iron shoe,\u2014the roots of all\nthings are in man. Santa Croce and the Dome of St. Peter\u2019s are lame\ncopies after a divine model. Strasburg Cathedral is a material\ncounterpart of the soul of Erwin of Steinbach. The true poem is the\npoet\u2019s mind; the true ship is the ship-builder. In the man, could we\nlay him open, we should see the reason for the last flourish and\ntendril of his work; as every spine and tint in the sea-shell preexists\nin the secreting organs of the fish. The whole of heraldry and of\nchivalry is in courtesy. A man of fine manners shall pronounce your\nname with all the ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.\nThe trivial experience of every day is always verifying some old\nprediction to us and converting into things the words and signs which\nwe had heard and seen without heed. A lady with whom I was riding in\nthe forest said to me that the woods always seemed to her to wait, as\nif the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer\nhad passed onward; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance\nof the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet. The man\nwho has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has\nbeen present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the\nworld. I remember one summer day in the fields my companion pointed out\nto me a broad cloud, which might extend a quarter of a mile parallel to\nthe horizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over\nchurches,\u2014a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate\nwith eyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-stretched\nsymmetrical wings. What appears once in the atmosphere may appear\noften, and it was undoubtedly the archetype of that familiar ornament.\nI have seen in the sky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed\nto me that the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the\nthunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift along the\nsides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common\narchitectural scroll to abut a tower.\nBy surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent anew\nthe orders and the ornaments of architecture, as we see how each people\nmerely decorated its primitive abodes. The Doric temple preserves the\nsemblance of the wooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt. The Chinese\npagoda is plainly a Tartar tent. The Indian and Egyptian temples still\nbetray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers. \u201cThe\ncustom of making houses and tombs in the living rock,\u201d says Heeren in\nhis Researches on the Ethiopians, \u201cdetermined very naturally the\nprincipal character of the Nubian Egyptian architecture to the colossal\nform which it assumed. In these caverns, already prepared by nature,\nthe eye was accustomed to dwell on huge shapes and masses, so that when\nart came to the assistance of nature it could not move on a small scale\nwithout degrading itself. What would statues of the usual size, or neat\nporches and wings have been, associated with those gigantic halls\nbefore which only Colossi could sit as watchmen or lean on the pillars\nof the interior?\u201d\nThe Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the forest\ntrees, with all their boughs, to a festal or solemn arcade; as the\nbands about the cleft pillars still indicate the green withes that tied\nthem. No one can walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being\nstruck with the architectural appearance of the grove, especially in\nwinter, when the barrenness of all other trees shows the low arch of\nthe Saxons. In the woods in a winter afternoon one will see as readily\nthe origin of the stained glass window, with which the Gothic\ncathedrals are adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen through\nthe bare and crossing branches of the forest. Nor can any lover of\nnature enter the old piles of Oxford and the English cathedrals,\nwithout feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the builder,\nand that his chisel, his saw and plane still reproduced its ferns, its\nspikes of flowers, its locust, elm, oak, pine, fir and spruce.\nThe Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable\ndemand of harmony in man. The mountain of granite blooms into an\neternal flower, with the lightness and delicate finish as well as the\naerial proportions and perspective of vegetable beauty.\nIn like manner all public facts are to be individualized, all private\nfacts are to be generalized. Then at once History becomes fluid and\ntrue, and Biography deep and sublime. As the Persian imitated in the\nslender shafts and capitals of his architecture the stem and flower of\nthe lotus and palm, so the Persian court in its magnificent era never\ngave over the nomadism of its barbarous tribes, but travelled from\nEcbatana, where the spring was spent, to Susa in summer and to Babylon\nfor the winter.\nIn the early history of Asia and Africa, Nomadism and Agriculture are\nthe two antagonist facts. The geography of Asia and of Africa\nnecessitated a nomadic life. But the nomads were the terror of all\nthose whom the soil or the advantages of a market had induced to build\ntowns. Agriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because of the\nperils of the state from nomadism. And in these late and civil\ncountries of England and America these propensities still fight out the\nold battle, in the nation and in the individual. The nomads of Africa\nwere constrained to wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives\nthe cattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy\nseason and to drive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions. The\nnomads of Asia follow the pasturage from month to month. In America and\nEurope the nomadism is of trade and curiosity; a progress, certainly,\nfrom the gad-fly of Astaboras to the Anglo and Italo-mania of Boston\nBay. Sacred cities, to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was\nenjoined, or stringent laws and customs, tending to invigorate the\nnational bond, were the check on the old rovers; and the cumulative\nvalues of long residence are the restraints on the itineracy of the\npresent day. The antagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in\nindividuals, as the love of adventure or the love of repose happens to\npredominate. A man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty\nof rapid domestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all\nlatitudes as easily as a Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or in the\nsnow, he sleeps as warm, dines with as good appetite, and associates as\nhappily as beside his own chimneys. Or perhaps his facility is deeper\nseated, in the increased range of his faculties of observation, which\nyield him points of interest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes. The\npastoral nations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this\nintellectual nomadism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind through the\ndissipation of power on a miscellany of objects. The home-keeping wit,\non the other hand, is that continence or content which finds all the\nelements of life in its own soil; and which has its own perils of\nmonotony and deterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infusions.\nEvery thing the individual sees without him corresponds to his states\nof mind, and every thing is in turn intelligible to him, as his onward\nthinking leads him into the truth to which that fact or series belongs.\nThe primeval world,\u2014the Fore-World, as the Germans say,\u2014I can dive to\nit in myself as well as grope for it with researching fingers in\ncatacombs, libraries, and the broken reliefs and torsos of ruined\nvillas.\nWhat is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history,\nletters, art, and poetry, in all its periods from the Heroic or Homeric\nage down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or\nfive centuries later? What but this, that every man passes personally\nthrough a Grecian period. The Grecian state is the era of the bodily\nnature, the perfection of the senses,\u2014of the spiritual nature unfolded\nin strict unity with the body. In it existed those human forms which\nsupplied the sculptor with his models of Hercules, Ph\u0153bus, and Jove;\nnot like the forms abounding in the streets of modern cities, wherein\nthe face is a confused blur of features, but composed of incorrupt,\nsharply defined and symmetrical features, whose eye-sockets are so\nformed that it would be impossible for such eyes to squint and take\nfurtive glances on this side and on that, but they must turn the whole\nhead. The manners of that period are plain and fierce. The reverence\nexhibited is for personal qualities; courage, address, self-command,\njustice, strength, swiftness, a loud voice, a broad chest. Luxury and\nelegance are not known. A sparse population and want make every man his\nown valet, cook, butcher and soldier, and the habit of supplying his\nown needs educates the body to wonderful performances. Such are the\nAgamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far different is the picture\nXenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the Retreat of the Ten\nThousand. \u201cAfter the army had crossed the river Teleboas in Armenia,\nthere fell much snow, and the troops lay miserably on the ground\ncovered with it. But Xenophon arose naked, and taking an axe, began to\nsplit wood; whereupon others rose and did the like.\u201d Throughout his\narmy exists a boundless liberty of speech. They quarrel for plunder,\nthey wrangle with the generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as\nsharp-tongued as any and sharper-tongued than most, and so gives as\ngood as he gets. Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys,\nwith such a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have?\nThe costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the old\nliterature, is that the persons speak simply,\u2014speak as persons who have\ngreat good sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective habit\nhas become the predominant habit of the mind. Our admiration of the\nantique is not admiration of the old, but of the natural. The Greeks\nare not reflective, but perfect in their senses and in their health,\nwith the finest physical organization in the world. Adults acted with\nthe simplicity and grace of children. They made vases, tragedies, and\nstatues, such as healthy senses should,\u2014that is, in good taste. Such\nthings have continued to be made in all ages, and are now, wherever a\nhealthy physique exists; but, as a class, from their superior\norganization, they have surpassed all. They combine the energy of\nmanhood with the engaging unconsciousness of childhood. The attraction\nof these manners is that they belong to man, and are known to every man\nin virtue of his being once a child; besides that there are always\nindividuals who retain these characteristics. A person of childlike\ngenius and inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our love of the\nMuse of Hellas. I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes. In\nreading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks, mountains\nand waves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea. I feel the\neternity of man, the identity of his thought. The Greek had it seems\nthe same fellow-beings as I. The sun and moon, water and fire, met his\nheart precisely as they meet mine. Then the vaunted distinction between\nGreek and English, between Classic and Romantic schools, seems\nsuperficial and pedantic. When a thought of Plato becomes a thought to\nme,\u2014when a truth that fired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no\nmore. When I feel that we two meet in a perception, that our two souls\nare tinged with the same hue, and do as it were run into one, why\nshould I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count Egyptian\nyears?\nThe student interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of chivalry,\nand the days of maritime adventure and circumnavigation by quite\nparallel miniature experiences of his own. To the sacred history of the\nworld he has the same key. When the voice of a prophet out of the deeps\nof antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of his infancy, a prayer\nof his youth, he then pierces to the truth through all the confusion of\ntradition and the caricature of institutions.\nRare, extravagant spirits come by us at intervals, who disclose to us\nnew facts in nature. I see that men of God have from time to time\nwalked among men and made their commission felt in the heart and soul\nof the commonest hearer. Hence evidently the tripod, the priest, the\npriestess inspired by the divine afflatus.\nJesus astonishes and overpowers sensual people. They cannot unite him\nto history, or reconcile him with themselves. As they come to revere\ntheir intuitions and aspire to live holily, their own piety explains\nevery fact, every word.\nHow easily these old worships of Moses, of Zoroaster, of Menu, of\nSocrates, domesticate themselves in the mind. I cannot find any\nantiquity in them. They are mine as much as theirs.\nI have seen the first monks and anchorets, without crossing seas or\ncenturies. More than once some individual has appeared to me with such\nnegligence of labor and such commanding contemplation, a haughty\nbeneficiary begging in the name of God, as made good to the nineteenth\ncentury Simeon the Stylite, the Thebais, and the first Capuchins.\nThe priestcraft of the East and West, of the Magian, Brahmin, Druid,\nand Inca, is expounded in the individual\u2019s private life. The cramping\ninfluence of a hard formalist on a young child, in repressing his\nspirits and courage, paralyzing the understanding, and that without\nproducing indignation, but only fear and obedience, and even much\nsympathy with the tyranny,\u2014is a familiar fact, explained to the child\nwhen he becomes a man, only by seeing that the oppressor of his youth\nis himself a child tyrannized over by those names and words and forms\nof whose influence he was merely the organ to the youth. The fact\nteaches him how Belus was worshipped and how the Pyramids were built,\nbetter than the discovery by Champollion of the names of all the\nworkmen and the cost of every tile. He finds Assyria and the Mounds of\nCholula at his door, and himself has laid the courses.\nAgain, in that protest which each considerate person makes against the\nsuperstition of his times, he repeats step for step the part of old\nreformers, and in the search after truth finds, like them, new perils\nto virtue. He learns again what moral vigor is needed to supply the\ngirdle of a superstition. A great licentiousness treads on the heels of\na reformation. How many times in the history of the world has the\nLuther of the day had to lament the decay of piety in his own\nhousehold! \u201cDoctor,\u201d said his wife to Martin Luther, one day, \u201chow is\nit that whilst subject to papacy we prayed so often and with such\nfervor, whilst now we pray with the utmost coldness and very seldom?\u201d\nThe advancing man discovers how deep a property he has in\nliterature,\u2014in all fable as well as in all history. He finds that the\npoet was no odd fellow who described strange and impossible situations,\nbut that universal man wrote by his pen a confession true for one and\ntrue for all. His own secret biography he finds in lines wonderfully\nintelligible to him, dotted down before he was born. One after another\nhe comes up in his private adventures with every fable of \u00c6sop, of\nHomer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer, of Scott, and verifies them\nwith his own head and hands.\nThe beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper creations of the\nimagination and not of the fancy, are universal verities. What a range\nof meanings and what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus!\nBeside its primary value as the first chapter of the history of Europe,\n(the mythology thinly veiling authentic facts, the invention of the\nmechanic arts and the migration of colonies,) it gives the history of\nreligion, with some closeness to the faith of later ages. Prometheus is\nthe Jesus of the old mythology. He is the friend of man; stands between\nthe unjust \u201cjustice\u201d of the Eternal Father and the race of mortals, and\nreadily suffers all things on their account. But where it departs from\nthe Calvinistic Christianity and exhibits him as the defier of Jove, it\nrepresents a state of mind which readily appears wherever the doctrine\nof Theism is taught in a crude, objective form, and which seems the\nself-defence of man against this untruth, namely a discontent with the\nbelieved fact that a God exists, and a feeling that the obligation of\nreverence is onerous. It would steal if it could the fire of the\nCreator, and live apart from him and independent of him. The Prometheus\nVinctus is the romance of skepticism. Not less true to all time are the\ndetails of that stately apologue. Apollo kept the flocks of Admetus,\nsaid the poets. When the gods come among men, they are not known. Jesus\nwas not; Socrates and Shakspeare were not. Antaeus was suffocated by\nthe gripe of Hercules, but every time he touched his mother earth his\nstrength was renewed. Man is the broken giant, and in all his weakness\nboth his body and his mind are invigorated by habits of conversation\nwith nature. The power of music, the power of poetry, to unfix and as\nit were clap wings to solid nature, interprets the riddle of Orpheus.\nThe philosophical perception of identity through endless mutations of\nform makes him know the Proteus. What else am I who laughed or wept\nyesterday, who slept last night like a corpse, and this morning stood\nand ran? And what see I on any side but the transmigrations of Proteus?\nI can symbolize my thought by using the name of any creature, of any\nfact, because every creature is man agent or patient. Tantalus is but a\nname for you and me. Tantalus means the impossibility of drinking the\nwaters of thought which are always gleaming and waving within sight of\nthe soul. The transmigration of souls is no fable. I would it were; but\nmen and women are only half human. Every animal of the barn-yard, the\nfield and the forest, of the earth and of the waters that are under the\nearth, has contrived to get a footing and to leave the print of its\nfeatures and form in some one or other of these upright, heaven-facing\nspeakers. Ah! brother, stop the ebb of thy soul,\u2014ebbing downward into\nthe forms into whose habits thou hast now for many years slid. As near\nand proper to us is also that old fable of the Sphinx, who was said to\nsit in the road-side and put riddles to every passenger. If the man\ncould not answer, she swallowed him alive. If he could solve the\nriddle, the Sphinx was slain. What is our life but an endless flight of\nwinged facts or events? In splendid variety these changes come, all\nputting questions to the human spirit. Those men who cannot answer by a\nsuperior wisdom these facts or questions of time, serve them. Facts\nencumber them, tyrannize over them, and make the men of routine, the\nmen of _sense_, in whom a literal obedience to facts has extinguished\nevery spark of that light by which man is truly man. But if the man is\ntrue to his better instincts or sentiments, and refuses the dominion of\nfacts, as one that comes of a higher race; remains fast by the soul and\nsees the principle, then the facts fall aptly and supple into their\nplaces; they know their master, and the meanest of them glorifies him.\nSee in Goethe\u2019s Helena the same desire that every word should be a\nthing. These figures, he would say, these Chirons, Griffins, Phorkyas,\nHelen and Leda, are somewhat, and do exert a specific influence on the\nmind. So far then are they eternal entities, as real to-day as in the\nfirst Olympiad. Much revolving them he writes out freely his humor, and\ngives them body to his own imagination. And although that poem be as\nvague and fantastic as a dream, yet is it much more attractive than the\nmore regular dramatic pieces of the same author, for the reason that it\noperates a wonderful relief to the mind from the routine of customary\nimages,\u2014awakens the reader\u2019s invention and fancy by the wild freedom of\nthe design, and by the unceasing succession of brisk shocks of\nsurprise.\nThe universal nature, too strong for the petty nature of the bard, sits\non his neck and writes through his hand; so that when he seems to vent\na mere caprice and wild romance, the issue is an exact allegory. Hence\nPlato said that \u201cpoets utter great and wise things which they do not\nthemselves understand.\u201d All the fictions of the Middle Age explain\nthemselves as a masked or frolic expression of that which in grave\nearnest the mind of that period toiled to achieve. Magic and all that\nis ascribed to it is a deep presentiment of the powers of science. The\nshoes of swiftness, the sword of sharpness, the power of subduing the\nelements, of using the secret virtues of minerals, of understanding the\nvoices of birds, are the obscure efforts of the mind in a right\ndirection. The preternatural prowess of the hero, the gift of perpetual\nyouth, and the like, are alike the endeavour of the human spirit \u201cto\nbend the shows of things to the desires of the mind.\u201d\nIn Perceforest and Amadis de Gaul a garland and a rose bloom on the\nhead of her who is faithful, and fade on the brow of the inconstant. In\nthe story of the Boy and the Mantle even a mature reader may be\nsurprised with a glow of virtuous pleasure at the triumph of the gentle\nVenelas; and indeed all the postulates of elfin annals,\u2014that the\nfairies do not like to be named; that their gifts are capricious and\nnot to be trusted; that who seeks a treasure must not speak; and the\nlike,\u2014I find true in Concord, however they might be in Cornwall or\nBretagne.\nIs it otherwise in the newest romance? I read the Bride of Lammermoor.\nSir William Ashton is a mask for a vulgar temptation, Ravenswood Castle\na fine name for proud poverty, and the foreign mission of state only a\nBunyan disguise for honest industry. We may all shoot a wild bull that\nwould toss the good and beautiful, by fighting down the unjust and\nsensual. Lucy Ashton is another name for fidelity, which is always\nbeautiful and always liable to calamity in this world.\nBut along with the civil and metaphysical history of man, another\nhistory goes daily forward,\u2014that of the external world,\u2014in which he is\nnot less strictly implicated. He is the compend of time; he is also the\ncorrelative of nature. His power consists in the multitude of his\naffinities, in the fact that his life is intertwined with the whole\nchain of organic and inorganic being. In old Rome the public roads\nbeginning at the Forum proceeded north, south, east, west, to the\ncentre of every province of the empire, making each market-town of\nPersia, Spain and Britain pervious to the soldiers of the capital: so\nout of the human heart go as it were highways to the heart of every\nobject in nature, to reduce it under the dominion of man. A man is a\nbundle of relations, a knot of roots, whose flower and fruitage is the\nworld. His faculties refer to natures out of him and predict the world\nhe is to inhabit, as the fins of the fish foreshow that water exists,\nor the wings of an eagle in the egg presuppose air. He cannot live\nwithout a world. Put Napoleon in an island prison, let his faculties\nfind no men to act on, no Alps to climb, no stake to play for, and he\nwould beat the air, and appear stupid. Transport him to large\ncountries, dense population, complex interests and antagonist power,\nand you shall see that the man Napoleon, bounded that is by such a\nprofile and outline, is not the virtual Napoleon. This is but Talbot\u2019s\nshadow;\u2014\n\u201cHis substance is not here.\nFor what you see is but the smallest part\nAnd least proportion of humanity;\nBut were the whole frame here,\nIt is of such a spacious, lofty pitch,\nYour roof were not sufficient to contain it.\u201d\n\u2014Henry VI.\nColumbus needs a planet to shape his course upon. Newton and Laplace\nneed myriads of age and thick-strewn celestial areas. One may say a\ngravitating solar system is already prophesied in the nature of\nNewton\u2019s mind. Not less does the brain of Davy or of Gay-Lussac, from\nchildhood exploring the affinities and repulsions of particles,\nanticipate the laws of organization. Does not the eye of the human\nembryo predict the light? the ear of Handel predict the witchcraft of\nharmonic sound? Do not the constructive fingers of Watt, Fulton,\nWhittemore, Arkwright, predict the fusible, hard, and temperable\ntexture of metals, the properties of stone, water, and wood? Do not the\nlovely attributes of the maiden child predict the refinements and\ndecorations of civil society? Here also we are reminded of the action\nof man on man. A mind might ponder its thought for ages and not gain so\nmuch self-knowledge as the passion of love shall teach it in a day. Who\nknows himself before he has been thrilled with indignation at an\noutrage, or has heard an eloquent tongue, or has shared the throb of\nthousands in a national exultation or alarm? No man can antedate his\nexperience, or guess what faculty or feeling a new object shall unlock,\nany more than he can draw to-day the face of a person whom he shall see\nto-morrow for the first time.\nI will not now go behind the general statement to explore the reason of\nthis correspondency. Let it suffice that in the light of these two\nfacts, namely, that the mind is One, and that nature is its\ncorrelative, history is to be read and written.\nThus in all ways does the soul concentrate and reproduce its treasures\nfor each pupil. He too shall pass through the whole cycle of\nexperience. He shall collect into a focus the rays of nature. History\nno longer shall be a dull book. It shall walk incarnate in every just\nand wise man. You shall not tell me by languages and titles a catalogue\nof the volumes you have read. You shall make me feel what periods you\nhave lived. A man shall be the Temple of Fame. He shall walk, as the\npoets have described that goddess, in a robe painted all over with\nwonderful events and experiences;\u2014his own form and features by their\nexalted intelligence shall be that variegated vest. I shall find in him\nthe Foreworld; in his childhood the Age of Gold, the Apples of\nKnowledge, the Argonautic Expedition, the calling of Abraham, the\nbuilding of the Temple, the Advent of Christ, Dark Ages, the Revival of\nLetters, the Reformation, the discovery of new lands, the opening of\nnew sciences and new regions in man. He shall be the priest of Pan, and\nbring with him into humble cottages the blessing of the morning stars,\nand all the recorded benefits of heaven and earth.\nIs there somewhat overweening in this claim? Then I reject all I have\nwritten, for what is the use of pretending to know what we know not?\nBut it is the fault of our rhetoric that we cannot strongly state one\nfact without seeming to belie some other. I hold our actual knowledge\nvery cheap. Hear the rats in the wall, see the lizard on the fence, the\nfungus under foot, the lichen on the log. What do I know\nsympathetically, morally, of either of these worlds of life? As old as\nthe Caucasian man,\u2014perhaps older,\u2014these creatures have kept their\ncounsel beside him, and there is no record of any word or sign that has\npassed from one to the other. What connection do the books show between\nthe fifty or sixty chemical elements and the historical eras? Nay, what\ndoes history yet record of the metaphysical annals of man? What light\ndoes it shed on those mysteries which we hide under the names Death and\nImmortality? Yet every history should be written in a wisdom which\ndivined the range of our affinities and looked at facts as symbols. I\nam ashamed to see what a shallow village tale our so-called History is.\nHow many times we must say Rome, and Paris, and Constantinople! What\ndoes Rome know of rat and lizard? What are Olympiads and Consulates to\nthese neighboring systems of being? Nay, what food or experience or\nsuccor have they for the Esquimaux seal-hunter, for the Kanaka in his\ncanoe, for the fisherman, the stevedore, the porter?\nBroader and deeper we must write our annals,\u2014from an ethical\nreformation, from an influx of the ever new, ever sanative\nconscience,\u2014if we would trulier express our central and wide-related\nnature, instead of this old chronology of selfishness and pride to\nwhich we have too long lent our eyes. Already that day exists for us,\nshines in on us at unawares, but the path of science and of letters is\nnot the way into nature. The idiot, the Indian, the child and\nunschooled farmer\u2019s boy stand nearer to the light by which nature is to\nbe read, than the dissector or the antiquary.\nII.\nSELF-RELIANCE\n\u201cNe te qu\u00e6siveris extra.\u201d\n\u201cMan is his own star; and the soul that can\nRender an honest and a perfect man,\nCommands all light, all influence, all fate;\nNothing to him falls early or too late.\nOur acts our angels are, or good or ill,\nOur fatal shadows that walk by us still.\u201d\n_Epilogue to Beaumont and Fletcher\u2019s Honest Man\u2019s Fortune._\nCast the bantling on the rocks,\nSuckle him with the she-wolf\u2019s teat,\nWintered with the hawk and fox.\nPower and speed be hands and feet.\nSELF-RELIANCE\nI read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which\nwere original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition\nin such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they\ninstil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe\nyour own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private\nheart is true for all men,\u2014that is genius. Speak your latent\nconviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due\ntime becomes the outmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us\nby the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind\nis to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato and Milton is\nthat they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men,\nbut what _they_ thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that\ngleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the\nlustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without\nnotice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we\nrecognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a\ncertain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting\nlesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous\nimpression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry\nof voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with\nmasterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the\ntime, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from\nanother.\nThere is a time in every man\u2019s education when he arrives at the\nconviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he\nmust take himself for better for worse as his portion; that though the\nwide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to\nhim but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given\nto him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and\nnone but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until\nhe has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes\nmuch impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory\nis not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray\nshould fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half\nexpress ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us\nrepresents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good\nissues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work\nmade manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his\nheart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done\notherwise shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not\ndeliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no\ninvention, no hope.\nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the\nplace the divine providence has found for you, the society of your\ncontemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done\nso, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age,\nbetraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated\nat their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their\nbeing. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same\ntranscendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected\ncorner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers\nand benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort and advancing on Chaos and\nthe Dark.\nWhat pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in the face and\nbehavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel\nmind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed\nthe strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their\nmind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in\ntheir faces we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody; all\nconform to it; so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the\nadults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty\nand manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it\nenviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand\nby itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak\nto you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear\nand emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries.\nBashful or bold then, he will know how to make us seniors very\nunnecessary.\nThe nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as\nmuch as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy\nattitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the\nplayhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on\nsuch people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their\nmerits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting,\nsilly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about\nconsequences, about interests; he gives an independent, genuine\nverdict. You must court him; he does not court you. But the man is as\nit were clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once\nacted or spoken with _\u00e9clat_ he is a committed person, watched by the\nsympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter\ninto his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass\nagain into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges and, having\nobserved, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable,\nunaffrighted innocence,\u2014must always be formidable. He would utter\nopinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private but\nnecessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in\nfear.\nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and\ninaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in\nconspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is\na joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better\nsecuring of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and\nculture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity.\nSelf-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but\nnames and customs.\nWhoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather\nimmortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must\nexplore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity\nof your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the\nsuffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I\nwas prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me\nwith the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, \u201cWhat have I\nto do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?\u201d\nmy friend suggested,\u2014\u201cBut these impulses may be from below, not from\nabove.\u201d I replied, \u201cThey do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the\nDevil\u2019s child, I will live then from the Devil.\u201d No law can be sacred\nto me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily\ntransferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my\nconstitution; the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry\nhimself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were\ntitular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we\ncapitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead\ninstitutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways\nme more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the\nrude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of\nphilanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful\ncause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes,\nwhy should I not say to him, \u2018Go love thy infant; love thy\nwood-chopper; be good-natured and modest; have that grace; and never\nvarnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible\ntenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite\nat home.\u2019 Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is\nhandsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some\nedge to it,\u2014else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached,\nas the counteraction of the doctrine of love, when that pules and\nwhines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius\ncalls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, _Whim_. I hope\nit is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in\nexplanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude\ncompany. Then again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my\nobligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they _my_ poor?\nI tell thee thou foolish philanthropist that I grudge the dollar, the\ndime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I\ndo not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual\naffinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison if need be;\nbut your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of\nfools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now\nstand; alms to sots, and the thousand-fold Relief Societies;\u2014though I\nconfess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a\nwicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.\nVirtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the\nrule. There is the man _and_ his virtues. Men do what is called a good\naction, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a\nfine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are\ndone as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,\u2014as\ninvalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I\ndo not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for\na spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it\nbe genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I\nwish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask\nprimary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the\nman to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference\nwhether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I\ncannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few\nand mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own\nassurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.\nWhat I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This\nrule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for\nthe whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder\nbecause you will always find those who think they know what is your\nduty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the\nworld\u2019s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the\ngreat man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect\nsweetness the independence of solitude.\nThe objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is\nthat it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the\nimpression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute\nto a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the\ngovernment or against it, spread your table like base\nhousekeepers,\u2014under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the\nprecise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your\nproper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and\nyou shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a\nblindman\u2019s-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I\nanticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and\ntopic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not\nknow beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous\nword? Do I not know that with all this ostentation of examining the\ngrounds of the institution he will do no such thing? Do I not know that\nhe is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, the permitted\nside, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained\nattorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation.\nWell, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief,\nand attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion.\nThis conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a\nfew lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite\ntrue. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so\nthat every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to\nset them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the\nprison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut\nof face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine\nexpression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does\nnot fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean \u201cthe\nfoolish face of praise,\u201d the forced smile which we put on in company\nwhere we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not\ninterest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low\nusurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the\nmost disagreeable sensation.\nFor nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And\ntherefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers\nlook askance on him in the public street or in the friend\u2019s parlor. If\nthis aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own\nhe might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the\nmultitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on\nand off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the\ndiscontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and\nthe college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to\nbrook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and\nprudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But\nwhen to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added,\nwhen the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent\nbrute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and\nmow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike\nas a trifle of no concernment.\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a\nreverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no\nother data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath\nto disappoint them.\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about\nthis corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have\nstated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict\nyourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on\nyour memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring\nthe past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in\na new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the\nDeity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them\nheart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color.\nLeave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and\nflee.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by\nlittle statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great\nsoul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his\nshadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words and\nto-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it\ncontradict every thing you said to-day.\u2014\u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be\nmisunderstood.\u2019\u2014Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was\nmisunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and\nGalileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took\nflesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.\nI suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will\nare rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes\nand Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it\nmatter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or\nAlexandrian stanza;\u2014read it forward, backward, or across, it still\nspells the same thing. In this pleasing contrite wood-life which God\nallows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect\nor retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical,\nthough I mean it not and see it not. My book should smell of pines and\nresound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should\ninterweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web\nalso. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men\nimagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt\nactions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.\nThere will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be\neach honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions\nwill be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost\nsight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One\ntendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line\nof a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it\nstraightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will\nexplain itself and will explain your other genuine actions. Your\nconformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done\nsingly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can\nbe firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done so\nmuch right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now.\nAlways scorn appearances and you always may. The force of character is\ncumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into\nthis. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field,\nwhich so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great\ndays and victories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing\nactor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels. That is it\nwhich throws thunder into Chatham\u2019s voice, and dignity into\nWashington\u2019s port, and America into Adams\u2019s eye. Honor is venerable to\nus because it is no ephemera. It is always ancient virtue. We worship\nit to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage\nbecause it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is\nself-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate\npedigree, even if shown in a young person.\nI hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and\nconsistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward.\nInstead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan\nfife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat\nat my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to\nplease me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it\nkind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth\nmediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face\nof custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all\nhistory, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working\nwherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or\nplace, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He\nmeasures you and all men and all events. Ordinarily, every body in\nsociety reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person.\nCharacter, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the\nwhole creation. The man must be so much that he must make all\ncircumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an\nage; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish\nhis design;\u2014and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of\nclients. A man C\u00e6sar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman\nEmpire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his\ngenius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An\ninstitution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, Monachism, of the\nHermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox;\nMethodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton called\n\u201cthe height of Rome\u201d; and all history resolves itself very easily into\nthe biography of a few stout and earnest persons.\nLet a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him\nnot peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy,\na bastard, or an interloper in the world which exists for him. But the\nman in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the\nforce which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when\nhe looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an\nalien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say\nlike that, \u2018Who are you, Sir?\u2019 Yet they all are his, suitors for his\nnotice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take\npossession. The picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me,\nbut I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot\nwho was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke\u2019s\nhouse, washed and dressed and laid in the duke\u2019s bed, and, on his\nwaking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured\nthat he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it\nsymbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot,\nbut now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a\ntrue prince.\nOur reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history our imagination\nplays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier\nvocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common\nday\u2019s work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total\nof both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg\nand Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue? As\ngreat a stake depends on your private act to-day, as followed their\npublic and renowned steps. When private men shall act with original\nviews, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to\nthose of gentlemen.\nThe world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the\neyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual\nreverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which\nmen have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great\nproprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale\nof men and things and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money\nbut with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the\nhieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of\ntheir own right and comeliness, the right of every man.\nThe magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we\ninquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the\naboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is\nthe nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax,\nwithout calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into\ntrivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear?\nThe inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of\nvirtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote\nthis primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are\ntuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis\ncannot go, all things find their common origin. For the sense of being\nwhich in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse\nfrom things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with\nthem and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and\nbeing also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist and\nafterwards see them as appearances in nature and forget that we have\nshared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here\nare the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom and which\ncannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of\nimmense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs\nof its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do\nnothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask\nwhence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all\nphilosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can\naffirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind\nand his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary\nperceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of\nthem, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to\nbe disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving;\u2014the\nidlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and\nrespect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of\nperceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for they do\nnot distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose\nto see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal.\nIf I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of\ntime all mankind,\u2014although it may chance that no one has seen it before\nme. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.\nThe relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is\nprofane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh\nhe should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the\nworld with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls,\nfrom the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the\nwhole. Whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old\nthings pass away,\u2014means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now,\nand absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made\nsacred by relation to it,\u2014one as much as another. All things are\ndissolved to their centre by their cause, and in the universal miracle\npetty and particular miracles disappear. If therefore a man claims to\nknow and speak of God and carries you backward to the phraseology of\nsome old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe\nhim not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and\ncompletion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast\nhis ripened being? Whence then this worship of the past? The centuries\nare conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and\nspace are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is\nlight: where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an\nimpertinence and an injury if it be any thing more than a cheerful\napologue or parable of my being and becoming.\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say\n\u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before\nthe blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window\nmake no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what\nthey are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There\nis simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.\nBefore a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown\nflower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its\nnature is satisfied and it satisfies nature in all moments alike. But\nman postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with\nreverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround\nhim, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and\nstrong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\nThis should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not\nyet hear God himself unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what\nDavid, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price\non a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote\nthe sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the\nmen of talents and character they chance to see,\u2014painfully recollecting\nthe exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point\nof view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them\nand are willing to let the words go; for at any time they can use words\nas good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It\nis as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be\nweak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory\nof its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his\nvoice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of\nthe corn.\nAnd now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid;\nprobably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering\nof the intuition. That thought by what I can now nearest approach to\nsay it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself,\nit is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the\nfootprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall\nnot hear any name;\u2014the way, the thought, the good shall be wholly\nstrange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take the\nway from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its\nforgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is\nsomewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision there is nothing that\ncan be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion\nbeholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of\nTruth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well.\nVast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea; long\nintervals of time, years, centuries, are of no account. This which I\nthink and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances,\nas it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is\ncalled death.\nLife only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of\nrepose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new\nstate, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one\nfact the world hates; that the soul _becomes;_ for that for ever\ndegrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a\nshame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas\nequally aside. Why then do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the\nsoul is present there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of\nreliance is a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather of that which\nrelies because it works and is. Who has more obedience than I masters\nme, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by\nthe gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric when we speak of\neminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man\nor a company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of\nnature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men,\npoets, who are not.\nThis is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on\nevery topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE.\nSelf-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it\nconstitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into\nall lower forms. All things real are so by so much virtue as they\ncontain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war, eloquence,\npersonal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of its\npresence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature for\nconservation and growth. Power is, in nature, the essential measure of\nright. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot\nhelp itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and\norbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the\nvital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of\nthe self-sufficing and therefore self-relying soul.\nThus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the\ncause. Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books\nand institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the\ninvaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within.\nLet our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law\ndemonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches.\nBut now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his\ngenius admonished to stay at home, to put itself in communication with\nthe internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the\nurns of other men. We must go alone. I like the silent church before\nthe service begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool,\nhow chaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or\nsanctuary! So let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our\nfriend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our\nhearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood and I\nhave all men\u2019s. Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly,\neven to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not\nbe mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the\nwhole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic\ntrifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all\nknock at once at thy closet door and say,\u2014\u2018Come out unto us.\u2019 But keep\nthy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to\nannoy me I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but\nthrough my act. \u201cWhat we love that we have, but by desire we bereave\nourselves of the love.\u201d\nIf we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith, let\nus at least resist our temptations; let us enter into the state of war\nand wake Thor and Woden, courage and constancy, in our Saxon breasts.\nThis is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth. Check\nthis lying hospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to the\nexpectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we\nconverse. Say to them, \u2018O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O\nfriend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward\nI am the truth\u2019s. Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law\nless than the eternal law. I will have no covenants but proximities. I\nshall endeavour to nourish my parents, to support my family, to be the\nchaste husband of one wife,\u2014but these relations I must fill after a new\nand unprecedented way. I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I\ncannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for\nwhat I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to\ndeserve that you should. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will\nso trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the\nsun and moon whatever inly rejoices me and the heart appoints. If you\nare noble, I will love you: if you are not, I will not hurt you and\nmyself by hypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same\ntruth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this\nnot selfishly but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and\nmine, and all men\u2019s, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in\ntruth. Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is\ndictated by your nature as well as mine, and if we follow the truth it\nwill bring us out safe at last.\u2019\u2014But so may you give these friends\npain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their\nsensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when\nthey look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify\nme and do the same thing.\nThe populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a\nrejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold\nsensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the\nlaw of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or the\nother of which we must be shriven. You may fulfil your round of duties\nby clearing yourself in the _direct_, or in the _reflex_ way. Consider\nwhether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin,\nneighbor, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But\nI may also neglect this reflex standard and absolve me to myself. I\nhave my own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty\nto many offices that are called duties. But if I can discharge its\ndebts it enables me to dispense with the popular code. If any one\nimagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day.\nAnd truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the\ncommon motives of humanity and has ventured to trust himself for a\ntaskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that\nhe may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a\nsimple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!\nIf any man consider the present aspects of what is called by\ndistinction _society_, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew\nand heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous,\ndesponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune,\nafraid of death and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and\nperfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our\nsocial state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot\nsatisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to\ntheir practical force and do lean and beg day and night continually.\nOur housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our\nmarriages, our religion we have not chosen, but society has chosen for\nus. We are parlor soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of fate, where\nstrength is born.\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises they lose all\nheart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is _ruined_. If the\nfinest genius studies at one of our colleges and is not installed in an\noffice within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or\nNew York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in\nbeing disheartened and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy\nlad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the\nprofessions, who _teams it, farms it, peddles_, keeps a school,\npreaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so\nforth, in successive years, and always like a cat falls on his feet, is\nworth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days and\nfeels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone\nhis life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred\nchances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man and tell men they are\nnot leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the\nexercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word\nmade flesh, born to shed healing to the nations; that he should be\nashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself,\ntossing the laws, the books, idolatries and customs out of the window,\nwe pity him no more but thank and revere him;\u2014and that teacher shall\nrestore the life of man to splendor and make his name dear to all\nhistory.\nIt is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution\nin all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their\neducation; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association;\nin their property; in their speculative views.\n1. In what prayers do men allow themselves! That which they call a holy\noffice is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks\nfor some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and\nloses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and\nmediatorial and miraculous. Prayer that craves a particular commodity,\nany thing less than all good, is vicious. Prayer is the contemplation\nof the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the\nsoliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God\npronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a private\nend is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature\nand consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not\nbeg. He will then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer\nkneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with\nthe stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though\nfor cheap ends. Caratach, in Fletcher\u2019s Bonduca, when admonished to\ninquire the mind of the god Audate, replies,\u2014\n\u201cHis hidden meaning lies in our endeavors;\nOur valors are our best gods.\u201d\nAnother sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want\nof self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities if you can\nthereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work and already the\nevil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to\nthem who weep foolishly and sit down and cry for company, instead of\nimparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting\nthem once more in communication with their own reason. The secret of\nfortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the\nself-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide; him all tongues\ngreet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out\nto him and embraces him because he did not need it. We solicitously and\napologetically caress and celebrate him because he held on his way and\nscorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him.\n\u201cTo the persevering mortal,\u201d said Zoroaster, \u201cthe blessed Immortals are\nswift.\u201d\nAs men\u2019s prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a\ndisease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, \u2018Let\nnot God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us,\nand we will obey.\u2019 Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my\nbrother, because he has shut his own temple doors and recites fables\nmerely of his brother\u2019s, or his brother\u2019s brother\u2019s God. Every new mind\nis a new classification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and\npower, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes\nits classification on other men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to\nthe depth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it\ntouches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency. But\nchiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also\nclassifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought\nof duty, and man\u2019s relation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism,\nQuakerism, Swedenborgism. The pupil takes the same delight in\nsubordinating every thing to the new terminology as a girl who has just\nlearned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby. It will\nhappen for a time that the pupil will find his intellectual power has\ngrown by the study of his master\u2019s mind. But in all unbalanced minds\nthe classification is idolized, passes for the end and not for a\nspeedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to\ntheir eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the\nluminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built.\nThey cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see,\u2014how you can\nsee; \u2018It must be somehow that you stole the light from us.\u2019 They do not\nyet perceive that light, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any\ncabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call it their own.\nIf they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will\nbe too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and\nthe immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed,\nmillion-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.\n2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling,\nwhose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all\neducated Americans. They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable\nin the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an\naxis of the earth. In manly hours we feel that duty is our place. The\nsoul is no traveller; the wise man stays at home, and when his\nnecessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or\ninto foreign lands, he is at home still and shall make men sensible by\nthe expression of his countenance that he goes, the missionary of\nwisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign and not\nlike an interloper or a valet.\nI have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe for\nthe purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is\nfirst domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding\nsomewhat greater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get\nsomewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows\nold even in youth among old things. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and\nmind have become old and dilapidated as they. He carries ruins to\nruins.\nTravelling is a fool\u2019s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the\nindifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can\nbe intoxicated with beauty and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk,\nembrace my friends, embark on the sea and at last wake up in Naples,\nand there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting,\nidentical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican and the palaces. I\naffect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not\nintoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.\n3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness\naffecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and\nour system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our\nbodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation\nbut the travelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign\ntaste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our opinions,\nour tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant.\nThe soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It was in his\nown mind that the artist sought his model. It was an application of his\nown thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed.\nAnd why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty,\nconvenience, grandeur of thought and quaint expression are as near to\nus as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love\nthe precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil,\nthe length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of\nthe government, he will create a house in which all these will find\nthemselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.\nInsist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every\nmoment with the cumulative force of a whole life\u2019s cultivation; but of\nthe adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous half\npossession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach\nhim. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has\nexhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare?\nWhere is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington,\nor Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of\nScipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will\nnever be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned\nyou, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this\nmoment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal\nchisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses or\nDante, but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul, all\nrich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat\nitself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can\nreply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue\nare two organs of one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of\nthy life, obey thy heart and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.\n4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our\nspirit of society. All men plume themselves on the improvement of\nsociety, and no man improves.\nSociety never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on\nthe other. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is\ncivilized, it is christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this\nchange is not amelioration. For every thing that is given something is\ntaken. Society acquires new arts and loses old instincts. What a\ncontrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American,\nwith a watch, a pencil and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the\nnaked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat and an\nundivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the health of\nthe two men and you shall see that the white man has lost his\naboriginal strength. If the traveller tell us truly, strike the savage\nwith a broad axe and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as\nif you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send\nthe white to his grave.\nThe civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet.\nHe is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He\nhas a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by\nthe sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the\ninformation when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a\nstar in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows\nas little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial\nin his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload\nhis wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it\nmay be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have\nnot lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in\nestablishments and forms some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was\na Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?\nThere is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard\nof height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular\nequality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the\nlast ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of\nthe nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than Plutarch\u2019s\nheroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in time is the race\nprogressive. Phocion, Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men,\nbut they leave no class. He who is really of their class will not be\ncalled by their name, but will be his own man, and in his turn the\nfounder of a sect. The arts and inventions of each period are only its\ncostume and do not invigorate men. The harm of the improved machinery\nmay compensate its good. Hudson and Behring accomplished so much in\ntheir fishing-boats as to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment\nexhausted the resources of science and art. Galileo, with an\nopera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena\nthan any one since. Columbus found the New World in an undecked boat.\nIt is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and\nmachinery which were introduced with loud laudation a few years or\ncenturies before. The great genius returns to essential man. We\nreckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of\nscience, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which\nconsisted of falling back on naked valor and disencumbering it of all\naids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las\nCases, \u201cwithout abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries and\ncarriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should\nreceive his supply of corn, grind it in his hand-mill, and bake his\nbread himself.\u201d\nSociety is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is\ncomposed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to\nthe ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a\nnation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.\nAnd so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments\nwhich protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked away\nfrom themselves and at things so long that they have come to esteem the\nreligious, learned and civil institutions as guards of property, and\nthey deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be assaults\non property. They measure their esteem of each other by what each has,\nand not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his\nproperty, out of new respect for his nature. Especially he hates what\nhe has if he see that it is accidental,\u2014came to him by inheritance, or\ngift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong\nto him, has no root in him and merely lies there because no revolution\nor no robber takes it away. But that which a man is, does always by\nnecessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which\ndoes not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or\nstorm, or bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man\nbreathes. \u201cThy lot or portion of life,\u201d said the Caliph Ali, \u201cis\nseeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.\u201d Our\ndependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for\nnumbers. The political parties meet in numerous conventions; the\ngreater the concourse and with each new uproar of announcement, The\ndelegation from Essex! The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of\nMaine! the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new\nthousand of eyes and arms. In like manner the reformers summon\nconventions and vote and resolve in multitude. Not so, O friends! will\nthe God deign to enter and inhabit you, but by a method precisely the\nreverse. It is only as a man puts off all foreign support and stands\nalone that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every\nrecruit to his banner. Is not a man better than a town? Ask nothing of\nmen, and, in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must presently\nappear the upholder of all that surrounds thee. He who knows that power\nis inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him\nand elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his\nthought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position,\ncommands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his\nfeet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.\nSo use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain\nall, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful\nthese winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God.\nIn the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of\nChance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations. A\npolitical victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick or the\nreturn of your absent friend, or some other favorable event raises your\nspirits, and you think good days are preparing for you. Do not believe\nit. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you\npeace but the triumph of principles.\nIII.\nCOMPENSATION\nThe wings of Time are black and white,\nPied with morning and with night.\nMountain tall and ocean deep\nTrembling balance duly keep.\nIn changing moon, in tidal wave,\nGlows the feud of Want and Have.\nGauge of more and less through space\nElectric star and pencil plays.\nThe lonely Earth amid the balls\nThat hurry through the eternal halls,\nA makeweight flying to the void,\nSupplemental asteroid,\nOr compensatory spark,\nShoots across the neutral Dark.\nMan\u2019s the elm, and Wealth the vine,\nStanch and strong the tendrils twine:\nThough the frail ringlets thee deceive,\nNone from its stock that vine can reave.\nFear not, then, thou child infirm,\nThere\u2019s no god dare wrong a worm.\nLaurel crowns cleave to deserts\nAnd power to him who power exerts;\nHast not thy share? On winged feet,\nLo! it rushes thee to meet;\nAnd all that Nature made thy own,\nFloating in air or pent in stone,\nWill rive the hills and swim the sea\nAnd, like thy shadow, follow thee.\nCOMPENSATION\nEver since I was a boy I have wished to write a discourse on\nCompensation; for it seemed to me when very young that on this subject\nlife was ahead of theology and the people knew more than the preachers\ntaught. The documents too from which the doctrine is to be drawn,\ncharmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always before me,\neven in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our\nbasket, the transactions of the street, the farm and the\ndwelling-house; greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence\nof character, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me also\nthat in it might be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of\nthe soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition; and so the\nheart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love,\nconversing with that which he knows was always and always must be,\nbecause it really is now. It appeared moreover that if this doctrine\ncould be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright\nintuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be\na star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey, that\nwould not suffer us to lose our way.\nI was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church.\nThe preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy, unfolded in the\nordinary manner the doctrine of the Last Judgment. He assumed that\njudgment is not executed in this world; that the wicked are successful;\nthat the good are miserable; and then urged from reason and from\nScripture a compensation to be made to both parties in the next life.\nNo offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this doctrine.\nAs far as I could observe when the meeting broke up they separated\nwithout remark on the sermon.\nYet what was the import of this teaching? What did the preacher mean by\nsaying that the good are miserable in the present life? Was it that\nhouses and lands, offices, wine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by\nunprincipled men, whilst the saints are poor and despised; and that a\ncompensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by giving them the\nlike gratifications another day,\u2014bank-stock and doubloons, venison and\nchampagne? This must be the compensation intended; for what else? Is it\nthat they are to have leave to pray and praise? to love and serve men?\nWhy, that they can do now. The legitimate inference the disciple would\ndraw was,\u2014\u2018We are to have _such_ a good time as the sinners have\nnow\u2019;\u2014or, to push it to its extreme import,\u2014\u2018You sin now; we shall sin\nby and by; we would sin now, if we could; not being successful, we\nexpect our revenge to-morrow.\u2019\nThe fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful;\nthat justice is not done now. The blindness of the preacher consisted\nin deferring to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a\nmanly success, instead of confronting and convicting the world from the\ntruth; announcing the presence of the soul; the omnipotence of the\nwill; and so establishing the standard of good and ill, of success and\nfalsehood.\nI find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day\nand the same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally\nthey treat the related topics. I think that our popular theology has\ngained in decorum, and not in principle, over the superstitions it has\ndisplaced. But men are better than their theology. Their daily life\ngives it the lie. Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine\nbehind him in his own experience, and all men feel sometimes the\nfalsehood which they cannot demonstrate. For men are wiser than they\nknow. That which they hear in schools and pulpits without afterthought,\nif said in conversation would probably be questioned in silence. If a\nman dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the divine laws, he\nis answered by a silence which conveys well enough to an observer the\ndissatisfaction of the hearer, but his incapacity to make his own\nstatement.\nI shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts\nthat indicate the path of the law of Compensation; happy beyond my\nexpectation if I shall truly draw the smallest arc of this circle.\nPolarity, or action and reaction, we meet in every part of nature; in\ndarkness and light; in heat and cold; in the ebb and flow of waters; in\nmale and female; in the inspiration and expiration of plants and\nanimals; in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the\nanimal body; in the systole and diastole of the heart; in the\nundulations of fluids, and of sound; in the centrifugal and centripetal\ngravity; in electricity, galvanism, and chemical affinity. Superinduce\nmagnetism at one end of a needle, the opposite magnetism takes place at\nthe other end. If the south attracts, the north repels. To empty here,\nyou must condense there. An inevitable dualism bisects nature, so that\neach thing is a half, and suggests another thing to make it whole; as,\nspirit, matter; man, woman; odd, even; subjective, objective; in, out;\nupper, under; motion, rest; yea, nay.\nWhilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts. The entire\nsystem of things gets represented in every particle. There is somewhat\nthat resembles the ebb and flow of the sea, day and night, man and\nwoman, in a single needle of the pine, in a kernel of corn, in each\nindividual of every animal tribe. The reaction, so grand in the\nelements, is repeated within these small boundaries. For example, in\nthe animal kingdom the physiologist has observed that no creatures are\nfavorites, but a certain compensation balances every gift and every\ndefect. A surplusage given to one part is paid out of a reduction from\nanother part of the same creature. If the head and neck are enlarged,\nthe trunk and extremities are cut short.\nThe theory of the mechanic forces is another example. What we gain in\npower is lost in time, and the converse. The periodic or compensating\nerrors of the planets is another instance. The influences of climate\nand soil in political history are another. The cold climate\ninvigorates. The barren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers\nor scorpions.\nThe same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every\nexcess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its\nsour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of\npleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its\nmoderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of\nfolly. For every thing you have missed, you have gained something else;\nand for every thing you gain, you lose something. If riches increase,\nthey are increased that use them. If the gatherer gathers too much,\nNature takes out of the man what she puts into his chest; swells the\nestate, but kills the owner. Nature hates monopolies and exceptions.\nThe waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level from their\nloftiest tossing than the varieties of condition tend to equalize\nthemselves. There is always some levelling circumstance that puts down\nthe overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate, substantially on\nthe same ground with all others. Is a man too strong and fierce for\nsociety and by temper and position a bad citizen,\u2014a morose ruffian,\nwith a dash of the pirate in him?\u2014Nature sends him a troop of pretty\nsons and daughters who are getting along in the dame\u2019s classes at the\nvillage school, and love and fear for them smooths his grim scowl to\ncourtesy. Thus she contrives to intenerate the granite and felspar,\ntakes the boar out and puts the lamb in and keeps her balance true.\nThe farmer imagines power and place are fine things. But the President\nhas paid dear for his White House. It has commonly cost him all his\npeace, and the best of his manly attributes. To preserve for a short\ntime so conspicuous an appearance before the world, he is content to\neat dust before the real masters who stand erect behind the throne. Or,\ndo men desire the more substantial and permanent grandeur of genius?\nNeither has this an immunity. He who by force of will or of thought is\ngreat and overlooks thousands, has the charges of that eminence. With\nevery influx of light comes new danger. Has he light? he must bear\nwitness to the light, and always outrun that sympathy which gives him\nsuch keen satisfaction, by his fidelity to new revelations of the\nincessant soul. He must hate father and mother, wife and child. Has he\nall that the world loves and admires and covets?\u2014he must cast behind\nhim their admiration, and afflict them by faithfulness to his truth,\nand become a byword and a hissing.\nThis law writes the laws of cities and nations. It is in vain to build\nor plot or combine against it. Things refuse to be mismanaged long.\n_Res nolunt diu male administrari_. Though no checks to a new evil\nappear, the checks exist, and will appear. If the government is cruel,\nthe governor\u2019s life is not safe. If you tax too high, the revenue will\nyield nothing. If you make the criminal code sanguinary, juries will\nnot convict. If the law is too mild, private vengeance comes in. If the\ngovernment is a terrific democracy, the pressure is resisted by an\nover-charge of energy in the citizen, and life glows with a fiercer\nflame. The true life and satisfactions of man seem to elude the utmost\nrigors or felicities of condition and to establish themselves with\ngreat indifferency under all varieties of circumstances. Under all\ngovernments the influence of character remains the same,\u2014in Turkey and\nin New England about alike. Under the primeval despots of Egypt,\nhistory honestly confesses that man must have been as free as culture\ncould make him.\nThese appearances indicate the fact that the universe is represented in\nevery one of its particles. Every thing in nature contains all the\npowers of nature. Every thing is made of one hidden stuff; as the\nnaturalist sees one type under every metamorphosis, and regards a horse\nas a running man, a fish as a swimming man, a bird as a flying man, a\ntree as a rooted man. Each new form repeats not only the main character\nof the type, but part for part all the details, all the aims,\nfurtherances, hindrances, energies and whole system of every other.\nEvery occupation, trade, art, transaction, is a compend of the world\nand a correlative of every other. Each one is an entire emblem of human\nlife; of its good and ill, its trials, its enemies, its course and its\nend. And each one must somehow accommodate the whole man and recite all\nhis destiny.\nThe world globes itself in a drop of dew. The microscope cannot find\nthe animalcule which is less perfect for being little. Eyes, ears,\ntaste, smell, motion, resistance, appetite, and organs of reproduction\nthat take hold on eternity,\u2014all find room to consist in the small\ncreature. So do we put our life into every act. The true doctrine of\nomnipresence is that God reappears with all his parts in every moss and\ncobweb. The value of the universe contrives to throw itself into every\npoint. If the good is there, so is the evil; if the affinity, so the\nrepulsion; if the force, so the limitation.\nThus is the universe alive. All things are moral. That soul which\nwithin us is a sentiment, outside of us is a law. We feel its\ninspiration; out there in history we can see its fatal strength. \u201cIt is\nin the world, and the world was made by it.\u201d Justice is not postponed.\nA perfect equity adjusts its balance in all parts of life. \u1f08\u03b5\u1f76 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b5\u1f56\n\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u1f31 \u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9,\u2014The dice of God are always loaded. The world\nlooks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which,\nturn it how you will, balances itself. Take what figure you will, its\nexact value, nor more nor less, still returns to you. Every secret is\ntold, every crime is punished, every virtue rewarded, every wrong\nredressed, in silence and certainty. What we call retribution is the\nuniversal necessity by which the whole appears wherever a part appears.\nIf you see smoke, there must be fire. If you see a hand or a limb, you\nknow that the trunk to which it belongs is there behind.\nEvery act rewards itself, or, in other words integrates itself, in a\ntwofold manner; first in the thing, or in real nature; and secondly in\nthe circumstance, or in apparent nature. Men call the circumstance the\nretribution. The causal retribution is in the thing and is seen by the\nsoul. The retribution in the circumstance is seen by the understanding;\nit is inseparable from the thing, but is often spread over a long time\nand so does not become distinct until after many years. The specific\nstripes may follow late after the offence, but they follow because they\naccompany it. Crime and punishment grow out of one stem. Punishment is\na fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which\nconcealed it. Cause and effect, means and ends, seed and fruit, cannot\nbe severed; for the effect already blooms in the cause, the end\npreexists in the means, the fruit in the seed.\nWhilst thus the world will be whole and refuses to be disparted, we\nseek to act partially, to sunder, to appropriate; for example,\u2014to\ngratify the senses we sever the pleasure of the senses from the needs\nof the character. The ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the\nsolution of one problem,\u2014how to detach the sensual sweet, the sensual\nstrong, the sensual bright, etc., from the moral sweet, the moral deep,\nthe moral fair; that is, again, to contrive to cut clean off this upper\nsurface so thin as to leave it bottomless; to get a _one end_, without\nan _other end_. The soul says, \u2018Eat;\u2019 the body would feast. The soul\nsays, \u2018The man and woman shall be one flesh and one soul;\u2019 the body\nwould join the flesh only. The soul says, \u2018Have dominion over all\nthings to the ends of virtue;\u2019 the body would have the power over\nthings to its own ends.\nThe soul strives amain to live and work through all things. It would be\nthe only fact. All things shall be added unto it,\u2014power, pleasure,\nknowledge, beauty. The particular man aims to be somebody; to set up\nfor himself; to truck and higgle for a private good; and, in\nparticulars, to ride that he may ride; to dress that he may be dressed;\nto eat that he may eat; and to govern, that he may be seen. Men seek to\nbe great; they would have offices, wealth, power, and fame. They think\nthat to be great is to possess one side of nature,\u2014the sweet, without\nthe other side, the bitter.\nThis dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted. Up to this day it\nmust be owned no projector has had the smallest success. The parted\nwater reunites behind our hand. Pleasure is taken out of pleasant\nthings, profit out of profitable things, power out of strong things, as\nsoon as we seek to separate them from the whole. We can no more halve\nthings and get the sensual good, by itself, than we can get an inside\nthat shall have no outside, or a light without a shadow. \u201cDrive out\nNature with a fork, she comes running back.\u201d\nLife invests itself with inevitable conditions, which the unwise seek\nto dodge, which one and another brags that he does not know, that they\ndo not touch him;\u2014but the brag is on his lips, the conditions are in\nhis soul. If he escapes them in one part they attack him in another\nmore vital part. If he has escaped them in form and in the appearance,\nit is because he has resisted his life and fled from himself, and the\nretribution is so much death. So signal is the failure of all attempts\nto make this separation of the good from the tax, that the experiment\nwould not be tried,\u2014since to try it is to be mad,\u2014but for the\ncircumstance, that when the disease began in the will, of rebellion and\nseparation, the intellect is at once infected, so that the man ceases\nto see God whole in each object, but is able to see the sensual\nallurement of an object and not see the sensual hurt; he sees the\nmermaid\u2019s head but not the dragon\u2019s tail, and thinks he can cut off\nthat which he would have from that which he would not have. \u201cHow secret\nart thou who dwellest in the highest heavens in silence, O thou only\ngreat God, sprinkling with an unwearied providence certain penal\nblindnesses upon such as have unbridled desires!\u201d[1]\n[1] St. Augustine, Confessions, B. I.\nThe human soul is true to these facts in the painting of fable, of\nhistory, of law, of proverbs, of conversation. It finds a tongue in\nliterature unawares. Thus the Greeks called Jupiter, Supreme Mind; but\nhaving traditionally ascribed to him many base actions, they\ninvoluntarily made amends to reason by tying up the hands of so bad a\ngod. He is made as helpless as a king of England. Prometheus knows one\nsecret which Jove must bargain for; Minerva, another. He cannot get his\nown thunders; Minerva keeps the key of them:\u2014\n\u201cOf all the gods, I only know the keys\nThat ope the solid doors within whose vaults\nHis thunders sleep.\u201d\nA plain confession of the in-working of the All and of its moral aim.\nThe Indian mythology ends in the same ethics; and it would seem\nimpossible for any fable to be invented and get any currency which was\nnot moral. Aurora forgot to ask youth for her lover, and though\nTithonus is immortal, he is old. Achilles is not quite invulnerable;\nthe sacred waters did not wash the heel by which Thetis held him.\nSiegfried, in the Nibelungen, is not quite immortal, for a leaf fell on\nhis back whilst he was bathing in the dragon\u2019s blood, and that spot\nwhich it covered is mortal. And so it must be. There is a crack in\nevery thing God has made. It would seem there is always this vindictive\ncircumstance stealing in at unawares even into the wild poesy in which\nthe human fancy attempted to make bold holiday and to shake itself free\nof the old laws,\u2014this back-stroke, this kick of the gun, certifying\nthat the law is fatal; that in nature nothing can be given, all things\nare sold.\nThis is that ancient doctrine of Nemesis, who keeps watch in the\nuniverse and lets no offence go unchastised. The Furies they said are\nattendants on justice, and if the sun in heaven should transgress his\npath they would punish him. The poets related that stone walls and iron\nswords and leathern thongs had an occult sympathy with the wrongs of\ntheir owners; that the belt which Ajax gave Hector dragged the Trojan\nhero over the field at the wheels of the car of Achilles, and the sword\nwhich Hector gave Ajax was that on whose point Ajax fell. They recorded\nthat when the Thasians erected a statue to Theagenes, a victor in the\ngames, one of his rivals went to it by night and endeavored to throw it\ndown by repeated blows, until at last he moved it from its pedestal and\nwas crushed to death beneath its fall.\nThis voice of fable has in it somewhat divine. It came from thought\nabove the will of the writer. That is the best part of each writer\nwhich has nothing private in it; that which he does not know; that\nwhich flowed out of his constitution and not from his too active\ninvention; that which in the study of a single artist you might not\neasily find, but in the study of many you would abstract as the spirit\nof them all. Phidias it is not, but the work of man in that early\nHellenic world that I would know. The name and circumstance of Phidias,\nhowever convenient for history, embarrass when we come to the highest\ncriticism. We are to see that which man was tending to do in a given\nperiod, and was hindered, or, if you will, modified in doing, by the\ninterfering volitions of Phidias, of Dante, of Shakspeare, the organ\nwhereby man at the moment wrought.\nStill more striking is the expression of this fact in the proverbs of\nall nations, which are always the literature of reason, or the\nstatements of an absolute truth without qualification. Proverbs, like\nthe sacred books of each nation, are the sanctuary of the intuitions.\nThat which the droning world, chained to appearances, will not allow\nthe realist to say in his own words, it will suffer him to say in\nproverbs without contradiction. And this law of laws, which the pulpit,\nthe senate and the college deny, is hourly preached in all markets and\nworkshops by flights of proverbs, whose teaching is as true and as\nomnipresent as that of birds and flies.\nAll things are double, one against another.\u2014Tit for tat; an eye for an\neye; a tooth for a tooth; blood for blood; measure for measure; love\nfor love.\u2014Give and it shall be given you.\u2014He that watereth shall be\nwatered himself.\u2014What will you have? quoth God; pay for it and take\nit.\u2014Nothing venture, nothing have.\u2014Thou shalt be paid exactly for what\nthou hast done, no more, no less.\u2014Who doth not work shall not eat.\u2014Harm\nwatch, harm catch.\u2014Curses always recoil on the head of him who\nimprecates them.\u2014If you put a chain around the neck of a slave, the\nother end fastens itself around your own.\u2014Bad counsel confounds the\nadviser.\u2014The Devil is an ass.\nIt is thus written, because it is thus in life. Our action is\novermastered and characterized above our will by the law of nature. We\naim at a petty end quite aside from the public good, but our act\narranges itself by irresistible magnetism in a line with the poles of\nthe world.\nA man cannot speak but he judges himself. With his will or against his\nwill he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every word.\nEvery opinion reacts on him who utters it. It is a thread-ball thrown\nat a mark, but the other end remains in the thrower\u2019s bag. Or rather it\nis a harpoon hurled at the whale, unwinding, as it flies, a coil of\ncord in the boat, and, if the harpoon is not good, or not well thrown,\nit will go nigh to cut the steersman in twain or to sink the boat.\nYou cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. \u201cNo man had ever a point\nof pride that was not injurious to him,\u201d said Burke. The exclusive in\nfashionable life does not see that he excludes himself from enjoyment,\nin the attempt to appropriate it. The exclusionist in religion does not\nsee that he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in striving to shut\nout others. Treat men as pawns and ninepins and you shall suffer as\nwell as they. If you leave out their heart, you shall lose your own.\nThe senses would make things of all persons; of women, of children, of\nthe poor. The vulgar proverb, \u201cI will get it from his purse or get it\nfrom his skin,\u201d is sound philosophy.\nAll infractions of love and equity in our social relations are speedily\npunished. They are punished by fear. Whilst I stand in simple relations\nto my fellow-man, I have no displeasure in meeting him. We meet as\nwater meets water, or as two currents of air mix, with perfect\ndiffusion and interpenetration of nature. But as soon as there is any\ndeparture from simplicity, and attempt at halfness, or good for me that\nis not good for him, my neighbor feels the wrong; he shrinks from me as\nfar as I have shrunk from him; his eyes no longer seek mine; there is\nwar between us; there is hate in him and fear in me.\nAll the old abuses in society, universal and particular, all unjust\naccumulations of property and power, are avenged in the same manner.\nFear is an instructor of great sagacity and the herald of all\nrevolutions. One thing he teaches, that there is rottenness where he\nappears. He is a carrion crow, and though you see not well what he\nhovers for, there is death somewhere. Our property is timid, our laws\nare timid, our cultivated classes are timid. Fear for ages has boded\nand mowed and gibbered over government and property. That obscene bird\nis not there for nothing. He indicates great wrongs which must be\nrevised.\nOf the like nature is that expectation of change which instantly\nfollows the suspension of our voluntary activity. The terror of\ncloudless noon, the emerald of Polycrates, the awe of prosperity, the\ninstinct which leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks of a\nnoble asceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of the\nbalance of justice through the heart and mind of man.\nExperienced men of the world know very well that it is best to pay scot\nand lot as they go along, and that a man often pays dear for a small\nfrugality. The borrower runs in his own debt. Has a man gained any\nthing who has received a hundred favors and rendered none? Has he\ngained by borrowing, through indolence or cunning, his neighbor\u2019s\nwares, or horses, or money? There arises on the deed the instant\nacknowledgment of benefit on the one part and of debt on the other;\nthat is, of superiority and inferiority. The transaction remains in the\nmemory of himself and his neighbor; and every new transaction alters\naccording to its nature their relation to each other. He may soon come\nto see that he had better have broken his own bones than to have ridden\nin his neighbor\u2019s coach, and that \u201cthe highest price he can pay for a\nthing is to ask for it.\u201d\nA wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life, and know that\nit is the part of prudence to face every claimant and pay every just\ndemand on your time, your talents, or your heart. Always pay; for first\nor last you must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may stand for\na time between you and justice, but it is only a postponement. You must\npay at last your own debt. If you are wise you will dread a prosperity\nwhich only loads you with more. Benefit is the end of nature. But for\nevery benefit which you receive, a tax is levied. He is great who\nconfers the most benefits. He is base,\u2014and that is the one base thing\nin the universe,\u2014to receive favors and render none. In the order of\nnature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or\nonly seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line\nfor line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody. Beware of too much\ngood staying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and worm worms. Pay it\naway quickly in some sort.\nLabor is watched over by the same pitiless laws. Cheapest, say the\nprudent, is the dearest labor. What we buy in a broom, a mat, a wagon,\na knife, is some application of good sense to a common want. It is best\nto pay in your land a skilful gardener, or to buy good sense applied to\ngardening; in your sailor, good sense applied to navigation; in the\nhouse, good sense applied to cooking, sewing, serving; in your agent,\ngood sense applied to accounts and affairs. So do you multiply your\npresence, or spread yourself throughout your estate. But because of the\ndual constitution of things, in labor as in life there can be no\ncheating. The thief steals from himself. The swindler swindles himself.\nFor the real price of labor is knowledge and virtue, whereof wealth and\ncredit are signs. These signs, like paper money, may be counterfeited\nor stolen, but that which they represent, namely, knowledge and virtue,\ncannot be counterfeited or stolen. These ends of labor cannot be\nanswered but by real exertions of the mind, and in obedience to pure\nmotives. The cheat, the defaulter, the gambler, cannot extort the\nknowledge of material and moral nature which his honest care and pains\nyield to the operative. The law of nature is, Do the thing, and you\nshall have the Power; but they who do not the thing have not the power.\nHuman labor, through all its forms, from the sharpening of a stake to\nthe construction of a city or an epic, is one immense illustration of\nthe perfect compensation of the universe. The absolute balance of Give\nand Take, the doctrine that every thing has its price,\u2014and if that\nprice is not paid, not that thing but something else is obtained, and\nthat it is impossible to get any thing without its price,\u2014is not less\nsublime in the columns of a leger than in the budgets of states, in the\nlaws of light and darkness, in all the action and reaction of nature. I\ncannot doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those\nprocesses with which he is conversant, the stern ethics which sparkle\non his chisel-edge, which are measured out by his plumb and foot-rule,\nwhich stand as manifest in the footing of the shop-bill as in the\nhistory of a state,\u2014do recommend to him his trade, and though seldom\nnamed, exalt his business to his imagination.\nThe league between virtue and nature engages all things to assume a\nhostile front to vice. The beautiful laws and substances of the world\npersecute and whip the traitor. He finds that things are arranged for\ntruth and benefit, but there is no den in the wide world to hide a\nrogue. Commit a crime, and the earth is made of glass. Commit a crime,\nand it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground, such as reveals\nin the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel and\nmole. You cannot recall the spoken word, you cannot wipe out the\nfoot-track, you cannot draw up the ladder, so as to leave no inlet or\nclew. Some damning circumstance always transpires. The laws and\nsubstances of nature,\u2014water, snow, wind, gravitation,\u2014become penalties\nto the thief.\nOn the other hand the law holds with equal sureness for all right\naction. Love, and you shall be loved. All love is mathematically just,\nas much as the two sides of an algebraic equation. The good man has\nabsolute good, which like fire turns every thing to its own nature, so\nthat you cannot do him any harm; but as the royal armies sent against\nNapoleon, when he approached cast down their colors and from enemies\nbecame friends, so disasters of all kinds, as sickness, offence,\npoverty, prove benefactors:\u2014\n\u201cWinds blow and waters roll\nStrength to the brave, and power and deity,\nYet in themselves are nothing.\u201d\nThe good are befriended even by weakness and defect. As no man had ever\na point of pride that was not injurious to him, so no man had ever a\ndefect that was not somewhere made useful to him. The stag in the fable\nadmired his horns and blamed his feet, but when the hunter came, his\nfeet saved him, and afterwards, caught in the thicket, his horns\ndestroyed him. Every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults. As\nno man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against\nit, so no man has a thorough acquaintance with the hindrances or\ntalents of men until he has suffered from the one and seen the triumph\nof the other over his own want of the same. Has he a defect of temper\nthat unfits him to live in society? Thereby he is driven to entertain\nhimself alone and acquire habits of self-help; and thus, like the\nwounded oyster, he mends his shell with pearl.\nOur strength grows out of our weakness. The indignation which arms\nitself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and\nstung and sorely assailed. A great man is always willing to be little.\nWhilst he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he\nis pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he\nhas been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns\nhis ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation\nand real skill. The wise man throws himself on the side of his\nassailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak\npoint. The wound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead skin and\nwhen they would triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame is\nsafer than praise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as all\nthat is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of success.\nBut as soon as honeyed words of praise are spoken for me I feel as one\nthat lies unprotected before his enemies. In general, every evil to\nwhich we do not succumb is a benefactor. As the Sandwich Islander\nbelieves that the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into\nhimself, so we gain the strength of the temptation we resist.\nThe same guards which protect us from disaster, defect, and enmity,\ndefend us, if we will, from selfishness and fraud. Bolts and bars are\nnot the best of our institutions, nor is shrewdness in trade a mark of\nwisdom. Men suffer all their life long under the foolish superstition\nthat they can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man to be\ncheated by any one but himself, as for a thing to be and not to be at\nthe same time. There is a third silent party to all our bargains. The\nnature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the\nfulfilment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to\nloss. If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in\nyour debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer The payment is\nwithholden, the better for you; for compound interest on compound\ninterest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.\nThe history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature,\nto make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand. It makes no\ndifference whether the actors be many or one, a tyrant or a mob. A mob\nis a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and\ntraversing its work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the\nnature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are\ninsane like its whole constitution. It persecutes a principle; it would\nwhip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and\noutrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these. It\nresembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to put out the\nruddy aurora streaming to the stars. The inviolate spirit turns their\nspite against the wrongdoers. The martyr cannot be dishonored. Every\nlash inflicted is a tongue of fame; every prison, a more illustrious\nabode; every burned book or house enlightens the world; every\nsuppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth from side to\nside. Hours of sanity and consideration are always arriving to\ncommunities, as to individuals, when the truth is seen and the martyrs\nare justified.\nThus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances. The man is\nall. Every thing has two sides, a good and an evil. Every advantage has\nits tax. I learn to be content. But the doctrine of compensation is not\nthe doctrine of indifferency. The thoughtless say, on hearing these\nrepresentations,\u2014What boots it to do well? there is one event to good\nand evil; if I gain any good I must pay for it; if I lose any good I\ngain some other; all actions are indifferent.\nThere is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to wit, its own\nnature. The soul is not a compensation, but a life. The soul _is_.\nUnder all this running sea of circumstance, whose waters ebb and flow\nwith perfect balance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being. Essence,\nor God, is not a relation or a part, but the whole. Being is the vast\naffirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced, and swallowing up all\nrelations, parts and times within itself. Nature, truth, virtue, are\nthe influx from thence. Vice is the absence or departure of the same.\nNothing, Falsehood, may indeed stand as the great Night or shade on\nwhich as a background the living universe paints itself forth, but no\nfact is begotten by it; it cannot work, for it is not. It cannot work\nany good; it cannot work any harm. It is harm inasmuch as it is worse\nnot to be than to be.\nWe feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts, because the\ncriminal adheres to his vice and contumacy and does not come to a\ncrisis or judgment anywhere in visible nature. There is no stunning\nconfutation of his nonsense before men and angels. Has he therefore\noutwitted the law? Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie\nwith him he so far deceases from nature. In some manner there will be a\ndemonstration of the wrong to the understanding also; but, should we\nnot see it, this deadly deduction makes square the eternal account.\nNeither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain of rectitude\nmust be bought by any loss. There is no penalty to virtue; no penalty\nto wisdom; they are proper additions of being. In a virtuous action I\nproperly _am;_ in a virtuous act I add to the world; I plant into\ndeserts conquered from Chaos and Nothing and see the darkness receding\non the limits of the horizon. There can be no excess to love, none to\nknowledge, none to beauty, when these attributes are considered in the\npurest sense. The soul refuses limits, and always affirms an Optimism,\nnever a Pessimism.\nHis life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is trust. Our\ninstinct uses \u201cmore\u201d and \u201cless\u201d in application to man, of the _presence\nof the soul_, and not of its absence, the brave man is greater than the\ncoward; the true, the benevolent, the wise, is more a man and not less,\nthan the fool and knave. There is no tax on the good of virtue, for\nthat is the incoming of God himself, or absolute existence, without any\ncomparative. Material good has its tax, and if it came without desert\nor sweat, has no root in me, and the next wind will blow it away. But\nall the good of nature is the soul\u2019s, and may be had if paid for in\nnature\u2019s lawful coin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head\nallow. I no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example to\nfind a pot of buried gold, knowing that it brings with it new burdens.\nI do not wish more external goods,\u2014neither possessions, nor honors, nor\npowers, nor persons. The gain is apparent; the tax is certain. But\nthere is no tax on the knowledge that the compensation exists and that\nit is not desirable to dig up treasure. Herein I rejoice with a serene\neternal peace. I contract the boundaries of possible mischief. I learn\nthe wisdom of St. Bernard,\u2014\u201cNothing can work me damage except myself;\nthe harm that I sustain I carry about with me, and never am a real\nsufferer but by my own fault.\u201d\nIn the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequalities of\ncondition. The radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction of\nMore and Less. How can Less not feel the pain; how not feel indignation\nor malevolence towards More? Look at those who have less faculty, and\none feels sad and knows not well what to make of it. He almost shuns\ntheir eye; he fears they will upbraid God. What should they do? It\nseems a great injustice. But see the facts nearly and these mountainous\ninequalities vanish. Love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in\nthe sea. The heart and soul of all men being one, this bitterness of\n_His_ and _Mine_ ceases. His is mine. I am my brother and my brother is\nme. If I feel overshadowed and outdone by great neighbors, I can yet\nlove; I can still receive; and he that loveth maketh his own the\ngrandeur he loves. Thereby I make the discovery that my brother is my\nguardian, acting for me with the friendliest designs, and the estate I\nso admired and envied is my own. It is the nature of the soul to\nappropriate all things. Jesus and Shakspeare are fragments of the soul,\nand by love I conquer and incorporate them in my own conscious domain.\nHis virtue,\u2014is not that mine? His wit,\u2014if it cannot be made mine, it is\nnot wit.\nSuch also is the natural history of calamity. The changes which break\nup at short intervals the prosperity of men are advertisements of a\nnature whose law is growth. Every soul is by this intrinsic necessity\nquitting its whole system of things, its friends and home and laws and\nfaith, as the shell-fish crawls out of its beautiful but stony case,\nbecause it no longer admits of its growth, and slowly forms a new\nhouse. In proportion to the vigor of the individual these revolutions\nare frequent, until in some happier mind they are incessant and all\nworldly relations hang very loosely about him, becoming as it were a\ntransparent fluid membrane through which the living form is seen, and\nnot, as in most men, an indurated heterogeneous fabric of many dates\nand of no settled character, in which the man is imprisoned. Then there\ncan be enlargement, and the man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man\nof yesterday. And such should be the outward biography of man in time,\na putting off of dead circumstances day by day, as he renews his\nraiment day by day. But to us, in our lapsed estate, resting, not\nadvancing, resisting, not cooperating with the divine expansion, this\ngrowth comes by shocks.\nWe cannot part with our friends. We cannot let our angels go. We do not\nsee that they only go out that archangels may come in. We are idolaters\nof the old. We do not believe in the riches of the soul, in its proper\neternity and omnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in\nto-day to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday. We linger in the\nruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs,\nnor believe that the spirit can feed, cover, and nerve us again. We\ncannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit and\nweep in vain. The voice of the Almighty saith, \u2018Up and onward for\nevermore!\u2019 We cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will we rely on the\nnew; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those monsters who\nlook backwards.\nAnd yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the\nunderstanding also, after long intervals of time. A fever, a\nmutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of\nfriends, seems at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure\nyears reveal the deep remedial force that underlies all facts. The\ndeath of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but\nprivation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for\nit commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an\nepoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up\na wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the\nformation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character. It\npermits or constrains the formation of new acquaintances and the\nreception of new influences that prove of the first importance to the\nnext years; and the man or woman who would have remained a sunny\ngarden-flower, with no room for its roots and too much sunshine for its\nhead, by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener is\nmade the banian of the forest, yielding shade and fruit to wide\nneighborhoods of men.\nIV.\nSPIRITUAL LAWS\nThe living Heaven thy prayers respect,\nHouse at once and architect,\nQuarrying man\u2019s rejected hours,\nBuilds therewith eternal towers;\nSole and self-commanded works,\nFears not undermining days,\nGrows by decays,\nAnd, by the famous might that lurks\nIn reaction and recoil,\nMakes flame to freeze, and ice to boil;\nForging, through swart arms of Offence,\nThe silver seat of Innocence.\nSPIRITUAL LAWS\nWhen the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look at\nourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is\nembosomed in beauty. Behind us, as we go, all things assume pleasing\nforms, as clouds do far off. Not only things familiar and stale, but\neven the tragic and terrible are comely as they take their place in the\npictures of memory. The river-bank, the weed at the water-side, the old\nhouse, the foolish person, however neglected in the passing, have a\ngrace in the past. Even the corpse that has lain in the chambers has\nadded a solemn ornament to the house. The soul will not know either\ndeformity or pain. If in the hours of clear reason we should speak the\nseverest truth, we should say that we had never made a sacrifice. In\nthese hours the mind seems so great that nothing can be taken from us\nthat seems much. All loss, all pain, is particular; the universe\nremains to the heart unhurt. Neither vexations nor calamities abate our\ntrust. No man ever stated his griefs as lightly as he might. Allow for\nexaggeration in the most patient and sorely ridden hack that ever was\ndriven. For it is only the finite that has wrought and suffered; the\ninfinite lies stretched in smiling repose.\nThe intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful if man will live\nthe life of nature and not import into his mind difficulties which are\nnone of his. No man need be perplexed in his speculations. Let him do\nand say what strictly belongs to him, and though very ignorant of\nbooks, his nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and\ndoubts. Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of\noriginal sin, origin of evil, predestination and the like. These never\npresented a practical difficulty to any man,\u2014never darkened across any\nman\u2019s road who did not go out of his way to seek them. These are the\nsoul\u2019s mumps and measles and whooping-coughs, and those who have not\ncaught them cannot describe their health or prescribe the cure. A\nsimple mind will not know these enemies. It is quite another thing that\nhe should be able to give account of his faith and expound to another\nthe theory of his self-union and freedom. This requires rare gifts. Yet\nwithout this self-knowledge there may be a sylvan strength and\nintegrity in that which he is. \u201cA few strong instincts and a few plain\nrules\u201d suffice us.\nMy will never gave the images in my mind the rank they now take. The\nregular course of studies, the years of academical and professional\neducation have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under\nthe bench at the Latin School. What we do not call education is more\nprecious than that which we call so. We form no guess, at the time of\nreceiving a thought, of its comparative value. And education often\nwastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural\nmagnetism, which is sure to select what belongs to it.\nIn like manner our moral nature is vitiated by any interference of our\nwill. People represent virtue as a struggle, and take to themselves\ngreat airs upon their attainments, and the question is everywhere vexed\nwhen a noble nature is commended, whether the man is not better who\nstrives with temptation. But there is no merit in the matter. Either\nGod is there or he is not there. We love characters in proportion as\nthey are impulsive and spontaneous. The less a man thinks or knows\nabout his virtues the better we like him. Timoleon\u2019s victories are the\nbest victories, which ran and flowed like Homer\u2019s verses, Plutarch\nsaid. When we see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful and\npleasant as roses, we must thank God that such things can be and are,\nand not turn sourly on the angel and say \u2018Crump is a better man with\nhis grunting resistance to all his native devils.\u2019\nNot less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over will in all\npractical life. There is less intention in history than we ascribe to\nit. We impute deep-laid far-sighted plans to C\u00e6sar and Napoleon; but\nthe best of their power was in nature, not in them. Men of an\nextraordinary success, in their honest moments, have always sung, \u2018Not\nunto us, not unto us.\u2019 According to the faith of their times they have\nbuilt altars to Fortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian. Their success\nlay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which found in them\nan unobstructed channel; and the wonders of which they were the visible\nconductors seemed to the eye their deed. Did the wires generate the\ngalvanism? It is even true that there was less in them on which they\ncould reflect than in another; as the virtue of a pipe is to be smooth\nand hollow. That which externally seemed will and immovableness was\nwillingness and self-annihilation. Could Shakspeare give a theory of\nShakspeare? Could ever a man of prodigious mathematical genius convey\nto others any insight into his methods? If he could communicate that\nsecret it would instantly lose its exaggerated value, blending with the\ndaylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go.\nThe lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might\nbe much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a\nhappier place than it is; that there is no need of struggles,\nconvulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the\ngnashing of the teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere\nwith the optimism of nature; for whenever we get this vantage-ground of\nthe past, or of a wiser mind in the present, we are able to discern\nthat we are begirt with laws which execute themselves.\nThe face of external nature teaches the same lesson. Nature will not\nhave us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our\nlearning much better than she likes our frauds and wars. When we come\nout of the caucus, or the bank, or the Abolition-convention, or the\nTemperance-meeting, or the Transcendental club into the fields and\nwoods, she says to us, \u2018So hot? my little Sir.\u2019\nWe are full of mechanical actions. We must needs intermeddle and have\nthings in our own way, until the sacrifices and virtues of society are\nodious. Love should make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our\nSunday-schools and churches and pauper-societies are yokes to the neck.\nWe pain ourselves to please nobody. There are natural ways of arriving\nat the same ends at which these aim, but do not arrive. Why should all\nvirtue work in one and the same way? Why should all give dollars? It is\nvery inconvenient to us country folk, and we do not think any good will\ncome of it. We have not dollars; merchants have; let them give them.\nFarmers will give corn; poets will sing; women will sew; laborers will\nlend a hand; the children will bring flowers. And why drag this dead\nweight of a Sunday-school over the whole Christendom? It is natural and\nbeautiful that childhood should inquire and maturity should teach; but\nit is time enough to answer questions when they are asked. Do not shut\nup the young people against their will in a pew and force the children\nto ask them questions for an hour against their will.\nIf we look wider, things are all alike; laws and letters and creeds and\nmodes of living seem a travesty of truth. Our society is encumbered by\nponderous machinery, which resembles the endless aqueducts which the\nRomans built over hill and dale and which are superseded by the\ndiscovery of the law that water rises to the level of its source. It is\na Chinese wall which any nimble Tartar can leap over. It is a standing\narmy, not so good as a peace. It is a graduated, titled, richly\nappointed empire, quite superfluous when town-meetings are found to\nanswer just as well.\nLet us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways.\nWhen the fruit is ripe, it falls. When the fruit is despatched, the\nleaf falls. The circuit of the waters is mere falling. The walking of\nman and all animals is a falling forward. All our manual labor and\nworks of strength, as prying, splitting, digging, rowing and so forth,\nare done by dint of continual falling, and the globe, earth, moon,\ncomet, sun, star, fall for ever and ever.\nThe simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of\na machine. He who sees moral nature out and out and thoroughly knows\nhow knowledge is acquired and character formed, is a pedant. The\nsimplicity of nature is not that which may easily be read, but is\ninexhaustible. The last analysis can no wise be made. We judge of a\nman\u2019s wisdom by his hope, knowing that the perception of the\ninexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth. The wild fertility of\nnature is felt in comparing our rigid names and reputations with our\nfluid consciousness. We pass in the world for sects and schools, for\nerudition and piety, and we are all the time jejune babes. One sees\nvery well how Pyrrhonism grew up. Every man sees that he is that middle\npoint whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied with equal reason.\nHe is old, he is young, he is very wise, he is altogether ignorant. He\nhears and feels what you say of the seraphim, and of the tin-peddler.\nThere is no permanent wise man except in the figment of the Stoics. We\nside with the hero, as we read or paint, against the coward and the\nrobber; but we have been ourselves that coward and robber, and shall be\nagain,\u2014not in the low circumstance, but in comparison with the\ngrandeurs possible to the soul.\nA little consideration of what takes place around us every day would\nshow us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that\nour painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our\neasy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting\nourselves with obedience we become divine. Belief and love,\u2014a believing\nlove will relieve us of a vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists.\nThere is a soul at the centre of nature and over the will of every man,\nso that none of us can wrong the universe. It has so infused its strong\nenchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice, and\nwhen we struggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to our\nsides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of things goes to\nteach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us,\nand by lowly listening we shall hear the right word. Why need you\nchoose so painfully your place and occupation and associates and modes\nof action and of entertainment? Certainly there is a possible right for\nyou that precludes the need of balance and wilful election. For you\nthere is a reality, a fit place and congenial duties. Place yourself in\nthe middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it\nfloats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right and a\nperfect contentment. Then you put all gainsayers in the wrong. Then you\nare the world, the measure of right, of truth, of beauty. If we will\nnot be mar-plots with our miserable interferences, the work, the\nsociety, letters, arts, science, religion of men would go on far better\nthan now, and the heaven predicted from the beginning of the world, and\nstill predicted from the bottom of the heart, would organize itself, as\ndo now the rose and the air and the sun.\nI say, _do not choose;_ but that is a figure of speech by which I would\ndistinguish what is commonly called _choice_ among men, and which is a\npartial act, the choice of the hands, of the eyes, of the appetites,\nand not a whole act of the man. But that which I call right or\ngoodness, is the choice of my constitution; and that which I call\nheaven, and inwardly aspire after, is the state or circumstance\ndesirable to my constitution; and the action which I in all my years\ntend to do, is the work for my faculties. We must hold a man amenable\nto reason for the choice of his daily craft or profession. It is not an\nexcuse any longer for his deeds that they are the custom of his trade.\nWhat business has he with an evil trade? Has he not a _calling_ in his\ncharacter?\nEach man has his own vocation. The talent is the call. There is one\ndirection in which all space is open to him. He has faculties silently\ninviting him thither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river;\nhe runs against obstructions on every side but one, on that side all\nobstruction is taken away and he sweeps serenely over a deepening\nchannel into an infinite sea. This talent and this call depend on his\norganization, or the mode in which the general soul incarnates itself\nin him. He inclines to do something which is easy to him and good when\nit is done, but which no other man can do. He has no rival. For the\nmore truly he consults his own powers, the more difference will his\nwork exhibit from the work of any other. His ambition is exactly\nproportioned to his powers. The height of the pinnacle is determined by\nthe breadth of the base. Every man has this call of the power to do\nsomewhat unique, and no man has any other call. The pretence that he\nhas another call, a summons by name and personal election and outward\n\u201csigns that mark him extraordinary, and not in the roll of common men,\u201d\nis fanaticism, and betrays obtuseness to perceive that there is one\nmind in all the individuals, and no respect of persons therein.\nBy doing his work he makes the need felt which he can supply, and\ncreates the taste by which he is enjoyed. By doing his own work he\nunfolds himself. It is the vice of our public speaking that it has not\nabandonment. Somewhere, not only every orator but every man should let\nout all the length of all the reins; should find or make a frank and\nhearty expression of what force and meaning is in him. The common\nexperience is that the man fits himself as well as he can to the\ncustomary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as\na dog turns a spit. Then is he a part of the machine he moves; the man\nis lost. Until he can manage to communicate himself to others in his\nfull stature and proportion, he does not yet find his vocation. He must\nfind in that an outlet for his character, so that he may justify his\nwork to their eyes. If the labor is mean, let him by his thinking and\ncharacter make it liberal. Whatever he knows and thinks, whatever in\nhis apprehension is worth doing, that let him communicate, or men will\nnever know and honor him aright. Foolish, whenever you take the\nmeanness and formality of that thing you do, instead of converting it\ninto the obedient spiracle of your character and aims.\nWe like only such actions as have already long had the praise of men,\nand do not perceive that any thing man can do may be divinely done. We\nthink greatness entailed or organized in some places or duties, in\ncertain offices or occasions, and do not see that Paganini can extract\nrapture from a catgut, and Eulenstein from a jews-harp, and a\nnimble-fingered lad out of shreds of paper with his scissors, and\nLandseer out of swine, and the hero out of the pitiful habitation and\ncompany in which he was hidden. What we call obscure condition or\nvulgar society is that condition and society whose poetry is not yet\nwritten, but which you shall presently make as enviable and renowned as\nany. In our estimates let us take a lesson from kings. The parts of\nhospitality, the connection of families, the impressiveness of death,\nand a thousand other things, royalty makes its own estimate of, and a\nroyal mind will. To make habitually a new estimate,\u2014that is elevation.\nWhat a man does, that he has. What has he to do with hope or fear? In\nhimself is his might. Let him regard no good as solid but that which is\nin his nature and which must grow out of him as long as he exists. The\ngoods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves; let him scatter\nthem on every wind as the momentary signs of his infinite\nproductiveness.\nHe may have his own. A man\u2019s genius, the quality that differences him\nfrom every other, the susceptibility to one class of influences, the\nselection of what is fit for him, the rejection of what is unfit,\ndetermines for him the character of the universe. A man is a method, a\nprogressive arrangement; a selecting principle, gathering his like to\nhim wherever he goes. He takes only his own out of the multiplicity\nthat sweeps and circles round him. He is like one of those booms which\nare set out from the shore on rivers to catch drift-wood, or like the\nloadstone amongst splinters of steel. Those facts, words, persons,\nwhich dwell in his memory without his being able to say why, remain\nbecause they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet\nunapprehended. They are symbols of value to him as they can interpret\nparts of his consciousness which he would vainly seek words for in the\nconventional images of books and other minds. What attracts my\nattention shall have it, as I will go to the man who knocks at my door,\nwhilst a thousand persons as worthy go by it, to whom I give no regard.\nIt is enough that these particulars speak to me. A few anecdotes, a few\ntraits of character, manners, face, a few incidents, have an emphasis\nin your memory out of all proportion to their apparent significance if\nyou measure them by the ordinary standards. They relate to your gift.\nLet them have their weight, and do not reject them and cast about for\nillustration and facts more usual in literature. What your heart thinks\ngreat is great. The soul\u2019s emphasis is always right.\nOver all things that are agreeable to his nature and genius the man has\nthe highest right. Everywhere he may take what belongs to his spiritual\nestate, nor can he take any thing else though all doors were open, nor\ncan all the force of men hinder him from taking so much. It is vain to\nattempt to keep a secret from one who has a right to know it. It will\ntell itself. That mood into which a friend can bring us is his dominion\nover us. To the thoughts of that state of mind he has a right. All the\nsecrets of that state of mind he can compel. This is a law which\nstatesmen use in practice. All the terrors of the French Republic,\nwhich held Austria in awe, were unable to command her diplomacy. But\nNapoleon sent to Vienna M. de Narbonne, one of the old noblesse, with\nthe morals, manners and name of that interest, saying that it was\nindispensable to send to the old aristocracy of Europe men of the same\nconnection, which, in fact, constitutes a sort of free-masonry. M. de\nNarbonne in less than a fortnight penetrated all the secrets of the\nimperial cabinet.\nNothing seems so easy as to speak and to be understood. Yet a man may\ncome to find _that_ the strongest of defences and of ties,\u2014that he has\nbeen understood; and he who has received an opinion may come to find it\nthe most inconvenient of bonds.\nIf a teacher have any opinion which he wishes to conceal, his pupils\nwill become as fully indoctrinated into that as into any which he\npublishes. If you pour water into a vessel twisted into coils and\nangles, it is vain to say, I will pour it only into this or that;\u2014it\nwill find its level in all. Men feel and act the consequences of your\ndoctrine without being able to show how they follow. Show us an arc of\nthe curve, and a good mathematician will find out the whole figure. We\nare always reasoning from the seen to the unseen. Hence the perfect\nintelligence that subsists between wise men of remote ages. A man\ncannot bury his meanings so deep in his book but time and like-minded\nmen will find them. Plato had a secret doctrine, had he? What secret\ncan he conceal from the eyes of Bacon? of Montaigne? of Kant?\nTherefore, Aristotle said of his works, \u201cThey are published and not\npublished.\u201d\nNo man can learn what he has not preparation for learning, however near\nto his eyes is the object. A chemist may tell his most precious secrets\nto a carpenter, and he shall be never the wiser,\u2014the secrets he would\nnot utter to a chemist for an estate. God screens us evermore from\npremature ideas. Our eyes are holden that we cannot see things that\nstare us in the face, until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened;\nthen we behold them, and the time when we saw them not is like a dream.\nNot in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees. The world\nis very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all\nits pride. \u201cEarth fills her lap with splendors\u201d _not_ her own. The vale\nof Tempe, Tivoli and Rome are earth and water, rocks and sky. There are\nas good earth and water in a thousand places, yet how unaffecting!\nPeople are not the better for the sun and moon, the horizon and the\ntrees; as it is not observed that the keepers of Roman galleries or the\nvalets of painters have any elevation of thought, or that librarians\nare wiser men than others. There are graces in the demeanor of a\npolished and noble person which are lost upon the eye of a churl. These\nare like the stars whose light has not yet reached us.\nHe may see what he maketh. Our dreams are the sequel of our waking\nknowledge. The visions of the night bear some proportion to the visions\nof the day. Hideous dreams are exaggerations of the sins of the day. We\nsee our evil affections embodied in bad physiognomies. On the Alps the\ntraveller sometimes beholds his own shadow magnified to a giant, so\nthat every gesture of his hand is terrific. \u201cMy children,\u201d said an old\nman to his boys scared by a figure in the dark entry, \u201cmy children, you\nwill never see any thing worse than yourselves.\u201d As in dreams, so in\nthe scarcely less fluid events of the world every man sees himself in\ncolossal, without knowing that it is himself. The good, compared to the\nevil which he sees, is as his own good to his own evil. Every quality\nof his mind is magnified in some one acquaintance, and every emotion of\nhis heart in some one. He is like a quincunx of trees, which counts\nfive,\u2014east, west, north, or south; or an initial, medial, and terminal\nacrostic. And why not? He cleaves to one person and avoids another,\naccording to their likeness or unlikeness to himself, truly seeking\nhimself in his associates and moreover in his trade and habits and\ngestures and meats and drinks, and comes at last to be faithfully\nrepresented by every view you take of his circumstances.\nHe may read what he writes. What can we see or acquire but what we are?\nYou have observed a skilful man reading Virgil. Well, that author is a\nthousand books to a thousand persons. Take the book into your two hands\nand read your eyes out, you will never find what I find. If any\ningenious reader would have a monopoly of the wisdom or delight he\ngets, he is as secure now the book is Englished, as if it were\nimprisoned in the Pelews\u2019 tongue. It is with a good book as it is with\ngood company. Introduce a base person among gentlemen, it is all to no\npurpose; he is not their fellow. Every society protects itself. The\ncompany is perfectly safe, and he is not one of them, though his body\nis in the room.\nWhat avails it to fight with the eternal laws of mind, which adjust the\nrelation of all persons to each other by the mathematical measure of\ntheir havings and beings? Gertrude is enamored of Guy; how high, how\naristocratic, how Roman his mien and manners! to live with him were\nlife indeed, and no purchase is too great; and heaven and earth are\nmoved to that end. Well, Gertrude has Guy; but what now avails how\nhigh, how aristocratic, how Roman his mien and manners, if his heart\nand aims are in the senate, in the theatre and in the billiard-room,\nand she has no aims, no conversation that can enchant her graceful\nlord?\nHe shall have his own society. We can love nothing but nature. The most\nwonderful talents, the most meritorious exertions really avail very\nlittle with us; but nearness or likeness of nature,\u2014how beautiful is\nthe ease of its victory! Persons approach us, famous for their beauty,\nfor their accomplishments, worthy of all wonder for their charms and\ngifts; they dedicate their whole skill to the hour and the\ncompany,\u2014with very imperfect result. To be sure it would be ungrateful\nin us not to praise them loudly. Then, when all is done, a person of\nrelated mind, a brother or sister by nature, comes to us so softly and\neasily, so nearly and intimately, as if it were the blood in our proper\nveins, that we feel as if some one was gone, instead of another having\ncome; we are utterly relieved and refreshed; it is a sort of joyful\nsolitude. We foolishly think in our days of sin that we must court\nfriends by compliance to the customs of society, to its dress, its\nbreeding, and its estimates. But only that soul can be my friend which\nI encounter on the line of my own march, that soul to which I do not\ndecline and which does not decline to me, but, native of the same\ncelestial latitude, repeats in its own all my experience. The scholar\nforgets himself and apes the customs and costumes of the man of the\nworld to deserve the smile of beauty, and follows some giddy girl, not\nyet taught by religious passion to know the noble woman with all that\nis serene, oracular and beautiful in her soul. Let him be great, and\nlove shall follow him. Nothing is more deeply punished than the neglect\nof the affinities by which alone society should be formed, and the\ninsane levity of choosing associates by others\u2019 eyes.\nHe may set his own rate. It is a maxim worthy of all acceptation that a\nman may have that allowance he takes. Take the place and attitude which\nbelong to you, and all men acquiesce. The world must be just. It leaves\nevery man, with profound unconcern, to set his own rate. Hero or\ndriveller, it meddles not in the matter. It will certainly accept your\nown measure of your doing and being, whether you sneak about and deny\nyour own name, or whether you see your work produced to the concave\nsphere of the heavens, one with the revolution of the stars.\nThe same reality pervades all teaching. The man may teach by doing, and\nnot otherwise. If he can communicate himself he can teach, but not by\nwords. He teaches who gives, and he learns who receives. There is no\nteaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in\nwhich you are; a transfusion takes place; he is you and you are he;\nthen is a teaching, and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he\never quite lose the benefit. But your propositions run out of one ear\nas they ran in at the other. We see it advertised that Mr. Grand will\ndeliver an oration on the Fourth of July, and Mr. Hand before the\nMechanics\u2019 Association, and we do not go thither, because we know that\nthese gentlemen will not communicate their own character and experience\nto the company. If we had reason to expect such a confidence we should\ngo through all inconvenience and opposition. The sick would be carried\nin litters. But a public oration is an escapade, a non-committal, an\napology, a gag, and not a communication, not a speech, not a man.\nA like Nemesis presides over all intellectual works. We have yet to\nlearn that the thing uttered in words is not therefore affirmed. It\nmust affirm itself, or no forms of logic or of oath can give it\nevidence. The sentence must also contain its own apology for being\nspoken.\nThe effect of any writing on the public mind is mathematically\nmeasurable by its depth of thought. How much water does it draw? If it\nawaken you to think, if it lift you from your feet with the great voice\nof eloquence, then the effect is to be wide, slow, permanent, over the\nminds of men; if the pages instruct you not, they will die like flies\nin the hour. The way to speak and write what shall not go out of\nfashion is to speak and write sincerely. The argument which has not\npower to reach my own practice, I may well doubt will fail to reach\nyours. But take Sidney\u2019s maxim:\u2014\u201cLook in thy heart, and write.\u201d He that\nwrites to himself writes to an eternal public. That statement only is\nfit to be made public which you have come at in attempting to satisfy\nyour own curiosity. The writer who takes his subject from his ear and\nnot from his heart, should know that he has lost as much as he seems to\nhave gained, and when the empty book has gathered all its praise, and\nhalf the people say, \u2018What poetry! what genius!\u2019 it still needs fuel to\nmake fire. That only profits which is profitable. Life alone can impart\nlife; and though we should burst we can only be valued as we make\nourselves valuable. There is no luck in literary reputation. They who\nmake up the final verdict upon every book are not the partial and noisy\nreaders of the hour when it appears, but a court as of angels, a public\nnot to be bribed, not to be entreated and not to be overawed, decides\nupon every man\u2019s title to fame. Only those books come down which\ndeserve to last. Gilt edges, vellum and morocco, and\npresentation-copies to all the libraries will not preserve a book in\ncirculation beyond its intrinsic date. It must go with all Walpole\u2019s\nNoble and Royal Authors to its fate. Blackmore, Kotzebue, or Pollok may\nendure for a night, but Moses and Homer stand for ever. There are not\nin the world at any one time more than a dozen persons who read and\nunderstand Plato,\u2014never enough to pay for an edition of his works; yet\nto every generation these come duly down, for the sake of those few\npersons, as if God brought them in his hand. \u201cNo book,\u201d said Bentley,\n\u201cwas ever written down by any but itself.\u201d The permanence of all books\nis fixed by no effort, friendly or hostile, but by their own specific\ngravity, or the intrinsic importance of their contents to the constant\nmind of man. \u201cDo not trouble yourself too much about the light on your\nstatue,\u201d said Michael Angelo to the young sculptor; \u201cthe light of the\npublic square will test its value.\u201d\nIn like manner the effect of every action is measured by the depth of\nthe sentiment from which it proceeds. The great man knew not that he\nwas great. It took a century or two for that fact to appear. What he\ndid, he did because he must; it was the most natural thing in the\nworld, and grew out of the circumstances of the moment. But now, every\nthing he did, even to the lifting of his finger or the eating of bread,\nlooks large, all-related, and is called an institution.\nThese are the demonstrations in a few particulars of the genius of\nnature; they show the direction of the stream. But the stream is blood;\nevery drop is alive. Truth has not single victories; all things are its\norgans,\u2014not only dust and stones, but errors and lies. The laws of\ndisease, physicians say, are as beautiful as the laws of health. Our\nphilosophy is affirmative and readily accepts the testimony of negative\nfacts, as every shadow points to the sun. By a divine necessity every\nfact in nature is constrained to offer its testimony.\nHuman character evermore publishes itself. The most fugitive deed and\nword, the mere air of doing a thing, the intimated purpose, expresses\ncharacter. If you act you show character; if you sit still, if you\nsleep, you show it. You think because you have spoken nothing when\nothers spoke, and have given no opinion on the times, on the church, on\nslavery, on marriage, on socialism, on secret societies, on the\ncollege, on parties and persons, that your verdict is still expected\nwith curiosity as a reserved wisdom. Far otherwise; your silence\nanswers very loud. You have no oracle to utter, and your fellow-men\nhave learned that you cannot help them; for oracles speak. Doth not\nWisdom cry and Understanding put forth her voice?\nDreadful limits are set in nature to the powers of dissimulation. Truth\ntyrannizes over the unwilling members of the body. Faces never lie, it\nis said. No man need be deceived who will study the changes of\nexpression. When a man speaks the truth in the spirit of truth, his eye\nis as clear as the heavens. When he has base ends and speaks falsely,\nthe eye is muddy and sometimes asquint.\nI have heard an experienced counsellor say that he never feared the\neffect upon a jury of a lawyer who does not believe in his heart that\nhis client ought to have a verdict. If he does not believe it his\nunbelief will appear to the jury, despite all his protestations, and\nwill become their unbelief. This is that law whereby a work of art, of\nwhatever kind, sets us in the same state of mind wherein the artist was\nwhen he made it. That which we do not believe we cannot adequately say,\nthough we may repeat the words never so often. It was this conviction\nwhich Swedenborg expressed when he described a group of persons in the\nspiritual world endeavoring in vain to articulate a proposition which\nthey did not believe; but they could not, though they twisted and\nfolded their lips even to indignation.\nA man passes for that he is worth. Very idle is all curiosity\nconcerning other people\u2019s estimate of us, and all fear of remaining\nunknown is not less so. If a man know that he can do any thing,\u2014that he\ncan do it better than any one else,\u2014he has a pledge of the\nacknowledgment of that fact by all persons. The world is full of\njudgment-days, and into every assembly that a man enters, in every\naction he attempts, he is gauged and stamped. In every troop of boys\nthat whoop and run in each yard and square, a new-comer is as well and\naccurately weighed in the course of a few days and stamped with his\nright number, as if he had undergone a formal trial of his strength,\nspeed and temper. A stranger comes from a distant school, with better\ndress, with trinkets in his pockets, with airs and pretensions; an\nolder boy says to himself, \u2018It\u2019s of no use; we shall find him out\nto-morrow.\u2019 \u2018What has he done?\u2019 is the divine question which searches\nmen and transpierces every false reputation. A fop may sit in any chair\nof the world nor be distinguished for his hour from Homer and\nWashington; but there need never be any doubt concerning the respective\nability of human beings. Pretension may sit still, but cannot act.\nPretension never feigned an act of real greatness. Pretension never\nwrote an Iliad, nor drove back Xerxes, nor christianized the world, nor\nabolished slavery.\nAs much virtue as there is, so much appears; as much goodness as there\nis, so much reverence it commands. All the devils respect virtue. The\nhigh, the generous, the self-devoted sect will always instruct and\ncommand mankind. Never was a sincere word utterly lost. Never a\nmagnanimity fell to the ground, but there is some heart to greet and\naccept it unexpectedly. A man passes for that he is worth. What he is\nengraves itself on his face, on his form, on his fortunes, in letters\nof light. Concealment avails him nothing, boasting nothing. There is\nconfession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations,\nand the grasp of hands. His sin bedaubs him, mars all his good\nimpression. Men know not why they do not trust him, but they do not\ntrust him. His vice glasses his eye, cuts lines of mean expression in\nhis cheek, pinches the nose, sets the mark of the beast on the back of\nthe head, and writes O fool! fool! on the forehead of a king.\nIf you would not be known to do any thing, never do it. A man may play\nthe fool in the drifts of a desert, but every grain of sand shall seem\nto see. He may be a solitary eater, but he cannot keep his foolish\ncounsel. A broken complexion, a swinish look, ungenerous acts and the\nwant of due knowledge,\u2014all blab. Can a cook, a Chiffinch, an Iachimo be\nmistaken for Zeno or Paul? Confucius exclaimed,\u2014\u201cHow can a man be\nconcealed? How can a man be concealed?\u201d\nOn the other hand, the hero fears not that if he withhold the avowal of\na just and brave act it will go unwitnessed and unloved. One knows\nit,\u2014himself,\u2014and is pledged by it to sweetness of peace and to\nnobleness of aim which will prove in the end a better proclamation of\nit than the relating of the incident. Virtue is the adherence in action\nto the nature of things, and the nature of things makes it prevalent.\nIt consists in a perpetual substitution of being for seeming, and with\nsublime propriety God is described as saying, I AM.\nThe lesson which these observations convey is, Be, and not seem. Let us\nacquiesce. Let us take our bloated nothingness out of the path of the\ndivine circuits. Let us unlearn our wisdom of the world. Let us lie low\nin the Lord\u2019s power and learn that truth alone makes rich and great.\nIf you visit your friend, why need you apologize for not having visited\nhim, and waste his time and deface your own act? Visit him now. Let him\nfeel that the highest love has come to see him, in thee its lowest\norgan. Or why need you torment yourself and friend by secret\nself-reproaches that you have not assisted him or complimented him with\ngifts and salutations heretofore? Be a gift and a benediction. Shine\nwith real light and not with the borrowed reflection of gifts. Common\nmen are apologies for men; they bow the head, excuse themselves with\nprolix reasons, and accumulate appearances because the substance is\nnot.\nWe are full of these superstitions of sense, the worship of magnitude.\nWe call the poet inactive, because he is not a president, a merchant,\nor a porter. We adore an institution, and do not see that it is founded\non a thought which we have. But real action is in silent moments. The\nepochs of our life are not in the visible facts of our choice of a\ncalling, our marriage, our acquisition of an office, and the like, but\nin a silent thought by the way-side as we walk; in a thought which\nrevises our entire manner of life and says,\u2014\u2018Thus hast thou done, but\nit were better thus.\u2019 And all our after years, like menials, serve and\nwait on this, and according to their ability execute its will. This\nrevisal or correction is a constant force, which, as a tendency,\nreaches through our lifetime. The object of the man, the aim of these\nmoments, is to make daylight shine through him, to suffer the law to\ntraverse his whole being without obstruction, so that on what point\nsoever of his doing your eye falls it shall report truly of his\ncharacter, whether it be his diet, his house, his religious forms, his\nsociety, his mirth, his vote, his opposition. Now he is not\nhomogeneous, but heterogeneous, and the ray does not traverse; there\nare no thorough lights, but the eye of the beholder is puzzled,\ndetecting many unlike tendencies and a life not yet at one.\nWhy should we make it a point with our false modesty to disparage that\nman we are and that form of being assigned to us? A good man is\ncontented. I love and honor Epaminondas, but I do not wish to be\nEpaminondas. I hold it more just to love the world of this hour than\nthe world of his hour. Nor can you, if I am true, excite me to the\nleast uneasiness by saying, \u2018He acted and thou sittest still.\u2019 I see\naction to be good, when the need is, and sitting still to be also good.\nEpaminondas, if he was the man I take him for, would have sat still\nwith joy and peace, if his lot had been mine. Heaven is large, and\naffords space for all modes of love and fortitude. Why should we be\nbusybodies and superserviceable? Action and inaction are alike to the\ntrue. One piece of the tree is cut for a weathercock and one for the\nsleeper of a bridge; the virtue of the wood is apparent in both.\nI desire not to disgrace the soul. The fact that I am here certainly\nshows me that the soul had need of an organ here. Shall I not assume\nthe post? Shall I skulk and dodge and duck with my unseasonable\napologies and vain modesty and imagine my being here impertinent? less\npertinent than Epaminondas or Homer being there? and that the soul did\nnot know its own needs? Besides, without any reasoning on the matter, I\nhave no discontent. The good soul nourishes me and unlocks new\nmagazines of power and enjoyment to me every day. I will not meanly\ndecline the immensity of good, because I have heard that it has come to\nothers in another shape.\nBesides, why should we be cowed by the name of Action? \u2019Tis a trick of\nthe senses,\u2014no more. We know that the ancestor of every action is a\nthought. The poor mind does not seem to itself to be any thing unless\nit have an outside badge,\u2014some Gentoo diet, or Quaker coat, or\nCalvinistic prayer-meeting, or philanthropic society, or a great\ndonation, or a high office, or, any how, some wild contrasting action\nto testify that it is somewhat. The rich mind lies in the sun and\nsleeps, and is Nature. To think is to act.\nLet us, if we must have great actions, make our own so. All action is\nof an infinite elasticity, and the least admits of being inflated with\nthe celestial air until it eclipses the sun and moon. Let us seek one\npeace by fidelity. Let me heed my duties. Why need I go gadding into\nthe scenes and philosophy of Greek and Italian history before I have\njustified myself to my benefactors? How dare I read Washington\u2019s\ncampaigns when I have not answered the letters of my own\ncorrespondents? Is not that a just objection to much of our reading? It\nis a pusillanimous desertion of our work to gaze after our neighbors.\nIt is peeping. Byron says of Jack Bunting,\u2014\n\u201cHe knew not what to say, and so he swore.\u201d\nI may say it of our preposterous use of books,\u2014He knew not what to do,\nand so _he read_. I can think of nothing to fill my time with, and I\nfind the Life of Brant. It is a very extravagant compliment to pay to\nBrant, or to General Schuyler, or to General Washington. My time should\nbe as good as their time,\u2014my facts, my net of relations, as good as\ntheirs, or either of theirs. Rather let me do my work so well that\nother idlers if they choose may compare my texture with the texture of\nthese and find it identical with the best.\nThis over-estimate of the possibilities of Paul and Pericles, this\nunder-estimate of our own, comes from a neglect of the fact of an\nidentical nature. Bonaparte knew but one merit, and rewarded in one and\nthe same way the good soldier, the good astronomer, the good poet, the\ngood player. The poet uses the names of C\u00e6sar, of Tamerlane, of\nBonduca, of Belisarius; the painter uses the conventional story of the\nVirgin Mary, of Paul, of Peter. He does not therefore defer to the\nnature of these accidental men, of these stock heroes. If the poet\nwrite a true drama, then he is C\u00e6sar, and not the player of C\u00e6sar; then\nthe selfsame strain of thought, emotion as pure, wit as subtle, motions\nas swift, mounting, extravagant, and a heart as great, self-sufficing,\ndauntless, which on the waves of its love and hope can uplift all that\nis reckoned solid and precious in the world,\u2014palaces, gardens, money,\nnavies, kingdoms,\u2014marking its own incomparable worth by the slight it\ncasts on these gauds of men;\u2014these all are his, and by the power of\nthese he rouses the nations. Let a man believe in God, and not in names\nand places and persons. Let the great soul incarnated in some woman\u2019s\nform, poor and sad and single, in some Dolly or Joan, go out to\nservice, and sweep chambers and scour floors, and its effulgent\ndaybeams cannot be muffled or hid, but to sweep and scour will\ninstantly appear supreme and beautiful actions, the top and radiance of\nhuman life, and all people will get mops and brooms; until, lo!\nsuddenly the great soul has enshrined itself in some other form and\ndone some other deed, and that is now the flower and head of all living\nnature.\nWe are the photometers, we the irritable goldleaf and tinfoil that\nmeasure the accumulations of the subtle element. We know the authentic\neffects of the true fire through every one of its million disguises.\nV.\nLOVE\n\u201cI was as a gem concealed;\nMe my burning ray revealed.\u201d\n_Koran_.\nLOVE\nEvery promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments; each of its joys\nripens into a new want. Nature, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking, in\nthe first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which\nshall lose all particular regards in its general light. The\nintroduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of\none to one, which is the enchantment of human life; which, like a\ncertain divine rage and enthusiasm, seizes on man at one period and\nworks a revolution in his mind and body; unites him to his race,\npledges him to the domestic and civic relations, carries him with new\nsympathy into nature, enhances the power of the senses, opens the\nimagination, adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes,\nestablishes marriage, and gives permanence to human society.\nThe natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the\nblood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints,\nwhich every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing\nexperience, one must not be too old. The delicious fancies of youth\nreject the least savor of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and\npedantry their purple bloom. And therefore I know I incur the\nimputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose\nthe Court and Parliament of Love. But from these formidable censors I\nshall appeal to my seniors. For it is to be considered that this\npassion of which we speak, though it begin with the young, yet forsakes\nnot the old, or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow\nold, but makes the aged participators of it not less than the tender\nmaiden, though in a different and nobler sort. For it is a fire that\nkindling its first embers in the narrow nook of a private bosom, caught\nfrom a wandering spark out of another private heart, glows and enlarges\nuntil it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the\nuniversal heart of all, and so lights up the whole world and all nature\nwith its generous flames. It matters not therefore whether we attempt\nto describe the passion at twenty, at thirty, or at eighty years. He\nwho paints it at the first period will lose some of its later, he who\npaints it at the last, some of its earlier traits. Only it is to be\nhoped that by patience and the Muses\u2019 aid we may attain to that inward\nview of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful,\nso central that it shall commend itself to the eye, at whatever angle\nbeholden.\nAnd the first condition is, that we must leave a too close and\nlingering adherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in\nhope and not in history. For each man sees his own life defaced and\ndisfigured, as the life of man is not, to his imagination. Each man\nsees over his own experience a certain stain of error, whilst that of\nother men looks fair and ideal. Let any man go back to those delicious\nrelations which make the beauty of his life, which have given him\nsincerest instruction and nourishment, he will shrink and moan. Alas! I\nknow not why, but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the\nremembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name. Every thing\nis beautiful seen from the point of the intellect, or as truth. But all\nis sour, if seen as experience. Details are melancholy; the plan is\nseemly and noble. In the actual world\u2014the painful kingdom of time and\nplace\u2014dwell care, and canker, and fear. With thought, with the ideal,\nis immortal hilarity, the rose of joy. Round it all the Muses sing. But\ngrief cleaves to names, and persons, and the partial interests of\nto-day and yesterday.\nThe strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of\npersonal relations usurps in the conversation of society. What do we\nwish to know of any worthy person so much, as how he has sped in the\nhistory of this sentiment? What books in the circulating libraries\ncirculate? How we glow over these novels of passion, when the story is\ntold with any spark of truth and nature! And what fastens attention, in\nthe intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between\ntwo parties? Perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet\nthem again. But we see them exchange a glance, or betray a deep\nemotion, and we are no longer strangers. We understand them, and take\nthe warmest interest in the development of the romance. All mankind\nlove a lover. The earliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness\nare nature\u2019s most winning pictures. It is the dawn of civility and\ngrace in the coarse and rustic. The rude village boy teases the girls\nabout the school-house door;\u2014but to-day he comes running into the\nentry, and meets one fair child disposing her satchel; he holds her\nbooks to help her, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed\nherself from him infinitely, and was a sacred precinct. Among the\nthrong of girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him; and\nthese two little neighbors, that were so close just now, have learned\nto respect each other\u2019s personality. Or who can avert his eyes from the\nengaging, half-artful, half-artless ways of school-girls who go into\nthe country shops to buy a skein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk\nhalf an hour about nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop-boy.\nIn the village they are on a perfect equality, which love delights in,\nand without any coquetry the happy, affectionate nature of woman flows\nout in this pretty gossip. The girls may have little beauty, yet\nplainly do they establish between them and the good boy the most\nagreeable, confiding relations, what with their fun and their earnest,\nabout Edgar and Jonas and Almira, and who was invited to the party, and\nwho danced at the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would\nbegin, and other nothings concerning which the parties cooed. By and by\nthat boy wants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he know where\nto find a sincere and sweet mate, without any risk such as Milton\ndeplores as incident to scholars and great men.\nI have been told that in some public discourses of mine my reverence\nfor the intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations.\nBut now I almost shrink at the remembrance of such disparaging words.\nFor persons are love\u2019s world, and the coldest philosopher cannot\nrecount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the\npower of love, without being tempted to unsay, as treasonable to\nnature, aught derogatory to the social instincts. For though the\ncelestial rapture falling out of heaven seizes only upon those of\ntender age, and although a beauty overpowering all analysis or\ncomparison and putting us quite beside ourselves we can seldom see\nafter thirty years, yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all\nother remembrances, and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows. But\nhere is a strange fact; it may seem to many men, in revising their\nexperience, that they have no fairer page in their life\u2019s book than the\ndelicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a\nwitchcraft, surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth, to a\nparcel of accidental and trivial circumstances. In looking backward\nthey may find that several things which were not the charm have more\nreality to this groping memory than the charm itself which embalmed\nthem. But be our experience in particulars what it may, no man ever\nforgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which\ncreated all things anew; which was the dawn in him of music, poetry,\nand art; which made the face of nature radiant with purple light, the\nmorning and the night varied enchantments; when a single tone of one\nvoice could make the heart bound, and the most trivial circumstance\nassociated with one form is put in the amber of memory; when he became\nall eye when one was present, and all memory when one was gone; when\nthe youth becomes a watcher of windows and studious of a glove, a veil,\na ribbon, or the wheels of a carriage; when no place is too solitary\nand none too silent, for him who has richer company and sweeter\nconversation in his new thoughts than any old friends, though best and\npurest, can give him; for the figures, the motions, the words of the\nbeloved object are not like other images written in water, but, as\nPlutarch said, \u201cenamelled in fire,\u201d and make the study of midnight:\u2014\n\u201cThou art not gone being gone, where\u2019er thou art,\nThou leav\u2019st in him thy watchful eyes, in him thy loving heart.\u201d\nIn the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the\nrecollection of days when happiness was not happy enough, but must be\ndrugged with the relish of pain and fear; for he touched the secret of\nthe matter who said of love,\u2014\n\u201cAll other pleasures are not worth its pains:\u201d\nand when the day was not long enough, but the night too must be\nconsumed in keen recollections; when the head boiled all night on the\npillow with the generous deed it resolved on; when the moonlight was a\npleasing fever and the stars were letters and the flowers ciphers and\nthe air was coined into song; when all business seemed an impertinence,\nand all the men and women running to and fro in the streets, mere\npictures.\nThe passion rebuilds the world for the youth. It makes all things alive\nand significant. Nature grows conscious. Every bird on the boughs of\nthe tree sings now to his heart and soul. The notes are almost\narticulate. The clouds have faces as he looks on them. The trees of the\nforest, the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown\nintelligent; and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which\nthey seem to invite. Yet nature soothes and sympathizes. In the green\nsolitude he finds a dearer home than with men:\u2014\n\u201cFountain-heads and pathless groves,\nPlaces which pale passion loves,\nMoonlight walks, when all the fowls\nAre safely housed, save bats and owls,\nA midnight bell, a passing groan,\u2014\nThese are the sounds we feed upon.\u201d\nBehold there in the wood the fine madman! He is a palace of sweet\nsounds and sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms\nakimbo; he soliloquizes; he accosts the grass and the trees; he feels\nthe blood of the violet, the clover and the lily in his veins; and he\ntalks with the brook that wets his foot.\nThe heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made\nhim love music and verse. It is a fact often observed, that men have\nwritten good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write\nwell under any other circumstances.\nThe like force has the passion over all his nature. It expands the\nsentiment; it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart. Into\nthe most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy\nthe world, so only it have the countenance of the beloved object. In\ngiving him to another it still more gives him to himself. He is a new\nman, with new perceptions, new and keener purposes, and a religious\nsolemnity of character and aims. He does not longer appertain to his\nfamily and society; _he_ is somewhat; _he_ is a person; _he_ is a soul.\nAnd here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence\nwhich is thus potent over the human youth. Beauty, whose revelation to\nman we now celebrate, welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine,\nwhich pleases everybody with it and with themselves, seems sufficient\nto itself. The lover cannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and\nsolitary. Like a tree in flower, so much soft, budding, informing\nloveliness is society for itself; and she teaches his eye why Beauty\nwas pictured with Loves and Graces attending her steps. Her existence\nmakes the world rich. Though she extrudes all other persons from his\nattention as cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by carrying out\nher own being into somewhat impersonal, large, mundane, so that the\nmaiden stands to him for a representative of all select things and\nvirtues. For that reason the lover never sees personal resemblances in\nhis mistress to her kindred or to others. His friends find in her a\nlikeness to her mother, or her sisters, or to persons not of her blood.\nThe lover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and diamond\nmornings, to rainbows and the song of birds.\nThe ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue. Who can analyze the\nnameless charm which glances from one and another face and form? We are\ntouched with emotions of tenderness and complacency, but we cannot find\nwhereat this dainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points. It is\ndestroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it to\norganization. Nor does it point to any relations of friendship or love\nknown and described in society, but, as it seems to me, to a quite\nother and unattainable sphere, to relations of transcendent delicacy\nand sweetness, to what roses and violets hint and foreshow. We cannot\napproach beauty. Its nature is like opaline doves\u2019-neck lustres,\nhovering and evanescent. Herein it resembles the most excellent things,\nwhich all have this rainbow character, defying all attempts at\nappropriation and use. What else did Jean Paul Richter signify, when he\nsaid to music, \u201cAway! away! thou speakest to me of things which in all\nmy endless life I have not found, and shall not find.\u201d The same fluency\nmay be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue is then\nbeautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out\nof criticism and can no longer be defined by compass and\nmeasuring-wand, but demands an active imagination to go with it and to\nsay what it is in the act of doing. The god or hero of the sculptor is\nalways represented in a transition _from_ that which is representable\nto the senses, _to_ that which is not. Then first it ceases to be a\nstone. The same remark holds of painting. And of poetry the success is\nnot attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it astonishes and\nfires us with new endeavors after the unattainable. Concerning it\nLandor inquires \u201cwhether it is not to be referred to some purer state\nof sensation and existence.\u201d\nIn like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself when\nit dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an\nend; when it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions;\nwhen it makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when he cannot feel\nhis right to it, though he were C\u00e6sar; he cannot feel more right to it\nthan to the firmament and the splendors of a sunset.\nHence arose the saying, \u201cIf I love you, what is that to you?\u201d We say so\nbecause we feel that what we love is not in your will, but above it. It\nis not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in\nyourself and can never know.\nThis agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient\nwriters delighted in; for they said that the soul of man, embodied here\non earth, went roaming up and down in quest of that other world of its\nown out of which it came into this, but was soon stupefied by the light\nof the natural sun, and unable to see any other objects than those of\nthis world, which are but shadows of real things. Therefore the Deity\nsends the glory of youth before the soul, that it may avail itself of\nbeautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the celestial good and\nfair; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to her\nand finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, movement, and\nintelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of\nthat which indeed is within the beauty, and the cause of the beauty.\nIf however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul\nwas gross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped\nnothing but sorrow; body being unable to fulfil the promise which\nbeauty holds out; but if, accepting the hint of these visions and\nsuggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the soul passes through the\nbody and falls to admire strokes of character, and the lovers\ncontemplate one another in their discourses and their actions, then\nthey pass to the true palace of beauty, more and more inflame their\nlove of it, and by this love extinguishing the base affection, as the\nsun puts out the fire by shining on the hearth, they become pure and\nhallowed. By conversation with that which is in itself excellent,\nmagnanimous, lowly, and just, the lover comes to a warmer love of these\nnobilities, and a quicker apprehension of them. Then he passes from\nloving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the one beautiful\nsoul only the door through which he enters to the society of all true\nand pure souls. In the particular society of his mate he attains a\nclearer sight of any spot, any taint which her beauty has contracted\nfrom this world, and is able to point it out, and this with mutual joy\nthat they are now able, without offence, to indicate blemishes and\nhindrances in each other, and give to each all help and comfort in\ncuring the same. And beholding in many souls the traits of the divine\nbeauty, and separating in each soul that which is divine from the taint\nwhich it has contracted in the world, the lover ascends to the highest\nbeauty, to the love and knowledge of the Divinity, by steps on this\nladder of created souls.\nSomewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all ages. The\ndoctrine is not old, nor is it new. If Plato, Plutarch and Apuleius\ntaught it, so have Petrarch, Angelo and Milton. It awaits a truer\nunfolding in opposition and rebuke to that subterranean prudence which\npresides at marriages with words that take hold of the upper world,\nwhilst one eye is prowling in the cellar; so that its gravest discourse\nhas a savor of hams and powdering-tubs. Worst, when this sensualism\nintrudes into the education of young women, and withers the hope and\naffection of human nature by teaching that marriage signifies nothing\nbut a housewife\u2019s thrift, and that woman\u2019s life has no other aim.\nBut this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one scene in our\nplay. In the procession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges\nits circles ever, like the pebble thrown into the pond, or the light\nproceeding from an orb. The rays of the soul alight first on things\nnearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses and domestics, on the\nhouse and yard and passengers, on the circle of household acquaintance,\non politics and geography and history. But things are ever grouping\nthemselves according to higher or more interior laws. Neighborhood,\nsize, numbers, habits, persons, lose by degrees their power over us.\nCause and effect, real affinities, the longing for harmony between the\nsoul and the circumstance, the progressive, idealizing instinct,\npredominate later, and the step backward from the higher to the lower\nrelations is impossible. Thus even love, which is the deification of\npersons, must become more impersonal every day. Of this at first it\ngives no hint. Little think the youth and maiden who are glancing at\neach other across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual\nintelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to proceed from this\nnew, quite external stimulus. The work of vegetation begins first in\nthe irritability of the bark and leaf-buds. From exchanging glances,\nthey advance to acts of courtesy, of gallantry, then to fiery passion,\nto plighting troth and marriage. Passion beholds its object as a\nperfect unit. The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly\nensouled:\u2014\n\u201cHer pure and eloquent blood\nSpoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,\nThat one might almost say her body thought.\u201d\nRomeo, if dead, should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens\nfine. Life, with this pair, has no other aim, asks no more, than\nJuliet,\u2014than Romeo. Night, day, studies, talents, kingdoms, religion,\nare all contained in this form full of soul, in this soul which is all\nform. The lovers delight in endearments, in avowals of love, in\ncomparisons of their regards. When alone, they solace themselves with\nthe remembered image of the other. Does that other see the same star,\nthe same melting cloud, read the same book, feel the same emotion, that\nnow delight me? They try and weigh their affection, and adding up\ncostly advantages, friends, opportunities, properties, exult in\ndiscovering that willingly, joyfully, they would give all as a ransom\nfor the beautiful, the beloved head, not one hair of which shall be\nharmed. But the lot of humanity is on these children. Danger, sorrow,\nand pain arrive to them, as to all. Love prays. It makes covenants with\nEternal Power in behalf of this dear mate. The union which is thus\neffected and which adds a new value to every atom in nature\u2014for it\ntransmutes every thread throughout the whole web of relation into a\ngolden ray, and bathes the soul in a new and sweeter element\u2014is yet a\ntemporary state. Not always can flowers, pearls, poetry, protestations,\nnor even home in another heart, content the awful soul that dwells in\nclay. It arouses itself at last from these endearments, as toys, and\nputs on the harness and aspires to vast and universal aims. The soul\nwhich is in the soul of each, craving a perfect beatitude, detects\nincongruities, defects and disproportion in the behavior of the other.\nHence arise surprise, expostulation and pain. Yet that which drew them\nto each other was signs of loveliness, signs of virtue; and these\nvirtues are there, however eclipsed. They appear and reappear and\ncontinue to attract; but the regard changes, quits the sign and\nattaches to the substance. This repairs the wounded affection.\nMeantime, as life wears on, it proves a game of permutation and\ncombination of all possible positions of the parties, to employ all the\nresources of each and acquaint each with the strength and weakness of\nthe other. For it is the nature and end of this relation, that they\nshould represent the human race to each other. All that is in the\nworld, which is or ought to be known, is cunningly wrought into the\ntexture of man, of woman:\u2014\n\u201cThe person love does to us fit,\nLike manna, has the taste of all in it.\u201d\nThe world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour. The angels that\ninhabit this temple of the body appear at the windows, and the gnomes\nand vices also. By all the virtues they are united. If there be virtue,\nall the vices are known as such; they confess and flee. Their once\nflaming regard is sobered by time in either breast, and losing in\nviolence what it gains in extent, it becomes a thorough good\nunderstanding. They resign each other without complaint to the good\noffices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in\ntime, and exchange the passion which once could not lose sight of its\nobject, for a cheerful, disengaged furtherance, whether present or\nabsent, of each other\u2019s designs. At last they discover that all which\nat first drew them together,\u2014those once sacred features, that magical\nplay of charms,\u2014was deciduous, had a prospective end, like the\nscaffolding by which the house was built; and the purification of the\nintellect and the heart from year to year is the real marriage,\nforeseen and prepared from the first, and wholly above their\nconsciousness. Looking at these aims with which two persons, a man and\na woman, so variously and correlatively gifted, are shut up in one\nhouse to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty years, I do not\nwonder at the emphasis with which the heart prophesies this crisis from\nearly infancy, at the profuse beauty with which the instincts deck the\nnuptial bower, and nature and intellect and art emulate each other in\nthe gifts and the melody they bring to the epithalamium.\nThus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex, nor person,\nnor partiality, but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere, to the\nend of increasing virtue and wisdom. We are by nature observers, and\nthereby learners. That is our permanent state. But we are often made to\nfeel that our affections are but tents of a night. Though slowly and\nwith pain, the objects of the affections change, as the objects of\nthought do. There are moments when the affections rule and absorb the\nman and make his happiness dependent on a person or persons. But in\nhealth the mind is presently seen again,\u2014its overarching vault, bright\nwith galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears that\nswept over us as clouds must lose their finite character and blend with\nGod, to attain their own perfection. But we need not fear that we can\nlose any thing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted to\nthe end. That which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations,\nmust be succeeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so\non for ever.\nVI.\nFRIENDSHIP\nA ruddy drop of manly blood\nThe surging sea outweighs;\nThe world uncertain comes and goes,\nThe lover rooted stays.\nI fancied he was fled,\nAnd, after many a year,\nGlowed unexhausted kindliness\nLike daily sunrise there.\nMy careful heart was free again,\u2014\nO friend, my bosom said,\nThrough thee alone the sky is arched,\nThrough thee the rose is red,\nAll things through thee take nobler form\nAnd look beyond the earth,\nThe mill-round of our fate appears\nA sun-path in thy worth.\nMe too thy nobleness has taught\nTo master my despair;\nThe fountains of my hidden life\nAre through thy friendship fair.\nFRIENDSHIP\nWe have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. Maugre all the\nselfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human\nfamily is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether. How many\npersons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we\nhonor, and who honor us! How many we see in the street, or sit with in\nchurch, whom, though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with! Read the\nlanguage of these wandering eye-beams. The heart knoweth.\nThe effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain\ncordial exhilaration. In poetry and in common speech, the emotions of\nbenevolence and complacency which are felt towards others are likened\nto the material effects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more\nactive, more cheering, are these fine inward irradiations. From the\nhighest degree of passionate love to the lowest degree of good-will,\nthey make the sweetness of life.\nOur intellectual and active powers increase with our affection. The\nscholar sits down to write, and all his years of meditation do not\nfurnish him with one good thought or happy expression; but it is\nnecessary to write a letter to a friend,\u2014and forthwith troops of gentle\nthoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with chosen words. See, in\nany house where virtue and self-respect abide, the palpitation which\nthe approach of a stranger causes. A commended stranger is expected and\nannounced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain invades all the\nhearts of a household. His arrival almost brings fear to the good\nhearts that would welcome him. The house is dusted, all things fly into\ntheir places, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get\nup a dinner if they can. Of a commended stranger, only the good report\nis told by others, only the good and new is heard by us. He stands to\nus for humanity. He is what we wish. Having imagined and invested him,\nwe ask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such\na man, and are uneasy with fear. The same idea exalts conversation with\nhim. We talk better than we are wont. We have the nimblest fancy, a\nricher memory, and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time. For\nlong hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful, rich\ncommunications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that\nthey who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a\nlively surprise at our unusual powers. But as soon as the stranger\nbegins to intrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects, into\nthe conversation, it is all over. He has heard the first, the last and\nbest he will ever hear from us. He is no stranger now. Vulgarity,\nignorance, misapprehension are old acquaintances. Now, when he comes,\nhe may get the order, the dress and the dinner,\u2014but the throbbing of\nthe heart and the communications of the soul, no more.\nWhat is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world\nfor me again? What so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two, in\na thought, in a feeling? How beautiful, on their approach to this\nbeating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and the true! The\nmoment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed; there is\nno winter and no night; all tragedies, all ennuis vanish,\u2014all duties\neven; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant\nof beloved persons. Let the soul be assured that somewhere in the\nuniverse it should rejoin its friend, and it would be content and\ncheerful alone for a thousand years.\nI awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old\nand the new. Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth\nhimself so to me in his gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and\nyet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely and the\nnoble-minded, as from time to time they pass my gate. Who hears me, who\nunderstands me, becomes mine,\u2014a possession for all time. Nor is Nature\nso poor but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we weave\nsocial threads of our own, a new web of relations; and, as many\nthoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we shall by and by\nstand in a new world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and\npilgrims in a traditionary globe. My friends have come to me unsought.\nThe great God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity\nof virtue with itself, I find them, or rather not I but the Deity in me\nand in them derides and cancels the thick walls of individual\ncharacter, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually\nconnives, and now makes many one. High thanks I owe you, excellent\nlovers, who carry out the world for me to new and noble depths, and\nenlarge the meaning of all my thoughts. These are new poetry of the\nfirst Bard,\u2014poetry without stop,\u2014hymn, ode and epic, poetry still\nflowing, Apollo and the Muses chanting still. Will these too separate\nthemselves from me again, or some of them? I know not, but I fear it\nnot; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by simple\naffinity, and the Genius of my life being thus social, the same\naffinity will exert its energy on whomsoever is as noble as these men\nand women, wherever I may be.\nI confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point. It is\nalmost dangerous to me to \u201ccrush the sweet poison of misused wine\u201d of\nthe affections. A new person is to me a great event and hinders me from\nsleep. I have often had fine fancies about persons which have given me\ndelicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit.\nThought is not born of it; my action is very little modified. I must\nfeel pride in my friend\u2019s accomplishments as if they were mine, and a\nproperty in his virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the\nlover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden. We over-estimate\nthe conscience of our friend. His goodness seems better than our\ngoodness, his nature finer, his temptations less. Every thing that is\nhis,\u2014his name, his form, his dress, books and instruments,\u2014fancy\nenhances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth.\nYet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy\nin the ebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the immortality of the\nsoul, is too good to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half\nknows that she is not verily that which he worships; and in the golden\nhour of friendship we are surprised with shades of suspicion and\nunbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he\nshines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this\ndivine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not respect men as it\nrespects itself. In strict science all persons underlie the same\ncondition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by\nmining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple? Shall I\nnot be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know\nthem for what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their\nappearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehension. The root\nof the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and\nfestoons we cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production of the\nbald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an\nEgyptian skull at our banquet. A man who stands united with his thought\nconceives magnificently of himself. He is conscious of a universal\nsuccess, even though bought by uniform particular failures. No\nadvantages, no powers, no gold or force, can be any match for him. I\ncannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth. I\ncannot make your consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star\ndazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like ray. I hear what you say of\nthe admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see\nwell that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is\nat last a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast\nshadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted\nimmensity,\u2014thee also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou art\nnot Being, as Truth is, as Justice is,\u2014thou art not my soul, but a\npicture and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already\nthou art seizing thy hat and cloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth\nfriends as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the\ngermination of new buds, extrudes the old leaf? The law of nature is\nalternation for evermore. Each electrical state superinduces the\nopposite. The soul environs itself with friends that it may enter into\na grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a\nseason, that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method\nbetrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations. The\ninstinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the\nreturning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man\npasses his life in the search after friendship, and if he should record\nhis true sentiment, he might write a letter like this to each new\ncandidate for his love:\u2014\nDEAR FRIEND,\nIf I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with\nthine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings\nand goings. I am not very wise; my moods are quite attainable, and I\nrespect thy genius; it is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not\npresume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a\ndelicious torment. Thine ever, or never.\nYet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity and not for\nlife. They are not to be indulged. This is to weave cobweb, and not\ncloth. Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we\nhave made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre\nof the human heart. The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of\none web with the laws of nature and of morals. But we have aimed at a\nswift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness. We snatch at the\nslowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which many summers and many\nwinters must ripen. We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an\nadulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain.\nWe are armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we\nmeet, begin to play, and translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost\nall people descend to meet. All association must be a compromise, and,\nwhat is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the\nbeautiful natures disappears as they approach each other. What a\nperpetual disappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and\ngifted! After interviews have been compassed with long foresight we\nmust be tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden, unseasonable\napathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the heyday of\nfriendship and thought. Our faculties do not play us true, and both\nparties are relieved by solitude.\nI ought to be equal to every relation. It makes no difference how many\nfriends I have and what content I can find in conversing with each, if\nthere be one to whom I am not equal. If I have shrunk unequal from one\ncontest, the joy I find in all the rest becomes mean and cowardly. I\nshould hate myself, if then I made my other friends my asylum:\u2014\n\u201cThe valiant warrior famoused for fight,\nAfter a hundred victories, once foiled,\nIs from the book of honor razed quite,\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled.\u201d\nOur impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and apathy are a\ntough husk in which a delicate organization is protected from premature\nripening. It would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best\nsouls were yet ripe enough to know and own it. Respect the\n_naturlangsamkeit_ which hardens the ruby in a million years, and works\nin duration in which Alps and Andes come and go as rainbows. The good\nspirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness. Love,\nwhich is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the total worth\nof man. Let us not have this childish luxury in our regards, but the\nausterest worth; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in\nthe truth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to be overturned, of\nhis foundations.\nThe attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I leave,\nfor the time, all account of subordinate social benefit, to speak of\nthat select and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute, and which\neven leaves the language of love suspicious and common, so much is this\npurer, and nothing is so much divine.\nI do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage.\nWhen they are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the\nsolidest thing we know. For now, after so many ages of experience, what\ndo we know of nature or of ourselves? Not one step has man taken toward\nthe solution of the problem of his destiny. In one condemnation of\nfolly stand the whole universe of men. But the sweet sincerity of joy\nand peace which I draw from this alliance with my brother\u2019s soul is the\nnut itself whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and\nshell. Happy is the house that shelters a friend! It might well be\nbuilt, like a festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day.\nHappier, if he know the solemnity of that relation and honor its law!\nHe who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an\nOlympian, to the great games where the first-born of the world are the\ncompetitors. He proposes himself for contests where Time, Want, Danger,\nare in the lists, and he alone is victor who has truth enough in his\nconstitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and\ntear of all these. The gifts of fortune may be present or absent, but\nall the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness and the\ncontempt of trifles. There are two elements that go to the composition\nof friendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in\neither, no reason why either should be first named. One is truth. A\nfriend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think\naloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal\nthat I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation,\ncourtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal\nwith him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom\nmeets another. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, like diadems and\nauthority, only to the highest rank; _that_ being permitted to speak\ntruth, as having none above it to court or conform unto. Every man\nalone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins.\nWe parry and fend the approach of our fellow-man by compliments, by\ngossip, by amusements, by affairs. We cover up our thought from him\nunder a hundred folds. I knew a man who under a certain religious\nfrenzy cast off this drapery, and omitting all compliment and\ncommonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered,\nand that with great insight and beauty. At first he was resisted, and\nall men agreed he was mad. But persisting\u2014as indeed he could not help\ndoing\u2014for some time in this course, he attained to the advantage of\nbringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him. No\nman would think of speaking falsely with him, or of putting him off\nwith any chat of markets or reading-rooms. But every man was\nconstrained by so much sincerity to the like plaindealing, and what\nlove of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth he had, he did\ncertainly show him. But to most of us society shows not its face and\neye, but its side and its back. To stand in true relations with men in\na false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not? We can seldom go\nerect. Almost every man we meet requires some civility,\u2014requires to be\nhumored; he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or\nphilanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils\nall conversation with him. But a friend is a sane man who exercises not\nmy ingenuity, but me. My friend gives me entertainment without\nrequiring any stipulation on my part. A friend therefore is a sort of\nparadox in nature. I who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose\nexistence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own, behold now the\nsemblance of my being, in all its height, variety, and curiosity,\nreiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned the\nmasterpiece of nature.\nThe other element of friendship is tenderness. We are holden to men by\nevery sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre, by\nlust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and badge and\ntrifle,\u2014but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in\nanother as to draw us by love. Can another be so blessed and we so pure\nthat we can offer him tenderness? When a man becomes dear to me I have\ntouched the goal of fortune. I find very little written directly to the\nheart of this matter in books. And yet I have one text which I cannot\nchoose but remember. My author says,\u2014\u201cI offer myself faintly and\nbluntly to those whose I effectually am, and tender myself least to him\nto whom I am the most devoted.\u201d I wish that friendship should have\nfeet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself on the\nground, before it vaults over the moon. I wish it to be a little of a\ncitizen, before it is quite a cherub. We chide the citizen because he\nmakes love a commodity. It is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans; it\nis good neighborhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall at\nthe funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of\nthe relation. But though we cannot find the god under this disguise of\na sutler, yet on the other hand we cannot forgive the poet if he spins\nhis thread too fine and does not substantiate his romance by the\nmunicipal virtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity and pity. I hate\nthe prostitution of the name of friendship to signify modish and\nworldly alliances. I much prefer the company of ploughboys and\ntin-peddlers to the silken and perfumed amity which celebrates its days\nof encounter by a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle and dinners\nat the best taverns. The end of friendship is a commerce the most\nstrict and homely that can be joined; more strict than any of which we\nhave experience. It is for aid and comfort through all the relations\nand passages of life and death. It is fit for serene days and graceful\ngifts and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare,\nshipwreck, poverty, and persecution. It keeps company with the sallies\nof the wit and the trances of religion. We are to dignify to each other\nthe daily needs and offices of man\u2019s life, and embellish it by courage,\nwisdom and unity. It should never fall into something usual and\nsettled, but should be alert and inventive and add rhyme and reason to\nwhat was drudgery.\nFriendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so\nwell tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced (for\neven in that particular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be\naltogether paired), that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured.\nIt cannot subsist in its perfection, say some of those who are learned\nin this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two. I am not quite\nso strict in my terms, perhaps because I have never known so high a\nfellowship as others. I please my imagination more with a circle of\ngodlike men and women variously related to each other and between whom\nsubsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of _one to one_\nperemptory for conversation, which is the practice and consummation of\nfriendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good and\nbad. You shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times\nwith two several men, but let all three of you come together and you\nshall not have one new and hearty word. Two may talk and one may hear,\nbut three cannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere and\nsearching sort. In good company there is never such discourse between\ntwo, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone. In\ngood company the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul\nexactly co-extensive with the several consciousnesses there present. No\npartialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister,\nof wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he\nmay then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not\npoorly limited to his own. Now this convention, which good sense\ndemands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which\nrequires an absolute running of two souls into one.\nNo two men but being left alone with each other enter into simpler\nrelations. Yet it is affinity that determines _which_ two shall\nconverse. Unrelated men give little joy to each other, will never\nsuspect the latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great talent\nfor conversation, as if it were a permanent property in some\nindividuals. Conversation is an evanescent relation,\u2014no more. A man is\nreputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a\nword to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as much\nreason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade.\nIn the sun it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought he\nwill regain his tongue.\nFriendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness that\npiques each with the presence of power and of consent in the other\nparty. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that my\nfriend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I am\nequally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him not cease an\ninstant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is that\nthe _not mine_ is _mine_. I hate, where I looked for a manly\nfurtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush of\nconcession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his\necho. The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do\nwithout it. That high office requires great and sublime parts. There\nmust be very two, before there can be very one. Let it be an alliance\nof two large, formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared,\nbefore yet they recognize the deep identity which, beneath these\ndisparities, unites them.\nHe only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure that\ngreatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to\nintermeddle with his fortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this. Leave\nto the diamond its ages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the births of\nthe eternal. Friendship demands a religious treatment. We talk of\nchoosing our friends, but friends are self-elected. Reverence is a\ngreat part of it. Treat your friend as a spectacle. Of course he has\nmerits that are not yours, and that you cannot honor if you must needs\nhold him close to your person. Stand aside; give those merits room; let\nthem mount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend\u2019s buttons, or\nof his thought? To a great heart he will still be a stranger in a\nthousand particulars, that he may come near in the holiest ground.\nLeave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property, and to suck\na short and all-confounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit.\nLet us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should\nwe desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why insist\non rash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his house, or\nknow his mother and brother and sisters? Why be visited by him at your\nown? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this touching and\nclawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity,\na glance from him, I want, but not news, nor pottage. I can get\npolitics and chat and neighborly conveniences from cheaper companions.\nShould not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal\nand great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in\ncomparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that\nclump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us not vilify, but\nraise it to that standard. That great defying eye, that scornful beauty\nof his mien and action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather\nfortify and enhance. Worship his superiorities; wish him not less by a\nthought, but hoard and tell them all. Guard him as thy counterpart. Let\nhim be to thee for ever a sort of beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly\nrevered, and not a trivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast\naside. The hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be\nseen if the eye is too near. To my friend I write a letter and from him\nI receive a letter. That seems to you a little. It suffices me. It is a\nspiritual gift worthy of him to give and of me to receive. It profanes\nnobody. In these warm lines the heart will trust itself, as it will not\nto the tongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier existence than\nall the annals of heroism have yet made good.\nRespect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its\nperfect flower by your impatience for its opening. We must be our own\nbefore we can be another\u2019s. There is at least this satisfaction in\ncrime, according to the Latin proverb;\u2014you can speak to your accomplice\non even terms. _Crimen quos inquinat, \u00e6quat_. To those whom we admire\nand love, at first we cannot. Yet the least defect of self-possession\nvitiates, in my judgment, the entire relation. There can never be deep\npeace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until in their\ndialogue each stands for the whole world.\nWhat is so great as friendship, let us carry with what grandeur of\nspirit we can. Let us be silent,\u2014so we may hear the whisper of the\ngods. Let us not interfere. Who set you to cast about what you should\nsay to the select souls, or how to say any thing to such? No matter how\ningenious, no matter how graceful and bland. There are innumerable\ndegrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to say aught is to be\nfrivolous. Wait, and thy heart shall speak. Wait until the necessary\nand everlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail themselves of\nyour lips. The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a\nfriend is to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by getting into\nhis house. If unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you, and you\nshall never catch a true glance of his eye. We see the noble afar off\nand they repel us; why should we intrude? Late,\u2014very late,\u2014we perceive\nthat no arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of\nsociety would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with\nthem as we desire,\u2014but solely the uprise of nature in us to the same\ndegree it is in them; then shall we meet as water with water; and if we\nshould not meet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already\nthey. In the last analysis, love is only the reflection of a man\u2019s own\nworthiness from other men. Men have sometimes exchanged names with\ntheir friends, as if they would signify that in their friend each loved\nhis own soul.\nThe higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy\nto establish it with flesh and blood. We walk alone in the world.\nFriends such as we desire are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope\ncheers ever the faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the\nuniversal power, souls are now acting, enduring, and daring, which can\nlove us and which we can love. We may congratulate ourselves that the\nperiod of nonage, of follies, of blunders and of shame, is passed in\nsolitude, and when we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands in\nheroic hands. Only be admonished by what you already see, not to strike\nleagues of friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship can be.\nOur impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god\nattends. By persisting in your path, though you forfeit the little you\ngain the great. You demonstrate yourself, so as to put yourself out of\nthe reach of false relations, and you draw to you the first-born of the\nworld,\u2014those rare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at\nonce, and before whom the vulgar great show as spectres and shadows\nmerely.\nIt is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual, as if so\nwe could lose any genuine love. Whatever correction of our popular\nviews we make from insight, nature will be sure to bear us out in, and\nthough it seem to rob us of some joy, will repay us with a greater. Let\nus feel if we will the absolute insulation of man. We are sure that we\nhave all in us. We go to Europe, or we pursue persons, or we read\nbooks, in the instinctive faith that these will call it out and reveal\nus to ourselves. Beggars all. The persons are such as we; the Europe,\nan old faded garment of dead persons; the books, their ghosts. Let us\ndrop this idolatry. Let us give over this mendicancy. Let us even bid\nour dearest friends farewell, and defy them, saying, \u2018Who are you?\nUnhand me: I will be dependent no more.\u2019 Ah! seest thou not, O brother,\nthat thus we part only to meet again on a higher platform, and only be\nmore each other\u2019s because we are more our own? A friend is Janus-faced;\nhe looks to the past and the future. He is the child of all my\nforegoing hours, the prophet of those to come, and the harbinger of a\ngreater friend.\nI do then with my friends as I do with my books. I would have them\nwhere I can find them, but I seldom use them. We must have society on\nour own terms, and admit or exclude it on the slightest cause. I cannot\nafford to speak much with my friend. If he is great he makes me so\ngreat that I cannot descend to converse. In the great days,\npresentiments hover before me in the firmament. I ought then to\ndedicate myself to them. I go in that I may seize them, I go out that I\nmay seize them. I fear only that I may lose them receding into the sky\nin which now they are only a patch of brighter light. Then, though I\nprize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their\nvisions, lest I lose my own. It would indeed give me a certain\nhousehold joy to quit this lofty seeking, this spiritual astronomy or\nsearch of stars, and come down to warm sympathies with you; but then I\nknow well I shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods. It is\ntrue, next week I shall have languid moods, when I can well afford to\noccupy myself with foreign objects; then I shall regret the lost\nliterature of your mind, and wish you were by my side again. But if you\ncome, perhaps you will fill my mind only with new visions; not with\nyourself but with your lustres, and I shall not be able any more than\nnow to converse with you. So I will owe to my friends this evanescent\nintercourse. I will receive from them not what they have but what they\nare. They shall give me that which properly they cannot give, but which\nemanates from them. But they shall not hold me by any relations less\nsubtile and pure. We will meet as though we met not, and part as though\nwe parted not.\nIt has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a\nfriendship greatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the\nother. Why should I cumber myself with regrets that the receiver is not\ncapacious? It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide\nand vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting\nplanet. Let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion. If he\nis unequal he will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by thy\nown shining, and no longer a mate for frogs and worms, dost soar and\nburn with the gods of the empyrean. It is thought a disgrace to love\nunrequited. But the great will see that true love cannot be unrequited.\nTrue love transcends the unworthy object and dwells and broods on the\neternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but\nfeels rid of so much earth and feels its independency the surer. Yet\nthese things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the\nrelation. The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity\nand trust. It must not surmise or provide for infirmity. It treats its\nobject as a god, that it may deify both.\nVII.\nPRUDENCE\nTheme no poet gladly sung,\nFair to old and foul to young;\nScorn not thou the love of parts,\nAnd the articles of arts.\nGrandeur of the perfect sphere\nThanks the atoms that cohere.\nPRUDENCE\nWhat right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have Little, and that\nof the negative sort? My prudence consists in avoiding and going\nwithout, not in the inventing of means and methods, not in adroit\nsteering, not in gentle repairing. I have no skill to make money spend\nwell, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees my garden discovers\nthat I must have some other garden. Yet I love facts, and hate\nlubricity and people without perception. Then I have the same title to\nwrite on prudence that I have to write on poetry or holiness. We write\nfrom aspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We paint\nthose qualities which we do not possess. The poet admires the man of\nenergy and tactics; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the\nbar; and where a man is not vain and egotistic you shall find what he\nhas not by his praise. Moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to\nbalance these fine lyric words of Love and Friendship with words of\ncoarser sound, and whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant,\nnot to own it in passing.\nPrudence is the virtue of the senses. It is the science of appearances.\nIt is the outmost action of the inward life. It is God taking thought\nfor oxen. It moves matter after the laws of matter. It is content to\nseek health of body by complying with physical conditions, and health\nof mind by the laws of the intellect.\nThe world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not exist for\nitself, but has a symbolic character; and a true prudence or law of\nshows recognizes the co-presence of other laws and knows that its own\noffice is subaltern; knows that it is surface and not centre where it\nworks. Prudence is false when detached. It is legitimate when it is the\nNatural History of the soul incarnate, when it unfolds the beauty of\nlaws within the narrow scope of the senses.\nThere are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world. It is\nsufficient to our present purpose to indicate three. One class live to\nthe utility of the symbol, esteeming health and wealth a final good.\nAnother class live above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the\npoet and artist and the naturalist and man of science. A third class\nlive above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing\nsignified; these are wise men. The first class have common sense; the\nsecond, taste; and the third, spiritual perception. Once in a long\ntime, a man traverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol\nsolidly, then also has a clear eye for its beauty, and lastly, whilst\nhe pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature, does not\noffer to build houses and barns thereon,\u2014reverencing the splendor of\nthe God which he sees bursting through each chink and cranny.\nThe world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of a base\nprudence, which is a devotion to matter, as if we possessed no other\nfaculties than the palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a\nprudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never subscribes, which\nnever gives, which seldom lends, and asks but one question of any\nproject,\u2014Will it bake bread? This is a disease like a thickening of the\nskin until the vital organs are destroyed. But culture, revealing the\nhigh origin of the apparent world and aiming at the perfection of the\nman as the end, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily life,\ninto means. It sees prudence not to be a several faculty, but a name\nfor wisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants.\nCultivated men always feel and speak so, as if a great fortune, the\nachievement of a civil or social measure, great personal influence, a\ngraceful and commanding address, had their value as proofs of the\nenergy of the spirit. If a man lose his balance and immerse himself in\nany trades or pleasures for their own sake, he may be a good wheel or\npin, but he is not a cultivated man.\nThe spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and\ncowards, and is the subject of all comedy. It is nature\u2019s joke, and\ntherefore literature\u2019s. The true prudence limits this sensualism by\nadmitting the knowledge of an internal and real world. This recognition\nonce made, the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and\ntimes, being studied with the co-perception of their subordinate place,\nwill reward any degree of attention. For our existence, thus apparently\nattached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods\nwhich they mark,\u2014so susceptible to climate and to country, so alive to\nsocial good and evil, so fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and\ncold and debt,\u2014reads all its primary lessons out of these books.\nPrudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is. It takes the\nlaws of the world whereby man\u2019s being is conditioned, as they are, and\nkeeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good. It respects space\nand time, climate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and death.\nThere revolve, to give bound and period to his being on all sides, the\nsun and moon, the great formalists in the sky: here lies stubborn\nmatter, and will not swerve from its chemical routine. Here is a\nplanted globe, pierced and belted with natural laws and fenced and\ndistributed externally with civil partitions and properties which\nimpose new restraints on the young inhabitant.\nWe eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by the air which\nblows around us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too\nhot, too dry or too wet. Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible and\ndivine in its coming, is slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A\ndoor is to be painted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood or oil, or\nmeal or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then the tax, and\nan affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains, and the\nstinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word,\u2014these eat\nup the hours. Do what we can, summer will have its flies; if we walk in\nthe woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing we must expect a\nwet coat. Then climate is a great impediment to idle persons; we often\nresolve to give up the care of the weather, but still we regard the\nclouds and the rain.\nWe are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and\nyears. The hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the\nnorthern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the\nfixed smile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day at will. At\nnight he may sleep on a mat under the moon, and wherever a wild\ndate-tree grows, nature has, without a prayer even, spread a table for\nhis morning meal. The northerner is perforce a householder. He must\nbrew, bake, salt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But as\nit happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new\nacquaintance with nature, and as nature is inexhaustibly significant,\nthe inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner\nin force. Such is the value of these matters that a man who knows other\nthings can never know too much of these. Let him have accurate\nperceptions. Let him, if he have hands, handle; if eyes, measure and\ndiscriminate; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry, natural\nhistory and economics; the more he has, the less is he willing to spare\nany one. Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their\nvalue. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action. The\ndomestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the\nairs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces\nwhich others never dream of. The application of means to ends insures\nvictory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in\nthe tactics of party or of war. The good husband finds method as\nefficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of\nfruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the\nDepartment of State. In the rainy day he builds a work-bench, or gets\nhis tool-box set in the corner of the barn-chamber, and stored with\nnails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver and chisel. Herein he tastes an old\njoy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and\ncorn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping. His garden\nor his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes. One might find\nargument for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine element\nof pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man\nkeep the law,\u2014any law,\u2014and his way will be strown with satisfactions.\nThere is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the\namount.\nOn the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence. If you\nthink the senses final, obey their law. If you believe in the soul, do\nnot clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of\ncause and effect. It is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose\nand imperfect perception. Dr. Johnson is reported to have said,\u2014\u201cIf the\nchild says he looked out of this window, when he looked out of\nthat,\u2014whip him.\u201d Our American character is marked by a more than\naverage delight in accurate perception, which is shown by the currency\nof the byword, \u201cNo mistake.\u201d But the discomfort of unpunctuality, of\nconfusion of thought about facts, of inattention to the wants of\nto-morrow, is of no nation. The beautiful laws of time and space, once\ndislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the hive be\ndisturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey it will yield us\nbees. Our words and actions to be fair must be timely. A gay and\npleasant sound is the whetting of the scythe in the mornings of June,\nyet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a whetstone or\nmower\u2019s rifle when it is too late in the season to make hay?\nScatter-brained and \u201cafternoon\u201d men spoil much more than their own\naffair in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them. I have seen\na criticism on some paintings, of which I am reminded when I see the\nshiftless and unhappy men who are not true to their senses. The last\nGrand Duke of Weimar, a man of superior understanding, said,\u2014\u201cI have\nsometimes remarked in the presence of great works of art, and just now\nespecially in Dresden, how much a certain property contributes to the\neffect which gives life to the figures, and to the life an irresistible\ntruth. This property is the hitting, in all the figures we draw, the\nright centre of gravity. I mean the placing the figures firm upon their\nfeet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on the spot where\nthey should look. Even lifeless figures, as vessels and stools\u2014let them\nbe drawn ever so correctly\u2014lose all effect so soon as they lack the\nresting upon their centre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and\noscillating appearance. The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only\ngreatly affecting picture which I have seen) is the quietest and most\npassionless piece you can imagine; a couple of saints who worship the\nVirgin and Child. Nevertheless, it awakens a deeper impression than the\ncontortions of ten crucified martyrs. For beside all the resistless\nbeauty of form, it possesses in the highest degree the property of the\nperpendicularity of all the figures.\u201d This perpendicularity we demand\nof all the figures in this picture of life. Let them stand on their\nfeet, and not float and swing. Let us know where to find them. Let them\ndiscriminate between what they remember and what they dreamed, call a\nspade a spade, give us facts, and honor their own senses with trust.\nBut what man shall dare tax another with imprudence? Who is prudent?\nThe men we call greatest are least in this kingdom. There is a certain\nfatal dislocation in our relation to nature, distorting our modes of\nliving and making every law our enemy, which seems at last to have\naroused all the wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of\nReform. We must call the highest prudence to counsel, and ask why\nhealth and beauty and genius should now be the exception rather than\nthe rule of human nature? We do not know the properties of plants and\nanimals and the laws of nature, through our sympathy with the same; but\nthis remains the dream of poets. Poetry and prudence should be\ncoincident. Poets should be lawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric\ninspiration should not chide and insult, but should announce and lead\nthe civil code and the day\u2019s work. But now the two things seem\nirreconcilably parted. We have violated law upon law until we stand\namidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a coincidence between reason\nand the phenomena, we are surprised. Beauty should be the dowry of\nevery man and woman, as invariably as sensation; but it is rare. Health\nor sound organization should be universal. Genius should be the child\nof genius and every child should be inspired; but now it is not to be\npredicted of any child, and nowhere is it pure. We call partial\nhalf-lights, by courtesy, genius; talent which converts itself to\nmoney; talent which glitters to-day that it may dine and sleep well\nto-morrow; and society is officered by _men of parts_, as they are\nproperly called, and not by divine men. These use their gifts to refine\nluxury, not to abolish it. Genius is always ascetic, and piety, and\nlove. Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and they find\nbeauty in rites and bounds that resist it.\nWe have found out fine names to cover our sensuality withal, but no\ngifts can raise intemperance. The man of talent affects to call his\ntransgressions of the laws of the senses trivial and to count them\nnothing considered with his devotion to his art. His art never taught\nhim lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the wish to reap where he had\nnot sowed. His art is less for every deduction from his holiness, and\nless for every defect of common sense. On him who scorned the world as\nhe said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge. He that despiseth small\nthings will perish by little and little. Goethe\u2019s Tasso is very likely\nto be a pretty fair historical portrait, and that is true tragedy. It\ndoes not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard the\nThird oppresses and slays a score of innocent persons, as when Antonio\nand Tasso, both apparently right, wrong each other. One living after\nthe maxims of this world and consistent and true to them, the other\nfired with all divine sentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of\nsense, without submitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel, a\nknot we cannot untie. Tasso\u2019s is no infrequent case in modern\nbiography. A man of genius, of an ardent temperament, reckless of\nphysical laws, self-indulgent, becomes presently unfortunate,\nquerulous, a \u201cdiscomfortable cousin,\u201d a thorn to himself and to others.\nThe scholar shames us by his bifold life. Whilst something higher than\nprudence is active, he is admirable; when common sense is wanted, he is\nan encumbrance. Yesterday, C\u00e6sar was not so great; to-day, the felon at\nthe gallows\u2019 foot is not more miserable. Yesterday, radiant with the\nlight of an ideal world in which he lives, the first of men; and now\noppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he must thank himself. He\nresembles the pitiful drivellers whom travellers describe as\nfrequenting the bazaars of Constantinople, who skulk about all day,\nyellow, emaciated, ragged, sneaking; and at evening, when the bazaars\nare open, slink to the opium-shop, swallow their morsel and become\ntranquil and glorified seers. And who has not seen the tragedy of\nimprudent genius struggling for years with paltry pecuniary\ndifficulties, at last sinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a\ngiant slaughtered by pins?\nIs it not better that a man should accept the first pains and\nmortifications of this sort, which nature is not slack in sending him,\nas hints that he must expect no other good than the just fruit of his\nown labor and self-denial? Health, bread, climate, social position,\nhave their importance, and he will give them their due. Let him esteem\nNature a perpetual counsellor, and her perfections the exact measure of\nour deviations. Let him make the night night, and the day day. Let him\ncontrol the habit of expense. Let him see that as much wisdom may be\nexpended on a private economy as on an empire, and as much wisdom may\nbe drawn from it. The laws of the world are written out for him on\nevery piece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will not be the\nbetter for knowing, were it only the wisdom of Poor Richard, or the\nState-Street prudence of buying by the acre to sell by the foot; or the\nthrift of the agriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because it\nwill grow whilst he sleeps; or the prudence which consists in\nhusbanding little strokes of the tool, little portions of time,\nparticles of stock and small gains. The eye of prudence may never shut.\nIron, if kept at the ironmonger\u2019s, will rust; beer, if not brewed in\nthe right state of the atmosphere, will sour; timber of ships will rot\nat sea, or if laid up high and dry, will strain, warp and dry-rot;\nmoney, if kept by us, yields no rent and is liable to loss; if\ninvested, is liable to depreciation of the particular kind of stock.\nStrike, says the smith, the iron is white; keep the rake, says the\nhaymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and the cart as nigh the rake.\nOur Yankee trade is reputed to be very much on the extreme of this\nprudence. It takes bank-notes, good, bad, clean, ragged, and saves\nitself by the speed with which it passes them off. Iron cannot rust,\nnor beer sour, nor timber rot, nor calicoes go out of fashion, nor\nmoney stocks depreciate, in the few swift moments in which the Yankee\nsuffers any one of them to remain in his possession. In skating over\nthin ice our safety is in our speed.\nLet him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him learn that every\nthing in nature, even motes and feathers, go by law and not by luck,\nand that what he sows he reaps. By diligence and self-command let him\nput the bread he eats at his own disposal, that he may not stand in\nbitter and false relations to other men; for the best good of wealth is\nfreedom. Let him practise the minor virtues. How much of human life is\nlost in waiting! let him not make his fellow-creatures wait. How many\nwords and promises are promises of conversation! Let his be words of\nfate. When he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float round the\nglobe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for which it was written,\namidst a swarming population, let him likewise feel the admonition to\nintegrate his being across all these distracting forces, and keep a\nslender human word among the storms, distances and accidents that drive\nus hither and thither, and, by persistency, make the paltry force of\none man reappear to redeem its pledge after months and years in the\nmost distant climates.\nWe must not try to write the laws of any one virtue, looking at that\nonly. Human nature loves no contradictions, but is symmetrical. The\nprudence which secures an outward well-being is not to be studied by\none set of men, whilst heroism and holiness are studied by another, but\nthey are reconcilable. Prudence concerns the present time, persons,\nproperty and existing forms. But as every fact hath its roots in the\nsoul, and if the soul were changed, would cease to be, or would become\nsome other thing,\u2014the proper administration of outward things will\nalways rest on a just apprehension of their cause and origin; that is,\nthe good man will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the politic\nman. Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the\nliar, but is a stab at the health of human society. On the most\nprofitable lie the course of events presently lays a destructive tax;\nwhilst frankness invites frankness, puts the parties on a convenient\nfooting and makes their business a friendship. Trust men and they will\nbe true to you; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great,\nthough they make an exception in your favor to all their rules of\ntrade.\nSo, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things, prudence does not\nconsist in evasion or in flight, but in courage. He who wishes to walk\nin the most peaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself\nup to resolution. Let him front the object of his worst apprehension,\nand his stoutness will commonly make his fear groundless. The Latin\nproverb says, \u201cIn battles the eye is first overcome.\u201d Entire\nself-possession may make a battle very little more dangerous to life\nthan a match at foils or at football. Examples are cited by soldiers of\nmen who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given to it, and who\nhave stepped aside from the path of the ball. The terrors of the storm\nare chiefly confined to the parlor and the cabin. The drover, the\nsailor, buffets it all day, and his health renews itself at as vigorous\na pulse under the sleet as under the sun of June.\nIn the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors, fear comes\nreadily to heart and magnifies the consequence of the other party; but\nit is a bad counsellor. Every man is actually weak and apparently\nstrong. To himself he seems weak; to others, formidable. You are afraid\nof Grim; but Grim also is afraid of you. You are solicitous of the\ngood-will of the meanest person, uneasy at his ill-will. But the\nsturdiest offender of your peace and of the neighborhood, if you rip up\n_his_ claims, is as thin and timid as any, and the peace of society is\noften kept, because, as children say, one is afraid, and the other\ndares not. Far off, men swell, bully and threaten; bring them hand to\nhand, and they are a feeble folk.\nIt is a proverb that \u2018courtesy costs nothing\u2019; but calculation might\ncome to value love for its profit. Love is fabled to be blind, but\nkindness is necessary to perception; love is not a hood, but an\neye-water. If you meet a sectary or a hostile partisan, never recognize\nthe dividing lines, but meet on what common ground remains,\u2014if only\nthat the sun shines and the rain rains for both; the area will widen\nvery fast, and ere you know it, the boundary mountains on which the eye\nhad fastened have melted into air. If they set out to contend, Saint\nPaul will lie and Saint John will hate. What low, poor, paltry,\nhypocritical people an argument on religion will make of the pure and\nchosen souls! They will shuffle and crow, crook and hide, feign to\nconfess here, only that they may brag and conquer there, and not a\nthought has enriched either party, and not an emotion of bravery,\nmodesty, or hope. So neither should you put yourself in a false\nposition with your contemporaries by indulging a vein of hostility and\nbitterness. Though your views are in straight antagonism to theirs,\nassume an identity of sentiment, assume that you are saying precisely\nthat which all think, and in the flow of wit and love roll out your\nparadoxes in solid column, with not the infirmity of a doubt. So at\nleast shall you get an adequate deliverance. The natural motions of the\nsoul are so much better than the voluntary ones that you will never do\nyourself justice in dispute. The thought is not then taken hold of by\nthe right handle, does not show itself proportioned and in its true\nbearings, but bears extorted, hoarse, and half witness. But assume a\nconsent and it shall presently be granted, since really and underneath\ntheir external diversities, all men are of one heart and mind.\nWisdom will never let us stand with any man or men on an unfriendly\nfooting. We refuse sympathy and intimacy with people, as if we waited\nfor some better sympathy and intimacy to come. But whence and when?\nTo-morrow will be like to-day. Life wastes itself whilst we are\npreparing to live. Our friends and fellow-workers die off from us.\nScarcely can we say we see new men, new women, approaching us. We are\ntoo old to regard fashion, too old to expect patronage of any greater\nor more powerful. Let us suck the sweetness of those affections and\nconsuetudes that grow near us. These old shoes are easy to the feet.\nUndoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company, can easily\nwhisper names prouder, and that tickle the fancy more. Every man\u2019s\nimagination hath its friends; and life would be dearer with such\ncompanions. But if you cannot have them on good mutual terms, you\ncannot have them. If not the Deity but our ambition hews and shapes the\nnew relations, their virtue escapes, as strawberries lose their flavor\nin garden-beds.\nThus truth, frankness, courage, love, humility and all the virtues\nrange themselves on the side of prudence, or the art of securing a\npresent well-being. I do not know if all matter will be found to be\nmade of one element, as oxygen or hydrogen, at last, but the world of\nmanners and actions is wrought of one stuff, and begin where we will we\nare pretty sure in a short space to be mumbling our ten commandments.\nVIII.\nHEROISM\n\u201cParadise is under the shadow of swords.\u201d\n_Mahomet._\nRuby wine is drunk by knaves,\nSugar spends to fatten slaves,\nRose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;\nThunderclouds are Jove\u2019s festoons,\nDrooping oft in wreaths of dread\nLightning-knotted round his head;\nThe hero is not fed on sweets,\nDaily his own heart he eats;\nChambers of the great are jails,\nAnd head-winds right for royal sails.\nHEROISM\nIn the elder English dramatists, and mainly in the plays Of Beaumont\nand Fletcher, there is a constant recognition of gentility, as if a\nnoble behavior were as easily marked in the society of their age as\ncolor is in our American population. When any Rodrigo, Pedro or Valerio\nenters, though he be a stranger, the duke or governor exclaims, \u2018This\nis a gentleman,\u2014and proffers civilities without end; but all the rest\nare slag and refuse. In harmony with this delight in personal\nadvantages there is in their plays a certain heroic cast of character\nand dialogue,\u2014as in Bonduca, Sophocles, the Mad Lover, the Double\nMarriage,\u2014wherein the speaker is so earnest and cordial and on such\ndeep grounds of character, that the dialogue, on the slightest\nadditional incident in the plot, rises naturally into poetry. Among\nmany texts take the following. The Roman Martius has conquered\nAthens,\u2014all but the invincible spirits of Sophocles, the duke of\nAthens, and Dorigen, his wife. The beauty of the latter inflames\nMartius, and he seeks to save her husband; but Sophocles will not ask\nhis life, although assured that a word will save him, and the execution\nof both proceeds:\u2014\n_Valerius_. Bid thy wife farewell.\n_Sophocles_. No, I will take no leave. My Dorigen,\nYonder, above, \u2019bout Ariadne\u2019s crown,\nMy spirit shall hover for thee. Prithee, haste.\n_Dorigen_. Stay, Sophocles,\u2014with this tie up my sight;\nLet not soft nature so transformed be,\nAnd lose her gentler sexed humanity,\nTo make me see my lord bleed. So, \u2019tis well;\nNever one object underneath the sun\nWill I behold before my Sophocles:\nFarewell; now teach the Romans how to die.\n_Martius_. Dost know what \u2019t is to die?\n_Sophocles_. Thou dost not, Martius,\nAnd, therefore, not what \u2019tis to live; to die\nIs to begin to live. It is to end\nAn old, stale, weary work, and to commence\nA newer and a better. \u2019Tis to leave\nDeceitful knaves for the society\nOf gods and goodness. Thou thyself must part\nAt last from all thy garlands, pleasures, triumphs,\nAnd prove thy fortitude what then \u2019t will do.\n_Valerius_. But art not grieved nor vexed to leave thy life thus?\n_Sophocles_. Why should I grieve or vex for being sent\nTo them I ever loved best? Now I\u2019ll kneel,\nBut with my back toward thee; \u2019tis the last duty\nThis trunk can do the gods.\n_Martius_. Strike, strike, Valerius,\nOr Martius\u2019 heart will leap out at his mouth.\nThis is a man, a woman. Kiss thy lord,\nAnd live with all the freedom you were wont.\nO love! thou doubly hast afflicted me\nWith virtue and with beauty. Treacherous heart,\nMy hand shall cast thee quick into my urn,\nEre thou transgress this knot of piety.\n_Valerius_. What ails my brother?\n_Sophocles_. Martius, O Martius,\nThou now hast found a way to conquer me.\n_Dorigen_. O star of Rome! what gratitude can speak\nFit words to follow such a deed as this?\n_Martius_. This admirable duke, Valerius,\nWith his disdain of fortune and of death,\nCaptived himself, has captivated me,\nAnd though my arm hath ta\u2019en his body here,\nHis soul hath subjugated Martius\u2019 soul.\nBy Romulus, he is all soul, I think;\nHe hath no flesh, and spirit cannot be gyved;\nThen we have vanquished nothing; he is free,\nAnd Martius walks now in captivity.\nI do not readily remember any poem, play, sermon, novel, or oration\nthat our press vents in the last few years, which goes to the same\ntune. We have a great many flutes and flageolets, but not often the\nsound of any fife. Yet, Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cLaodamia,\u201d and the ode of \u201cDion,\u201d\nand some sonnets, have a certain noble music; and Scott will sometimes\ndraw a stroke like the portrait of Lord Evandale given by Balfour of\nBurley. Thomas Carlyle, with his natural taste for what is manly and\ndaring in character, has suffered no heroic trait in his favorites to\ndrop from his biographical and historical pictures. Earlier, Robert\nBurns has given us a song or two. In the Harleian Miscellanies there is\nan account of the battle of Lutzen which deserves to be read. And Simon\nOckley\u2019s History of the Saracens recounts the prodigies of individual\nvalor, with admiration all the more evident on the part of the narrator\nthat he seems to think that his place in Christian Oxford requires of\nhim some proper protestations of abhorrence. But if we explore the\nliterature of Heroism we shall quickly come to Plutarch, who is its\nDoctor and historian. To him we owe the Brasidas, the Dion, the\nEpaminondas, the Scipio of old, and I must think we are more deeply\nindebted to him than to all the ancient writers. Each of his \u201cLives\u201d is\na refutation to the despondency and cowardice of our religious and\npolitical theorists. A wild courage, a Stoicism not of the schools but\nof the blood, shines in every anecdote, and has given that book its\nimmense fame.\nWe need books of this tart cathartic virtue more than books of\npolitical science or of private economy. Life is a festival only to the\nwise. Seen from the nook and chimney-side of prudence, it wears a\nragged and dangerous front. The violations of the laws of nature by our\npredecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us also. The\ndisease and deformity around us certify the infraction of natural,\nintellectual, and moral laws, and often violation on violation to breed\nsuch compound misery. A lock-jaw that bends a man\u2019s head back to his\nheels; hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes; insanity\nthat makes him eat grass; war, plague, cholera, famine, indicate a\ncertain ferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime,\nmust have its outlet by human suffering. Unhappily no man exists who\nhas not in his own person become to some amount a stockholder in the\nsin, and so made himself liable to a share in the expiation.\nOur culture therefore must not omit the arming of the man. Let him hear\nin season that he is born into the state of war, and that the\ncommonwealth and his own well-being require that he should not go\ndancing in the weeds of peace, but warned, self-collected and neither\ndefying nor dreading the thunder, let him take both reputation and life\nin his hand, and, with perfect urbanity dare the gibbet and the mob by\nthe absolute truth of his speech and the rectitude of his behavior.\nTowards all this external evil the man within the breast assumes a\nwarlike attitude, and affirms his ability to cope single-handed with\nthe infinite army of enemies. To this military attitude of the soul we\ngive the name of Heroism. Its rudest form is the contempt for safety\nand ease, which makes the attractiveness of war. It is a self-trust\nwhich slights the restraints of prudence, in the plenitude of its\nenergy and power to repair the harms it may suffer. The hero is a mind\nof such balance that no disturbances can shake his will, but pleasantly\nand as it were merrily he advances to his own music, alike in frightful\nalarms and in the tipsy mirth of universal dissoluteness. There is\nsomewhat not philosophical in heroism; there is somewhat not holy in\nit; it seems not to know that other souls are of one texture with it;\nit has pride; it is the extreme of individual nature. Nevertheless we\nmust profoundly revere it. There is somewhat in great actions which\ndoes not allow us to go behind them. Heroism feels and never reasons,\nand therefore is always right; and although a different breeding,\ndifferent religion and greater intellectual activity would have\nmodified or even reversed the particular action, yet for the hero that\nthing he does is the highest deed, and is not open to the censure of\nphilosophers or divines. It is the avowal of the unschooled man that he\nfinds a quality in him that is negligent of expense, of health, of\nlife, of danger, of hatred, of reproach, and knows that his will is\nhigher and more excellent than all actual and all possible antagonists.\nHeroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in\ncontradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism\nis an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual\u2019s character. Now\nto no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every man\nmust be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than\nany one else. Therefore just and wise men take umbrage at his act,\nuntil after some little time be past: then they see it to be in unison\nwith their acts. All prudent men see that the action is clean contrary\nto a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its\ncontempt of some external good. But it finds its own success at last,\nand then the prudent also extol.\nSelf-trust is the essence of heroism. It is the state of the soul at\nwar, and its ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and\nwrong, and the power to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents.\nIt speaks the truth and it is just, generous, hospitable, temperate,\nscornful of petty calculations and scornful of being scorned. It\npersists; it is of an undaunted boldness and of a fortitude not to be\nwearied out. Its jest is the littleness of common life. That false\nprudence which dotes on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of\nheroism. Heroism, like Plotinus, is almost ashamed of its body. What\nshall it say then to the sugar-plums and cats\u2019-cradles, to the toilet,\ncompliments, quarrels, cards and custard, which rack the wit of all\nsociety? What joys has kind nature provided for us dear creatures!\nThere seems to be no interval between greatness and meanness. When the\nspirit is not master of the world, then it is its dupe. Yet the little\nman takes the great hoax so innocently, works in it so headlong and\nbelieving, is born red, and dies gray, arranging his toilet, attending\non his own health, laying traps for sweet food and strong wine, setting\nhis heart on a horse or a rifle, made happy with a little gossip or a\nlittle praise, that the great soul cannot choose but laugh at such\nearnest nonsense. \u201cIndeed, these humble considerations make me out of\nlove with greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to take note how many\npairs of silk stockings thou hast, namely, these and those that were\nthe peach-colored ones; or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one\nfor superfluity, and one other for use!\u201d\nCitizens, thinking after the laws of arithmetic, consider the\ninconvenience of receiving strangers at their fireside, reckon narrowly\nthe loss of time and the unusual display; the soul of a better quality\nthrusts back the unseasonable economy into the vaults of life, and\nsays, I will obey the God, and the sacrifice and the fire he will\nprovide. Ibn Hankal, the Arabian geographer, describes a heroic extreme\nin the hospitality of Sogd, in Bukharia. \u201cWhen I was in Sogd I saw a\ngreat building, like a palace, the gates of which were open and fixed\nback to the wall with large nails. I asked the reason, and was told\nthat the house had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred years.\nStrangers may present themselves at any hour and in whatever number;\nthe master has amply provided for the reception of the men and their\nanimals, and is never happier than when they tarry for some time.\nNothing of the kind have I seen in any other country.\u201d The magnanimous\nknow very well that they who give time, or money, or shelter, to the\nstranger,\u2014so it be done for love and not for ostentation,\u2014do, as it\nwere, put God under obligation to them, so perfect are the\ncompensations of the universe. In some way the time they seem to lose\nis redeemed and the pains they seem to take remunerate themselves.\nThese men fan the flame of human love and raise the standard of civil\nvirtue among mankind. But hospitality must be for service and not for\nshow, or it pulls down the host. The brave soul rates itself too high\nto value itself by the splendor of its table and draperies. It gives\nwhat it hath, and all it hath, but its own majesty can lend a better\ngrace to bannocks and fair water than belong to city feasts.\nThe temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no\ndishonor to the worthiness he has. But he loves it for its elegancy,\nnot for its austerity. It seems not worth his while to be solemn and\ndenounce with bitterness flesh-eating or wine-drinking, the use of\ntobacco, or opium, or tea, or silk, or gold. A great man scarcely knows\nhow he dines, how he dresses; but without railing or precision his\nliving is natural and poetic. John Eliot, the Indian Apostle, drank\nwater, and said of wine,\u2014\u201cIt is a noble, generous liquor and we should\nbe humbly thankful for it, but, as I remember, water was made before\nit.\u201d Better still is the temperance of King David, who poured out on\nthe ground unto the Lord the water which three of his warriors had\nbrought him to drink, at the peril of their lives.\nIt is told of Brutus, that when he fell on his sword after the battle\nof Philippi, he quoted a line of Euripides,\u2014\u201cO Virtue! I have followed\nthee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade.\u201d I doubt not\nthe hero is slandered by this report. The heroic soul does not sell its\njustice and its nobleness. It does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep\nwarm. The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough.\nPoverty is its ornament. It does not need plenty, and can very well\nabide its loss.\nBut that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class, is the\ngood-humor and hilarity they exhibit. It is a height to which common\nduty can very well attain, to suffer and to dare with solemnity. But\nthese rare souls set opinion, success, and life at so cheap a rate that\nthey will not soothe their enemies by petitions, or the show of sorrow,\nbut wear their own habitual greatness. Scipio, charged with peculation,\nrefuses to do himself so great a disgrace as to wait for justification,\nthough he had the scroll of his accounts in his hands, but tears it to\npieces before the tribunes. Socrates\u2019s condemnation of himself to be\nmaintained in all honor in the Prytaneum, during his life, and Sir\nThomas More\u2019s playfulness at the scaffold, are of the same strain. In\nBeaumont and Fletcher\u2019s \u201cSea Voyage,\u201d Juletta tells the stout captain\nand his company,\u2014\n_Juletta_. Why, slaves, \u2019tis in our power to hang ye.\n_Master_. Very likely,\n\u2019Tis in our powers, then, to be hanged, and scorn ye.\nThese replies are sound and whole. Sport is the bloom and glow of a\nperfect health. The great will not condescend to take any thing\nseriously; all must be as gay as the song of a canary, though it were\nthe building of cities or the eradication of old and foolish churches\nand nations which have cumbered the earth long thousands of years.\nSimple hearts put all the history and customs of this world behind\nthem, and play their own game in innocent defiance of the Blue-Laws of\nthe world; and such would appear, could we see the human race assembled\nin vision, like little children frolicking together, though to the eyes\nof mankind at large they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and\ninfluences.\nThe interest these fine stories have for us, the power of a romance\nover the boy who grasps the forbidden book under his bench at school,\nour delight in the hero, is the main fact to our purpose. All these\ngreat and transcendent properties are ours. If we dilate in beholding\nthe Greek energy, the Roman pride, it is that we are already\ndomesticating the same sentiment. Let us find room for this great guest\nin our small houses. The first step of worthiness will be to disabuse\nus of our superstitious associations with places and times, with number\nand size. Why should these words, Athenian, Roman, Asia and England, so\ntingle in the ear? Where the heart is, there the muses, there the gods\nsojourn, and not in any geography of fame. Massachusetts, Connecticut\nRiver and Boston Bay you think paltry places, and the ear loves names\nof foreign and classic topography. But here we are; and, if we will\ntarry a little, we may come to learn that here is best. See to it only\nthat thyself is here, and art and nature, hope and fate, friends,\nangels and the Supreme Being shall not be absent from the chamber where\nthou sittest. Epaminondas, brave and affectionate, does not seem to us\nto need Olympus to die upon, nor the Syrian sunshine. He lies very well\nwhere he is. The Jerseys were handsome ground enough for Washington to\ntread, and London streets for the feet of Milton. A great man makes his\nclimate genial in the imagination of men, and its air the beloved\nelement of all delicate spirits. That country is the fairest which is\ninhabited by the noblest minds. The pictures which fill the imagination\nin reading the actions of Pericles, Xenophon, Columbus, Bayard, Sidney,\nHampden, teach us how needlessly mean our life is; that we, by the\ndepth of our living, should deck it with more than regal or national\nsplendor, and act on principles that should interest man and nature in\nthe length of our days.\nWe have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men who never\nripened, or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary.\nWhen we see their air and mien, when we hear them speak of society, of\nbooks, of religion, we admire their superiority; they seem to throw\ncontempt on our entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone of a\nyouthful giant who is sent to work revolutions. But they enter an\nactive profession and the forming Colossus shrinks to the common size\nof man. The magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always make\nthe Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the moment\nthey put their horses of the sun to plough in its furrow. They found no\nexample and no companion, and their heart fainted. What then? The\nlesson they gave in their first aspirations is yet true; and a better\nvalor and a purer truth shall one day organize their belief. Or why\nshould a woman liken herself to any historical woman, and think,\nbecause Sappho, or S\u00e9vign\u00e9, or De Sta\u00ebl, or the cloistered souls who\nhave had genius and cultivation do not satisfy the imagination and the\nserene Themis, none can,\u2014certainly not she? Why not? She has a new and\nunattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest nature\nthat ever bloomed. Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on\nher way, accept the hint of each new experience, search in turn all the\nobjects that solicit her eye, that she may learn the power and the\ncharm of her new-born being, which is the kindling of a new dawn in the\nrecesses of space. The fair girl who repels interference by a decided\nand proud choice of influences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and\nlofty, inspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness. The\nsilent heart encourages her; O friend, never strike sail to a fear!\nCome into port greatly, or sail with God the seas. Not in vain you\nlive, for every passing eye is cheered and refined by the vision.\nThe characteristic of heroism is its persistency. All men have\nwandering impulses, fits and starts of generosity. But when you have\nchosen your part, abide by it, and do not weakly try to reconcile\nyourself with the world. The heroic cannot be the common, nor the\ncommon the heroic. Yet we have the weakness to expect the sympathy of\npeople in those actions whose excellence is that they outrun sympathy\nand appeal to a tardy justice. If you would serve your brother, because\nit is fit for you to serve him, do not take back your words when you\nfind that prudent people do not commend you. Adhere to your own act,\nand congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and\nextravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age. It was a high\ncounsel that I once heard given to a young person,\u2014\u201cAlways do what you\nare afraid to do.\u201d A simple manly character need never make an apology,\nbut should regard its past action with the calmness of Phocion, when he\nadmitted that the event of the battle was happy, yet did not regret his\ndissuasion from the battle.\nThere is no weakness or exposure for which we cannot find consolation\nin the thought\u2014this is a part of my constitution, part of my relation\nand office to my fellow-creature. Has nature covenanted with me that I\nshould never appear to disadvantage, never make a ridiculous figure?\nLet us be generous of our dignity as well as of our money. Greatness\nonce and for ever has done with opinion. We tell our charities, not\nbecause we wish to be praised for them, not because we think they have\ngreat merit, but for our justification. It is a capital blunder; as you\ndiscover when another man recites his charities.\nTo speak the truth, even with some austerity, to live with some rigor\nof temperance, or some extremes of generosity, seems to be an\nasceticism which common good-nature would appoint to those who are at\nease and in plenty, in sign that they feel a brotherhood with the great\nmultitude of suffering men. And not only need we breathe and exercise\nthe soul by assuming the penalties of abstinence, of debt, of solitude,\nof unpopularity,\u2014but it behooves the wise man to look with a bold eye\ninto those rarer dangers which sometimes invade men, and to familiarize\nhimself with disgusting forms of disease, with sounds of execration,\nand the vision of violent death.\nTimes of heroism are generally times of terror, but the day never\nshines in which this element may not work. The circumstances of man, we\nsay, are historically somewhat better in this country and at this hour\nthan perhaps ever before. More freedom exists for culture. It will not\nnow run against an axe at the first step out of the beaten track of\nopinion. But whoso is heroic will always find crises to try his edge.\nHuman virtue demands her champions and martyrs, and the trial of\npersecution always proceeds. It is but the other day that the brave\nLovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free\nspeech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live.\nI see not any road of perfect peace which a man can walk, but after the\ncounsel of his own bosom. Let him quit too much association, let him go\nhome much, and stablish himself in those courses he approves. The\nunremitting retention of simple and high sentiments in obscure duties\nis hardening the character to that temper which will work with honor,\nif need be in the tumult, or on the scaffold. Whatever outrages have\nhappened to men may befall a man again; and very easily in a republic,\nif there appear any signs of a decay of religion. Coarse slander, fire,\ntar and feathers and the gibbet, the youth may freely bring home to his\nmind and with what sweetness of temper he can, and inquire how fast he\ncan fix his sense of duty, braving such penalties, whenever it may\nplease the next newspaper and a sufficient number of his neighbors to\npronounce his opinions incendiary.\nIt may calm the apprehension of calamity in the most susceptible heart\nto see how quick a bound Nature has set to the utmost infliction of\nmalice. We rapidly approach a brink over which no enemy can follow us:\u2014\n\u201cLet them rave:\nThou art quiet in thy grave.\u201d\nIn the gloom of our ignorance of what shall be, in the hour when we are\ndeaf to the higher voices, who does not envy those who have seen safely\nto an end their manful endeavor? Who that sees the meanness of our\npolitics but inly congratulates Washington that he is long already\nwrapped in his shroud, and for ever safe; that he was laid sweet in his\ngrave, the hope of humanity not yet subjugated in him? Who does not\nsometimes envy the good and brave who are no more to suffer from the\ntumults of the natural world, and await with curious complacency the\nspeedy term of his own conversation with finite nature? And yet the\nlove that will be annihilated sooner than treacherous has already made\ndeath impossible, and affirms itself no mortal but a native of the\ndeeps of absolute and inextinguishable being.\nIX.\nTHE OVER-SOUL\n\u201cBut souls that of his own good life partake,\nHe loves as his own self; dear as his eye\nThey are to Him: He\u2019ll never them forsake:\nWhen they shall die, then God himself shall die:\nThey live, they live in blest eternity.\u201d\n_Henry More_.\nSpace is ample, east and west,\nBut two cannot go abreast,\nCannot travel in it two:\nYonder masterful cuckoo\nCrowds every egg out of the nest,\nQuick or dead, except its own;\nA spell is laid on sod and stone,\nNight and Day \u2019ve been tampered with,\nEvery quality and pith\nSurcharged and sultry with a power\nThat works its will on age and hour.\nTHE OVER-SOUL\nThere is a difference between one and another hour of life in their\nauthority and subsequent effect. Our faith comes in moments; our vice\nis habitual. Yet there is a depth in those brief moments which\nconstrains us to ascribe more reality to them than to all other\nexperiences. For this reason the argument which is always forthcoming\nto silence those who conceive extraordinary hopes of man, namely the\nappeal to experience, is for ever invalid and vain. We give up the past\nto the objector, and yet we hope. He must explain this hope. We grant\nthat human life is mean, but how did we find out that it was mean? What\nis the ground of this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent? What\nis the universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by\nwhich the soul makes its enormous claim? Why do men feel that the\nnatural history of man has never been written, but he is always leaving\nbehind what you have said of him, and it becomes old, and books of\nmetaphysics worthless? The philosophy of six thousand years has not\nsearched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its experiments\nthere has always remained, in the last analysis, a residuum it could\nnot resolve. Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is\ndescending into us from we know not whence. The most exact calculator\nhas no prescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next\nmoment. I am constrained every moment to acknowledge a higher origin\nfor events than the will I call mine.\nAs with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch that flowing\nriver, which, out of regions I see not, pours for a season its streams\ninto me, I see that I am a pensioner; not a cause, but a surprised\nspectator of this ethereal water; that I desire and look up and put\nmyself in the attitude of reception, but from some alien energy the\nvisions come.\nThe Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the present, and the\nonly prophet of that which must be, is that great nature in which we\nrest as the earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity,\nthat Over-soul, within which every man\u2019s particular being is contained\nand made one with all other; that common heart of which all sincere\nconversation is the worship, to which all right action is submission;\nthat overpowering reality which confutes our tricks and talents, and\nconstrains every one to pass for what he is, and to speak from his\ncharacter and not from his tongue, and which evermore tends to pass\ninto our thought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power and\nbeauty. We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles.\nMeantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the\nuniversal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related;\nthe eternal ONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose\nbeatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and\nperfect in every hour, but the act of seeing and the thing seen, the\nseer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one. We see the\nworld piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but\nthe whole, of which these are the shining parts, is the soul. Only by\nthe vision of that Wisdom can the horoscope of the ages be read, and by\nfalling back on our better thoughts, by yielding to the spirit of\nprophecy which is innate in every man, we can know what it saith. Every\nman\u2019s words who speaks from that life must sound vain to those who do\nnot dwell in the same thought on their own part. I dare not speak for\nit. My words do not carry its august sense; they fall short and cold.\nOnly itself can inspire whom it will, and behold! their speech shall be\nlyrical, and sweet, and universal as the rising of the wind. Yet I\ndesire, even by profane words, if I may not use sacred, to indicate the\nheaven of this deity and to report what hints I have collected of the\ntranscendent simplicity and energy of the Highest Law.\nIf we consider what happens in conversation, in reveries, in remorse,\nin times of passion, in surprises, in the instructions of dreams,\nwherein often we see ourselves in masquerade,\u2014the droll disguises only\nmagnifying and enhancing a real element and forcing it on our distinct\nnotice,\u2014we shall catch many hints that will broaden and lighten into\nknowledge of the secret of nature. All goes to show that the soul in\nman is not an organ, but animates and exercises all the organs; is not\na function, like the power of memory, of calculation, of comparison,\nbut uses these as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but a light; is not\nthe intellect or the will, but the master of the intellect and the\nwill; is the background of our being, in which they lie,\u2014an immensity\nnot possessed and that cannot be possessed. From within or from behind,\na light shines through us upon things and makes us aware that we are\nnothing, but the light is all. A man is the facade of a temple wherein\nall wisdom and all good abide. What we commonly call man, the eating,\ndrinking, planting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent\nhimself, but misrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the\nsoul, whose organ he is, would he let it appear through his action,\nwould make our knees bend. When it breathes through his intellect, it\nis genius; when it breathes through his will, it is virtue; when it\nflows through his affection, it is love. And the blindness of the\nintellect begins when it would be something of itself. The weakness of\nthe will begins when the individual would be something of himself. All\nreform aims in some one particular to let the soul have its way through\nus; in other words, to engage us to obey.\nOf this pure nature every man is at some time sensible. Language cannot\npaint it with his colors. It is too subtile. It is undefinable,\nunmeasurable; but we know that it pervades and contains us. We know\nthat all spiritual being is in man. A wise old proverb says, \u201cGod comes\nto see us without bell;\u201d that is, as there is no screen or ceiling\nbetween our heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall\nin the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins.\nThe walls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps of\nspiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we see and know,\nLove, Freedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they\ntower over us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to\nwound them.\nThe sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made known by its\nindependency of those limitations which circumscribe us on every hand.\nThe soul circumscribes all things. As I have said, it contradicts all\nexperience. In like manner it abolishes time and space. The influence\nof the senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that degree that\nthe walls of time and space have come to look real and insurmountable;\nand to speak with levity of these limits is, in the world, the sign of\ninsanity. Yet time and space are but inverse measures of the force of\nthe soul. The spirit sports with time,\u2014\n\u201cCan crowd eternity into an hour,\nOr stretch an hour to eternity.\u201d\nWe are often made to feel that there is another youth and age than that\nwhich is measured from the year of our natural birth. Some thoughts\nalways find us young, and keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the\nuniversal and eternal beauty. Every man parts from that contemplation\nwith the feeling that it rather belongs to ages than to mortal life.\nThe least activity of the intellectual powers redeems us in a degree\nfrom the conditions of time. In sickness, in languor, give us a strain\nof poetry or a profound sentence, and we are refreshed; or produce a\nvolume of Plato or Shakspeare, or remind us of their names, and\ninstantly we come into a feeling of longevity. See how the deep divine\nthought reduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself present\nthrough all ages. Is the teaching of Christ less effective now than it\nwas when first his mouth was opened? The emphasis of facts and persons\nin my thought has nothing to do with time. And so always the soul\u2019s\nscale is one, the scale of the senses and the understanding is another.\nBefore the revelations of the soul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away.\nIn common speech we refer all things to time, as we habitually refer\nthe immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere. And so we say that\nthe Judgment is distant or near, that the Millennium approaches, that a\nday of certain political, moral, social reforms is at hand, and the\nlike, when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we\ncontemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is permanent and\nconnate with the soul. The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by\none, detach themselves like ripe fruit from our experience, and fall.\nThe wind shall blow them none knows whither. The landscape, the\nfigures, Boston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution past,\nor any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society, and so is the world.\nThe soul looketh steadily forwards, creating a world before her,\nleaving worlds behind her. She has no dates, nor rites, nor persons,\nnor specialties nor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of\nevents is the flowing robe in which she is clothed.\nAfter its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of its progress to\nbe computed. The soul\u2019s advances are not made by gradation, such as can\nbe represented by motion in a straight line, but rather by ascension of\nstate, such as can be represented by metamorphosis,\u2014from the egg to the\nworm, from the worm to the fly. The growths of genius are of a certain\n_total_ character, that does not advance the elect individual first\nover John, then Adam, then Richard, and give to each the pain of\ndiscovered inferiority,\u2014but by every throe of growth the man expands\nthere where he works, passing, at each pulsation, classes, populations,\nof men. With each divine impulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the\nvisible and finite, and comes out into eternity, and inspires and\nexpires its air. It converses with truths that have always been spoken\nin the world, and becomes conscious of a closer sympathy with Zeno and\nArrian than with persons in the house.\nThis is the law of moral and of mental gain. The simple rise as by\nspecific levity not into a particular virtue, but into the region of\nall the virtues. They are in the spirit which contains them all. The\nsoul requires purity, but purity is not it; requires justice, but\njustice is not that; requires beneficence, but is somewhat better; so\nthat there is a kind of descent and accommodation felt when we leave\nspeaking of moral nature to urge a virtue which it enjoins. To the\nwell-born child all the virtues are natural, and not painfully\nacquired. Speak to his heart, and the man becomes suddenly virtuous.\nWithin the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual growth, which\nobeys the same law. Those who are capable of humility, of justice, of\nlove, of aspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the\nsciences and arts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso\ndwells in this moral beatitude already anticipates those special powers\nwhich men prize so highly. The lover has no talent, no skill, which\npasses for quite nothing with his enamoured maiden, however little she\nmay possess of related faculty; and the heart which abandons itself to\nthe Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works, and will travel\na royal road to particular knowledges and powers. In ascending to this\nprimary and aboriginal sentiment we have come from our remote station\non the circumference instantaneously to the centre of the world, where,\nas in the closet of God, we see causes, and anticipate the universe,\nwhich is but a slow effect.\nOne mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of the spirit in a\nform,\u2014in forms, like my own. I live in society, with persons who answer\nto thoughts in my own mind, or express a certain obedience to the great\ninstincts to which I live. I see its presence to them. I am certified\nof a common nature; and these other souls, these separated selves, draw\nme as nothing else can. They stir in me the new emotions we call\npassion; of love, hatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come\nconversation, competition, persuasion, cities and war. Persons are\nsupplementary to the primary teaching of the soul. In youth we are mad\nfor persons. Childhood and youth see all the world in them. But the\nlarger experience of man discovers the identical nature appearing\nthrough them all. Persons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal.\nIn all conversation between two persons tacit reference is made, as to\na third party, to a common nature. That third party or common nature is\nnot social; it is impersonal; is God. And so in groups where debate is\nearnest, and especially on high questions, the company become aware\nthat the thought rises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all have a\nspiritual property in what was said, as well as the sayer. They all\nbecome wiser than they were. It arches over them like a temple, this\nunity of thought in which every heart beats with nobler sense of power\nand duty, and thinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are conscious\nof attaining to a higher self-possession. It shines for all. There is a\ncertain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the\nlowest, and which our ordinary education often labors to silence and\nobstruct. The mind is one, and the best minds, who love truth for its\nown sake, think much less of property in truth. They accept it\nthankfully everywhere, and do not label or stamp it with any man\u2019s\nname, for it is theirs long beforehand, and from eternity. The learned\nand the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom. Their violence\nof direction in some degree disqualifies them to think truly. We owe\nmany valuable observations to people who are not very acute or\nprofound, and who say the thing without effort which we want and have\nlong been hunting in vain. The action of the soul is oftener in that\nwhich is felt and left unsaid than in that which is said in any\nconversation. It broods over every society, and they unconsciously seek\nfor it in each other. We know better than we do. We do not yet possess\nourselves, and we know at the same time that we are much more. I feel\nthe same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my neighbors,\nthat somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this by-play, and Jove\nnods to Jove from behind each of us.\nMen descend to meet. In their habitual and mean service to the world,\nfor which they forsake their native nobleness, they resemble those\nArabian sheiks who dwell in mean houses and affect an external poverty,\nto escape the rapacity of the Pacha, and reserve all their display of\nwealth for their interior and guarded retirements.\nAs it is present in all persons, so it is in every period of life. It\nis adult already in the infant man. In my dealing with my child, my\nLatin and Greek, my accomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but\nas much soul as I have avails. If I am wilful, he sets his will against\nmine, one for one, and leaves me, if I please, the degradation of\nbeating him by my superiority of strength. But if I renounce my will\nand act for the soul, setting that up as umpire between us two, out of\nhis young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves with me.\nThe soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when we\nsee it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose. Foolish people\nask you, when you have spoken what they do not wish to hear, \u2018How do\nyou know it is truth, and not an error of your own?\u2019 We know truth when\nwe see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are\nawake. It was a grand sentence of Emanuel Swedenborg, which would alone\nindicate the greatness of that man\u2019s perception,\u2014\u201cIt is no proof of a\nman\u2019s understanding to be able to confirm whatever he pleases; but to\nbe able to discern that what is true is true, and that what is false is\nfalse,\u2014this is the mark and character of intelligence.\u201d In the book I\nread, the good thought returns to me, as every truth will, the image of\nthe whole soul. To the bad thought which I find in it, the same soul\nbecomes a discerning, separating sword, and lops it away. We are wiser\nthan we know. If we will not interfere with our thought, but will act\nentirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we know the particular\nthing, and every thing, and every man. For the Maker of all things and\nall persons stands behind us and casts his dread omniscience through us\nover things.\nBut beyond this recognition of its own in particular passages of the\nindividual\u2019s experience, it also reveals truth. And here we should seek\nto reinforce ourselves by its very presence, and to speak with a\nworthier, loftier strain of that advent. For the soul\u2019s communication\nof truth is the highest event in nature, since it then does not give\nsomewhat from itself, but it gives itself, or passes into and becomes\nthat man whom it enlightens; or, in proportion to that truth he\nreceives, it takes him to itself.\nWe distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its\nown nature, by the term _Revelation_. These are always attended by the\nemotion of the sublime. For this communication is an influx of the\nDivine mind into our mind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet\nbefore the flowing surges of the sea of life. Every distinct\napprehension of this central commandment agitates men with awe and\ndelight. A thrill passes through all men at the reception of new truth,\nor at the performance of a great action, which comes out of the heart\nof nature. In these communications the power to see is not separated\nfrom the will to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and the\nobedience proceeds from a joyful perception. Every moment when the\nindividual feels himself invaded by it is memorable. By the necessity\nof our constitution a certain enthusiasm attends the individual\u2019s\nconsciousness of that divine presence. The character and duration of\nthis enthusiasm varies with the state of the individual, from an\necstasy and trance and prophetic inspiration,\u2014which is its rarer\nappearance,\u2014to the faintest glow of virtuous emotion, in which form it\nwarms, like our household fires, all the families and associations of\nmen, and makes society possible. A certain tendency to insanity has\nalways attended the opening of the religious sense in men, as if they\nhad been \u201cblasted with excess of light.\u201d The trances of Socrates, the\n\u201cunion\u201d of Plotinus, the vision of Porphyry, the conversion of Paul,\nthe aurora of Behmen, the convulsions of George Fox and his Quakers,\nthe illumination of Swedenborg, are of this kind. What was in the case\nof these remarkable persons a ravishment, has, in innumerable instances\nin common life, been exhibited in less striking manner. Everywhere the\nhistory of religion betrays a tendency to enthusiasm. The rapture of\nthe Moravian and Quietist; the opening of the internal sense of the\nWord, in the language of the New Jerusalem Church; the _revival_ of the\nCalvinistic churches; the _experiences_ of the Methodists, are varying\nforms of that shudder of awe and delight with which the individual soul\nalways mingles with the universal soul.\nThe nature of these revelations is the same; they are perceptions of\nthe absolute law. They are solutions of the soul\u2019s own questions. They\ndo not answer the questions which the understanding asks. The soul\nanswers never by words, but by the thing itself that is inquired after.\nRevelation is the disclosure of the soul. The popular notion of a\nrevelation is that it is a telling of fortunes. In past oracles of the\nsoul the understanding seeks to find answers to sensual questions, and\nundertakes to tell from God how long men shall exist, what their hands\nshall do and who shall be their company, adding names and dates and\nplaces. But we must pick no locks. We must check this low curiosity. An\nanswer in words is delusive; it is really no answer to the questions\nyou ask. Do not require a description of the countries towards which\nyou sail. The description does not describe them to you, and to-morrow\nyou arrive there and know them by inhabiting them. Men ask concerning\nthe immortality of the soul, the employments of heaven, the state of\nthe sinner, and so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left replies\nto precisely these interrogatories. Never a moment did that sublime\nspirit speak in their _patois_. To truth, justice, love, the attributes\nof the soul, the idea of immutableness is essentially associated.\nJesus, living in these moral sentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes,\nheeding only the manifestations of these, never made the separation of\nthe idea of duration from the essence of these attributes, nor uttered\na syllable concerning the duration of the soul. It was left to his\ndisciples to sever duration from the moral elements, and to teach the\nimmortality of the soul as a doctrine, and maintain it by evidences.\nThe moment the doctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is\nalready fallen. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility,\nthere is no question of continuance. No inspired man ever asks this\nquestion or condescends to these evidences. For the soul is true to\nitself, and the man in whom it is shed abroad cannot wander from the\npresent, which is infinite, to a future which would be finite.\nThese questions which we lust to ask about the future are a confession\nof sin. God has no answer for them. No answer in words can reply to a\nquestion of things. It is not in an arbitrary \u201cdecree of God,\u201d but in\nthe nature of man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow;\nfor the soul will not have us read any other cipher than that of cause\nand effect. By this veil which curtains events it instructs the\nchildren of men to live in to-day. The only mode of obtaining an answer\nto these questions of the senses is to forego all low curiosity, and,\naccepting the tide of being which floats us into the secret of nature,\nwork and live, work and live, and all unawares the advancing soul has\nbuilt and forged for itself a new condition, and the question and the\nanswer are one.\nBy the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which burns until it\nshall dissolve all things into the waves and surges of an ocean of\nlight, we see and know each other, and what spirit each is of. Who can\ntell the grounds of his knowledge of the character of the several\nindividuals in his circle of friends? No man. Yet their acts and words\ndo not disappoint him. In that man, though he knew no ill of him, he\nput no trust. In that other, though they had seldom met, authentic\nsigns had yet passed, to signify that he might be trusted as one who\nhad an interest in his own character. We know each other very\nwell,\u2014which of us has been just to himself and whether that which we\nteach or behold is only an aspiration or is our honest effort also.\nWe are all discerners of spirits. That diagnosis lies aloft in our life\nor unconscious power. The intercourse of society, its trade, its\nreligion, its friendships, its quarrels, is one wide, judicial\ninvestigation of character. In full court, or in small committee, or\nconfronted face to face, accuser and accused, men offer themselves to\nbe judged. Against their will they exhibit those decisive trifles by\nwhich character is read. But who judges? and what? Not our\nunderstanding. We do not read them by learning or craft. No; the wisdom\nof the wise man consists herein, that he does not judge them; he lets\nthem judge themselves and merely reads and records their own verdict.\nBy virtue of this inevitable nature, private will is overpowered, and,\nmaugre our efforts or our imperfections, your genius will speak from\nyou, and mine from me. That which we are, we shall teach, not\nvoluntarily but involuntarily. Thoughts come into our minds by avenues\nwhich we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through\navenues which we never voluntarily opened. Character teaches over our\nhead. The infallible index of true progress is found in the tone the\nman takes. Neither his age, nor his breeding, nor company, nor books,\nnor actions, nor talents, nor all together can hinder him from being\ndeferential to a higher spirit than his own. If he have not found his\nhome in God, his manners, his forms of speech, the turn of his\nsentences, the build, shall I say, of all his opinions will\ninvoluntarily confess it, let him brave it out how he will. If he have\nfound his centre, the Deity will shine through him, through all the\ndisguises of ignorance, of ungenial temperament, of unfavorable\ncircumstance. The tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having is\nanother.\nThe great distinction between teachers sacred or literary,\u2014between\npoets like Herbert, and poets like Pope,\u2014between philosophers like\nSpinoza, Kant and Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley,\nMackintosh and Stewart,\u2014between men of the world who are reckoned\naccomplished talkers, and here and there a fervent mystic, prophesying\nhalf insane under the infinitude of his thought,\u2014is that one class\nspeak _from within_, or from experience, as parties and possessors of\nthe fact; and the other class _from without_, as spectators merely, or\nperhaps as acquainted with the fact on the evidence of third persons.\nIt is of no use to preach to me from without. I can do that too easily\nmyself. Jesus speaks always from within, and in a degree that\ntranscends all others. In that is the miracle. I believe beforehand\nthat it ought so to be. All men stand continually in the expectation of\nthe appearance of such a teacher. But if a man do not speak from within\nthe veil, where the word is one with that it tells of, let him lowly\nconfess it.\nThe same Omniscience flows into the intellect, and makes what we call\ngenius. Much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most\nilluminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and\nare not writers. Among the multitude of scholars and authors, we feel\nno hallowing presence; we are sensible of a knack and skill rather than\nof inspiration; they have a light and know not whence it comes and call\nit their own; their talent is some exaggerated faculty, some overgrown\nmember, so that their strength is a disease. In these instances the\nintellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue, but almost of\nvice; and we feel that a man\u2019s talents stand in the way of his\nadvancement in truth. But genius is religious. It is a larger imbibing\nof the common heart. It is not anomalous, but more like and not less\nlike other men. There is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity which\nis superior to any talents they exercise. The author, the wit, the\npartisan, the fine gentleman, does not take place of the man. Humanity\nshines in Homer, in Chaucer, in Spenser, in Shakspeare, in Milton. They\nare content with truth. They use the positive degree. They seem frigid\nand phlegmatic to those who have been spiced with the frantic passion\nand violent coloring of inferior but popular writers. For they are\npoets by the free course which they allow to the informing soul, which\nthrough their eyes beholds again and blesses the things which it hath\nmade. The soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of its\nworks. The great poet makes us feel our own wealth, and then we think\nless of his compositions. His best communication to our mind is to\nteach us to despise all he has done. Shakspeare carries us to such a\nlofty strain of intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which\nbeggars his own; and we then feel that the splendid works which he has\ncreated, and which in other hours we extol as a sort of self-existent\npoetry, take no stronger hold of real nature than the shadow of a\npassing traveller on the rock. The inspiration which uttered itself in\nHamlet and Lear could utter things as good from day to day for ever.\nWhy then should I make account of Hamlet and Lear, as if we had not the\nsoul from which they fell as syllables from the tongue?\nThis energy does not descend into individual life on any other\ncondition than entire possession. It comes to the lowly and simple; it\ncomes to whomsoever will put off what is foreign and proud; it comes as\ninsight; it comes as serenity and grandeur. When we see those whom it\ninhabits, we are apprised of new degrees of greatness. From that\ninspiration the man comes back with a changed tone. He does not talk\nwith men with an eye to their opinion. He tries them. It requires of us\nto be plain and true. The vain traveller attempts to embellish his life\nby quoting my lord and the prince and the countess, who thus said or\ndid to _him_. The ambitious vulgar show you their spoons and brooches\nand rings, and preserve their cards and compliments. The more\ncultivated, in their account of their own experience, cull out the\npleasing, poetic circumstance,\u2014the visit to Rome, the man of genius\nthey saw, the brilliant friend They know; still further on perhaps the\ngorgeous landscape, the mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they\nenjoyed yesterday,\u2014and so seek to throw a romantic color over their\nlife. But the soul that ascends to worship the great God is plain and\ntrue; has no rose-color, no fine friends, no chivalry, no adventures;\ndoes not want admiration; dwells in the hour that now is, in the\nearnest experience of the common day,\u2014by reason of the present moment\nand the mere trifle having become porous to thought and bibulous of the\nsea of light.\nConverse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature looks like\nword-catching. The simplest utterances are worthiest to be written, yet\nare they so cheap and so things of course, that in the infinite riches\nof the soul it is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or\nbottling a little air in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole\natmosphere are ours. Nothing can pass there, or make you one of the\ncircle, but the casting aside your trappings, and dealing man to man in\nnaked truth, plain confession, and omniscient affirmation.\nSouls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as gods in the earth,\naccepting without any admiration your wit, your bounty, your virtue\neven,\u2014say rather your act of duty, for your virtue they own as their\nproper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal, and the father of\nthe gods. But what rebuke their plain fraternal bearing casts on the\nmutual flattery with which authors solace each other and wound\nthemselves! These flatter not. I do not wonder that these men go to see\nCromwell and Christina and Charles the Second and James the First and\nthe Grand Turk. For they are, in their own elevation, the fellows of\nkings, and must feel the servile tone of conversation in the world.\nThey must always be a godsend to princes, for they confront them, a\nking to a king, without ducking or concession, and give a high nature\nthe refreshment and satisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of\neven companionship and of new ideas. They leave them wiser and superior\nmen. Souls like these make us feel that sincerity is more excellent\nthan flattery. Deal so plainly with man and woman as to constrain the\nutmost sincerity and destroy all hope of trifling with you. It is the\nhighest compliment you can pay. Their \u201chighest praising,\u201d said Milton,\n\u201cis not flattery, and their plainest advice is a kind of praising.\u201d\nIneffable is the union of man and God in every act of the soul. The\nsimplest person who in his integrity worships God, becomes God; yet for\never and ever the influx of this better and universal self is new and\nunsearchable. It inspires awe and astonishment. How dear, how soothing\nto man, arises the idea of God, peopling the lonely place, effacing the\nscars of our mistakes and disappointments! When we have broken our god\nof tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric, then may God fire the\nheart with his presence. It is the doubling of the heart itself, nay,\nthe infinite enlargement of the heart with a power of growth to a new\ninfinity on every side. It inspires in man an infallible trust. He has\nnot the conviction, but the sight, that the best is the true, and may\nin that thought easily dismiss all particular uncertainties and fears,\nand adjourn to the sure revelation of time the solution of his private\nriddles. He is sure that his welfare is dear to the heart of being. In\nthe presence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a reliance so\nuniversal that it sweeps away all cherished hopes and the most stable\nprojects of mortal condition in its flood. He believes that he cannot\nescape from his good. The things that are really for thee gravitate to\nthee. You are running to seek your friend. Let your feet run, but your\nmind need not. If you do not find him, will you not acquiesce that it\nis best you should not find him? for there is a power, which, as it is\nin you, is in him also, and could therefore very well bring you\ntogether, if it were for the best. You are preparing with eagerness to\ngo and render a service to which your talent and your taste invite you,\nthe love of men and the hope of fame. Has it not occurred to you that\nyou have no right to go, unless you are equally willing to be prevented\nfrom going? O, believe, as thou livest, that every sound that is spoken\nover the round world, which thou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on\nthine ear! Every proverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee\nfor aid or comfort, shall surely come home through open or winding\npassages. Every friend whom not thy fantastic will but the great and\ntender heart in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace. And this\nbecause the heart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a wall,\nnot an intersection is there anywhere in nature, but one blood rolls\nuninterruptedly an endless circulation through all men, as the water of\nthe globe is all one sea, and, truly seen, its tide is one.\nLet man then learn the revelation of all nature and all thought to his\nheart; this, namely; that the Highest dwells with him; that the sources\nof nature are in his own mind, if the sentiment of duty is there. But\nif he would know what the great God speaketh, he must \u2018go into his\ncloset and shut the door,\u2019 as Jesus said. God will not make himself\nmanifest to cowards. He must greatly listen to himself, withdrawing\nhimself from all the accents of other men\u2019s devotion. Even their\nprayers are hurtful to him, until he have made his own. Our religion\nvulgarly stands on numbers of believers. Whenever the appeal is\nmade,\u2014no matter how indirectly,\u2014to numbers, proclamation is then and\nthere made that religion is not. He that finds God a sweet enveloping\nthought to him never counts his company. When I sit in that presence,\nwho shall dare to come in? When I rest in perfect humility, when I burn\nwith pure love, what can Calvin or Swedenborg say?\nIt makes no difference whether the appeal is to numbers or to one. The\nfaith that stands on authority is not faith. The reliance on authority\nmeasures the decline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul. The\nposition men have given to Jesus, now for many centuries of history, is\na position of authority. It characterizes themselves. It cannot alter\nthe eternal facts. Great is the soul, and plain. It is no flatterer, it\nis no follower; it never appeals from itself. It believes in itself.\nBefore the immense possibilities of man all mere experience, all past\nbiography, however spotless and sainted, shrinks away. Before that\nheaven which our presentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise any\nform of life we have seen or read of. We not only affirm that we have\nfew great men, but, absolutely speaking, that we have none; that we\nhave no history, no record of any character or mode of living that\nentirely contents us. The saints and demigods whom history worships we\nare constrained to accept with a grain of allowance. Though in our\nlonely hours we draw a new strength out of their memory, yet, pressed\non our attention, as they are by the thoughtless and customary, they\nfatigue and invade. The soul gives itself, alone, original and pure, to\nthe Lonely, Original and Pure, who, on that condition, gladly inhabits,\nleads and speaks through it. Then is it glad, young and nimble. It is\nnot wise, but it sees through all things. It is not called religious,\nbut it is innocent. It calls the light its own, and feels that the\ngrass grows and the stone falls by a law inferior to, and dependent on,\nits nature. Behold, it saith, I am born into the great, the universal\nmind. I, the imperfect, adore my own Perfect. I am somehow receptive of\nthe great soul, and thereby I do Overlook the sun and the stars and\nfeel them to be the fair accidents and effects which change and pass.\nMore and more the surges of everlasting nature enter into me, and I\nbecome public and human in my regards and actions. So come I to live in\nthoughts and act with energies which are immortal. Thus revering the\nsoul, and learning, as the ancient said, that \u201cits beauty is immense,\u201d\nman will come to see that the world is the perennial miracle which the\nsoul worketh, and be less astonished at particular wonders; he will\nlearn that there is no profane history; that all history is sacred;\nthat the universe is represented in an atom, in a moment of time. He\nwill weave no longer a spotted life of shreds and patches, but he will\nlive with a divine unity. He will cease from what is base and frivolous\nin his life and be content with all places and with any service he can\nrender. He will calmly front the morrow in the negligency of that trust\nwhich carries God with it and so hath already the whole future in the\nbottom of the heart.\nX.\nCIRCLES\nNature centres into balls,\nAnd her proud ephemerals,\nFast to surface and outside,\nScan the profile of the sphere;\nKnew they what that signified,\nA new genesis were here.\nCIRCLES\nThe eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second;\nand throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end. It\nis the highest emblem in the cipher of the world. St. Augustine\ndescribed the nature of God as a circle whose centre was everywhere and\nits circumference nowhere. We are all our lifetime reading the copious\nsense of this first of forms. One moral we have already deduced, in\nconsidering the circular or compensatory character of every human\naction. Another analogy we shall now trace, that every action admits of\nbeing outdone. Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around\nevery circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but\nevery end is a beginning; that there is always another dawn risen on\nmid-noon, and under every deep a lower deep opens.\nThis fact, as far as it symbolizes the moral fact of the Unattainable,\nthe flying Perfect, around which the hands of man can never meet, at\nonce the inspirer and the condemner of every success, may conveniently\nserve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every\ndepartment.\nThere are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and volatile.\nPermanence is but a word of degrees. Our globe seen by God is a\ntransparent law, not a mass of facts. The law dissolves the fact and\nholds it fluid. Our culture is the predominance of an idea which draws\nafter it this train of cities and institutions. Let us rise into\nanother idea: they will disappear. The Greek sculpture is all melted\naway, as if it had been statues of ice; here and there a solitary\nfigure or fragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of snow left\nin cold dells and mountain clefts in June and July. For the genius that\ncreated it creates now somewhat else. The Greek letters last a little\nlonger, but are already passing under the same sentence and tumbling\ninto the inevitable pit which the creation of new thought opens for all\nthat is old. The new continents are built out of the ruins of an old\nplanet; the new races fed out of the decomposition of the foregoing.\nNew arts destroy the old. See the investment of capital in aqueducts\nmade useless by hydraulics; fortifications, by gunpowder; roads and\ncanals, by railways; sails, by steam; steam by electricity.\nYou admire this tower of granite, weathering the hurts of so many ages.\nYet a little waving hand built this huge wall, and that which builds is\nbetter than that which is built. The hand that built can topple it down\nmuch faster. Better than the hand and nimbler was the invisible thought\nwhich wrought through it; and thus ever, behind the coarse effect, is a\nfine cause, which, being narrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer\ncause. Every thing looks permanent until its secret is known. A rich\nestate appears to women a firm and lasting fact; to a merchant, one\neasily created out of any materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good\ntillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold mine, or a river, to\na citizen; but to a large farmer, not much more fixed than the state of\nthe crop. Nature looks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a\ncause like all the rest; and when once I comprehend that, will these\nfields stretch so immovably wide, these leaves hang so individually\nconsiderable? Permanence is a word of degrees. Every thing is medial.\nMoons are no more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls.\nThe key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying though he look,\nhe has a helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all his\nfacts are classified. He can only be reformed by showing him a new idea\nwhich commands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving circle,\nwhich, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to\nnew and larger circles, and that without end. The extent to which this\ngeneration of circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on the\nforce or truth of the individual soul. For it is the inert effort of\neach thought, having formed itself into a circular wave of\ncircumstance,\u2014as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a local\nusage, a religious rite,\u2014to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify\nand hem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over\nthat boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep,\nwhich also runs up into a high wave, with attempt again to stop and to\nbind. But the heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and\nnarrowest pulses, it already tends outward with a vast force and to\nimmense and innumerable expansions.\nEvery ultimate fact is only the first of a new series. Every general\nlaw only a particular fact of some more general law presently to\ndisclose itself. There is no outside, no inclosing wall, no\ncircumference to us. The man finishes his story,\u2014how good! how final!\nhow it puts a new face on all things! He fills the sky. Lo! on the\nother side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had\njust pronounced the outline of the sphere. Then already is our first\nspeaker not man, but only a first speaker. His only redress is\nforthwith to draw a circle outside of his antagonist. And so men do by\nthemselves. The result of to-day, which haunts the mind and cannot be\nescaped, will presently be abridged into a word, and the principle that\nseemed to explain nature will itself be included as one example of a\nbolder generalization. In the thought of to-morrow there is a power to\nupheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures of the\nnations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet\ndepicted. Every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a\nsuggestion of that he should be. Men walk as prophecies of the next\nage.\nStep by step we scale this mysterious ladder: the steps are actions;\nthe new prospect is power. Every several result is threatened and\njudged by that which follows. Every one seems to be contradicted by the\nnew; it is only limited by the new. The new statement is always hated\nby the old, and, to those dwelling in the old, comes like an abyss of\nscepticism. But the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are\neffects of one cause; then its innocency and benefit appear, and\npresently, all its energy spent, it pales and dwindles before the\nrevelation of the new hour.\nFear not the new generalization. Does the fact look crass and material,\nthreatening to degrade thy theory of spirit? Resist it not; it goes to\nrefine and raise thy theory of matter just as much.\nThere are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to consciousness. Every man\nsupposes himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth\nin him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, I see not how it can be\notherwise. The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel was never\nopened; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable. That is,\nevery man believes that he has a greater possibility.\nOur moods do not believe in each other. To-day I am full of thoughts\nand can write what I please. I see no reason why I should not have the\nsame thought, the same power of expression, to-morrow. What I write,\nwhilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the world; but\nyesterday I saw a dreary vacuity in this direction in which now I see\nso much; and a month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that\nwrote so many continuous pages. Alas for this infirm faith, this will\nnot strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow! I am God in nature; I am a\nweed by the wall.\nThe continual effort to raise himself above himself, to work a pitch\nabove his last height, betrays itself in a man\u2019s relations. We thirst\nfor approbation, yet cannot forgive the approver. The sweet of nature\nis love; yet, if I have a friend I am tormented by my imperfections.\nThe love of me accuses the other party. If he were high enough to\nslight me, then could I love him, and rise by my affection to new\nheights. A man\u2019s growth is seen in the successive choirs of his\nfriends. For every friend whom he loses for truth, he gains a better. I\nthought as I walked in the woods and mused on my friends, why should I\nplay with them this game of idolatry? I know and see too well, when not\nvoluntarily blind, the speedy limits of persons called high and worthy.\nRich, noble and great they are by the liberality of our speech, but\ntruth is sad. O blessed Spirit, whom I forsake for these, they are not\nthou! Every personal consideration that we allow costs us heavenly\nstate. We sell the thrones of angels for a short and turbulent\npleasure.\nHow often must we learn this lesson? Men cease to interest us when we\nfind their limitations. The only sin is limitation. As soon as you once\ncome up with a man\u2019s limitations, it is all over with him. Has he\ntalents? has he enterprise? has he knowledge? It boots not. Infinitely\nalluring and attractive was he to you yesterday, a great hope, a sea to\nswim in; now, you have found his shores, found it a pond, and you care\nnot if you never see it again.\nEach new step we take in thought reconciles twenty seemingly discordant\nfacts, as expressions of one law. Aristotle and Plato are reckoned the\nrespective heads of two schools. A wise man will see that Aristotle\nplatonizes. By going one step farther back in thought, discordant\nopinions are reconciled by being seen to be two extremes of one\nprinciple, and we can never go so far back as to preclude a still\nhigher vision.\nBeware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. Then all\nthings are at risk. It is as when a conflagration has broken out in a\ngreat city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end. There\nis not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow; there\nis not any literary reputation, not the so-called eternal names of\nfame, that may not be revised and condemned. The very hopes of man, the\nthoughts of his heart, the religion of nations, the manners and morals\nof mankind are all at the mercy of a new generalization. Generalization\nis always a new influx of the divinity into the mind. Hence the thrill\nthat attends it.\nValor consists in the power of self-recovery, so that a man cannot have\nhis flank turned, cannot be out-generalled, but put him where you will,\nhe stands. This can only be by his preferring truth to his past\napprehension of truth, and his alert acceptance of it from whatever\nquarter; the intrepid conviction that his laws, his relations to\nsociety, his Christianity, his world, may at any time be superseded and\ndecease.\nThere are degrees in idealism. We learn first to play with it\nacademically, as the magnet was once a toy. Then we see in the heyday\nof youth and poetry that it may be true, that it is true in gleams and\nfragments. Then its countenance waxes stern and grand, and we see that\nit must be true. It now shows itself ethical and practical. We learn\nthat God is; that he is in me; and that all things are shadows of him.\nThe idealism of Berkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of\nJesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature\nis the rapid efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself. Much\nmore obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time\ndirectly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in\nthe minds of men. The things which are dear to men at this hour are so\non account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon, and\nwhich cause the present order of things, as a tree bears its apples. A\nnew degree of culture would instantly revolutionize the entire system\nof human pursuits.\nConversation is a game of circles. In conversation we pluck up the\n_termini_ which bound the common of silence on every side. The parties\nare not to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under\nthis Pentecost. To-morrow they will have receded from this high-water\nmark. To-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old\npack-saddles. Yet let us enjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our\nwalls. When each new speaker strikes a new light, emancipates us from\nthe oppression of the last speaker, to oppress us with the greatness\nand exclusiveness of his own thought, then yields us to another\nredeemer, we seem to recover our rights, to become men. O, what truths\nprofound and executable only in ages and orbs, are supposed in the\nannouncement of every truth! In common hours, society sits cold and\nstatuesque. We all stand waiting, empty,\u2014knowing, possibly, that we can\nbe full, surrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to us, but\nprose and trivial toys. Then cometh the god and converts the statues\ninto fiery men, and by a flash of his eye burns up the veil which\nshrouded all things, and the meaning of the very furniture, of cup and\nsaucer, of chair and clock and tester, is manifest. The facts which\nloomed so large in the fogs of yesterday,\u2014property, climate, breeding,\npersonal beauty and the like, have strangely changed their proportions.\nAll that we reckoned settled shakes and rattles; and literatures,\ncities, climates, religions, leave their foundations and dance before\nour eyes. And yet here again see the swift circumspection! Good as is\ndiscourse, silence is better, and shames it. The length of the\ndiscourse indicates the distance of thought betwixt the speaker and the\nhearer. If they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no words\nwould be necessary thereon. If at one in all parts, no words would be\nsuffered.\nLiterature is a point outside of our hodiernal circle through which a\nnew one may be described. The use of literature is to afford us a\nplatform whence we may command a view of our present life, a purchase\nby which we may move it. We fill ourselves with ancient learning,\ninstall ourselves the best we can in Greek, in Punic, in Roman houses,\nonly that we may wiselier see French, English and American houses and\nmodes of living. In like manner we see literature best from the midst\nof wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or from a high religion.\nThe field cannot be well seen from within the field. The astronomer\nmust have his diameter of the earth\u2019s orbit as a base to find the\nparallax of any star.\nTherefore we value the poet. All the argument and all the wisdom is not\nin the encyclopaedia, or the treatise on metaphysics, or the Body of\nDivinity, but in the sonnet or the play. In my daily work I incline to\nrepeat my old steps, and do not believe in remedial force, in the power\nof change and reform. But some Petrarch or Ariosto, filled with the new\nwine of his imagination, writes me an ode or a brisk romance, full of\ndaring thought and action. He smites and arouses me with his shrill\ntones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and I open my eye on my own\npossibilities. He claps wings to the sides of all the solid old lumber\nof the world, and I am capable once more of choosing a straight path in\ntheory and practice.\nWe have the same need to command a view of the religion of the world.\nWe can never see Christianity from the catechism:\u2014from the pastures,\nfrom a boat in the pond, from amidst the songs of wood-birds we\npossibly may. Cleansed by the elemental light and wind, steeped in the\nsea of beautiful forms which the field offers us, we may chance to cast\na right glance back upon biography. Christianity is rightly dear to the\nbest of mankind; yet was there never a young philosopher whose breeding\nhad fallen into the Christian church by whom that brave text of Paul\u2019s\nwas not specially prized:\u2014\u201cThen shall also the Son be subject unto Him\nwho put all things under him, that God may be all in all.\u201d Let the\nclaims and virtues of persons be never so great and welcome, the\ninstinct of man presses eagerly onward to the impersonal and\nillimitable, and gladly arms itself against the dogmatism of bigots\nwith this generous word out of the book itself.\nThe natural world may be conceived of as a system of concentric\ncircles, and we now and then detect in nature slight dislocations which\napprise us that this surface on which we now stand is not fixed, but\nsliding. These manifold tenacious qualities, this chemistry and\nvegetation, these metals and animals, which seem to stand there for\ntheir own sake, are means and methods only,\u2014are words of God, and as\nfugitive as other words. Has the naturalist or chemist learned his\ncraft, who has explored the gravity of atoms and the elective\naffinities, who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof this is\nonly a partial or approximate statement, namely that like draws to\nlike, and that the goods which belong to you gravitate to you and need\nnot be pursued with pains and cost? Yet is that statement approximate\nalso, and not final. Omnipresence is a higher fact. Not through subtle\nsubterranean channels need friend and fact be drawn to their\ncounterpart, but, rightly considered, these things proceed from the\neternal generation of the soul. Cause and effect are two sides of one\nfact.\nThe same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues,\nand extinguishes each in the light of a better. The great man will not\nbe prudent in the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much\ndeduction from his grandeur. But it behooves each to see, when he\nsacrifices prudence, to what god he devotes it; if to ease and\npleasure, he had better be prudent still; if to a great trust, he can\nwell spare his mule and panniers who has a winged chariot instead.\nGeoffrey draws on his boots to go through the woods, that his feet may\nbe safer from the bite of snakes; Aaron never thinks of such a peril.\nIn many years neither is harmed by such an accident. Yet it seems to me\nthat with every precaution you take against such an evil you put\nyourself into the power of the evil. I suppose that the highest\nprudence is the lowest prudence. Is this too sudden a rushing from the\ncentre to the verge of our orbit? Think how many times we shall fall\nback into pitiful calculations before we take up our rest in the great\nsentiment, or make the verge of to-day the new centre. Besides, your\nbravest sentiment is familiar to the humblest men. The poor and the low\nhave their way of expressing the last facts of philosophy as well as\nyou. \u201cBlessed be nothing\u201d and \u201cThe worse things are, the better they\nare\u201d are proverbs which express the transcendentalism of common life.\nOne man\u2019s justice is another\u2019s injustice; one man\u2019s beauty another\u2019s\nugliness; one man\u2019s wisdom another\u2019s folly; as one beholds the same\nobjects from a higher point. One man thinks justice consists in paying\ndebts, and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very\nremiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait tediously. But that\nsecond man has his own way of looking at things; asks himself Which\ndebt must I pay first, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor?\nthe debt of money, or the debt of thought to mankind, of genius to\nnature? For you, O broker, there is no other principle but arithmetic.\nFor me, commerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character,\nthe aspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach one duty,\nlike you, from all other duties, and concentrate my forces mechanically\non the payment of moneys. Let me live onward; you shall find that,\nthough slower, the progress of my character will liquidate all these\ndebts without injustice to higher claims. If a man should dedicate\nhimself to the payment of notes, would not this be injustice? Does he\nowe no debt but money? And are all claims on him to be postponed to a\nlandlord\u2019s or a banker\u2019s?\nThere is no virtue which is final; all are initial. The virtues of\nsociety are vices of the saint. The terror of reform is the discovery\nthat we must cast away our virtues, or what we have always esteemed\nsuch, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser vices:\u2014\n\u201cForgive his crimes, forgive his virtues too,\nThose smaller faults, half converts to the right.\u201d\nIt is the highest power of divine moments that they abolish our\ncontritions also. I accuse myself of sloth and unprofitableness day by\nday; but when these waves of God flow into me I no longer reckon lost\ntime. I no longer poorly compute my possible achievement by what\nremains to me of the month or the year; for these moments confer a sort\nof omnipresence and omnipotence which asks nothing of duration, but\nsees that the energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be\ndone, without time.\nAnd thus, O circular philosopher, I hear some reader exclaim, you have\narrived at a fine Pyrrhonism, at an equivalence and indifferency of all\nactions, and would fain teach us that _if we are true_, forsooth, our\ncrimes may be lively stones out of which we shall construct the temple\nof the true God!\nI am not careful to justify myself. I own I am gladdened by seeing the\npredominance of the saccharine principle throughout vegetable nature,\nand not less by beholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of the\nprinciple of good into every chink and hole that selfishness has left\nopen, yea into selfishness and sin itself; so that no evil is pure, nor\nhell itself without its extreme satisfactions. But lest I should\nmislead any when I have my own head and obey my whims, let me remind\nthe reader that I am only an experimenter. Do not set the least value\non what I do, or the least discredit on what I do not, as if I\npretended to settle any thing as true or false. I unsettle all things.\nNo facts are to me sacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an\nendless seeker with no Past at my back.\nYet this incessant movement and progression which all things partake\ncould never become sensible to us but by contrast to some principle of\nfixture or stability in the soul. Whilst the eternal generation of\ncircles proceeds, the eternal generator abides. That central life is\nsomewhat superior to creation, superior to knowledge and thought, and\ncontains all its circles. For ever it labors to create a life and\nthought as Large and excellent as itself, but in vain, for that which\nis made instructs how to make a better.\nThus there is no sleep, no pause, no preservation, but all things\nrenew, germinate and spring. Why should we import rags and relics into\nthe new hour? Nature abhors the old, and old age seems the only\ndisease; all others run into this one. We call it by many names,\u2014fever,\nintemperance, insanity, stupidity and crime; they are all forms of old\nage; they are rest, conservatism, appropriation, inertia; not newness,\nnot the way onward. We grizzle every day. I see no need of it. Whilst\nwe converse with what is above us, we do not grow old, but grow young.\nInfancy, youth, receptive, aspiring, with religious eye looking upward,\ncounts itself nothing and abandons itself to the instruction flowing\nfrom all sides. But the man and woman of seventy assume to know all,\nthey have outlived their hope, they renounce aspiration, accept the\nactual for the necessary and talk down to the young. Let them, then,\nbecome organs of the Holy Ghost; let them be lovers; let them behold\ntruth; and their eyes are uplifted, their wrinkles smoothed, they are\nperfumed again with hope and power. This old age ought not to creep on\na human mind. In nature every moment is new; the past is always\nswallowed and forgotten; the coming only is sacred. Nothing is secure\nbut life, transition, the energizing spirit. No love can be bound by\noath or covenant to secure it against a higher love. No truth so\nsublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts.\nPeople wish to be settled; only as far as they are unsettled is there\nany hope for them.\nLife is a series of surprises. We do not guess to-day the mood, the\npleasure, the power of to-morrow, when we are building up our being. Of\nlower states, of acts of routine and sense, we can tell somewhat; but\nthe masterpieces of God, the total growths and universal movements of\nthe soul, he hideth; they are incalculable. I can know that truth is\ndivine and helpful; but how it shall help me I can have no guess, for\n_so to be_ is the sole inlet of _so to know_. The new position of the\nadvancing man has all the powers of the old, yet has them all new. It\ncarries in its bosom all the energies of the past, yet is itself an\nexhalation of the morning. I cast away in this new moment all my once\nhoarded knowledge, as vacant and vain. Now, for the first time seem I\nto know any thing rightly. The simplest words,\u2014we do not know what they\nmean except when we love and aspire.\nThe difference between talents and character is adroitness to keep the\nold and trodden round, and power and courage to make a new road to new\nand better goals. Character makes an overpowering present; a cheerful,\ndetermined hour, which fortifies all the company by making them see\nthat much is possible and excellent that was not thought of. Character\ndulls the impression of particular events. When we see the conqueror we\ndo not think much of any one battle or success. We see that we had\nexaggerated the difficulty. It was easy to him. The great man is not\nconvulsible or tormentable; events pass over him without much\nimpression. People say sometimes, \u2018See what I have overcome; see how\ncheerful I am; see how completely I have triumphed over these black\nevents.\u2019 Not if they still remind me of the black event. True conquest\nis the causing the calamity to fade and disappear as an early cloud of\ninsignificant result in a history so large and advancing.\nThe one thing which we seek with insatiable desire is to forget\nourselves, to be surprised out of our propriety, to lose our\nsempiternal memory and to do something without knowing how or why; in\nshort to draw a new circle. Nothing great was ever achieved without\nenthusiasm. The way of life is wonderful; it is by abandonment. The\ngreat moments of history are the facilities of performance through the\nstrength of ideas, as the works of genius and religion. \u201cA man,\u201d said\nOliver Cromwell, \u201cnever rises so high as when he knows not whither he\nis going.\u201d Dreams and drunkenness, the use of opium and alcohol are the\nsemblance and counterfeit of this oracular genius, and hence their\ndangerous attraction for men. For the like reason they ask the aid of\nwild passions, as in gaming and war, to ape in some manner these flames\nand generosities of the heart.\nXI.\nINTELLECT\nGo, speed the stars of Thought\nOn to their shining goals;\u2014\nThe sower scatters broad his seed,\nThe wheat thou strew\u2019st be souls.\nINTELLECT\nEvery substance is negatively electric to that which stands above it in\nthe chemical tables, positively to that which stands below it. Water\ndissolves wood and iron and salt; air dissolves water; electric fire\ndissolves air, but the intellect dissolves fire, gravity, laws, method,\nand the subtlest unnamed relations of nature in its resistless\nmenstruum. Intellect lies behind genius, which is intellect\nconstructive. Intellect is the simple power anterior to all action or\nconstruction. Gladly would I unfold in calm degrees a natural history\nof the intellect, but what man has yet been able to mark the steps and\nboundaries of that transparent essence? The first questions are always\nto be asked, and the wisest doctor is gravelled by the inquisitiveness\nof a child. How can we speak of the action of the mind under any\ndivisions, as of its knowledge, of its ethics, of its works, and so\nforth, since it melts will into perception, knowledge into act? Each\nbecomes the other. Itself alone is. Its vision is not like the vision\nof the eye, but is union with the things known.\nIntellect and intellection signify to the common ear consideration of\nabstract truth. The considerations of time and place, of you and me, of\nprofit and hurt tyrannize over most men\u2019s minds. Intellect separates\nthe fact considered, from you, from all local and personal reference,\nand discerns it as if it existed for its own sake. Heraclitus looked\nupon the affections as dense and colored mists. In the fog of good and\nevil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in a straight line.\nIntellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the\nlight of science, cool and disengaged. The intellect goes out of the\nindividual, floats over its own personality, and regards it as a fact,\nand not as _I_ and _mine_. He who is immersed in what concerns person\nor place cannot see the problem of existence. This the intellect always\nponders. Nature shows all things formed and bound. The intellect\npierces the form, overleaps the wall, detects intrinsic likeness\nbetween remote things and reduces all things into a few principles.\nThe making a fact the subject of thought raises it. All that mass of\nmental and moral phenomena which we do not make objects of voluntary\nthought, come within the power of fortune; they constitute the\ncircumstance of daily life; they are subject to change, to fear, and\nhope. Every man beholds his human condition with a degree of\nmelancholy. As a ship aground is battered by the waves, so man,\nimprisoned in mortal life, lies open to the mercy of coming events. But\na truth, separated by the intellect, is no longer a subject of destiny.\nWe behold it as a god upraised above care and fear. And so any fact in\nour life, or any record of our fancies or reflections, disentangled\nfrom the web of our unconsciousness, becomes an object impersonal and\nimmortal. It is the past restored, but embalmed. A better art than that\nof Egypt has taken fear and corruption out of it. It is eviscerated of\ncare. It is offered for science. What is addressed to us for\ncontemplation does not threaten us but makes us intellectual beings.\nThe growth of the intellect is spontaneous in every expansion. The mind\nthat grows could not predict the times, the means, the mode of that\nspontaneity. God enters by a private door into every individual. Long\nprior to the age of reflection is the thinking of the mind. Out of\ndarkness it came insensibly into the marvellous light of to-day. In the\nperiod of infancy it accepted and disposed of all impressions from the\nsurrounding creation after its own way. Whatever any mind doth or saith\nis after a law; and this native law remains over it after it has come\nto reflection or conscious thought. In the most worn, pedantic,\nintroverted self-tormenter\u2019s life, the greatest part is incalculable by\nhim, unforeseen, unimaginable, and must be, until he can take himself\nup by his own ears. What am I? What has my will done to make me that I\nam? Nothing. I have been floated into this thought, this hour, this\nconnection of events, by secret currents of might and mind, and my\ningenuity and wilfulness have not thwarted, have not aided to an\nappreciable degree.\nOur spontaneous action is always the best. You cannot with your best\ndeliberation and heed come so close to any question as your spontaneous\nglance shall bring you, whilst you rise from your bed, or walk abroad\nin the morning after meditating the matter before sleep on the previous\nnight. Our thinking is a pious reception. Our truth of thought is\ntherefore vitiated as much by too violent direction given by our will,\nas by too great negligence. We do not determine what we will think. We\nonly open our senses, clear away as we can all obstruction from the\nfact, and suffer the intellect to see. We have little control over our\nthoughts. We are the prisoners of ideas. They catch us up for moments\ninto their heaven and so fully engage us that we take no thought for\nthe morrow, gaze like children, without an effort to make them our own.\nBy and by we fall out of that rapture, bethink us where we have been,\nwhat we have seen, and repeat as truly as we can what we have beheld.\nAs far as we can recall these ecstasies we carry away in the\nineffaceable memory the result, and all men and all the ages confirm\nit. It is called Truth. But the moment we cease to report and attempt\nto correct and contrive, it is not truth.\nIf we consider what persons have stimulated and profited us, we shall\nperceive the superiority of the spontaneous or intuitive principle over\nthe arithmetical or logical. The first contains the second, but virtual\nand latent. We want in every man a long logic; we cannot pardon the\nabsence of it, but it must not be spoken. Logic is the procession or\nproportionate unfolding of the intuition; but its virtue is as silent\nmethod; the moment it would appear as propositions and have a separate\nvalue it is worthless.\nIn every man\u2019s mind, some images, words and facts remain, without\neffort on his part to imprint them, which others forget, and afterwards\nthese illustrate to him important laws. All our progress is an\nunfolding, like the vegetable bud. You have first an instinct, then an\nopinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has root, bud and fruit. Trust\nthe instinct to the end, though you can render no reason. It is vain to\nhurry it. By trusting it to the end, it shall ripen into truth and you\nshall know why you believe.\nEach mind has its own method. A true man never acquires after college\nrules. What you have aggregated in a natural manner surprises and\ndelights when it is produced. For we cannot oversee each other\u2019s\nsecret. And hence the differences between men in natural endowment are\ninsignificant in comparison with their common wealth. Do you think the\nporter and the cook have no anecdotes, no experiences, no wonders for\nyou? Every body knows as much as the savant. The walls of rude minds\nare scrawled all over with facts, with thoughts. They shall one day\nbring a lantern and read the inscriptions. Every man, in the degree in\nwhich he has wit and culture, finds his curiosity inflamed concerning\nthe modes of living and thinking of other men, and especially of those\nclasses whose minds have not been subdued by the drill of school\neducation.\nThis instinctive action never ceases in a healthy mind, but becomes\nricher and more frequent in its informations through all states of\nculture. At last comes the era of reflection, when we not only observe,\nbut take pains to observe; when we of set purpose sit down to consider\nan abstract truth; when we keep the mind\u2019s eye open whilst we converse,\nwhilst we read, whilst we act, intent to learn the secret law of some\nclass of facts.\nWhat is the hardest task in the world? To think. I would put myself in\nthe attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth, and I cannot. I\nblench and withdraw on this side and on that. I seem to know what he\nmeant who said, No man can see God face to face and live. For example,\na man explores the basis of civil government. Let him intend his mind\nwithout respite, without rest, in one direction. His best heed long\ntime avails him nothing. Yet thoughts are flitting before him. We all\nbut apprehend, we dimly forebode the truth. We say I will walk abroad,\nand the truth will take form and clearness to me. We go forth, but\ncannot find it. It seems as if we needed only the stillness and\ncomposed attitude of the library to seize the thought. But we come in,\nand are as far from it as at first. Then, in a moment, and unannounced,\nthe truth appears. A certain wandering light appears, and is the\ndistinction, the principle, we wanted. But the oracle comes because we\nhad previously laid siege to the shrine. It seems as if the law of the\nintellect resembled that law of nature by which we now inspire, now\nexpire the breath; by which the heart now draws in, then hurls out the\nblood,\u2014the law of undulation. So now you must labor with your brains,\nand now you must forbear your activity and see what the great Soul\nshoweth.\nThe immortality of man is as legitimately preached from the\nintellections as from the moral volitions. Every intellection is mainly\nprospective. Its present value is its least. Inspect what delights you\nin Plutarch, in Shakspeare, in Cervantes. Each truth that a writer\nacquires is a lantern, which he turns full on what facts and thoughts\nlay already in his mind, and behold, all the mats and rubbish which had\nlittered his garret become precious. Every trivial fact in his private\nbiography becomes an illustration of this new principle, revisits the\nday, and delights all men by its piquancy and new charm. Men say, Where\ndid he get this? and think there was something divine in his life. But\nno; they have myriads of facts just as good, would they only get a lamp\nto ransack their attics withal.\nWe are all wise. The difference between persons is not in wisdom but in\nart. I knew, in an academical club, a person who always deferred to me;\nwho, seeing my whim for writing, fancied that my experiences had\nsomewhat superior; whilst I saw that his experiences were as good as\nmine. Give them to me and I would make the same use of them. He held\nthe old; he holds the new; I had the habit of tacking together the old\nand the new which he did not use to exercise. This may hold in the\ngreat examples. Perhaps if we should meet Shakspeare we should not be\nconscious of any steep inferiority; no, but of a great equality,\u2014only\nthat he possessed a strange skill of using, of classifying, his facts,\nwhich we lacked. For notwithstanding our utter incapacity to produce\nanything like Hamlet and Othello, see the perfect reception this wit\nand immense knowledge of life and liquid eloquence find in us all.\nIf you gather apples in the sunshine, or make hay, or hoe corn, and\nthen retire within doors and shut your eyes and press them with your\nhand, you shall still see apples hanging in the bright light with\nboughs and leaves thereto, or the tasselled grass, or the corn-flags,\nand this for five or six hours afterwards. There lie the impressions on\nthe retentive organ, though you knew it not. So lies the whole series\nof natural images with which your life has made you acquainted, in your\nmemory, though you know it not; and a thrill of passion flashes light\non their dark chamber, and the active power seizes instantly the fit\nimage, as the word of its momentary thought.\nIt is long ere we discover how rich we are. Our history, we are sure,\nis quite tame: we have nothing to write, nothing to infer. But our\nwiser years still run back to the despised recollections of childhood,\nand always we are fishing up some wonderful article out of that pond;\nuntil by and by we begin to suspect that the biography of the one\nfoolish person we know is, in reality, nothing less than the miniature\nparaphrase of the hundred volumes of the Universal History.\nIn the intellect constructive, which we popularly designate by the word\nGenius, we observe the same balance of two elements as in intellect\nreceptive. The constructive intellect produces thoughts, sentences,\npoems, plans, designs, systems. It is the generation of the mind, the\nmarriage of thought with nature. To genius must always go two gifts,\nthe thought and the publication. The first is revelation, always a\nmiracle, which no frequency of occurrence or incessant study can ever\nfamiliarize, but which must always leave the inquirer stupid with\nwonder. It is the advent of truth into the world, a form of thought now\nfor the first time bursting into the universe, a child of the old\neternal soul, a piece of genuine and immeasurable greatness. It seems,\nfor the time, to inherit all that has yet existed and to dictate to the\nunborn. It affects every thought of man and goes to fashion every\ninstitution. But to make it available it needs a vehicle or art by\nwhich it is conveyed to men. To be communicable it must become picture\nor sensible object. We must learn the language of facts. The most\nwonderful inspirations die with their subject if he has no hand to\npaint them to the senses. The ray of light passes invisible through\nspace and only when it falls on an object is it seen. When the\nspiritual energy is directed on something outward, then it is a\nthought. The relation between it and you first makes you, the value of\nyou, apparent to me. The rich inventive genius of the painter must be\nsmothered and lost for want of the power of drawing, and in our happy\nhours we should be inexhaustible poets if once we could break through\nthe silence into adequate rhyme. As all men have some access to primary\ntruth, so all have some art or power of communication in their head,\nbut only in the artist does it descend into the hand. There is an\ninequality, whose laws we do not yet know, between two men and between\ntwo moments of the same man, in respect to this faculty. In common\nhours we have the same facts as in the uncommon or inspired, but they\ndo not sit for their portraits; they are not detached, but lie in a\nweb. The thought of genius is spontaneous; but the power of picture or\nexpression, in the most enriched and flowing nature, implies a mixture\nof will, a certain control over the spontaneous states, without which\nno production is possible. It is a conversion of all nature into the\nrhetoric of thought, under the eye of judgment, with a strenuous\nexercise of choice. And yet the imaginative vocabulary seems to be\nspontaneous also. It does not flow from experience only or mainly, but\nfrom a richer source. Not by any conscious imitation of particular\nforms are the grand strokes of the painter executed, but by repairing\nto the fountain-head of all forms in his mind. Who is the first\ndrawing-master? Without instruction we know very well the ideal of the\nhuman form. A child knows if an arm or a leg be distorted in a picture;\nif the attitude be natural or grand or mean; though he has never\nreceived any instruction in drawing or heard any conversation on the\nsubject, nor can himself draw with correctness a single feature. A good\nform strikes all eyes pleasantly, long before they have any science on\nthe subject, and a beautiful face sets twenty hearts in palpitation,\nprior to all consideration of the mechanical proportions of the\nfeatures and head. We may owe to dreams some light on the fountain of\nthis skill; for as soon as we let our will go and let the unconscious\nstates ensue, see what cunning draughtsmen we are! We entertain\nourselves with wonderful forms of men, of women, of animals, of\ngardens, of woods and of monsters, and the mystic pencil wherewith we\nthen draw has no awkwardness or inexperience, no meagreness or poverty;\nit can design well and group well; its composition is full of art, its\ncolors are well laid on and the whole canvas which it paints is\nlifelike and apt to touch us with terror, with tenderness, with desire\nand with grief. Neither are the artist\u2019s copies from experience ever\nmere copies, but always touched and softened by tints from this ideal\ndomain.\nThe conditions essential to a constructive mind do not appear to be so\noften combined but that a good sentence or verse remains fresh and\nmemorable for a long time. Yet when we write with ease and come out\ninto the free air of thought, we seem to be assured that nothing is\neasier than to continue this communication at pleasure. Up, down,\naround, the kingdom of thought has no inclosures, but the Muse makes us\nfree of her city. Well, the world has a million writers. One would\nthink then that good thought would be as familiar as air and water, and\nthe gifts of each new hour would exclude the last. Yet we can count all\nour good books; nay, I remember any beautiful verse for twenty years.\nIt is true that the discerning intellect of the world is always much in\nadvance of the creative, so that there are many competent judges of the\nbest book, and few writers of the best books. But some of the\nconditions of intellectual construction are of rare occurrence. The\nintellect is a whole and demands integrity in every work. This is\nresisted equally by a man\u2019s devotion to a single thought and by his\nambition to combine too many.\nTruth is our element of life, yet if a man fasten his attention on a\nsingle aspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long time,\nthe truth becomes distorted and not itself but falsehood; herein\nresembling the air, which is our natural element, and the breath of our\nnostrils, but if a stream of the same be directed on the body for a\ntime, it causes cold, fever, and even death. How wearisome the\ngrammarian, the phrenologist, the political or religious fanatic, or\nindeed any possessed mortal whose balance is lost by the exaggeration\nof a single topic. It is incipient insanity. Every thought is a prison\nalso. I cannot see what you see, because I am caught up by a strong\nwind and blown so far in one direction that I am out of the hoop of\nyour horizon.\nIs it any better if the student, to avoid this offence, and to\nliberalize himself, aims to make a mechanical whole of history, or\nscience, or philosophy, by a numerical addition of all the facts that\nfall within his vision? The world refuses to be analyzed by addition\nand subtraction. When we are young we spend much time and pains in\nfilling our note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry,\nPolitics, Art, in the hope that in the course of a few years we shall\nhave condensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories\nat which the world has yet arrived. But year after year our tables get\nno completeness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola,\nwhose arcs will never meet.\nNeither by detachment neither by aggregation is the integrity of the\nintellect transmitted to its works, but by a vigilance which brings the\nintellect in its greatness and best state to operate every moment. It\nmust have the same wholeness which nature has. Although no diligence\ncan rebuild the universe in a model by the best accumulation or\ndisposition of details, yet does the world reappear in miniature in\nevery event, so that all the laws of nature may be read in the smallest\nfact. The intellect must have the like perfection in its apprehension\nand in its works. For this reason, an index or mercury of intellectual\nproficiency is the perception of identity. We talk with accomplished\npersons who appear to be strangers in nature. The cloud, the tree, the\nturf, the bird are not theirs, have nothing of them; the world is only\ntheir lodging and table. But the poet, whose verses are to be spheral\nand complete, is one whom Nature cannot deceive, whatsoever face of\nstrangeness she may put on. He feels a strict consanguinity, and\ndetects more likeness than variety in all her changes. We are stung by\nthe desire for new thought; but when we receive a new thought it is\nonly the old thought with a new face, and though we make it our own we\ninstantly crave another; we are not really enriched. For the truth was\nin us before it was reflected to us from natural objects; and the\nprofound genius will cast the likeness of all creatures into every\nproduct of his wit.\nBut if the constructive powers are rare and it is given to few men to\nbe poets, yet every man is a receiver of this descending holy ghost,\nand may well study the laws of its influx. Exactly parallel is the\nwhole rule of intellectual duty to the rule of moral duty. A\nself-denial no less austere than the saint\u2019s is demanded of the\nscholar. He must worship truth, and forego all things for that, and\nchoose defeat and pain, so that his treasure in thought is thereby\naugmented.\nGod offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose. Take\nwhich you please,\u2014you can never have both. Between these, as a\npendulum, man oscillates. He in whom the love of repose predominates\nwill accept the first creed, the first philosophy, the first political\nparty he meets,\u2014most likely his father\u2019s. He gets rest, commodity, and\nreputation; but he shuts the door of truth. He in whom the love of\ntruth predominates will keep himself aloof from all moorings, and\nafloat. He will abstain from dogmatism, and recognize all the opposite\nnegations between which, as walls, his being is swung. He submits to\nthe inconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion, but he is a\ncandidate for truth, as the other is not, and respects the highest law\nof his being.\nThe circle of the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find\nthe man who can yield him truth. He shall then know that there is\nsomewhat more blessed and great in hearing than in speaking. Happy is\nthe hearing man; unhappy the speaking man. As long as I hear truth I am\nbathed by a beautiful element and am not conscious of any limits to my\nnature. The suggestions are thousandfold that I hear and see. The\nwaters of the great deep have ingress and egress to the soul. But if I\nspeak, I define, I confine and am less. When Socrates speaks, Lysis and\nMenexenus are afflicted by no shame that they do not speak. They also\nare good. He likewise defers to them, loves them, whilst he speaks.\nBecause a true and natural man contains and is the same truth which an\neloquent man articulates; but in the eloquent man, because he can\narticulate it, it seems something the less to reside, and he turns to\nthese silent beautiful with the more inclination and respect. The\nancient sentence said, Let us be silent, for so are the gods. Silence\nis a solvent that destroys personality, and gives us leave to be great\nand universal. Every man\u2019s progress is through a succession of\nteachers, each of whom seems at the time to have a superlative\ninfluence, but it at last gives place to a new. Frankly let him accept\nit all. Jesus says, Leave father, mother, house and lands, and follow\nme. Who leaves all, receives more. This is as true intellectually as\nmorally. Each new mind we approach seems to require an abdication of\nall our past and present possessions. A new doctrine seems at first a\nsubversion of all our opinions, tastes, and manner of living. Such has\nSwedenborg, such has Kant, such has Coleridge, such has Hegel or his\ninterpreter Cousin seemed to many young men in this country. Take\nthankfully and heartily all they can give. Exhaust them, wrestle with\nthem, let them not go until their blessing be won, and after a short\nseason the dismay will be overpast, the excess of influence withdrawn,\nand they will be no longer an alarming meteor, but one more bright star\nshining serenely in your heaven and blending its light with all your\nday.\nBut whilst he gives himself up unreservedly to that which draws him,\nbecause that is his own, he is to refuse himself to that which draws\nhim not, whatsoever fame and authority may attend it, because it is not\nhis own. Entire self-reliance belongs to the intellect. One soul is a\ncounterpoise of all souls, as a capillary column of water is a balance\nfor the sea. It must treat things and books and sovereign genius as\nitself also a sovereign. If \u00c6schylus be that man he is taken for, he\nhas not yet done his office when he has educated the learned of Europe\nfor a thousand years. He is now to approve himself a master of delight\nto me also. If he cannot do that, all his fame shall avail him nothing\nwith me. I were a fool not to sacrifice a thousand \u00c6schyluses to my\nintellectual integrity. Especially take the same ground in regard to\nabstract truth, the science of the mind. The Bacon, the Spinoza, the\nHume, Schelling, Kant, or whosoever propounds to you a philosophy of\nthe mind, is only a more or less awkward translator of things in your\nconsciousness which you have also your way of seeing, perhaps of\ndenominating. Say then, instead of too timidly poring into his obscure\nsense, that he has not succeeded in rendering back to you your\nconsciousness. He has not succeeded; now let another try. If Plato\ncannot, perhaps Spinoza will. If Spinoza cannot, then perhaps Kant.\nAnyhow, when at last it is done, you will find it is no recondite, but\na simple, natural, common state which the writer restores to you.\nBut let us end these didactics. I will not, though the subject might\nprovoke it, speak to the open question between Truth and Love. I shall\nnot presume to interfere in the old politics of the skies;\u2014\u201cThe\ncherubim know most; the seraphim love most.\u201d The gods shall settle\ntheir own quarrels. But I cannot recite, even thus rudely, laws of the\nintellect, without remembering that lofty and sequestered class of men\nwho have been its prophets and oracles, the high-priesthood of the pure\nreason, the _Trismegisti_, the expounders of the principles of thought\nfrom age to age. When at long intervals we turn over their abstruse\npages, wonderful seems the calm and grand air of these few, these great\nspiritual lords who have walked in the world,\u2014these of the old\nreligion,\u2014dwelling in a worship which makes the sanctities of\nChristianity look _parvenues_ and popular; for \u201cpersuasion is in soul,\nbut necessity is in intellect.\u201d This band of grandees, Hermes,\nHeraclitus, Empedocles, Plato, Plotinus, Olympiodorus, Proclus,\nSynesius and the rest, have somewhat so vast in their logic, so primary\nin their thinking, that it seems antecedent to all the ordinary\ndistinctions of rhetoric and literature, and to be at once poetry and\nmusic and dancing and astronomy and mathematics. I am present at the\nsowing of the seed of the world. With a geometry of sunbeams the soul\nlays the foundations of nature. The truth and grandeur of their thought\nis proved by its scope and applicability, for it commands the entire\nschedule and inventory of things for its illustration. But what marks\nits elevation and has even a comic look to us, is the innocent serenity\nwith which these babe-like Jupiters sit in their clouds, and from age\nto age prattle to each other and to no contemporary. Well assured that\ntheir speech is intelligible and the most natural thing in the world,\nthey add thesis to thesis, without a moment\u2019s heed of the universal\nastonishment of the human race below, who do not comprehend their\nplainest argument; nor do they ever relent so much as to insert a\npopular or explaining sentence, nor testify the least displeasure or\npetulance at the dulness of their amazed auditory. The angels are so\nenamored of the language that is spoken in heaven that they will not\ndistort their lips with the hissing and unmusical dialects of men, but\nspeak their own, whether there be any who understand it or not.\nXII.\nART\nGive to barrows trays and pans\nGrace and glimmer of romance,\nBring the moonlight into noon\nHid in gleaming piles of stone;\nOn the city\u2019s paved street\nPlant gardens lined with lilac sweet,\nLet spouting fountains cool the air,\nSinging in the sun-baked square.\nLet statue, picture, park and hall,\nBallad, flag and festival,\nThe past restore, the day adorn\nAnd make each morrow a new morn\nSo shall the drudge in dusty frock\nSpy behind the city clock\nRetinues of airy kings,\nSkirts of angels, starry wings,\nHis fathers shining in bright fables,\nHis children fed at heavenly tables.\n\u2019Tis the privilege of Art\nThus to play its cheerful part,\nMan in Earth to acclimate\nAnd bend the exile to his fate,\nAnd, moulded of one element\nWith the days and firmament,\nTeach him on these as stairs to climb\nAnd live on even terms with Time;\nWhilst upper life the slender rill\nOf human sense doth overfill.\nART\nBecause the soul is progressive, it never quite repeats itself, but in\nevery act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole. This\nappears in works both of the useful and the fine arts, if we employ the\npopular distinction of works according to their aim either at use or\nbeauty. Thus in our fine arts, not imitation but creation is the aim.\nIn landscapes the painter should give the suggestion of a fairer\ncreation than we know. The details, the prose of nature he should omit\nand give us only the spirit and splendor. He should know that the\nlandscape has beauty for his eye because it expresses a thought which\nis to him good; and this because the same power which sees through his\neyes is seen in that spectacle; and he will come to value the\nexpression of nature and not nature itself, and so exalt in his copy\nthe features that please him. He will give the gloom of gloom and the\nsunshine of sunshine. In a portrait he must inscribe the character and\nnot the features, and must esteem the man who sits to him as himself\nonly an imperfect picture or likeness of the aspiring original within.\nWhat is that abridgment and selection we observe in all spiritual\nactivity, but itself the creative impulse? for it is the inlet of that\nhigher illumination which teaches to convey a larger sense by simpler\nsymbols. What is a man but nature\u2019s finer success in self-explication?\nWhat is a man but a finer and compacter landscape than the horizon\nfigures,\u2014nature\u2019s eclecticism? and what is his speech, his love of\npainting, love of nature, but a still finer success,\u2014all the weary\nmiles and tons of space and bulk left out, and the spirit or moral of\nit contracted into a musical word, or the most cunning stroke of the\npencil?\nBut the artist must employ the symbols in use in his day and nation to\nconvey his enlarged sense to his fellow-men. Thus the new in art is\nalways formed out of the old. The Genius of the Hour sets his\nineffaceable seal on the work and gives it an inexpressible charm for\nthe imagination. As far as the spiritual character of the period\noverpowers the artist and finds expression in his work, so far it will\nretain a certain grandeur, and will represent to future beholders the\nUnknown, the Inevitable, the Divine. No man can quite exclude this\nelement of Necessity from his labor. No man can quite emancipate\nhimself from his age and country, or produce a model in which the\neducation, the religion, the politics, usages and arts of his times\nshall have no share. Though he were never so original, never so wilful\nand fantastic, he cannot wipe out of his work every trace of the\nthoughts amidst which it grew. The very avoidance betrays the usage he\navoids. Above his will and out of his sight he is necessitated by the\nair he breathes and the idea on which he and his contemporaries live\nand toil, to share the manner of his times, without knowing what that\nmanner is. Now that which is inevitable in the work has a higher charm\nthan individual talent can ever give, inasmuch as the artist\u2019s pen or\nchisel seems to have been held and guided by a gigantic hand to\ninscribe a line in the history of the human race. This circumstance\ngives a value to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, to the Indian, Chinese and\nMexican idols, however gross and shapeless. They denote the height of\nthe human soul in that hour, and were not fantastic, but sprung from a\nnecessity as deep as the world. Shall I now add that the whole extant\nproduct of the plastic arts has herein its highest value, _as history;_\nas a stroke drawn in the portrait of that fate, perfect and beautiful,\naccording to whose ordinations all beings advance to their beatitude?\nThus, historically viewed, it has been the office of art to educate the\nperception of beauty. We are immersed in beauty, but our eyes have no\nclear vision. It needs, by the exhibition of single traits, to assist\nand lead the dormant taste. We carve and paint, or we behold what is\ncarved and painted, as students of the mystery of Form. The virtue of\nart lies in detachment, in sequestering one object from the\nembarrassing variety. Until one thing comes out from the connection of\nthings, there can be enjoyment, contemplation, but no thought. Our\nhappiness and unhappiness are unproductive. The infant lies in a\npleasing trance, but his individual character and his practical power\ndepend on his daily progress in the separation of things, and dealing\nwith one at a time. Love and all the passions concentrate all existence\naround a single form. It is the habit of certain minds to give an\nall-excluding fulness to the object, the thought, the word, they alight\nupon, and to make that for the time the deputy of the world. These are\nthe artists, the orators, the leaders of society. The power to detach\nand to magnify by detaching is the essence of rhetoric in the hands of\nthe orator and the poet. This rhetoric, or power to fix the momentary\neminency of an object,\u2014so remarkable in Burke, in Byron, in\nCarlyle,\u2014the painter and sculptor exhibit in color and in stone. The\npower depends on the depth of the artist\u2019s insight of that object he\ncontemplates. For every object has its roots in central nature, and may\nof course be so exhibited to us as to represent the world. Therefore\neach work of genius is the tyrant of the hour and concentrates\nattention on itself. For the time, it is the only thing worth naming to\ndo that,\u2014be it a sonnet, an opera, a landscape, a statue, an oration,\nthe plan of a temple, of a campaign, or of a voyage of discovery.\nPresently we pass to some other object, which rounds itself into a\nwhole as did the first; for example a well-laid garden; and nothing\nseems worth doing but the laying out of gardens. I should think fire\nthe best thing in the world, if I were not acquainted with air, and\nwater, and earth. For it is the right and property of all natural\nobjects, of all genuine talents, of all native properties whatsoever,\nto be for their moment the top of the world. A squirrel leaping from\nbough to bough and making the Wood but one wide tree for his pleasure,\nfills the eye not less than a lion,\u2014is beautiful, self-sufficing, and\nstands then and there for nature. A good ballad draws my ear and heart\nwhilst I listen, as much as an epic has done before. A dog, drawn by a\nmaster, or a litter of pigs, satisfies and is a reality not less than\nthe frescoes of Angelo. From this succession of excellent objects we\nlearn at last the immensity of the world, the opulence of human nature,\nwhich can run out to infinitude in any direction. But I also learn that\nwhat astonished and fascinated me in the first work astonished me in\nthe second work also; that excellence of all things is one.\nThe office of painting and sculpture seems to be merely initial. The\nbest pictures can easily tell us their last secret. The best pictures\nare rude draughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines and dyes\nwhich make up the ever-changing \u201clandscape with figures\u201d amidst which\nwe dwell. Painting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs.\nWhen that has educated the frame to self-possession, to nimbleness, to\ngrace, the steps of the dancing-master are better forgotten; so\npainting teaches me the splendor of color and the expression of form,\nand as I see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I see the\nboundless opulence of the pencil, the indifferency in which the artist\nstands free to choose out of the possible forms. If he can draw every\nthing, why draw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the eternal\npicture which nature paints in the street, with moving men and\nchildren, beggars and fine ladies, draped in red and green and blue and\ngray; long-haired, grizzled, white-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant,\ndwarf, expanded, elfish,\u2014capped and based by heaven, earth and sea.\nA gallery of sculpture teaches more austerely the same lesson. As\npicture teaches the coloring, so sculpture the anatomy of form. When I\nhave seen fine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly, I\nunderstand well what he meant who said, \u201cWhen I have been reading\nHomer, all men look like giants.\u201d I too see that painting and sculpture\nare gymnastics of the eye, its training to the niceties and curiosities\nof its function. There is no statue like this living man, with his\ninfinite advantage over all ideal sculpture, of perpetual variety. What\na gallery of art have I here! No mannerist made these varied groups and\ndiverse original single figures. Here is the artist himself\nimprovising, grim and glad, at his block. Now one thought strikes him,\nnow another, and with each moment he alters the whole air, attitude and\nexpression of his clay. Away with your nonsense of oil and easels, of\nmarble and chisels; except to open your eyes to the masteries of\neternal art, they are hypocritical rubbish.\nThe reference of all production at last to an aboriginal Power explains\nthe traits common to all works of the highest art,\u2014that they are\nuniversally intelligible; that they restore to us the simplest states\nof mind, and are religious. Since what skill is therein shown is the\nreappearance of the original soul, a jet of pure light, it should\nproduce a similar impression to that made by natural objects. In happy\nhours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected,\u2014the work of\ngenius. And the individual, in whom simple tastes and susceptibility to\nall the great human influences overpower the accidents of a local and\nspecial culture, is the best critic of art. Though we travel the world\nover to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it\nnot. The best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces, in\noutlines, or rules of art can ever teach, namely a radiation from the\nwork of art of human character,\u2014a wonderful expression through stone,\nor canvas, or musical sound, of the deepest and simplest attributes of\nour nature, and therefore most intelligible at last to those souls\nwhich have these attributes. In the sculptures of the Greeks, in the\nmasonry of the Romans, and in the pictures of the Tuscan and Venetian\nmasters, the highest charm is the universal language they speak. A\nconfession of moral nature, of purity, love, and hope, breathes from\nthem all. That which we carry to them, the same we bring back more\nfairly illustrated in the memory. The traveller who visits the Vatican,\nand passes from chamber to chamber through galleries of statues, vases,\nsarcophagi and candelabra, through all forms of beauty cut in the\nrichest materials, is in danger of forgetting the simplicity of the\nprinciples out of which they all sprung, and that they had their origin\nfrom thoughts and laws in his own breast. He studies the technical\nrules on these wonderful remains, but forgets that these works were not\nalways thus constellated; that they are the contributions of many ages\nand many countries; that each came out of the solitary workshop of one\nartist, who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the existence of other\nsculpture, created his work without other model save life, household\nlife, and the sweet and smart of personal relations, of beating hearts,\nand meeting eyes; of poverty and necessity and hope and fear. These\nwere his inspirations, and these are the effects he carries home to\nyour heart and mind. In proportion to his force, the artist will find\nin his work an outlet for his proper character. He must not be in any\nmanner pinched or hindered by his material, but through his necessity\nof imparting himself the adamant will be wax in his hands, and will\nallow an adequate communication of himself, in his full stature and\nproportion. He need not cumber himself with a conventional nature and\nculture, nor ask what is the mode in Rome or in Paris, but that house\nand weather and manner of living which poverty and the fate of birth\nhave made at once so odious and so dear, in the gray unpainted wood\ncabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in the log-hut of the\nbackwoods, or in the narrow lodging where he has endured the\nconstraints and seeming of a city poverty, will serve as well as any\nother condition as the symbol of a thought which pours itself\nindifferently through all.\nI remember when in my younger days I had heard of the wonders of\nItalian painting, I fancied the great pictures would be great\nstrangers; some surprising combination of color and form; a foreign\nwonder, barbaric pearl and gold, like the spontoons and standards of\nthe militia, which play such pranks in the eyes and imaginations of\nschool-boys. I was to see and acquire I knew not what. When I came at\nlast to Rome and saw with eyes the pictures, I found that genius left\nto novices the gay and fantastic and ostentatious, and itself pierced\ndirectly to the simple and true; that it was familiar and sincere; that\nit was the old, eternal fact I had met already in so many forms,\u2014unto\nwhich I lived; that it was the plain _you and me_ I knew so well,\u2014had\nleft at home in so many conversations. I had the same experience\nalready in a church at Naples. There I saw that nothing was changed\nwith me but the place, and said to myself\u2014\u2018Thou foolish child, hast\nthou come out hither, over four thousand miles of salt water, to find\nthat which was perfect to thee there at home?\u2019 That fact I saw again in\nthe Academmia at Naples, in the chambers of sculpture, and yet again\nwhen I came to Rome and to the paintings of Raphael, Angelo, Sacchi,\nTitian, and Leonardo da Vinci. \u201cWhat, old mole! workest thou in the\nearth so fast?\u201d It had travelled by my side; that which I fancied I had\nleft in Boston was here in the Vatican, and again at Milan and at\nParis, and made all travelling ridiculous as a treadmill. I now require\nthis of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not that they dazzle\nme. Pictures must not be too picturesque. Nothing astonishes men so\nmuch as common-sense and plain dealing. All great actions have been\nsimple, and all great pictures are.\nThe Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent example of this peculiar\nmerit. A calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture, and goes\ndirectly to the heart. It seems almost to call you by name. The sweet\nand sublime face of Jesus is beyond praise, yet how it disappoints all\nflorid expectations! This familiar, simple, home-speaking countenance\nis as if one should meet a friend. The knowledge of picture-dealers has\nits value, but listen not to their criticism when your heart is touched\nby genius. It was not painted for them, it was painted for you; for\nsuch as had eyes capable of being touched by simplicity and lofty\nemotions.\nYet when we have said all our fine things about the arts, we must end\nwith a frank confession, that the arts, as we know them, are but\ninitial. Our best praise is given to what they aimed and promised, not\nto the actual result. He has conceived meanly of the resources of man,\nwho believes that the best age of production is past. The real value of\nthe Iliad or the Transfiguration is as signs of power; billows or\nripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens of the everlasting\neffort to produce, which even in its worst estate the soul betrays. Art\nhas not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with\nthe most potent influences of the world, if it is not practical and\nmoral, if it do not stand in connection with the conscience, if it do\nnot make the poor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a\nvoice of lofty cheer. There is higher work for Art than the arts. They\nare abortive births of an imperfect or vitiated instinct. Art is the\nneed to create; but in its essence, immense and universal, it is\nimpatient of working with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples\nand monsters, such as all pictures and statues are. Nothing less than\nthe creation of man and nature is its end. A man should find in it an\noutlet for his whole energy. He may paint and carve only as long as he\ncan do that. Art should exhilarate, and throw down the walls of\ncircumstance on every side, awakening in the beholder the same sense of\nuniversal relation and power which the work evinced in the artist, and\nits highest effect is to make new artists.\nAlready History is old enough to witness the old age and disappearance\nof particular arts. The art of sculpture is long ago perished to any\nreal effect. It was originally a useful art, a mode of writing, a\nsavage\u2019s record of gratitude or devotion, and among a people possessed\nof a wonderful perception of form this childish carving was refined to\nthe utmost splendor of effect. But it is the game of a rude and\nyouthful people, and not the manly labor of a wise and spiritual\nnation. Under an oak-tree loaded with leaves and nuts, under a sky full\nof eternal eyes, I stand in a thoroughfare; but in the works of our\nplastic arts and especially of sculpture, creation is driven into a\ncorner. I cannot hide from myself that there is a certain appearance of\npaltriness, as of toys and the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture.\nNature transcends all our moods of thought, and its secret we do not\nyet find. But the gallery stands at the mercy of our moods, and there\nis a moment when it becomes frivolous. I do not wonder that Newton,\nwith an attention habitually engaged on the paths of planets and suns,\nshould have wondered what the Earl of Pembroke found to admire in\n\u201cstone dolls.\u201d Sculpture may serve to teach the pupil how deep is the\nsecret of form, how purely the spirit can translate its meanings into\nthat eloquent dialect. But the statue will look cold and false before\nthat new activity which needs to roll through all things, and is\nimpatient of counterfeits and things not alive. Picture and sculpture\nare the celebrations and festivities of form. But true art is never\nfixed, but always flowing. The sweetest music is not in the oratorio,\nbut in the human voice when it speaks from its instant life tones of\ntenderness, truth, or courage. The oratorio has already lost its\nrelation to the morning, to the sun, and the earth, but that persuading\nvoice is in tune with these. All works of art should not be detached,\nbut extempore performances. A great man is a new statue in every\nattitude and action. A beautiful woman is a picture which drives all\nbeholders nobly mad. Life may be lyric or epic, as well as a poem or a\nromance.\nA true announcement of the law of creation, if a man were found worthy\nto declare it, would carry art up into the kingdom of nature, and\ndestroy its separate and contrasted existence. The fountains of\ninvention and beauty in modern society are all but dried up. A popular\nnovel, a theatre, or a ball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers\nin the alms-house of this world, without dignity, without skill or\nindustry. Art is as poor and low. The old tragic Necessity, which\nlowers on the brows even of the Venuses and the Cupids of the antique,\nand furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of such anomalous\nfigures into nature,\u2014namely, that they were inevitable; that the artist\nwas drunk with a passion for form which he could not resist, and which\nvented itself in these fine extravagances,\u2014no longer dignifies the\nchisel or the pencil. But the artist and the connoisseur now seek in\nart the exhibition of their talent, or an asylum from the evils of\nlife. Men are not well pleased with the figure they make in their own\nimaginations, and they flee to art, and convey their better sense in an\noratorio, a statue, or a picture. Art makes the same effort which a\nsensual prosperity makes; namely to detach the beautiful from the\nuseful, to do up the work as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on to\nenjoyment. These solaces and compensations, this division of beauty\nfrom use, the laws of nature do not permit. As soon as beauty is\nsought, not from religion and love but for pleasure, it degrades the\nseeker. High beauty is no longer attainable by him in canvas or in\nstone, in sound, or in lyrical construction; an effeminate, prudent,\nsickly beauty, which is not beauty, is all that can be formed; for the\nhand can never execute any thing higher than the character can inspire.\nThe art that thus separates is itself first separated. Art must not be\na superficial talent, but must begin farther back in man. Now men do\nnot see nature to be beautiful, and they go to make a statue which\nshall be. They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible, and\nconsole themselves with color-bags and blocks of marble. They reject\nlife as prosaic, and create a death which they call poetic. They\ndespatch the day\u2019s weary chores, and fly to voluptuous reveries. They\neat and drink, that they may afterwards execute the ideal. Thus is art\nvilified; the name conveys to the mind its secondary and bad senses; it\nstands in the imagination as somewhat contrary to nature, and struck\nwith death from the first. Would it not be better to begin higher\nup,\u2014to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to serve the ideal in\neating and drinking, in drawing the breath, and in the functions of\nlife? Beauty must come back to the useful arts, and the distinction\nbetween the fine and the useful arts be forgotten. If history were\ntruly told, if life were nobly spent, it would be no longer easy or\npossible to distinguish the one from the other. In nature, all is\nuseful, all is beautiful. It is therefore beautiful because it is\nalive, moving, reproductive; it is therefore useful because it is\nsymmetrical and fair. Beauty will not come at the call of a\nlegislature, nor will it repeat in England or America its history in\nGreece. It will come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the\nfeet of brave and earnest men. It is in vain that we look for genius to\nreiterate its miracles in the old arts; it is its instinct to find\nbeauty and holiness in new and necessary facts, in the field and\nroad-side, in the shop and mill. Proceeding from a religious heart it\nwill raise to a divine use the railroad, the insurance office, the\njoint-stock company; our law, our primary assemblies, our commerce, the\ngalvanic battery, the electric jar, the prism, and the chemist\u2019s\nretort; in which we seek now only an economical use. Is not the selfish\nand even cruel aspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to\nmills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary impulses\nwhich these works obey? When its errands are noble and adequate, a\nsteamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old and New England and\narriving at its ports with the punctuality of a planet, is a step of\nman into harmony with nature. The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies\nalong the Lena by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime. When\nscience is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by love, they\nwill appear the supplements and continuations of the material creation.\nNext Volume", "source": "essays_first_series.txt"}
{"text": "I. USES OF GREAT MEN.\nIt is natural to believe in great men. If the companions of our\nchildhood should turn out to be heroes, and their condition regal, it\nwould not surprise us. All mythology opens with demigods, and the\ncircumstance is high and poetic; that is, their genius is paramount.\nIn the legends of the Gautama, the first men ate the earth, and found\nit deliciously sweet.\nNature seems to exist for the excellent. The world is upheld by the\nveracity of good men: they make the earth wholesome. They who lived\nwith them found life glad and nutritious. Life is sweet and tolerable\nonly in our belief in such society; and actually, or ideally, we manage\nto live with superiors. We call our children and our lands by their\nnames. Their names are wrought into the verbs of language, their works\nand effigies are in our houses, and every circumstance of the day\nrecalls an anecdote of them.\nThe search after the great is the dream of youth, and the most serious\noccupation of manhood. We travel into foreign parts to find his\nworks,--if possible, to get a glimpse of him. But we are put off with\nfortune instead. You say, the English are practical; the Germans are\nhospitable; in Valencia, the climate is delicious; and in the hills\nof Sacramento there is gold for the gathering. Yes, but I do not travel\nto find comfortable, rich, and hospitable people, or clear sky, or\ningots that cost too much. But if there were any magnet that would\npoint to the countries and houses where are the persons who are\nintrinsically rich and powerful, I would sell all, and buy it, and put\nmyself on the road to-day.\nThe race goes with us on their credit. The knowledge, that in the city\nis a man who invented the railroad, raises the credit of all the\ncitizens. But enormous populations, if they be beggars, are disgusting,\nlike moving cheese, like hills of ants, or of fleas--the more, the\nworse.\nOur religion is the love and cherishing of these patrons. The gods of\nfable are the shining moments of great men. We run all our vessels\ninto one mould. Our colossal theologies of Judaism, Christism, Buddhism,\nMahometism, are the necessary and structural action of the human mind.\nThe student of history is like a man going into a warehouse to buy\ncloths or carpets. He fancies he has a new article. If he go to the\nfactory, he shall find that his new stuff still repeats the scrolls\nand rosettes which are found on the interior walls of the pyramids of\nThebes. Our theism is the purification of the human mind. Man can\npaint, or make, or think nothing but man. He believes that the great\nmaterial elements had their origin from his thought. And our philosophy\nfinds one essence collected or distributed.\nIf now we proceed to inquire into the kinds of service we derive from\nothers, let us be warned of the danger of modern studies, and begin\nlow enough. We must not contend against love, or deny the substantial\nexistence of other people. I know not what would happen to us. We have\nsocial strengths. Our affection toward others creates a sort of vantage\nor purchase which nothing will supply. I can do that by another which\nI cannot do alone. I can say to you what I cannot first say to myself.\nOther men are lenses through which we read our own minds. Each man\nseeks those of different quality from his own, and such as are good\nof their kind; that is, he seeks other men, and the otherest. The\nstronger the nature, the more it is reactive. Let us have the quality\npure. A little genius let us leave alone. A main difference betwixt\nmen is, whether they attend their own affair or not. Man is that noble\nendogenous plant which grows, like the palm, from within, outward. His\nown affair, though impossible to others, he can open with celerity and\nin sport. It is easy to sugar to be sweet, and to nitre to be salt.\nWe take a great deal of pains to waylay and entrap that which of itself\nwill fall into our hands. I count him a great man who inhabits a higher\nsphere of thought, into which other men rise with labor and difficulty;\nhe has but to open his eyes to see things in a true light, and in large\nrelations; whilst they must make painful corrections, and keep a\nvigilant eye on many sources of error. His service to us is of like\nsort. It costs a beautiful person no exertion to paint her image on\nour eyes; yet how splendid is that benefit! It costs no more for a\nwise soul to convey his quality to other men. And every one can do his\nbest thing easiest--\"_Peu de moyens, beaucoup d'effet._\" He is great who\nis what he is from nature, and who never reminds us of others.\nBut he must be related to us, and our life receive from him some promise\nof explanation. I cannot tell what I would know; but I have observed\nthere are persons, who, in their character and actions, answer questions\nwhich I have not skill to put. One man answers some questions which\nnone of his contemporaries put, and is isolated. The past and passing\nreligions and philosophies answer some other question. Certain men\naffect us as rich possibilities, but helpless to themselves and to\ntheir times,--the sport, perhaps, of some instinct that rules in the\nair;--they do not speak to our want. But the great are near: we know\nthem at sight. They satisfy expectation, and fall into place. What is\ngood is effective, generative; makes for itself room, food, and allies.\nA sound apple produces seed,--a hybrid does not. Is a man in his place,\nhe is constructive, fertile, magnetic, inundating armies with his\npurpose, which is thus executed. The river makes its own shores, and\neach legitimate idea makes its own channels and welcome,--harvest for\nfood, institutions for expression, weapons to fight with, and disciples\nto explain it. The true artist has the planet for his pedestal; the\nadventurer, after years of strife, has nothing broader than his own\nshoes.\nOur common discourse respects two kinds of use of service from superior\nmen. Direct giving is agreeable to the early belief of men; direct\ngiving of material or metaphysical aid, as of health, eternal youth,\nfine senses, arts of healing, magical power, and prophecy. The boy\nbelieves there is a teacher who can sell him wisdom. Churches believe\nin imputed merit. But, in strictness, we are not much cognizant of\ndirect serving. Man is endogenous, and education is his unfolding. The\naid we have from others is mechanical, compared with the discoveries\nof nature in us. What is thus learned is delightful in the doing, and\nthe effect remains. Right ethics are central, and go from the soul\noutward. Gift is contrary to the law of the universe. Serving others\nis serving us. I must absolve me to myself. \"Mind thy affair,\" says\nthe spirit:--\"coxcomb, would you meddle with the skies, or with other\npeople?\" Indirect service is left. Men have a pictorial or\nrepresentative quality, and serve us in the intellect. Behmen and\nSwedenborg saw that things were representative. Men are also\nrepresentative; first, of things, and secondly, of ideas.\nAs plants convert the minerals into food for animals, so each man\nconverts some raw material in nature to human use. The inventors of\nfire, electricity, magnetism, iron; lead, glass, linen, silk, cotton;\nthe makers of tools; the inventor of decimal notation; the geometer;\nthe engineer; musician,--severally make an easy way for all, through\nunknown and impossible confusions. Each man is, by secret liking,\nconnected with some district of nature, whose agent and interpreter\nhe is, as Linnaeus, of plants; Huber, of bees; Fries, of lichens; Van\nMons, of pears; Dalton, of atomic forms; Euclid, of lines; Newton, of\nfluxions.\nA man is a center for nature, running out threads of relation through\neverything, fluid and solid, material and elemental. The earth rolls;\nevery clod and stone comes to the meridian; so every organ, function,\nacid, crystal, grain of dust, has its relation to the brain. It waits\nlong, but its turn comes. Each plant has its parasite, and each created\nthing its lover and poet. Justice has already been done to steam, to\niron, to wood, to coal, to loadstone, to iodine, to corn, and cotton;\nbut how few materials are yet used by our arts! The mass of creatures\nand of qualities are still hid and expectant. It would seem as if each\nwaited, like the enchanted princess in fairy tales, for a destined\nhuman deliverer. Each must be disenchanted, and walk forth to the day\nin human shape. In the history of discovery, the ripe and latent truth\nseems to have fashioned a brain for itself. A magnet must be made man,\nin some Gilbert, or Swedenborg, or Oersted, before the general mind\ncan come to entertain its powers.\nIf we limit ourselves to the first advantages;--a sober grace adheres\nto the mineral and botanic kingdoms, which, in the highest moments,\ncomes up as the charm of nature,--the glitter of the spar, the sureness\nof affinity, the veracity of angles. Light and darkness, heat and cold,\nhunger and food, sweet and sour, solid, liquid, and gas, circle us\nround in a wreath of pleasures, and, by their agreeable quarrel, beguile\nthe day of life. The eye repeats every day the finest eulogy on\nthings--\"He saw that they were good.\" We know where to find them; and\nthese performers are relished all the more, after a little experience\nof the pretending races. We are entitled, also, to higher advantages.\nSomething is wanting to science, until it has been humanized. The table\nof logarithms is one thing, and its vital play, in botany, music,\noptics, and architecture, another. There are advancements to numbers,\nanatomy, architecture, astronomy, little suspected at first, when, by\nunion with intellect and will, they ascend into the life, and re-appear\nin conversation, character and politics.\nBut this comes later. We speak now only of our acquaintance with them\nin their own sphere, and the way in which they seem to fascinate and\ndraw to them some genius who occupies himself with one thing, all his\nlife long. The possibility of interpretation lies in the identity of\nthe observer with the observed. Each material thing has its celestial\nside; has its translation, through humanity, into the spiritual and\nnecessary sphere, where it plays a part as indestructible as any other.\nAnd to these, their ends, all things continually ascend. The gases\ngather to the solid firmament; the chemic lump arrives at the plant,\nand grows; arrives at the quadruped, and walks; arrives at the man,\nand thinks. But also the constituency determines the vote of the\nrepresentative. He is not only representative, but participant. Like\ncan only be known by like. The reason why he knows about them is, that\nhe is of them; he has just come out of nature, or from being a part\nof that thing. Animated chlorine knows of chlorine, and incarnate zinc,\nof zinc. Their quality makes this career; and he can variously publish\ntheir virtues, because they compose him. Man, made of the dust of the\nworld, does not forget his origin; and all that is yet inanimate will\none day speak and reason. Unpublished nature will have its whole secret\ntold. Shall we say that quartz mountains will pulverize into innumerable\nWerners, Von Buchs, and Beaumonts; and the laboratory of the atmosphere\nholds in solution I know not what Berzeliuses and Davys?\nThus, we sit by the fire, and take hold on the poles of the earth.\nThis quasi omnipresence supplies the imbecility of our condition. In\none of those celestial days, when heaven and earth meet and adorn each\nother, it seems a poverty that we can only spend it once; we wish for\na thousand heads, a thousand bodies, that we might celebrate its immense\nbeauty in many ways and places. Is this fancy? Well, in good faith,\nwe are multiplied by our proxies. How easily we adopt their labors!\nEvery ship that comes to America got its chart from Columbus. Every\nnovel is debtor to Homer. Every carpenter who shaves with a foreplane\nborrows the genius of a forgotten inventor. Life is girt all around\nwith a zodiac of sciences, the contributions of men who have perished\nto add their point of light to our sky. Engineer, broker, jurist,\nphysician, moralist, theologian, and every man, inasmuch as he has any\nscience, is a definer and map-maker of the latitudes and longitudes\nof our condition. These road-makers on every hand enrich us. We must\nextend the area of life, and multiply our relations. We are as much\ngainers by finding a new property in the old earth, as by acquiring\na new planet.\nWe are too passive in the reception of these material or semi-material\naids. We must not be sacks and stomachs. To ascend one step,--we are\nbetter served through our sympathy. Activity is contagious. Looking\nwhere others look, and conversing with the same things, we catch the\ncharm which lured them. Napoleon said, \"you must not fight too often\nwith one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.\" Talk much\nwith any man of vigorous mind, and we acquire very fast the habit of\nlooking at things in the same light, and, on each occurrence, we\nanticipate his thought.\nMen are helpful through the intellect and the affections. Other help,\nI find a false appearance. If you affect to give me bread and fire,\nI perceive that I pay for it the full price, and at last it leaves me\nas it found me, neither better nor worse: but all mental and moral\nforce is a positive good. It goes out from you whether you will or\nnot, and profits me whom you never thought of. I cannot even hear of\npersonal vigor of any kind, great power of performance, without fresh\nresolution. We are emulous of all that man can do. Cecil's saying of\nSir Walter Raleigh, \"I know that he can toil terribly,\" is an electric\ntouch. So are Clarendon's portraits,--of Hampden; \"who was of an\nindustry and vigilance not to be tired out or wearied by the most\nlaborious, and of parts not to be imposed on by the most subtle and\nsharp, and of a personal courage equal to his best parts\"--of Falkland;\n\"who was so severe an adorer of truth, that he could as easily have\ngiven himself leave to steal, as to dissemble.\" We cannot read Plutarch,\nwithout a tingling of the blood; and I accept the saying of the Chinese\nMencius: \"As age is the instructor of a hundred ages. When the manners\nof Loo are heard of, the stupid become intelligent, and the wavering,\ndetermined.\"\nThis is the moral of biography; yet it is hard for departed men to\ntouch the quick like our own companions, whose names may not last as\nlong. What is he whom I never think of? whilst in every solitude are\nthose who succor our genius, and stimulate us in wonderful manners.\nThere is a power in love to divine another's destiny better than that\nother can, and by heroic encouragements, hold him to his task. What\nhas friendship so signaled as its sublime attraction to whatever virtue\nis in us? We will never more think cheaply of ourselves, or of life.\nWe are piqued to some purpose, and the industry of the diggers on the\nrailroad will not again shame us.\nUnder this head, too, falls that homage, very pure, as I think, which\nall ranks pay to the hero of the day, from Coriolanus and Gracchus,\ndown to Pitt, Lafayette, Wellington, Webster, Lamartine. Hear the\nshouts in the street! The people cannot see him enough. They delight\nin a man. Here is a head and a trunk! What a front! What eyes! Atlantean\nshoulders, and the whole carriage heroic, with equal inward force to\nguide the great machine! This pleasure of full expression to that\nwhich, in their private experience, is usually cramped and obstructed,\nruns, also, much higher, and is the secret of the reader's joy in\nliterary genius. Nothing is kept back. There is fire enough to fuse\nthe mountain of ore. Shakspeare's principal merit may be conveyed, in\nsaying that he, of all men, best understands the English language, and\ncan say what he will. Yet these unchoked channels and floodgates of\nexpression are only health or fortunate constitution. Shakspeare's\nname suggests other and purely intellectual benefits.\nSenates and sovereigns have no compliment, with their medals, swords,\nand armorial coats, like the addressing to a human being thoughts out\nof a certain height, and presupposing his intelligence. This honor,\nwhich is possible in personal intercourse scarcely twice in a lifetime,\ngenius perpetually pays; contented, if now and then, in a century, the\nproffer is accepted. The indicators of the values of matter are degraded\nto a sort of cooks and confectioners, on the appearance of the\nindicators of ideas. Genius is the naturalist or geographer of the\nsupersensible regions, and draws on their map; and, by acquainting us\nwith new fields of activity, cools our affection for the old. These\nare at once accepted as the reality, of which the world we have\nconversed with is the show.\nWe go to the gymnasium and the swimming-school to see the power and\nbeauty of the body; there is the like pleasure, and a higher benefit,\nfrom witnessing intellectual feats of all kinds; as, feats of memory,\nof mathematical combination, great power of abstraction, the\ntransmutings of the imagination, even versatility, and concentration,\nas these acts expose the invisible organs and members of the mind,\nwhich respond, member for member, to the parts of the body. For, we\nthus enter a new gymnasium, and learn to choose men by their truest\nmarks, taught, with Plato, \"to choose those who can, without aid from\nthe eyes, or any other sense, proceed to truth and to being.\" Foremost\namong these activities, are the summersaults, spells, and resurrections,\nwrought by the imagination. When this wakes, a man seems to multiply\nten times or a thousand times his force. It opens the delicious sense\nof indeterminate size, and inspires an audacious mental habit. We are\nas elastic as the gas of gunpowder, and a sentence in a book, or a\nword dropped in conversation, sets free our fancy, and instantly our\nheads are bathed with galaxies, and our feet tread the floor of the\nPit. And this benefit is real, because we are entitled to these\nenlargements, and, once having passed the bounds, shall never again\nbe quite the miserable pedants we were.\nThe high functions of the intellect are so allied, that some imaginative\npower usually appears in all eminent minds, even in arithmeticians of\nthe first class, but especially in meditative men of an intuitive habit\nof thought. This class serve us, so that they have the perception of\nidentity and the perception of reaction. The eyes of Plato, Shakespeare,\nSwedenborg, Goethe, never shut on either of these laws. The perception\nof these laws is a kind of metre of the mind. Little minds are little,\nthrough failure to see them.\nEven these feasts have their surfeit. Our delight in reason degenerates\ninto idolatry of the herald. Especially when a mind of powerful method\nhas instructed men, we find the examples of oppression. The dominion\nof Aristotle, the Ptolemaic astronomy, the credit of Luther, of Bacon,\nof Locke,--in religion the history of hierarchies, of saints, and the\nsects which have taken the name of each founder, are in point. Alas!\nevery man is such a victim. The imbecility of men is always inviting\nthe impudence of power. It is the delight of vulgar talent to dazzle\nand to bind the beholder. But true genius seeks to defend us from\nitself. True genius will not impoverish, but will liberate, and add\nnew senses. If a wise man should appear in our village, he would create,\nin those who conversed with him, a new consciousness of wealth, by\nopening their eyes to unobserved advantages; he would establish a sense\nof immovable equality, calm us with assurances that we could not be\ncheated; as every one would discern the checks and guaranties of\ncondition. The rich would see their mistakes and poverty, the poor\ntheir escapes and their resources.\nBut nature brings all this about in due time. Rotation is her remedy.\nThe soul is impatient of masters, and eager for change. Housekeepers\nsay of a domestic who has been valuable, \"She has lived with me long\nenough.\" We are tendencies, or rather, symptoms, and none of us\ncomplete. We touch and go, and sip the foam of many lives. Rotation\nis the law of nature. When nature removes a great man, people explore\nthe horizon for a successor; but none comes and none will. His class\nis extinguished with him. In some other and quite different field, the\nnext man will appear; not Jefferson, nor Franklin, but now a great\nsalesman; then a road-contractor; then a student of fishes; then a\nbuffalo-hunting explorer, or a semi-savage western general. Thus we\nmake a stand against our rougher masters; but against the best there\nis a finer remedy. The power which they communicate is not theirs.\nWhen we are exalted by ideas, we do not owe this to Plato, but to the\nidea, to which, also, Plato was debtor.\nI must not forget that we have a special debt to a single class. Life\nis a scale of degrees. Between rank and rank of our great men are wide\nintervals. Mankind have, in all ages, attached themselves to a few\npersons, who, either by the quality of that idea they embodied, or by\nthe largeness of their reception, were entitled to the position of\nleaders and law-givers. These teach us the qualities of primary\nnature,--admit us to the constitution of things. We swim, day by day,\non a river of delusions, and are effectually amused with houses and\ntowns in the air, of which the men about us are dupes. But life is a\nsincerity. In lucid intervals we say, \"Let there be an entrance opened\nfor me into realities; I have worn the fool's cap too long.\" We will\nknow the meaning of our economies and politics. Give us the cipher,\nand, if persons and things are scores of a celestial music, let us\nread off the strains. We have been cheated of our reason; yet there\nhave been sane men, who enjoyed a rich and related existence. What\nthey know, they know for us. With each new mind, a new secret of nature\ntranspires; nor can the Bible be closed, until the last great man is\nborn. These men correct the delirium of the animal spirits, make us\nconsiderate, and engage us to new aims and powers. The veneration of\nmankind selects these for the highest place. Witness the multitude of\nstatues, pictures, and memorials which recall their genius in every\ncity, village, house, and ship:--\n\"Ever their phantoms arise before us.\nOur loftier brothers, but one in blood;\nAt bed and table they lord it o'er us,\nWith looks of beauty, and words of good.\"\nHow to illustrate the distinctive benefit of ideas, the service rendered\nby those who introduce moral truths into the general mind?--I am\nplagued, in all my living, with a perpetual tariff of prices. If I\nwork in my garden, and prune an apple-tree, I am well enough\nentertained, and could continue indefinitely in the like occupation.\nBut it comes to mind that a day is gone, and I have got this precious\nnothing done. I go to Boston or New York, and run up and down on my\naffairs: they are sped, but so is the day. I am vexed by the\nrecollection of this price I have paid for a trifling advantage. I\nremember the _peau d'ane_, on which whoso sat should have his desire,\nbut a piece of the skin was gone for every wish. I go to a convention of\nphilanthropists. Do what I can, I cannot keep my eyes off the clock. But\nif there should appear in the company some gentle soul who knows little\nof persons or parties, of Carolina or Cuba, but who announces a law that\ndisposes these particulars, and so certifies me of the equity which\ncheckmates every false player, bankrupts every self-seeker, and apprises\nme of my independence on any conditions of country, or time, or human\nbody, that man liberates me; I forget the clock.\nI pass out of the sore relation to persons. I am healed of my hurts.\nI am made immortal by apprehending my possession of incorruptible\ngoods. Here is great competition of rich and poor. We live in a market,\nwhere is only so much wheat, or wool, or land; and if I have so much\nmore, every other must have so much less. I seem to have no good,\nwithout breach of good manners. Nobody is glad in the gladness of\nanother, and our system is one of war, of an injurious superiority.\nEvery child of the Saxon race is educated to wish to be first. It is\nour system; and a man comes to measure his greatness by the regrets,\nenvies, and hatreds of his competitors. But in these new fields there\nis room: here are no self-esteems, no exclusions.\nI admire great men of all classes, those who stand for facts, and for\nthoughts; I like rough and smooth \"Scourges of God,\" and \"Darlings of\nthe human race.\" I like the first Caesar; and Charles V., of Spain;\nand Charles XII., of Sweden; Richard Plantagenet; and Bonaparte, in\nFrance. I applaud a sufficient man, an officer, equal to his office;\ncaptains, ministers, senators. I like a master standing firm on legs\nof iron, well-born, rich, handsome, eloquent, loaded with advantages,\ndrawing all men by fascination into tributaries and supporters of his\npower. Sword and staff, or talents sword-like or staff-like, carry on\nthe work of the world. But I find him greater, when he can abolish\nhimself, and all heroes, by letting in this element of reason,\nirrespective of persons; this subtilizer, and irresistible upward\nforce, into our thought, destroying individualism; the power so great,\nthat the potentate is nothing. Then he is a monarch, who gives a\nconstitution to his people; a pontiff, who preaches the equality of\nsouls, and releases his servants from their barbarous homages; an\nemperor, who can spare his empire.\nBut I intended to specify, with a little minuteness, two or three\npoints of service. Nature never spares the opium or nepenthe; but\nwherever she mars her creature with some deformity or defect, lays her\npoppies plentifully on the bruise, and the sufferer goes joyfully\nthrough life, ignorant of the ruin, and incapable of seeing it, though\nall the world point their finger at it every day. The worthless and\noffensive members of society, whose existence is a social pest,\ninvariably think themselves the most ill-used people alive, and never\nget over their astonishment at the ingratitude and selfishness of their\ncontemporaries. Our globe discovers its hidden virtues, not only in\nheroes and archangels, but in gossips and nurses. Is it not a rare\ncontrivance that lodged the due inertia in every creature, the\nconserving, resisting energy, the anger at being waked or changed?\nAltogether independent of the intellectual force in each, is the pride\nof opinion, the security that we are right. Not the feeblest grandame,\nnot a mowing idiot, but uses what spark of perception and faculty is\nleft, to chuckle and triumph in his or her opinion over the absurdities\nof all the rest. Difference from me is the measure of absurdity. Not\none has a misgiving of being wrong. Was it not a bright thought that\nmade things cohere with this bitumen, fastest of cements? But, in the\nmidst of this chuckle of self-gratulation, some figure goes by, which\nThersites too can love and admire. This is he that should marshal us\nthe way we were going. There is no end to his aid. Without Plato, we\nshould almost lose our faith in the possibility of a reasonable book.\nWe seem to want but one, but we want one. We love to associate with\nheroic persons, since our receptivity is unlimited; and, with the\ngreat, our thoughts and manners easily become great. We are all wise\nin capacity, though so few in energy. There needs but one wise man in\na company, and all are wise, so rapid is the contagion.\nGreat men are thus a collyrium to clear our eyes from egotism, and\nenable us to see other people and their works. But there are vices and\nfollies incident to whole populations and ages. Men resemble their\ncontemporaries, even more than their progenitors. It is observed in\nold couples, or in persons who have been housemates for a course of\nyears, that they grow alike; and, if they should live long enough, we\nshould not be able to know them apart. Nature abhors these\ncomplaisances, which threaten to melt the world into a lump, and hastens\nto break up such maudlin agglutinations. The like assimilation goes\non between men of one town, of one sect, of one political party; and\nthe ideas of the time are in the air, and infect all who breathe it.\nViewed from any high point, the city of New York, yonder city of London,\nthe western civilization, would seem a bundle of insanities. We keep\neach other in countenance, and exasperate by emulation the frenzy of\nthe time. The shield against the stingings of conscience, is the\nuniversal practice, or our contemporaries. Again; it is very easy to\nbe as wise and good as your companions. We learn of our contemporaries,\nwhat they know, without effort, and almost through the pores of the\nskin. We catch it by sympathy, or, as a wife arrives at the intellectual\nand moral elevations of her husband. But we stop where they stop. Very\nhardly can we take another step. The great, or such as hold of nature,\nand transcend fashions, by their fidelity to universal ideas, are\nsaviors from these federal errors, and defend us from our\ncontemporaries. They are the exceptions which we want, where all grows\nalike. A foreign greatness is the antidote for cabalism.\nThus we feed on genius, and refresh ourselves from too much conversation\nwith our mates, and exult in the depth of nature in that direction in\nwhich he leads us. What indemnification is one great man for populations\nof pigmies! Every mother wishes one son a genius, though all the rest\nshould be mediocre. But a new danger appears in the excess of influence\nof the great man. His attractions warp us from our place. We have\nbecome underlings and intellectual suicides. Ah! yonder in the horizon\nis our help:--other great men, new qualities, counterweights and\nchecks on each other. We cloy of the honey of each peculiar greatness.\nEvery hero becomes a bore at last. Perhaps Voltaire was not bad-hearted,\nyet he said of the good Jesus, even, \"I pray you, let me never hear\nthat man's name again.\" They cry up the virtues of George\nWashington,--\"Damn George Washington!\" is the poor Jacobin's whole\nspeech and confutation. But it is human nature's indispensable defense.\nThe centripetence augments the centrifugence. We balance one man with\nhis opposite, and the health of the state depends on the see-saw.\nThere is, however, a speedy limit to the use of heroes. Every genius\nis defended from approach by quantities of availableness. They are\nvery attractive, and seem at a distance our own: but we are hindered\non all sides from approach. The more we are drawn, the more we are\nrepelled. There is something not solid in the good that is done for\nus. The best discovery the discoverer makes for himself. It has\nsomething unreal for his companion, until he too has substantiated it.\nIt seems as if the Deity dressed each soul which he sends into nature\nin certain virtues and powers not communicable to other men, and,\nsending it to perform one more turn through the circle of beings, wrote\n\"Not transferable,\" and \"Good for this trip only,\" on these garments\nof the soul. There is somewhat deceptive about the intercourse of\nminds. The boundaries are invisible, but they are never crossed. There\nis such good will to impart, and such good will to receive, that each\nthreatens to become the other; but the law of individuality collects\nits secret strength: you are you, and I am I, and so we remain.\nFor Nature wishes every thing to remain itself; and, whilst every\nindividual strives to grow and exclude, and to exclude and grow, to\nthe extremities of the universe, and to impose the law of its being\non every other creature, Nature steadily aims to protect each against\nevery other. Each is self-defended. Nothing is more marked than the\npower by which individuals are guarded from individuals, in a world\nwhere every benefactor becomes so easily a malefactor, only by\ncontinuation of his activity into places where it is not due; where\nchildren seem so much at the mercy of their foolish parents, and where\nalmost all men are too social and interfering. We rightly speak of the\nguardian angels of children. How superior in their security from\ninfusions of evil persons, from vulgarity and second thought! They\nshed their own abundant beauty on the objects they behold. Therefore,\nthey are not at the mercy of such poor educators as we adults. If we\nhuff and chide them, they soon come not to mind it, and get a\nself-reliance; and if we indulge them to folly, they learn the\nlimitation elsewhere.\nWe need not fear excessive influence. A more generous trust is\npermitted. Serve the great. Stick at no humiliation. Grudge no office\nthou canst render. Be the limb of their body, the breath of their\nmouth. Compromise thy egotism. Who cares for that, so thou gain aught\nwider and nobler? Never mind the taunt of Boswellism: the devotion may\neasily be greater than the wretched pride which is guarding its own\nskirts. Be another: not thyself, but a Platonist; not a soul, but a\nChristian; not a naturalist, but a Cartesian; not a poet, but a\nShakspearian. In vain, the wheels of tendency will not stop, nor will\nall the forces of inertia, fear, or love itself, hold thee there. On,\nand forever onward! The microscope observes a monad or wheel-insect\namong the infusories circulating in water. Presently, a dot appears\non the animal, which enlarges to a slit, and it becomes two perfect\nanimals. The ever-proceeding detachment appears not less in all thought,\nand in society. Children think they cannot live without their parents.\nBut, long before they are aware of it, the black dot has appeared, and\nthe detachment taken place. Any accident will now reveal to them their\nindependence.\nBut great men:--the word is injurious. Is there caste? is there fate?\nWhat becomes of the promise to virtue? The thoughtful youth laments\nthe superfoetation of nature. \"Generous and handsome,\" he says, \"is\nyour hero; but look at yonder poor Paddy, whose country is his\nwheelbarrow; look at his whole nation of Paddies.\" Why are the masses,\nfrom the dawn of history down, food for knives and powder? The idea\ndignifies a few leaders, who have sentiment, opinion, love,\nself-devotion; and they make war and death sacred;--but what for the\nwretches whom they hire and kill? The cheapness of man is every day's\ntragedy. It is as real a loss that others should be low, as that we\nshould be low; for we must have society.\nIs it a reply to these suggestions, to say, society is a Pestalozzian\nschool; all are teachers and pupils in turn. We are equally served by\nreceiving and by imparting. Men who know the same things, are not long\nthe best company for each other. But bring to each an intelligent\nperson of another experience, and it is as if you let off water from\na lake, by cutting a lower basin. It seems a mechanical advantage, and\ngreat benefit it is to each speaker, as he can now paint out his thought\nto himself. We pass very fast, in our personal moods, from dignity to\ndependence. And if any appear never to assume the chair, but always\nto stand and serve, it is because we do not see the company in a\nsufficiently long period for the whole rotation of parts to come about.\nAs to what we call the masses, and common men;--there are no common\nmen. All men are at last of a size; and true art is only possible, on\nthe conviction that every talent has its apotheosis somewhere. Fair\nplay, and an open field, and freshest laurels to all who have won them!\nBut heaven reserves an equal scope for every creature. Each is uneasy\nuntil he has produced his private ray unto the concave sphere, and\nbeheld his talent also in its last nobility and exaltation.\nThe heroes of the hour are relatively great: of a faster growth; or\nthey are such, in whom, at the moment of success, a quality is ripe\nwhich is then in request. Other days will demand other qualities. Some\nrays escape the common observer, and want a finely adapted eye. Ask\nthe great man if there be none greater. His companions are; and not\nthe less great, but the more, that society cannot see them. Nature\nnever sends a great man into the planet, without confiding the secret\nto another soul.\nOne gracious fact emerges from these studies,--that there is true\nascension in our love. The reputations of the nineteenth century will\none day be quoted to prove its barbarism. The genius of humanity is\nthe real subject whose biography is written in our annals. We must\ninfer much, and supply many chasms in the record. The history of the\nuniverse is symptomatic, and life is mnemonical. No man, in all the\nprocession of famous men, is reason or illumination, or that essence\nwe were looking for; but is an exhibition, in some quarter, of new\npossibilities. Could we one day complete the immense figure which these\nflagrant points compose! The study of many individuals leads us to an\nelemental region wherein the individual is lost, or wherein all touch\nby their summits. Thought and feeling, that break out there, cannot\nbe impounded by any fence of personality. This is the key to the power\nof the greatest men,--their spirit diffuses itself. A new quality of\nmind travels by night and by day, in concentric circles from its origin,\nand publishes itself by unknown methods: the union of all minds appears\nintimate: what gets admission to one, cannot be kept out of any other:\nthe smallest acquisition of truth or of energy, in any quarter, is so\nmuch good to the commonwealth of souls. If the disparities of talent\nand position vanish, when the individuals are seen in the duration\nwhich is necessary to complete the career of each; even more swiftly\nthe seeming injustice disappears, when we ascend to the central identity\nof all the individuals, and know that they are made of the same\nsubstance which ordaineth and doeth.\nThe genius of humanity is the right point of view of history. The\nqualities abide; the men who exhibit them have now more, now less, and\npass away; the qualities remain on another brow. No experience is more\nfamiliar. Once you saw phoenixes: they are gone; the world is not\ntherefore disenchanted. The vessels on which you read sacred emblems\nturn out to be common pottery; but the sense of the pictures is sacred,\nand you may still read them transferred to the walls of the world. For\na time, our teachers serve us personally, as metres or milestones of\nprogress. Once they were angels of knowledge, and their figures touched\nthe sky. Then we drew near, saw their means, culture, and limits; and\nthey yielded their places to other geniuses. Happy, if a few names\nremain so high, that we have not been able to read them nearer, and\nage and comparison have not robbed them of a ray. But, at last, we\nshall cease to look in men for completeness, and shall content ourselves\nwith their social and delegated quality. All that respects the\nindividual is temporary and prospective, like the individual himself,\nwho is ascending out of his limits, into a catholic existence. We have\nnever come at the true and best benefit of any genius, so long as we\nbelieve him an original force. In the moment when he ceases to help\nus as a cause, he begins to help us move as an effect. Then he appears\nas an exponent of a vaster mind and will. The opaque self becomes\ntransparent with the light of the First Cause.\nYet, within the limits of human education and agency, we may say, great\nmen exist that there may be greater men. The destiny of organized\nnature is amelioration, and who can tell its limits? It is for man to\ntame the chaos; on every side, whilst he lives, to scatter the seeds\nof science and of song, that climate, corn, animals, men, may be milder,\nand the germs of love and benefit may be multiplied.\nII. PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER.\nAmong books, Plato only is entitled to Omar's fanatical compliment to\nthe Koran, when he said, \"Burn the libraries; for, their value is in\nthis book.\" These sentences contain the culture of nations; these are\nthe corner-stone of schools; these are the fountain-head of literatures.\nA discipline it is in logic, arithmetic, taste, symmetry, poetry,\nlanguage, rhetoric, ontology, morals, or practical wisdom. There was\nnever such range of speculation. Out of Plato come all things that are\nstill written and debated among men of thought. Great havoc makes he\namong our originalities. We have reached the mountain from which all\nthese drift bowlders were detached. The Bible of the learned for twenty-\ntwo hundred years, every brisk young man, who says in succession fine\nthings to each reluctant generation,--Boethius, Rabelais, Erasmus,\nBruno, Locke, Rousseau, Alfieri, Coleridge,--is some reader of Plato,\ntranslating into the vernacular, wittily, his good things. Even the\nmen of grander proportion suffer some deduction from the misfortune\n(shall I say?) of coming after this exhausting generalizer. St.\nAugustine, Copernicus, Newton, Behmen, Swedenborg, Goethe, are likewise\nhis debtors, and must say after him. For it is fair to credit the\nbroadest generalizer with all the particulars deducible from his thesis.\nPlato is philosophy, and philosophy, Plato,--at once the glory and the\nshame of mankind, since neither Saxon nor Roman have availed to add\nany idea to his categories. No wife, no children had he, and the\nthinkers of all civilized nations are his posterity, and are tinged\nwith his mind. How many great men Nature is incessantly sending up out\nof night, to be his men,--Platonists! the Alexandrians, a constellation\nof genius; the Elizabethans, not less; Sir Thomas More, Henry More,\nJohn Hales, John Smith, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor, Ralph Cudworth,\nSydenham, Thomas Taylor; Marcilius Ficinus, and Picus Mirandola.\nCalvinism is in his Phaedo: Christianity is in it. Mahometanism draws\nall its philosophy, in its hand-book of morals, the Akhlak-y-Jalaly,\nfrom him. Mysticism finds in Plato all its texts. This citizen of a\ntown in Greece is no villager nor patriot. An Englishman reads and\nsays, \"how English!\" a German--\"how Teutonic!\" an Italian--\"how Roman\nand how Greek!\" As they say that Helen of Argos had that universal\nbeauty that everybody felt related to her, so Plato seems, to a reader\nin New England, an American genius. His broad humanity transcends all\nsectional lines.\nThis range of Plato instructs us what to think of the vexed question\nconcerning his reputed works,--what are genuine, what spurious. It is\nsingular that wherever we find a man higher, by a whole head, than any\nof his contemporaries, it is sure to come into doubt, what are his\nreal works. Thus, Homer, Plato, Raffaelle, Shakspeare. For these men\nmagnetize their contemporaries, so that their companions can do for\nthem what they can never do for themselves; and the great man does\nthus live in several bodies; and write, or paint, or act, by many\nhands; and after some time, it is not easy to say what is the authentic\nwork of the master, and what is only of his school.\nPlato, too, like every great man, consumed his own times. What is a\ngreat man, but one of great affinities, who takes up into himself all\narts, sciences, all knowables, as his food? He can spare nothing; he\ncan dispose of everything. What is not good for virtue is good for\nknowledge. Hence his contemporaries tax him with plagiarism. But the\ninventor only knows how to borrow; and society is glad to forget the\ninnumerable laborers who ministered to this architect, and reserves\nall its gratitude for him. When we are praising Plato, it seems we are\npraising quotations from Solon, and Sophron, and Philolaus. Be it so.\nEvery book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all\nforests, and mines, and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation\nfrom all his ancestors. And this grasping inventor puts all nations\nunder contribution.\nPlato absorbed the learning of his times,--Philolaus, Timaeus,\nHeraclitus, Parmenides, and what else; then his master, Socrates; and\nfinding himself still capable of a larger synthesis,--beyond all example\nthen or since,--he traveled into Italy, to gain what Pythagoras had\nfor him; then into Egypt, and perhaps still further east, to import\nthe other element, which Europe wanted, into the European mind. This\nbreadth entitles him to stand as the representative of philosophy. He\nsays, in the Republic, \"Such a genius as philosophers must of necessity\nhave, is wont but seldom, in all its parts, to meet in one man; but\nits different parts generally spring up in different persons.\" Every\nman, who would do anything well, must come to it from a higher ground.\nA philosopher must be more than a philosopher. Plato is clothed with\nthe powers of a poet, stands upon the highest place of the poet, and\n(though I doubt he wanted the decisive gift of lyric expression) mainly\nis not a poet, because he chose to use the poetic gift to an ulterior\npurpose.\nGreat geniuses have the shortest biographies. Their cousins can tell\nyou nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their\nhouse and street life was trivial and commonplace. If you would know\ntheir tastes and complexions, the most admiring of their readers most\nresembles them. Plato, especially, has no external biography. If he\nhad lover, wife, or children, we hear nothing of them. He ground them\nall into paint. As a good chimney burns its smoke, so a philosopher\nconverts the value of all his fortunes into his intellectual\nperformances.\nHe was born 430 A. C., about the time of the death of Pericles; was\nof patrician connection in his times and city; and is said to have had\nan early inclination for war; but in his twentieth year, meeting with\nSocrates, was easily dissuaded from this pursuit, and remained for ten\nyears his scholar, until the death of Socrates. He then went to Megara;\naccepted the invitations of Dion and of Dionysius, to the court of\nSicily; and went thither three times, though very capriciously treated.\nHe traveled into Italy; then into Egypt, where he stayed a long time;\nsome say three,--some say thirteen years. It is said, he went farther,\ninto Babylonia: this is uncertain. Returning to Athens, he gave lessons,\nin the Academy, to those whom his fame drew thither; and died, as we\nhave received it, in the act of writing, at eighty-one years.\nBut the biography of Plato is interior. We are to account for the\nsupreme elevation of this man, in the intellectual history of our\nrace,--how it happens that, in proportion to the culture of men, they\nbecome his scholars; that, as our Jewish Bible has implanted itself\nin the table-talk and household life of every man and woman in the\nEuropean and American nations, so the writings of Plato have\npre-occupied every school of learning, every lover of thought, every\nchurch, every poet,--making it impossible to think, on certain levels,\nexcept through him. He stands between the truth and every man's mind,\nand has almost impressed language, and the primary forms of thought,\nwith his name and seal. I am struck, in reading him, with the extreme\nmodernness of his style and spirit. Here is the germ of that Europe\nwe know so well, in its long history of arts and arms; here are all\nits traits, already discernible in the mind of Plato,--and in none\nbefore him. It has spread itself since into a hundred histories, but\nhas added no new element. This perpetual modernness is the measure of\nmerit, in every work of art; since the author of it was not misled by\nanything shortlived or local, but abode by real and abiding traits.\nHow Plato came thus to be Europe, and philosophy, and almost literature,\nis the problem for us to solve.\nThis could not have happened, without a sound, sincere, and catholic\nman, able to honor, at the same time, the ideal, or laws of the mind,\nand fate, or the order of nature. The first period of a nation, as of\nan individual, is the period of unconscious strength. Children cry,\nscream and stamp with fury, unable to express their desires. As soon\nas they can speak and tell their want, and the reason of it, they\nbecome gentle. In adult life, whilst the perceptions are obtuse, men\nand women talk vehemently and superlatively, blunder and quarrel; their\nmanners are full of desperation; their speech is full of oaths. As\nsoon as, with culture, things have cleared up a little, and they see\nthem no longer in lumps and masses, but accurately distributed, they\ndesist from that weak vehemence, and explain their meaning in detail.\nIf the tongue had not been framed for articulation, man would still\nbe a beast in the forest. The same weakness and want, on a higher\nplane, occurs daily in the education of ardent young men and women.\n\"Ah! you don't understand me; I have never met with any one who\ncomprehends me:\" and they sigh and weep, write verses, and walk\nalone,--fault of power to express their precise meaning. In a month\nor two, through the favor of their good genius, they meet some one so\nrelated as to assist their volcanic estate; and, good communication\nbeing once established, they are thenceforward good citizens. It is\never thus. The progress is to accuracy, to skill, to truth, from blind\nforce.\nThere is a moment, in the history of every nation, when, proceeding\nout of this brute youth, the perceptive powers reach their ripeness,\nand have not yet become microscopic: so that man, at that instant,\nextends across the entire scale; and, with his feet still planted on\nthe immense forces of night, converses, by his eyes and brain, with\nsolar and stellar creation. That is the moment of adult health, the\nculmination of power.\nSuch is the history of Europe, in all points; and such in philosophy.\nIts early records, almost perished, are of the immigrations from Asia,\nbringing with them the dreams of barbarians; a confusion of crude\nnotions of morals, and of natural philosophy, gradually subsiding,\nthrough the partial insight of single teachers.\nBefore Pericles, came the Seven Wise Masters; and we have the beginnings\nof geometry, metaphysics, and ethics: then the partialists,--deducing\nthe origin of things from flux or water, or from air, or from fire,\nor from mind. All mix with these causes mythologic pictures. At last,\ncomes Plato, the distributor, who needs no barbaric paint, or tattoo,\nor whooping; for he can define. He leaves with Asia the vast and\nsuperlative; he is the arrival of accuracy and intelligence. \"He shall\nbe as a god to me, who can rightly divide and define.\"\nThis defining is philosophy. Philosophy is the account which the human\nmind gives to itself of the constitution of the world. Two cardinal\nfacts lie forever at the base: the one, and the two.--1. Unity, or\nIdentity; and, 2, Variety. We unite all things, by perceiving the law\nwhich pervades them; by perceiving the superficial differences, and\nthe profound resemblances. But every mental act,--this very perception\nof identity or oneness, recognizes the difference of things. Oneness\nand otherness. It is impossible to speak, or to think, without embracing\nboth.\nThe mind is urged to ask for one cause of many effects; then for the\ncause of that; and again the cause, diving still into the profound;\nself-assured that it shall arrive at an absolute and sufficient one,--a\none that shall be all. \"In the midst of the sun is the light, in the\nmidst of the light is truth, and in the midst of truth is the\nimperishable being, \"say the Vedas. All philosophy, of east and west,\nhas the same centripetence. Urged by an opposite necessity, the mind\nreturns from the one, to that which is not one, but other or many;\nfrom cause to effect; and affirms the necessary existence of variety,\nthe self-existence of both, as each is involved in the other. These\nstrictly-blended elements it is the problem of thought to separate,\nand to reconcile. Their existence is mutually contradictory and\nexclusive; and each so fast slides into the other, that we can never\nsay what is one, and what it is not. The Proteus is as nimble in the\nhighest as in the lowest grounds, when we contemplate the one, the\ntrue, the good,--as in the surfaces and extremities of matter.  In all\nnations, there are minds which incline to dwell in the conception of\nthe fundamental Unity. The raptures of prayer and ecstasy of devotion\nlose all being in one Being. This tendency finds its highest expression\nin the religious writings of the East, and chiefly, in the Indian\nScriptures, in the Vedas, the Bhagavat Geeta, and the Vishnu Purana.\nThose writings contain little else than this idea, and they rise to\npure and sublime strains in celebrating it.\nThe Same, the Same! friend and foe are of one stuff; the ploughman,\nthe plough, and the furrow, are of one stuff; and the stuff is such,\nand so much, that the variations of forms are unimportant. \"You are\nfit\" (says the supreme Krishna to a sage) \"to apprehend that you are\nnot distinct from me. That which I am, thou art, and that also is this\nworld, with its gods, and heroes, and mankind. Men contemplate\ndistinctions, because they are stupefied with ignorance.\" \"The words\nI and mine constitute ignorance. What is the great end of all, you\nshall now learn from me. It is soul,--one in all bodies, pervading,\nuniform, perfect, preeminent over nature, exempt from birth, growth,\nand decay, omnipresent, made up of true knowledge, independent,\nunconnected with unrealities, with name, species, and the rest, in\ntime past, present, and to come. The knowledge that this spirit, which\nis essentially one, is in one's own, and in all other bodies, is the\nwisdom of one who knows the unity of things. As one diffusive air,\npassing through the perforations of a flute, is distinguished as the\nnotes of a scale, so the nature of the Great Spirit is single, though\nits forms be manifold, arising from the consequences of acts. When the\ndifference of the investing form, as that of god, or the rest, is\ndestroyed, there is no distinction.\" \"The whole world is but a\nmanifestation of Vishnu, who is identical with all things, and is to\nbe regarded by the wise, as not differing from, but as the same as\nthemselves. I neither am going nor coming; nor is my dwelling in any\none place; nor art thou, thou; nor are others, others; nor am I, I.\"\nAs if he had said, \"All is for the soul, and the soul is Vishnu; and\nanimals and stars are transient painting; and light is whitewash; and\ndurations are deceptive; and form is imprisonment; and heaven itself\na decoy.\" That which the soul seeks is resolution into being, above\nform, out of Tartarus, and out of heaven,--liberation from nature.\nIf speculation tends thus to a terrific unity, in which all things are\nabsorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is\nthe course of gravitation of mind; the second is the power of nature.\nNature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature\nopens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate\nall things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; the other,\nintellect; one is necessity; the other, freedom; one, rest; the other,\nmotion; one, power; the other, distribution; one, strength; the other,\npleasure; one, consciousness; the other, definition; one, genius; the\nother, talent, one, earnestness; the other, knowledge; one, possession;\nthe other, trade; one, caste; the other, culture; one king; the other,\ndemocracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher,\nand name the last tendency of both, we might say, that the end of the\none is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of the\nother is the highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive\ndeity.\nEach student adheres, by temperament and by habit, to the first or to\nthe second of these gods of the mind. By religion, he tends to unity;\nby intellect, or by the senses, to the many. A too rapid unification,\nand an excessive appliance to parts and particulars, are the twin\ndangers of speculation.\nTo this partiality the history of nations corresponded. The country\nof unity, of immovable institutions, the seat of a philosophy delighting\nin abstractions, of men faithful in doctrine and in practice to the\nidea of a deaf, unimplorable, immense fate, is Asia; and it realizes\nthis fate in the social institution of caste. On the other side, the\ngenius of Europe is active and creative; it resists caste by culture;\nits philosophy was a discipline; it is a land of arts, inventions,\ntrade, freedom. If the East loved infinity, the West delighted in\nboundaries.\nEuropean civility is the triumph of talent, the extension of system,\nthe sharpened understanding, adaptive skill, delight in forms, delight\nin manifestation, in comprehensible results. Pericles, Athens, Greece,\nhad been working in this element with the joy of genius not yet chilled\nby any foresight of the detriment of an excess. They saw before them\nno sinister political economy; no ominous Malthus; no Paris or London;\nno pitiless subdivision of classes,--the doom of the pinmakers, the\ndoom of the weavers, of dressers, of stockingers, of carders, of\nspinners, of colliers; no Ireland; no Indian caste, superinduced by\nthe efforts of Europe to throw it off. The understanding was in its\nhealth and prime. Art was in its splendid novelty. They cut the\nPentelican marble as if it were snow, and their perfect works in\narchitecture and sculpture seemed things of course, not more difficult\nthan the completion of a new ship at the Medford yards, or new mills\nat Lowell. These things are in course, and may be taken for granted.\nThe Roman legion, Byzantine legislation, English trade, the saloons\nof Versailles, the cafes of Paris, the steam-mill, steamboat,\nsteam-coach, may all be seen in perspective; the town-meeting, the\nballot-box, the newspaper and cheap press.\nMeantime, Plato, in Egypt, and in Eastern pilgrimages, imbibed the\nidea of one Deity, in which all things are absorbed. The unity of Asia,\nand the detail of Europe; the infinitude of the Asiatic soul, and the\ndefining, result-loving, machine-making, surface-seeking, opera-going\nEurope,--Plato came to join, and by contact to enhance the energy of\neach. The excellence of Europe and Asia are in his brain. Metaphysics\nand natural philosophy expressed the genius of Europe; he substructs\nthe religion of Asia, as the base.\nIn short, a balanced soul was born, perceptive of the two elements.\nIt is as easy to be great as to be small. The reason why we do not at\nonce believe in admirable souls, is because they are not in our\nexperience. In actual life, they are so rare, as to be incredible;\nbut, primarily, there is not only no presumption against them, but the\nstrongest presumption in favor of their appearance. But whether voices\nwere heard in the sky, or not; whether his mother or his father dreamed\nthat the infant man-child was the son of Apollo; whether a swarm of\nbees settled on his lips, or not; a man who could see two sides of a\nthing was born. The wonderful synthesis so familiar in nature; the\nupper and the under side of the medal of Jove; the union of\nimpossibilities, which reappears in every object; its real and its\nideal power,--was now, also, transferred entire to the consciousness\nof a man.\nThe balanced soul came. If he loved abstract truth, he saved himself\nby propounding the most popular of all principles, the absolute good,\nwhich rules rulers, and judges the judge. If he made transcendental\ndistinctions, he fortified himself by drawing all his illustrations\nfrom sources disdained by orators, and polite conversers; from mares\nand puppies; from pitchers and soup-ladles; from cooks and criers;\nthe shops of potters, horse-doctors, butchers, and fishmongers. He\ncannot forgive in himself a partiality, but is resolved that the two\npoles of thought shall appear in his statement. His arguments and his\nsentences are self-poised and spherical. The two poles appear; yes,\nand become two hands, to grasp and appropriate their own.\nEvery great artist has been such by synthesis. Our strength is\ntransitional, alternating; or, shall I say, a thread of two strands.\nThe seashore, sea seen from shore, shore seen from sea; the taste of\ntwo metals in contact; and our enlarged powers at the approach and at\nthe departure of a friend; the experience of poetic creativeness, which\nis not found in staying at home, nor yet in traveling, but in\ntransitions from one to the other, which must therefore be adroitly\nmanaged to present as much transitional surface as possible; this\ncommand of two elements must explain the power and charm of Plato. Art\nexpresses the one, or the same by the different. Thought seeks to know\nunity in unity; poetry to show it by variety; that is, always by an\nobject or symbol. Plato keeps the two vases, one of aether and one of\npigment, at his side, and invariably uses both. Things added to things,\nas statistics, civil history, are inventories. Things used as language\nare inexhaustibly attractive. Plato turns incessantly the obverse and\nthe reverse of the medal of Jove.\nTo take an example:--The physical philosophers have sketched each his\ntheory of the world; the theory of atoms, of fire, of flux, of spirit;\ntheories mechanical and chemical in their genius. Plato, a master of\nmathematics, studious of all natural laws and causes, feels these, as\nsecond causes, to be no theories of the world, but bare inventories\nand lists. To the study of nature he therefore prefixes the dogma,--\"Let\nus declare the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and\ncompose the universe. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of\nenvy. Exempt from envy, he wished that all things should be as much\nas possible like himself. Whosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit\nthis as the prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world,\nwill be in the truth.\" \"All things are for the sake of the good, and\nit is the cause of everything beautiful.\" This dogma animates and\nimpersonates his philosophy. The synthesis which makes the character\nof his mind appears in all his talents. Where there is great compass\nof wit, we usually find excellencies that combine easily in the living\nman, but in description appear incompatible. The mind of Plato is not\nto be exhibited by a Chinese catalogue, but is to be apprehended by\nan original mind in the exercise of its original power. In him the\nfreest abandonment is united with the precision of a geometer. His\ndaring imagination gives him the more solid grasp of facts; as the\nbirds of highest flight have the strongest alar bones. His patrician\npolish, his intrinsic elegance, edged by an irony so subtle that it\nstings and paralyzes, adorn the soundest health and strength of frame.\nAccording to the old sentence, \"If Jove should descend to the earth,\nhe would speak in the style of Plato.\"\nWith this palatial air, there is, for the direct aim of several of his\nworks, and running through the tenor of them all, a certain earnestness,\nwhich mounts, in the Republic, and in the Phaedo, to piety. He has\nbeen charged with feigning sickness at the time of the death of\nSocrates. But the anecdotes that have come down from the times attest\nhis manly interference before the people in his master's behalf, since\neven the savage cry of the assembly to Plato is preserved; and the\nindignation towards popular government, in many of his pieces, expresses\na personal exasperation. He has a probity, a native reverence for\njustice and honor, and a humanity which makes him tender for the\nsuperstitions of the people. Add to this, he believes that poetry,\nprophecy, and the high insight, arc from a wisdom of which man is not\nmaster; that the gods never philosophize; but, by a celestial mania,\nthese miracles are accomplished. Horsed on these winged steeds, he\nsweeps the dim regions, visits worlds which flesh cannot enter; he saw\nthe souls in pain; he hears the doom of the judge; he beholds the penal\nmetempsychosis; the Fates, with the rock and shears; and hears the\nintoxicating hum of their spindle.\nBut his circumspection never forsook him. One would say, he had read\nthe inscription on the gates of Busyrane,--\"Be bold;\" and on the second\ngate,--\"Be bold, be bold and evermore be bold;\" and then again he\npaused well at the third gate,--\"Be not too bold.\" His strength is\nlike the momentum of a falling planet; and his discretion, the return\nof its due and perfect curve,--so excellent is his Greek love of\nboundary, and his skill in definition. In reading logarithms, one is\nnot more secure, than in following Plato in his flights. Nothing can\nbe colder than his head, when the lightnings of his imagination are\nplaying in the sky. He has finished his thinking, before he brings it\nto the reader; and he abounds in the surprises of a literary master.\nHe has that opulence which furnishes, at every turn, the precise weapon\nhe needs. As the rich man wears no more garments, drives no more horses,\nsits in no more chambers, than the poor,--but has that one dress, or\nequipage, or instrument, which is fit for the hour and the need; so\nPlato, in his plenty, is never restricted, but has the fit word. There\nis, indeed, no weapon in all the armory of wit which he did not possess\nand use,--epic, analysis, mania, intuition, music, satire, and irony,\ndown to the customary and polite. His illustrations are poetry and his\njests illustrations. Socrates' profession of obstetric art is good\nphilosophy; and his finding that word \"cookery,\" and \"adulatory art,\"\nfor rhetoric, in the Gorgias, does us a substantial service still. No\norator can measure in effect with him who can give good nicknames.\nWhat moderation, and understatement, and checking his thunder in mid\nvolley! He has good-naturedly furnished the courtier and citizen with\nall that can be said against the schools. \"For philosophy is an elegant\nthing, if any one modestly meddles with it; but, if he is conversant\nwith it more than is becoming, it corrupts the man.\" He could well\nafford to be generous,--he, who from the sunlike centrality and reach\nof his vision, had a faith without cloud. Such as his perception, was\nhis speech: he plays with the doubt, and makes the most of it: he\npaints and quibbles; and by and by comes a sentence that moves the sea\nand land. The admirable earnest comes not only at intervals, in the\nperfect yes and no of the dialogue, but in bursts of light. \"I,\ntherefore, Callicles, am persuaded by these accounts, and consider how\nI may exhibit my soul before the judge in a healthy condition.\nWherefore, disregarding the honors that most men value, and looking\nto the truth, I shall endeavor in reality to live as virtuously as I\ncan and, when I die, to die so. And I invite all other men, to the\nutmost of my power; and you, too, I in turn invite to this contest,\nwhich, I affirm, surpasses all contests here.\"\nHe is a great average man one who, to the best thinking, adds a\nproportion and equality in his faculties, so that men see in him their\nown dreams and glimpses made available, and made to pass for what they\nare. A great common sense is his warrant and qualification to be the\nworld's interpreter. He has reason, as all the philosophic and poetic\nclass have: but he has, also, what they have not,--this strong solving\nsense to reconcile his poetry with the appearances of the world, and\nbuild a bridge from the streets of cities to the Atlantis. He omits\nnever this graduation, but slopes his thought, however picturesque the\nprecipice on one side, to an access from the plain. He never writes\nin ecstasy, or catches us up into poetic rapture.\nPlato apprehended the cardinal facts. He could prostrate himself on\nthe earth, and cover his eyes, whilst he adorned that which cannot be\nnumbered, or gauged, or known, or named: that of which everything can\nbe affirmed and denied: that \"which is entity and nonentity.\" He called\nit super-essential. He even stood ready, as in the Parmenides, to\ndemonstrate that it was so,--that this Being exceeded the limits of\nintellect. No man ever more fully acknowledged the Ineffable. Having\npaid his homage, as for the human race, to the Illimitable, he then\nstood erect, and for the human race affirmed, \"And yet things are\nknowable!\"--that is, the Asia in his mind was first heartily\nhonored,--the ocean of love and power, before form, before will, before\nknowledge, the Same, the Good, the One; and now, refreshed and empowered\nby this worship, the instinct of Europe, namely, culture, returns; and\nhe cries, Yet things are knowable! They are knowable, because, being\nfrom one, things correspond. There is a scale: and the correspondence\nof heaven to earth, of matter to mind, of the part to the whole, is\nour guide. As there is a science of stars, called astronomy; a science\nof quantities called mathematics; a science of qualities, called\nchemistry; so there is a science of sciences,--I call it\nDialectic,--which is the intellect discriminating the false and the\ntrue. It rests on the observation of identity and diversity; for, to\njudge, is to unite to an object the notion which belongs to it. The\nsciences, even the best,--mathematics, and astronomy, are like\nsportsmen, who seize whatever prey offers, even without being able to\nmake any use of them. Dialectic must teach the use of them. \"This is\nof that rank that no intellectual man will enter on any study for its\nown sake, but only with a view to advance himself in that one sole\nscience which embraces all.\"\n\"The essence or peculiarity of man is to comprehend the whole; or that\nwhich in the diversity of sensations, can be comprised under a rational\nunity.\" \"The soul which has never perceived the truth, cannot pass\ninto the human form.\" I announce to men the intellect. I announce the\ngood of being interpenetrated by the mind that made nature: this\nbenefit, namely, that it can understand nature, which it made and\nmaketh. Nature is good, but intellect is better: as the law-giver is\nbefore the law-receiver. I give you joy, O sons of men: that truth is\naltogether wholesome; that we have hope to search out what might be\nthe very self of everything. The misery of man is to be balked of the\nsight of essence, and to be stuffed with conjecture: but the supreme\ngood is reality; the supreme beauty is reality; and all virtue and all\nfelicity depend on this science of the real: for courage is nothing\nelse than knowledge: the fairest fortune that can befall man, is to\nbe guided by his daemon to that which is truly his own. This also is\nthe essence of justice,--to attend every one his own; nay, the notion\nof virtue is not to be arrived at, except through direct contemplation\nof the divine essence. Courage, then, for \"the persuasion that we must\nsearch that which we do not know, will render us, beyond comparison,\nbetter, braver, and more industrious, than if we thought it impossible\nto discover what we do not know, and useless to search for it.\" He\nsecures a position not to be commanded, by his passion for reality;\nvaluing philosophy only as it is the pleasure of conversing with real\nbeing.\nThus, full of the genius of Europe, he said, \"Culture.\" He saw the\ninstitutions of Sparta, and recognized more genially, one would say,\nthan any since, the hope of education. He delighted in every\naccomplishment, in every graceful and useful and truthful performance;\nabove all, in the splendors of genius and intellectual achievement.\n\"The whole of life, O Socrates,\" said Glauco, \"is, with the wise the\nmeasure of hearing such discourses as these.\" What a price he sets on\nthe feats of talent, on the powers of Pericles, of Isocrates, of\nParmenides! What price, above price on the talents themselves! He\ncalled the several faculties, gods, in his beautiful personation. What\nvalue he gives to the art of gymnastics in education; what to geometry;\nwhat to music, what to astronomy, whose appeasing and medicinal power\nhe celebrates! In the Timseus, he indicates the highest employment of\nthe eyes. \"By us it is asserted, that God invented and bestowed sight\non us for this purpose,--that, on surveying the circles of intelligence\nin the heavens, we might properly employ those of our own minds, which,\nthough disturbed when compared with the others that are uniform, are\nstill allied to their circulations; and that, having thus learned, and\nbeing naturally possessed of a correct reasoning faculty, we might,\nby imitating the uniform revolutions of divinity, set right our own\nwanderings and blunders.\" And in the Republic,--\"By each of these\ndisciplines, a certain organ of the soul is both purified and\nreanimated, which is blinded and buried by studies of another kind;\nan organ better worth saving than ten thousand eyes, since truth is\nperceived by this alone.\"\nHe said, Culture; but he first admitted its basis, and gave immeasurably\nthe first place to advantages of nature. His patrician tastes laid\nstress on the distinctions of birth. In the doctrine of the organic\ncharacter and disposition is the origin of caste. \"Such as were fit\nto govern, into their composition the informing Deity mingled gold:\ninto the military, silver; iron and brass for husbandmen and\nartificers.\" The East confirms itself, in all ages, in this faith. The\nKoran is explicit on this point of caste. \"Men have their metal, as\nof gold and silver. Those of you who were the worthy ones in the state\nof ignorance, will be the worthy ones in the state of faith, as soon\nas you embrace it.\" Plato was not less firm. \"Of the five orders of\nthings, only four can be taught in the generality of men.\" In the\nRepublic, he insists on the temperaments of the youth, as the first\nof the first.\nA happier example of the stress laid on nature, is in the dialogue\nwith the young Theages, who wishes to receive lessons from Socrates.\nSocrates declares that, if some have grown wise by associating with\nhim, no thanks are due to him; but, simply, whilst they were with him,\nthey grew wise, not because of him; he pretends not to know the way\nof it. \"It is adverse to many, nor can those be benefited by associating\nwith me, whom the Daemons oppose, so that it is not possible for me\nto live with these. With many, however, he does not prevent me from\nconversing, who yet are not at all benefited by associating with me.\nSuch, O Theages, is the association with me; for, if it pleases the\nGod, you will make great and rapid proficiency: you will not, if he\ndoes not please. Judge whether it is not safer to be instructed by\nsome one of those who have power over the benefit which they impart\nto men, than by me, who benefit or not, just as it may happen.\" As if\nhe had said, \"I have no system. I cannot be answerable for you. You\nwill be what you must. If there is love between us, inconceivably\ndelicious and profitable will our intercourse be; if not, your time\nis lost, and you will only annoy me. I shall seem to you stupid, and\nthe reputation I have, false. Quite above us, beyond the will of you\nor me, is this secret affinity or repulsion laid. All my good is\nmagnetic, and I educate, not by lessons, but by going about my\nbusiness.\"\nHe said, Culture; he said, Nature; and he failed not to add, \"There\nis also the divine.\" There is no thought in any mind, but it quickly\ntends to convert itself into a power, and organizes a huge\ninstrumentality of means. Plato, lover of limits, loved the illimitable,\nsaw the enlargement and nobility which come from truth itself, and\ngood itself, and attempted, as if on the part of the human intellect,\nonce for all, to do it adequate homage,--homage fit for the immense\nsoul to receive, and yet homage becoming the intellect to render. He\nsaid, then, \"Our faculties run out into infinity, and return to us\nthence. We can define but a little way; but here is a fact which will\nnot be skipped, and which to shut our eyes upon is suicide. All things\nare in a scale; and, begin where we will, ascend and ascend. All things\nare symbolical; and what we call results are beginnings.\"\nA key to the method and completeness of Plato is his twice bisected\nline. After he has illustrated the relation between the absolute good\nand true, and the forms of the intelligible world, he says:--\"Let there\nbe a line cut in two, unequal parts. Cut again each of these two\nparts,--one representing the visible, the other the intelligible\nworld,--and these two new sections, representing the bright part and\nthe dark part of these worlds, you will have, for one of the sections\nof the visible world,--images, that is, both shadows and reflections;\nfor the other section, the objects of these images,-that is, plants,\nanimals, and the works of art and nature. Then divide the intelligible\nworld in like manner; the one section will be of opinions and\nhypotheses, and the other section, of truths.\" To these four sections,\nthe four operations of the soul correspond,--conjecture, faith,\nunderstanding, reason. As every pool reflects the image of the sun,\nso every thought and thing restores us an image and creature of the\nsupreme Good. The universe is perforated by a million channels for his\nactivity. All things mount and mount.\nAll his thought has this ascension; in Phaedrus, teaching that \"beauty\nis the most lovely of all things, exciting hilarity, and shedding\ndesire and confidence through the universe, wherever it enters; and\nit enters, in some degree, into all things; but that there is another,\nwhich is as much more beautiful than beauty, as beauty is than chaos;\nnamely, wisdom, which our wonderful organ of sight cannot reach unto,\nbut which, could it be seen, would ravish us with its perfect reality.\"\nHe has the same regard to it as the source of excellence in works of\nart. \"When an artificer, in the fabrication of any work, looks to that\nwhich always subsists according to the same; and, employing a model\nof this kind, expresses its idea and power in his work; it must follow,\nthat his production should be beautiful. But when he beholds that which\nis born and dies, it will be far from beautiful.\"\nThus ever: the Banquet is a teaching in the same spirit, familiar now\nto all the poetry, and to all the sermons of the world, that the love\nof the sexes is initial; and symbolizes, at a distance, the passion\nof the soul for that immense lake of beauty it exists to seek. This\nfaith in the Divinity is never out of mind, and constitutes the\nlimitation of all his dogmas. Body cannot teach wisdom;--God only. In\nthe same mind, he constantly affirms that virtue cannot be taught;\nthat it is not a science, but an inspiration; that the greatest goods\nare produced to us through mania, and are assigned to us by a divine\ngift.\nThis leads me to that central figure, which he has established in his\nAcademy, as the organ through which every considered opinion shall be\nannounced, and whose biography he has likewise so labored, that the\nhistoric facts are lost in the light of Plato's mind. Socrates and\nPlato are the double star, which the most powerful instruments will\nnot entirely separate. Socrates, again, in his traits and genius, is\nthe best example of that synthesis which constitutes Plato's\nextraordinary power. Socrates, a man of humble stem, but honest enough;\nof the commonest history; of a personal homeliness so remarkable, as\nto be a cause of wit in others,--the rather that his broad good nature\nand exquisite taste for a joke invited the sally, which was sure to\nbe paid. The players personated him on the stage; the potters copied\nhis ugly face on their stone jugs. He was a cool fellow, adding to his\nhumor a perfect temper, and a knowledge of his man, be he who he might\nwhom he talked with, which laid the companion open to certain defeat\nin any debate,--and in debate he immoderately delighted. The young men\nare prodigiously fond of him, and invite him to their feasts, whither\nhe goes for conversation. He can drink, too; has the strongest head\nin Athens; and, after leaving the whole party under the table, goes\naway, as if nothing had happened, to begin new dialogues with somebody\nthat is sober. In short, he was what our country-people call an old\none.\nHe affected a good many citizen-like tastes, was monstrously fond of\nAthens, hated trees, never willingly went beyond the walls, knew the\nold characters, valued the bores and philistines, thought everything\nin Athens a little better than anything in any other place. He was\nplain as a Quaker in habit and speech, affected low phrases, and\nillustrations from cocks and quails, soup-pans and sycamore-spoons,\ngrooms and farriers, and unnameable offices,--especially if he talked\nwith any superfine person. He had a Franklin-like wisdom. Thus, he\nshowed one who was afraid to go on foot to Olympia, that it was no\nmore than his daily walk within doors, if continuously extended, would\neasily reach.\nPlain old uncle as he was, with his great ears,--an immense talker,--the\nrumor ran, that, on one or two occasions, in the war with Boeotia, he\nhad shown a determination which had covered the retreat of a troop;\nand there was some story that, under cover of folly, he had, in the\ncity government, when one day he chanced to hold a seat there, evinced\na courage in opposing singly the popular voice, which had well-nigh\nruined him. He is very poor; but then he is hardy as a soldier, and\ncan live on a few olives; usually, in the strictest sense, on bread\nand water, except when entertained by his friends. His necessary\nexpenses were exceedingly small, and no one could live as he did. He\nwore no undergarment; his upper garment was the same for summer and\nwinter; and he went barefooted; and it is said that, to procure the\npleasure, which he loves, of talking at his ease all day with the most\nelegant and cultivated young men, he will now and then return to his\nshop, and carve statues, good or bad, for sale. However that be, it\nis certain that he had grown to delight in nothing else than this\nconversation; and that, under his hypocritical pretense of knowing\nnothing, he attacks and brings down all the fine speakers, all the\nfine philosophers of Athens, whether natives, or strangers from Asia\nMinor and the islands. Nobody can refuse to talk with him, he is so\nhonest, and really curious to know; a man who was willingly confuted,\nif he did not speak the truth, and who willingly confuted others,\nasserting what was false; and not less pleased when confuted than when\nconfuting; for he thought not any evil happened to men, of such a\nmagnitude as false opinion respecting the just and unjust. A pitiless\ndisputant, who knows nothing, but the bounds of whose conquering\nintelligence no man had ever reached; whose temper was imperturbable;\nwhose dreadful logic was always leisurely and sportive; so careless\nand ignorant as to disarm the weariest, and draw them, in the\npleasantest manner, into horrible doubts and confusion. But he always\nknew the way out; knew it, yet would not tell it. No escape; he drives\nthem to terrible choices by his dilemmas, and tosses the Hippiases and\nGorgiases, with their grand reputations, as a boy tosses his balls.\nThe tyrannous realist!-Meno has discoursed a thousand times, at length,\non virtue, before many companies, and very well, as it appeared to\nhim; but, at this moment, he cannot even tell what it is,--this\ncramp-fish of a Socrates has so bewitched him.\nThis hard-headed humorist, whose strange conceits, drollery, and\n_bon-hommie_, diverted the young patricians, whilst the rumor of\nhis sayings and quibbles gets abroad every day, turns out, in a sequel,\nto have a probity as invincible as his logic and to be either insane,\nor, at least, under cover of this play, enthusiastic in his religion.\nWhen accused before the judges of subverting the popular creed, he\naffirms the immortality of the soul, the future reward and punishment;\nand, refusing to recant, in a caprice of the popular government, was\ncondemned to die, and sent to the prison. Socrates entered the prison,\nand took away all ignominy from the place, which could not be a prison,\nwhilst he was there. Crito bribed the jailor; but Socrates would not\ngo out by treachery. \"Whatever inconvenience ensue, nothing is to be\npreferred before justice. These things I hear like pipes and drums,\nwhose sound makes me deaf to everything you say.\" The fame of this\nprison, the fame of the discourses there, and the drinking of the\nhemlock, are one of the most precious passages in the history of the\nworld.\nThe rare coincidence, in one ugly body, of the droll and the martyr,\nthe keen street and market debater with the sweetest saint known to\nany history at that time, had forcibly struck the mind of Plato, so\ncapacious of these contrasts; and the figure of Socrates, by a\nnecessity, placed itself in the foreground of the scene, as the fittest\ndispenser of the intellectual treasurers he had to communicate. It was\na rare fortune, that this Aesod of the mob, and this robed scholar,\nshould meet, to make each other immortal in their mutual faculty. The\nstrange synthesis, in the character of Socrates, capped the synthesis\nin the mind of Plato. Moreover, by this means, he was able, in the\ndirect way, and without envy, to avail himself of the wit and weight\nof Socrates, to which unquestionably his own debt was great; and these\nderived again their principal advantage from the perfect art of Plato.\nIt remains to say, that the defect of Plato in power is only that which\nresults inevitably from his quality. He is intellectual in his aim;\nand, therefore, in expression, literary. Mounting into heaven, driving\ninto the pit, expounding the laws of the state, the passion of love,\nthe remorse of crime, the hope of the parting soul,--he is literary,\nand never otherwise. It is almost the sole deduction from the merit\nof Plato, that his writings have not,--what is, no doubt, incident\nto this regnancy of intellect in his work,--the vital authority which\nthe screams of prophets and the sermons of unlettered Arabs and Jews\npossess. There is an interval; and to cohesion, contact is necessary.\nI know not what can be said in reply to this criticism, but that we\nhave come to a fact in the nature of things: an oak is not an orange.\nThe qualities of sugar remain with sugar, and those of salt, with salt.\nIn the second place, he has not a system. The dearest defenders and\ndisciples are at fault. He attempted a theory of the universe, and his\ntheory is not complete or self-evident. One man thinks he means this,\nand another, that: he has said one thing in one place, and the reverse\nof it in another place. He is charged with having failed to make the\ntransition from ideas to matter. Here is the world, sound as a nut,\nperfect, not the smallest piece of chaos left, never a stitch nor an\nend, not a mark of haste, or botching, or second thought; but the\ntheory of the world is a thing of shreds and patches.\nThe longest wave is quickly lost in the sea. Plato would willingly\nhave a Platonism, a known and accurate expression for the world, and\nit should be accurate. It shall be the world passed through the mind\nof Plato,--nothing less. Every atom shall have the Platonic tinge;\nevery atom, every relation or quality you knew before, you shall know\nagain and find here, but now ordered; not nature, but art. And you\nshall feel that Alexander indeed overran, with men and horses, some\ncountries of the planet; but countries, and things of which countries\nare made, elements, planet itself, laws of planet and of men, have\npassed through this man as bread into his body, and become no longer\nbread, but body: so all this mammoth morsel has become Plato. He has\nclapped copyright on the world. This is the ambition of individualism.\nBut the mouthful proves too large. Boa constrictor has good will to\neat it, but he is foiled. He falls abroad in the attempt; and biting,\ngets strangled: the bitten world holds the biter fast by his own teeth.\nThere he perishes: unconquered nature lives on, and forgets him. So\nit fares with all: so must it fare with Plato. In view of eternal\nnature, Plato turns out to be philosophical exercitations. He argues\non this side, and on that. The acutest German, the lovingest disciple,\ncould never tell what Platonism was; indeed, admirable texts can be\nquoted on both sides of every great question from him.\nThese things we are forced to say, if we must consider the effort of\nPlato, or of any philosopher, to dispose of Nature,--which will not\nbe disposed of. No power of genius has ever yet had the smallest success\nin explaining existence. The perfect enigma remains. But there is an\ninjustice in assuming this ambition for Plato. Let us not seem to treat\nwith flippancy his venerable name. Men, in proportion to their\nintellect, have admitted his transcendent claims. The way to know him,\nis to compare him, not with nature, but with other men. How many ages\nhave gone by, and he remains unapproached! A chief structure of human\nwit, like Karnac, or the mediaeval cathedrals, or the Etrurian remains,\nit requires all the breadth of human faculty to know it. I think it\nis truliest seen, when seen with the most respect. His sense deepens,\nhis merits multiply, with study. When we say, here is a fine collection\nof fables; or, when we praise the style; or the common sense; or\narithmetic; we speak as boys, and much of our impatient criticism of\nthe dialectic, I suspect, is no better. The criticism is like our\nimpatience of miles when we are in a hurry; but it is still best that\na mile should have seventeen hundred and sixty yards. The great-eyed\nPlato proportioned the lights and shades after the genius of our life.\nPLATO: NEW READINGS\nThe publication, in Mr. Bohn's \"Serial Library,\" of the excellent\ntranslations of Plato, which we esteem one of the chief benefits the\ncheap press has yielded, gives us an occasion to take hastily a few\nmore notes of the elevation and bearings of this fixed star; or, to\nadd a bulletin, like the journals, of Plato at the latest dates.\nModern science, by the extent of its generalization, has learned to\nindemnify the student of man for the defects of individuals, by tracing\ngrowth and ascent in races; and, by the simple expedient of lighting\nup the vast background, generates a feeling of complacency and hope.\nThe human being has the saurian and the plant in his rear. His arts\nand sciences, the easy issue of his brain, look glorious when\nprospectively beheld from the distant brain of ox, crocodile, and fish.\nIt seems as if nature, in regarding the geologic night behind her,\nwhen, in five or six millenniums, she had turned out five or six men,\nas Homer, Phidias, Menu, and Columbus, was nowise discontented with\nthe result. These samples attested the virtue of the tree. These were\na clear amelioration of trilobite and saurus, and a good basis for\nfurther proceeding. With this artist time and space are cheap, and she\nis insensible of what you say of tedious preparation. She waited\ntranquilly the flowing periods of paleontology, for the hour to be\nstruck when man should arrive. Then periods must pass before the motion\nof the earth can be suspected; then before the map of the instincts\nand the cultivable powers can be drawn. But as of races, so the\nsuccession of individual men is fatal and beautiful, and Plato has the\nfortune, in the history of mankind, to mark an epoch.\nPlato's fame does not stand on a syllogism, or on any masterpieces of\nthe Socratic, or on any thesis, as, for example, the immortality of\nthe soul. He is more than an expert, or a school-man, or a geometer,\nor the prophet of a peculiar message. He represents the privilege of\nthe intellect, the power, namely, of carrying up every fact to\nsuccessive platforms, and so disclosing, in every fact, a germ of\nexpansion. These expansions are in the essence of thought. The\nnaturalist would never help us to them by any discoveries of the extent\nof the universe, but is as poor, when cataloguing the resolved nebula\nof Orion, as when measuring the angles of an acre. But the Republic\nof Plato, by these expansions, may be said to require, and so to\nanticipate, the astronomy of Laplace. The expansions are organic. The\nmind does not create what it perceives, any more than the eye creates\nthe rose. In ascribing to Plato the merit of announcing them, we only\nsay, here was a more complete man, who could apply to nature the whole\nscale of the senses, the understanding, and the reason. These\nexpansions, or extensions, consist in continuing the spiritual sight\nwhere the horizon falls on our natural vision, and, by this second\nsight, discovering the long lines of law which shoot in every direction.\nEverywhere he stands on a path which has no end, but runs continuously\nround the universe. Therefore, every word becomes an exponent of nature.\nWhatever he looks upon discloses a second sense, and ulterior senses.\nHis perception of the generation of contraries, of death out of life,\nand life out of death,--that law by which, in nature, decomposition\nis recomposition, and putrefaction and cholera are only signals of a\nnew creation; his discernment of the little in the large, and the large\nin the small; studying the state in the citizen, and the citizen in\nthe state; and leaving it doubtful whether he exhibited the Republic\nas an allegory on the education of the private soul; his beautiful\ndefinitions of ideas, of time, of form, of figure, of the line,\nsometimes hypothetically given, as his defining of virtue, courage,\njustice, temperance; his love of the apologue, and his apologues\nthemselves; the cave of Trophonius; the ring of Gyges; the charioteer\nand two horses; the golden, silver, brass, and iron temperaments;\nTheuth and Thamus; and the visions of Hades and the Fates--fables which\nhave imprinted themselves in the human memory like the signs of the\nzodiac; his soliform eye and his boniform soul; his doctrine of\nassimilation; his doctrine of reminiscence; his clear vision of the\nlaws of return, or reaction, which secure instant justice throughout\nthe universe, instanced everywhere, but specially in the doctrine,\n\"what comes from God to us, returns from us to God,\" and in Socrates'\nbelief that the laws below are sisters of the laws above.\nMore striking examples are his moral conclusions. Plato affirms the\ncoincidence of science and virtue; for vice can never know itself and\nvirtue; but virtue knows both itself and vice. The eye attested that\njustice was best, as long as it was profitable; Plato affirms that it\nis profitable throughout; that the profit is intrinsic, though the\njust conceal his justice from gods and men; that it is better to suffer\ninjustice, than to do it; that the sinner ought to covet punishment;\nthat the lie was more hurtful than homicide; and that ignorance, or\nthe involuntary lie, was more calamitous than involuntary homicide;\nthat the soul is unwillingly deprived of true opinions; and that no\nman sins willingly; that the order of proceeding of nature was from\nthe mind to the body; and, though a sound body cannot restore an unsound\nmind, yet a good soul can, by its virtue, render the body the best\npossible. The intelligent have a right over the ignorant, namely, the\nright of instructing them. The right punishment of one out of tune,\nis to make him play in tune; the fine which the good, refusing to\ngovern, ought to pay, is, to be governed by a worse man; that his\nguards shall not handle gold and silver, but shall be instructed that\nthere is gold and silver in their souls, which will make men willing\nto give them everything which they need. This second sight explains\nthe stress laid on geometry. He saw that the globe of earth was not\nmore lawful and precise than was the supersensible; that a celestial\ngeometry was in place there, as a logic of lines and angles here below;\nthat the world was throughout mathematical; the proportions are constant\nof oxygen, azote, and lime; there is just so much water, and slate,\nand magnesia; not less are the proportions constant of moral elements.\nThis eldest Goethe, hating varnish and falsehood, delighted in revealing\nthe real at the base of the accidental; in discovering connection,\ncontinuity, and representation, everywhere; hating insulation; and\nappears like the god of wealth among the cabins of vagabonds, opening\npower and capability in everything he touches. Ethical science was new\nand vacant, when Plato could write thus:--\"Of all whose arguments are\nleft to the men of the present time, no one has ever yet condemned\ninjustice, or praised justice, otherwise than as respects the repute,\nhonors, and emoluments arising therefrom; while, as respects either\nof them in itself, and subsisting by its own power in the soul of the\npossessor, and concealed both from gods and men, no one has yet\nsufficiently investigated, either in poetry or prose writings,--how,\nnamely, that the one is the greatest of all the evils that the soul\nhas within it, and justice the greatest good.\"\nHis definition of ideas, as what is simple, permanent, uniform, and\nself-existent, forever discriminating them from the notions of the\nunderstanding, marks an era in the world. He was born to behold the\nself-evolving power of spirit, endless generator of new ends; a power\nwhich is the key at once to the centrality and the evanescence of\nthings. Plato is so centered, that he can well spare all his dogmas.\nThus the fact of knowledge and ideas reveals to him the fact of\neternity; and the doctrine of reminiscence he offers as the most\nprobable particular explication. Call that fanciful,--it matters not;\nthe connection between our knowledge and the abyss of being is still\nreal, and the explication must be not less magnificent.\nHe has indicated every eminent point in speculation. He wrote on the\nscale of the mind itself, so that all things have symmetry in his\ntablet. He put in all the past, without weariness, and descended into\ndetail with a courage like that he witnessed in nature. One would say,\nthat his forerunners had mapped out each a farm, or a district, or an\nisland, in intellectual geography, but that Plato first drew the sphere.\nHe domesticates the soul in nature; man is the microcosm. All the\ncircles of the visible heaven represent as many circles in the rational\nsoul. There is no lawless particle, and there is nothing casual in the\naction of the human mind. The names of things, too, are fatal, following\nthe nature of things. All the gods of the Pantheon are, by their names,\nsignificant of a profound sense. The gods are the ideas. Pan is speech,\nor manifestation; Saturn, the contemplative; Jove, the regal soul; and\nMars, passion. Venus is proportion; Calliope, the soul of the world;\nAglaia, intellectual illustration.\nThese thoughts, in sparkles of light, had appeared often to pious and\nto poetic souls; but this well-bred, all-knowing Greek geometer comes\nwith command, gathers them all up into rank and gradation, the Euclid\nof holiness, and marries the two parts of nature. Before all men, he\nsaw the intellectual values of the moral sentiment. He describes his\nown ideal, when he paints in Timaeus a god leading things from disorder\ninto order. He kindled a fire so truly in the center, that we see the\nsphere illuminated, and can distinguish poles, equator, and lines of\nlatitude, every arc and node; a theory so averaged, so modulated, that\nyou would say, the winds of ages had swept through this rhythmic\nstructure, and not that it was the brief extempore blotting of one\nshort-lived scribe. Hence it has happened that a very well-marked\nclass of souls, namely those who delight in giving a spiritual, that\nis, an ethico-intellectual expression to every truth by exhibiting an\nulterior end which is yet legitimate to it, are said to Platonize.\nThus, Michel Angelo is a Platonist, in his sonnets. Shakspeare is a\nPlatonist, when he writes, \"Nature is made better by no mean, but\nnature makes that mean,\" or,\n\"He that can endure\nTo follow with allegiance a fallen lord,\nDoes conquer him that did his master conquer,\nAnd earns a place in the story.\"\nHamlet is a pure Platonist, and 'tis the magnitude only of Shakspeare's\nproper genius that hinders him from being classed as the most eminent\nof this school. Swedenborg, throughout his prose poem of \"Conjugal\nLove,\" is a Platonist.\nHis subtlety commended him to men of thought. The secret of his popular\nsuccess is the moral aim, which endeared him to mankind. \"Intellect,\"\nhe said, \"is king of heaven and of earth;\" but, in Plato, intellect\nis always moral. His writings have also the sempiternal youth of poetry.\nFor their arguments, most of them, might have been couched in sonnets;\nand poetry has never soared higher than in the Timaeus and the Phaedrus.\nAs the poet, too, he is only contemplative. He did not, like Pythagoras,\nbreak himself with an institution. All his painting in the Republic\nmust be esteemed mythical, with intent to bring out, sometimes in\nviolent colors, his thought. You cannot institute, without peril of\ncharlatan.\nIt was a high scheme, his absolute privilege for the best (which, to\nmake emphatic, he expressed by community of women), as the premium\nwhich he would set on grandeur. There shall be exempts of two kinds:\nfirst, those who by demerit have put themselves below\nprotection,--outlaws; and secondly, those who by eminence of nature\nand desert are out of the reach of your rewards; let such be free of\nthe city, and above the law. We confide them to themselves; let them\ndo with us as they will. Let none presume to measure the irregularities\nof Michel Angelo and Socrates by village scales.\nIn his eighth book of the Republic, he throws a little mathematical\ndust in our eyes. I am sorry to see him, after such noble superiorities,\npermitting the lie to governors. Plato plays Providence a little with\nthe baser sort, as people allow themselves with their dogs and cats.\nIII. SWEDENBORG; OR, THE MYSTIC.\nAmong eminent persons, those who are most dear to men are not the class\nwhich the economists call producers; they have nothing in their hands;\nthey have not cultivated corn, nor made bread; they have not led out\na colony, nor invented a loom. A higher class, in the estimation and\nlove of this city-building, market-going race of mankind, are the\npoets, who, from the intellectual kingdom, feed the thought and\nimagination with ideas and pictures which raise men out of the world\nof corn and money, and console them for the shortcomings of the day,\nand the meannesses of labor and traffic. Then, also, the philosopher\nhas his value, who flatters the intellect of this laborer, by engaging\nhim with subtleties which instruct him in new faculties. Others may\nbuild cities; he is to understand them, and keep them in awe. But there\nis a class who lead us into another region,--the world of morals, or\nof will. What is singular about this region of thought, is, its claim.\nWherever the sentiment of right comes in, it takes precedence of\neverything else. For other things, I make poetry of them; but the moral\nsentiment makes poetry of me.\nI have sometimes thought that he would render the greatest service to\nmodern criticism, who shall draw the line of relation that subsists\nbetween Shakespeare and Swedenborg. The human mind stands ever in\nperplexity, demanding intellect, demanding sanctity, impatient equally\nof each without the other. The reconciler has not yet appeared. If we\ntire of the saints, Shakespeare is our city of refuge. Yet the instincts\npresently teach, that the problem of essence must take precedence of\nall others,--the questions of Whence? What? and Whither? and the\nsolution of these must be in a life, and not in a book. A drama or\npoem is a proximate or oblique reply; but Moses, Menu, Jesus, work\ndirectly on this problem. The atmosphere of moral sentiment is a region\nof grandeur which reduces all material magnificence to toys, yet opens\nto every wretch that has reason, the doors of the universe. Almost\nwith a fierce haste it lays its empire on the man. In the language of\nthe Koran, \"God said, the heaven and the earth, and all that is between\nthem, think ye that we created them in jest, and that ye shall not\nreturn to us?\" It is the kingdom of the will, and by inspiring the\nwill, which is the seat of personality, seems to convert the universe\ninto a person:--\n\"The realms of being to no other bow,\nNot only all are thine, but all are Thou.\"\nAll men are commanded by the saint. The Koran makes a distinct class\nof those who are by nature good, and whose goodness has an influence\non others, and pronounces this class to be the aim of creation: the\nother classes are admitted to the feast of being, only as following\nin the train of this. And the Persian poet exclaims to a soul of this\nkind:\n\"Go boldly forth, and feast on being's banquet;\nThou art the called,--the rest admitted with thee.\"\nThe privilege of this caste is an access to the secrets and structure\nof nature, by some higher method than by experience. In common parlance,\nwhat one man is said to learn by experience, a man of extraordinary\nsagacity is said, without experience, to divine. The Arabians say,\nthat Abul Khain, the mystic, and Abu Ali Seena, the Philosopher,\nconferred together; and, on parting, the philosopher said, \"All that\nhe sees, I know;\" and the mystic said, \"All that he knows, I see.\" If\none should ask the reason of this intuition, the solution would lead\nus into that property which Plato denoted as Reminiscence, and which\nis implied by the Bramins in the tenet of Transmigration. The soul\nhaving been often born, or, as the Hindoos say, \"traveling the path\nof existence through thousands of births,\" having beheld the things\nwhich are here, those which are in heaven, and those which are beneath,\nthere is nothing of which she has not gained the knowledge: no wonder\nthat she is able to recollect, in regard to any one thing, what formerly\nshe knew. \"For, all things in nature being linked and related, and\nthe soul having heretofore known all, nothing hinders but that any man\nwho has recalled to mind, or, according to the common phrase, has\nlearned one thing only, should of himself recover all his ancient\nknowledge, and find out again all the rest, if he have but courage,\nand faint not in the midst of his researches. For inquiry and learning\nis reminiscence all.\" How much more, if he that inquires be a holy and\ngodlike soul! For, by being assimilated to the original soul, by whom,\nand after whom, all things subsist, the soul of man does then easily\nflow into all things, and all things flow into it: they mix: and he\nis present and sympathetic with their structure and law.\nThis path is difficult, secret, and beset with terror. The ancients\ncalled it ecstasy or absence,--a getting out of their bodies to think.\nAll religious history contains traces of the trance of saints,--a\nbeatitude, but without any sign of joy, earnest, solitary, even sad;\n\"the flight,\" Plotinus called it, \"of the alone to the alone.\" The\ntrances of Socrates, Plotinus, Porphyry, Behmen, Bunyan, Fox, Pascal,\nGuion, Swedenborg, will readily come to mind. But what as readily comes\nto mind, is the accompaniment of disease. This beatitude comes in\nterror, and with shocks to the mind of the receiver. \"It o'erinforms\nthe tenement of clay,\" and drives the man mad; or, gives a certain\nviolent bias, which taints his judgment. In the chief examples of\nreligious illumination, somewhat morbid, has mingled, in spite of the\nunquestionable increase of mental power. Must the highest good drag\nafter it a quality which neutralizes and discredits it?--\n\"Indeed it takes\nFrom our achievements, when performed at height,\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\"\nShall we say, that the economical mother disburses so much earth and\nso much fire, by weight and metre, to make a man, and will not add a\npennyweight, though a nation is perishing for a leader? Therefore, the\nmen of God purchased their science by folly or pain. If you will have\npure carbon, carbuncle, or diamond, to make the brain transparent, the\ntrunk and organs shall be so much the grosser: instead of porcelain,\nthey are potter's earth, clay, or mud.\nIn modern times, no such remarkable example of this introverted mind\nhas occurred, as in Emanuel Swedenborg, born in Stockholm, in 1688.\nThis man, who appeared to his contemporaries a visionary, and elixir\nof moonbeams, no doubt led the most real life of any man then in the\nworld: and now, when the royal and ducal Frederics, Cristierns, and\nBrunswicks, of that day, have slid into oblivion, he begins to spread\nhimself into the minds of thousands. As happens in great men, he seemed,\nby the variety and amount of his powers, to be a composition of several\npersons,--like the giant fruits which are matured in gardens by the\nunion of four or five single blossoms. His frame is on a larger scale,\nand possesses the advantage of size. As it is easier to see the\nreflection of the great sphere in large globes, though defaced by some\ncrack or blemish, than in drops of water, so men of large calibre,\nthough with some eccentricity or madness, like Pascal or Newton, help\nus more than balanced mediocre minds.\nHis youth and training could not fail to be extraordinary. Such a boy\ncould not whistle or dance, but goes grubbing into mines and mountains,\nprying into chemistry and optics, physiology, mathematics, and\nastronomy, to find images fit for the measure of his versatile and\ncapacious brain. He was a scholar from a child, and was educated at\nUpsala. At the age of twenty-eight, he was made Assessor of the Board\nof Mines, by Charles XII. In 1716, he left home for four years, and\nvisited the universities of England, Holland, France, and Germany. He\nperformed a notable feat of engineering in 1718, at the siege of\nFredericshall, by hauling two galleys, five boats, and a sloop, some\nfourteen English miles overland, for the royal service. In 1721 he\njourneyed over Europe, to examine mines and smelting works. He\npublished, in 1716, his Daedalus Hyperboreus, and, from this time, for\nthe next thirty years, was employed in the composition and publication\nof his scientific works. With the like force, he threw himself into\ntheology. In 1743, when he was fifty-four years old, what is called\nhis illumination began. All his metallurgy, and transportation of ships\noverland, was absorbed into this ecstasy. He ceased to publish any\nmore scientific books, withdrew from his practical labors, and devoted\nhimself to the writing and publication of his voluminous theological\nworks, which were printed at his own expense, or at that of the Duke\nof Brunswick, or other prince, at Dresden, Liepsic, London, or\nAmsterdam. Later, he resigned his office of Assessor: the salary\nattached to this office continued to be paid to him during his life.\nHis duties had brought him into intimate acquaintance with King Charles\nXII., by whom he was much consulted and honored. The like favor was\ncontinued to him by his successor. At the Diet of 1751, Count Hopken\nsays, the most solid memorials on finance were from his pen. In Sweden,\nhe appears to have attracted a marked regard. His rare science and\npractical skill, and the added fame of second sight and extraordinary\nreligious knowledge and gifts, drew to him queens, nobles, clergy,\nshipmasters, and people about the ports through which he was wont to\npass in his many voyages. The clergy interfered a little with the\nimportation and publication of his religious works; but he seems to\nhave kept the friendship of men in power. He was never married. He had\ngreat modesty and gentleness of bearing. His habits were simple; he\nlived on bread, milk, and vegetables; and he lived in a house situated\nin a large garden; he went several times to England, where he does not\nseem to have attracted any attention whatever from the learned or the\neminent; and died at London, March 29, 1772, of apoplexy, in his\neighty-fifth year. He is described, when in London, as a man of quiet,\nclerical habit, not averse to tea and coffee, and kind to children.\nHe wore a sword when in full velvet dress, and, whenever he walked\nout, carried a gold-headed cane. There is a common portrait of him in\nantique coat and wig, but the face has a wandering or vacant air.\nThe genius which was to penetrate the science of the age with a far\nmore subtle science; to pass the bounds of space and time; venture\ninto the dim spirit-realm, and attempt to establish a new religion in\nthe world,--began its lessons in quarries and forges, in the\nsmelting-pot and crucible, in ship-yards and dissecting-rooms. No one\nman is perhaps able to judge of the merits of his works on so many\nsubjects. One is glad to learn that his books on mines and metals are\nheld in the highest esteem by those who understand these matters. It\nseems that he anticipated much science of the nineteenth century;\nanticipated, in astronomy, the discovery of the seventh planet,--but,\nunhappily, not also of the eighth; anticipated the views of modern\nastronomy in regard to the generation of earth by the sun; in magnetism,\nsome important experiments and conclusions of later students; in\nchemistry, the atomic theory; in anatomy, the discoveries of\nSchlichting, Monro, and Wilson; and first demonstrated the office of\nthe lungs. His excellent English editor magnanimously lays no stress\non his discoveries, since he was too great to care to be original; and\nwe are to judge, by what he can spare, of what remains.\nA colossal soul, he lies vast abroad on his times, uncomprehended by\nthem, and requires a long local distance to be seen; suggest, as\nAristotle, Bacon, Selden, Humboldt, that a certain vastness of learning,\nor _quasi_ omnipresence of the human soul in nature, is possible.\nHis superb speculations, as from a tower, over nature and arts, without\never losing sight of the texture and sequence of things, almost realizes\nhis own picture, in the \"Principia,\" of the original integrity of man.\nOver and above the merit of his particular discoveries, is the capital\nmerit of his self-equality. A drop of water has the properties of the\nsea, but cannot exhibit a storm. There is beauty of a concert, as well\nas of a flute; strength of a host, as well as of a hero; and, in\nSwedenborg, those who are best acquainted with modern books, will most\nadmire the merit of mass. One of the missouriums and mastodons of\nliterature, he is not to be measured by whole colleges of ordinary\nscholars. His stalwart presence would flutter the gowns of an\nuniversity. Our books are false by being fragmentary; their sentences\nare _bon mots_, and not parts of natural discourse; childish expressions\nof surprise or pleasure in nature; or, worse, owing a brief notoriety to\ntheir petulance, or aversion from the order of nature,--being some\ncuriosity or oddity, designedly not in harmony with nature, and\npurposely framed to excite a surprise, as jugglers do by concealing\ntheir means. But Swedenborg is systematic, and respective of the world\nin every sentence; all the means are orderly given; his faculties work\nwith astronomic punctuality, and this admirable writing is pure from all\npertness or egotism.\nSwedenborg was born into an atmosphere of great ideas. 'Tis hard to\nsay what was his own: yet his life was dignified by noblest pictures\nof the universe. The robust Aristotelian method, with its breadth and\nadequateness, shaming our sterile and linear logic by its genial\nradiation, conversant with series and degree, with effects and ends,\nskilful to discriminate power from form, essence from accident, and\nopening by its terminology and definition, high roads into nature, had\ntrained a race of athletic philosophers. Harvey had shown the\ncirculation of the blood; Gilbert had shown that the earth was a magnet;\nDescartes, taught by Gilbert's magnet, with its vortex, spiral, and\npolarity, had filled Europe with the leading thought of vortical motion,\nas the secret of nature. Newton, in the year in which Swedenborg was\nborn, published the \"Principia,\" and established the universal gravity.\nMalpighi, following the high doctrines of Hippocrates, Leucippus, and\nLucretius, had given emphasis to the dogma that nature works in\nleasts,--\"_tota in minimis existit natura_.\" Unrivalled dissectors,\nSwammerdam, Leeuwenhoek, Winslow, Eustachius, Heister, Vesalius,\nBoerhaave, had left nothing for scalpel or microscope to reveal in\nhuman or comparative anatomy; Linnaeus, his contemporary, was affirming,\nin his beautiful science, that \"Nature is always like herself;\" and,\nlastly, the nobility of method, the largest application of principles,\nhad been exhibited by Leibnitz and Christian Wolff, in cosmology;\nwhilst Locke and Grotius had drawn the moral argument. What was left\nfor a genius of the largest calibre, but to go over their ground, and\nverify and unite? It is easy to see, in these minds, the original of\nSwedenborg's studies, and the suggestion of his problems. He had a\ncapacity to entertain and vivify these volumes of thought. Yet the\nproximity of these geniuses, one or other of whom had introduced all\nhis leading ideas, makes Swedenborg another example of the difficulty,\neven in a highly fertile genius, of proving originality, the first\nbirth and annunciation of one of the laws of nature.\nHe named his favorite views, the doctrine of Forms, the doctrine of\nSeries and Degrees, the doctrine of Influx, the doctrine of\nCorrespondence. His statement of these doctrines deserves to be studied\nin his books. Not every man can read them, but they will reward him\nwho can. His theologic works are valuable to illustrate these. His\nwritings would be a sufficient library to a lonely and athletic student;\nand the \"Economy of the Animal Kingdom\" is one of those books which,\nby the sustained dignity of thinking, is an honor to the human race.\nHe had studied spars and metals to some purpose. His varied and solid\nknowledge makes his style lustrous with points and shooting spicula\nof thought, and resembling one of those winter mornings when the air\nsparkles with crystals. The grandeur of the topics makes the grandeur\nof the style. He was apt for cosmology, because of that native\nperception of identity which made mere size of no account to him. In\nthe atom of magnetic iron, he saw the quality which would generate the\nspiral motion of sun and planet.\nThe thoughts in which he lived were, the universality of each law in\nnature; the Platonic doctrine of the scale or degrees; the version or\nconversion of each into other, and so the correspondence of all the\nparts; the fine secret that little explains large, and large, little;\nthe centrality of man in nature, and the connection that subsists\nthroughout all things: he saw that the human body was strictly\nuniversal, or an instrument through which the soul feeds and is fed\nby the whole of matter: so that he held, in exact antagonism to the\nskeptics, that, \"the wiser a man is, the more will he be a worshipper\nof the Deity.\" In short, he was a believer in the Identity-philosophy,\nwhich he held not idly, as the dreamers of Berlin or Boston, but which\nhe experimented with and established through years of labor, with the\nheart and strength of the rudest Viking that his rough Sweden ever\nsent to battle.\nThis theory dates from the oldest philosophers, and derives perhaps\nits best illustration from the newest. It is this: that nature iterates\nher means perpetually on successive planes. In the old aphorism, nature\nis always self-similar. In the plant, the eye or germinative point\nopens to a leaf, then to another leaf, with a power of transforming\nthe leaf into radicle, stamen, pistil, petal, bract, sepal, or seed.\nThe whole art of the plant is still to repeat leaf on leaf without\nend, the more or less of heat, light, moisture, and food, determining\nthe form it shall assume. In the animal, nature makes a vertebra, or\na spine of vertebrae, and helps herself still by a new spine, with a\nlimited power of modifying its form,--spine on spine, to the end of\nthe world. A poetic anatomist, in our own day, teaches that a snake,\nbeing a horizontal line, and man, being an erect line, constitute a\nright angle; and, between the lines of this mystical quadrant, all\nanimate beings find their place; and he assumes the hair-worm, the\nspan-worm, or the snake, as the type of prediction of the spine.\nManifestly, at the end of the spine, nature puts out smaller spines,\nas arms; at the end of the arms, new spines, as hands; at the other\nend, she repeats the process, as legs and feet. At the top of the\ncolumn, she puts out another spine, which doubles or loops itself over,\nas a span-worm, into a ball, and forms the skull, with extremities\nagain; the hands being now the upper jaw, the feet the lower jaw, the\nfingers and toes being represented this time by upper and lower teeth.\nThis new spine is destined to high uses. It is a new man on the\nshoulders of the last. It can almost shed its trunk, and manage to\nlive alone, according to the Platonic idea in the Timaeus. Within it,\non a higher plane, all that was done in the trunk repeats itself.\nNature recites her lesson once more in a higher mood. The mind is a\nfiner body, and resumes its functions of feeding, digesting, absorbing,\nexcluding, and generating, in a new and ethereal element. Here, in the\nbrain, is all the process of alimentation repeated, in the acquiring,\ncomparing, digesting, and assimilating of experience. Here again is\nthe mystery of generation repeated. In the brain are male and female\nfaculties; here is marriage, here is fruit. And there is no limit to\nthis ascending scale, but series on series. Everything, at the end of\none use, is taken up into the next, each series punctually repeating\nevery organ and process of the last. We are adapted to infinity. We\nare hard to please, and love nothing which ends; and in nature is no\nend; but everything, at the end of one use, is lifted into a superior,\nand the ascent of these things climbs into daemonic and celestial\nnatures. Creative force, like a musical composer, goes on unweariedly\nrepeating a simple air or theme now high, now low, in solo, in chorus,\nten thousand times reverberated, till it fills earth and heaven with\nthe chant.\nGravitation, as explained by Newton, is good, but grandeur, when we\nfind chemistry only an extension of the law of masses into particles,\nand that the atomic theory shows the action of chemistry to be\nmechanical also. Metaphysics shows us a sort of gravitation, operative\nalso in the mental phenomena; and the terrible tabulation of the French\nstatists brings every piece of whim and humor to be reducible also to\nexact numerical rations. If one man in twenty thousand, or in thirty\nthousand, eats shoes, or marries his grandmother, then, in every twenty\nthousand, or thirty thousand, is found one man who eats shoes, or\nmarries his grandmother. What we call gravitation, and fancy ultimate,\nis one fork of a mightier stream, for which we have yet no name.\nAstronomy is excellent; but it must come up into life to have its full\nvalue, and not remain there in globes and spaces. The globule of blood\ngyrates around its own axis in the human veins, as the planet in the\nsky; and the circles of intellect relate to those of the heavens. Each\nlaw of nature has the like universality; eating, sleep or hybernation,\nrotation, generation, metamorphosis, vortical motion, which is seen\nin eggs as in planets. These grand rhymes or returns in nature,--the\ndear, best-known face startling us at every turn, under a mask so\nunexpected that we think it the face of a stranger, and, carrying up\nthe semblance into divine forms,--delighted the prophetic eye of\nSwedenborg; and he must be reckoned a leader in that revolution, which,\nby giving to science an idea, has given to an aimless accumulation of\nexperiments, guidance and form, and a beating heart.\nI own, with some regret, that his printed works amount to about fifty\nstout octaves, his scientific works being about half of the whole\nnumber; and it appears that a mass of manuscript still unedited remains\nin the royal library at Stockholm. The scientific works have just now\nbeen translated into English, in an excellent edition.\nSwedenborg printed these scientific books in the ten years from 1734\nto 1744, and they remained from that time neglected; and now, after\ntheir century is complete, he has at last found a pupil in Mr.\nWilkinson, in London, a philosophic critic, with a co-equal vigor of\nunderstanding and imagination comparable only to Lord Bacon's, who has\nproduced his master's buried books to the day, and transferred them,\nwith every advantage, from their forgotten Latin into English, to go\nround the world in our commercial and conquering tongue. This startling\nreappearance of Swedenborg, after a hundred years, in his pupil, is\nnot the least remarkable fact in his history. Aided, it is said, by\nthe munificence of Mr. Clissold, and also by his literary skill, this\npiece of poetic justice is done. The admirable preliminary discourses\nwith which Mr. Wilkinson has enriched these volumes, throw all the\ncontemporary philosophy of England into shade, and leave me nothing\nto say on their proper grounds.\nThe \"Animal Kingdom\" is a book of wonderful merits. It was written\nwith the highest end,--to put science and the soul, long estranged\nfrom each other, at one again. It was an anatomist's account of the\nhuman body, in the highest style of poetry. Nothing can exceed the\nbold and brilliant treatment of a subject usually so dry and repulsive.\nHe saw nature \"wreathing through an everlasting spiral, with wheels\nthat never dry, on axles that never creak,\" and sometimes sought \"to\nuncover those secret recess is where nature is sitting at the fires\nin the depths of her laboratory;\" whilst the picture comes recommended\nby the hard fidelity with which it is based on practical anatomy. It\nis remarkable that this sublime genius decides, peremptorily for the\nanalytic, against the synthetic method; and, in a book whose genius\nis a daring poetic synthesis, claims to confine himself to a rigid\nexperience.\nHe knows, if he only, the flowing of nature and how wise was that old\nanswer of Amasis to him who bade him drink up the sea,--\"Yes, willingly,\nif you will stop the rivers that flow in.\" Few knew as much about\nnature and her subtle manners, or expressed more subtly her goings.\nHe thought as large a demand is made on our faith by nature, as by\nmiracles. \"He noted that in her proceeding from first principles through\nher several subordinations, there was no state through which she did\nnot pass, as if her path lay through all things.\" \"For as often as she\nbetakes herself upward from visible phenomena, or, in other words,\nwithdraws herself inward, she instantly, as it were, disappears, while\nno one knows what has become of her, or whither she is gone; so that\nit is necessary to take science as a guide in pursuing her steps.\"\nThe pursuing the inquiry under the light of an end or final cause,\ngives wonderful animation, a sort of personality to the whole writing.\nThis book announces his favorite dogmas. The ancient doctrines of\nHippocrates, that the brain is a gland; and of Leucippus, that the\natom may be known by the mass; or, in Plato, the macrocosm by the\nmicrocosm; and, in the verses of Lucretius,--\nOssa videlicet e pauxillis atque minutis\nOssibus sic et de pauxillis atque minutis\nVisceribus viscus gigni, sanguenque creari\nSanguinis inter se multis coeuntibus guttis;\nEx aurique putat micis consistere posse\nAurum, et de terris terram concrescere parvis;\nIgnibus ex igneis, humorem humoribus esse.\nLib. I. 835.\n\"The principle of all things entrails made\nOf smallest entrails; bone, of smallest bone,\nBlood, of small sanguine drops reduced to one;\nGold, of small grains; earth, of small sands compacted\nSmall drops to water, sparks to fire contracted:\"\nand which Malpighi had summed in his maxim, that \"nature exists entirely\nin leasts,\"--is a favorite thought of Swedenborg. \"It is a constant\nlaw of the organic body, that large, compound, or visible forms exist\nand subsist from smaller, simpler, and ultimately from invisible forms,\nwhich act similarly to the larger ones, but more perfectly and more\nuniversally, and the least forms so perfectly and universally, as to\ninvolve an idea representative of their entire universe.\" The unities\nof each organ are so many little organs, homogeneous with their\ncompound; the unities of the tongue are little tongues; those of the\nstomach, little stomachs; those of the heart are little hearts. This\nfruitful idea furnishes a key to every secret. What was too small for\nthe eye to detect was read by the aggregates; what was too large, by\nthe units. There is no end to his application of the thought. \"Hunger\nis an aggregate of very many little hungers, or losses of blood by the\nlittle veins all over the body.\" It is the key to his theology, also.\n\"Man is a kind of very minute heaven, corresponding to the world of\nspirits and to heaven. Every particular idea of man, and every\naffection, yea, every smallest spark of his affection, is an image and\neffigy of him. A spirit may be known from only a single thought. God\nis the grand man.\"  The hardihood and thoroughness of his study of\nnature required a theory of forms, also. \"Forms ascend in order from\nthe lowest to the highest. The lowest form is angular, or the\nterrestrial and corporeal. The second and next higher form is the\ncircular, which is also called the perpetual-angular, because the\ncircumference of a circle is a perpetual angle. The form above this\nis the spiral, parent and measure of circular forms; its diameters are\nnot rectilinear, but variously circular, and have a spherical surface\nfor center; therefore it is called the perpetual-circular. The form\nabove this is the vortical, or perpetual-spiral; next, the\nperpetual-vortical, or celestial; last, the perpetual-celestial, or\nspiritual.\"\nWas it strange that a genius so bold should take the last step,\nalso,--conceive that he might attain the science of all sciences, to\nunlock the meaning of the world? In the first volume of the \"Animal\nKingdom,\" he broaches the subject, in a remarkable note.--\n\"In our doctrine of Representations and Correspondences, we shall treat\nof both these symbolical and typical resemblances, and of the\nastonishing things which occur, I will not say, in the living body\nonly, but throughout nature, and which correspond so entirely to supreme\nand spiritual things, that one would swear that the physical world was\npurely symbolical of the spiritual world; insomuch, that if we choose\nto express any natural truth in physical and definite vocalterms, and\nto convert these terms only into the corresponding and spiritual terms,\nwe shall by this means elicit a spiritual truth, or theological dogma,\nin place of the physical truth or precept; although no mortal would\nhave predicted that anything of the kind could possibly arise by bare\nliteral transposition; inasmuch as the one precept, considered\nseparately from the other, appears to have absolutely no relation to\nit. I intend, hereafter, to communicate a number of examples of such\ncorrespondences, together with a vocabulary containing the terms of\nspiritual things, as well as of the physical things for which they are\nto be substituted. This symbolism pervades the living body.\"\nThe fact, thus explicitly stated, is implied in all poetry, in allegory,\nin fable, in the use of emblems, and in the structure of language.\nPlato knew of it, as is evident from his twice bisected line, in the\nsixth book of the Republic. Lord Bacon had found that truth and nature\ndiffered only as seal and print; and he instanced some physical\nproportions, with their translation into a moral and political sense.\nBehmen, and all mystics, imply this law in their dark riddle-writing.\nThe poets, in as far as they are poets, use it; but it is known to\nthem only, as the magnet was known for ages, as a toy. Swedenborg first\nput the fact into a detached and scientific statement, because it was\nhabitually present to him, and never not seen. It was involved, as we\nexplained already, in the doctrine of identity and iteration, because\nthe mental series exactly tallies with the material series. It required\nan insight that could rank things in order and series; or, rather, it\nrequired such rightness of position, that the poles of the eye should\ncoincide with the axis of the world. The earth has fed its mankind\nthrough five or six millenniums, and they had sciences, religions,\nphilosophies; and yet had failed to see the correspondence of meaning\nbetween every part and every other part. And, down to this hour,\nliterature has no book in which the symbolism of things is\nscientifically opened. One would say, that, as soon as men had the\nfirst hint that every sensible object,--animal, rock, river, air,--nay,\nspace and time, subsists not for itself, nor finally to a material\nend, but as a picture-language, to tell another story of beings and\nduties, other science would be put by, and a science of such grand\npresage would absorb all faculties; that each man would ask of all\nobjects, what they mean: Why does the horizon hold me fast, with my\njoy and grief, in this center? Why hear I the same sense from countless\ndiffering voices, and read one never quite expressed fact in endless\npicture-language? Yet, whether it be that these things will not be\nintellectually learned, or, that many centuries must elaborate and\ncompose so rare and opulent a soul,--there is no comet, rock-stratum,\nfossil, fish, quadruped, spider, or fungus, that, for itself, does not\ninterest more scholars and classifiers than the meaning and upshot of\nthe frame of things.\nBut Swedenborg was not content with the culinary use of the world. In\nhis fifty-fourth year, these thoughts held him fast, and his profound\nmind admitted the perilous opinion, too frequent in religious history,\nthat he was an abnormal person, to whom was granted the privilege of\nconversing with angels and spirits; and this ecstasy connected itself\nwith just this office of explaining the moral import of the sensible\nworld. To a right perception, at once broad and minute, of the order\nof nature, he added the comprehension of the moral laws in their widest\nsocial aspects; but whatever he saw, through some excessive\ndetermination to form, in his constitution, he saw not abstractly, but\nin pictures, heard it in dialogues, constructed it in events. When he\nattempted to announce the law most sanely, he was forced to couch it\nin parable.\nModern psychology offers no similar example of a deranged balance. The\nprincipal powers continued to maintain a healthy action; and, to a\nreader who can make due allowance in the report for the reporter's\npeculiarities, the results are still instructive, and a more striking\ntestimony to the sublime laws he announced, than any that balanced\ndulness could afford. He attempts to give some account of the modus\nof the new state, affirming that \"his presence in the spiritual world\nis attended with a certain separation, but only as to the intellectual\npart of his mind, not as to the will part;\" and he affirms that \"he\nsees, with the internal sight, the things that are in another life,\nmore clearly than he sees the things which are here in the world.\"\nHaving adopted the belief that certain books of the Old and New\nTestaments were exact allegories, or written in the angelic and ecstatic\nmode, he employed his remaining years in extricating from the literal,\nthe universal sense. He had borrowed from Plato the fine fable of \"a\nmost ancient people, men better than we, and dwelling nigher to the\ngods;\" and Swedenborg added, that they used the earth symbolically;\nthat these, when they saw terrestrial objects, did not think at all\nabout them, but only about those which they signified. The\ncorrespondence between thoughts and things henceforward occupied him.\n\"The very organic form resembles the end inscribed on it.\" A man is\nin general, and in particular, an organizd justice or injustice,\nselfishness or gratitude. And the cause of this harmony he assigned\nin the Arcana: \"The reason why all and single things, in the heavens\nand on earth, are representative, is because they exist from an influx\nof the Lord, through heaven.\" This design of exhibiting such\ncorrespondences, which, if adequately executed, would be the poem of\nthe world, in which all history and science would play an essential\npart, was narrowed and defeated by the exclusively theologic direction\nwhich his inquiries took. His perception of nature is not human and\nuniversal, but is mystical and Hebraic. He fastens each natural object\nto a theologic notion:--a horse signifies carnal understanding; a tree,\nperception; the moon, faith; a cat means this; an ostrich, that; an\nartichoke, this other; and poorly tethers every symbol to a several\necclesiastic sense. The slippery Proteus is not so easily caught. In\nnature, each individual symbol plays innumerable parts, as each particle\nof matter circulates in turn through every system. The central identity\nenables any one symbol to express successively all the qualities and\nshades of the real being. In the transmission of the heavenly waters,\nevery hose fits every hydrant. Nature avenges herself speedily on the\nhard pedantry that would chain her waves. She is no literalist.\nEverything must be taken genially, and we must be at the top of our\ncondition to understand anything rightly.\nHis theological bias thus fatally narrowed his interpretation of nature,\nand the dictionary of symbols is yet to be written. But the interpreter,\nwhom mankind must still expect, will find no predecessor who has\napproached so near to the true problem.\nSwedenborg styles himself, in the title-page of his books, \"Servant\nof the Lord Jesus Christ;\" and by force of intellect, and in effect,\nhe is the last Father in the Church, and is not likely to have a\nsuccessor. No wonder that his depth of ethical wisdom should give him\ninfluence as a teacher. To the withered traditional church yielding\ndry catechisms, he let in nature again, and the worshiper, escaping\nfrom the vestry of verbs and texts, is surprised to find himself a\nparty to the whole of his religion. His religion thinks for him, and\nis of universal application. He turns it on every side; it fits every\npart of life, interprets and dignifies every circumstance. Instead of\na religion which visited him diplomatically three or four times,--\nwhen he was born, when he married, when he fell sick, and when he died,\nand for the rest never interfered with him,--here was a teaching which\naccompanied him all day, accompanied him even into sleep and dreams;\ninto his thinking, and showed him through what a long ancestry his\nthoughts descend; into society, and showed by what affinities he was\ngirt to his equals and his counterparts; into natural objects, and\nshowed their origin and meaning, what are friendly, and what are\nhurtful; and opened the future world, by indicating the continuity of\nthe same laws. His disciples allege that their intellect is invigorated\nby the study of his books.\nThere is no such problem for criticism as his theological writings,\ntheir merits are so commanding; yet such grave deductions must be made.\nTheir immense and sandy diffuseness is like the prairie, or the desert,\nand their incongruities are like the last deliration. He is\nsuperfluously explanatory, and his feelings of the ignorance of men,\nstrangely exaggerated. Men take truths of this nature very fast. Yet\nhe abounds in assertions; he is a rich discoverer, and of things which\nmost import us to know. His thought dwells in essential resemblances,\nlike the resemblance of a house to the man who built it. He saw things\nin their law, in likeness of function, not of structure. There is an\ninvariable method and order in his delivery of his truth, the habitual\nproceeding of the mind from inmost to outmost. What earnestness and\nweightiness,--his eye never roving, without one swell of vanity, or\none look to self, in any common form of literary pride! a theoretic\nor speculative man, but whom no practical man in the universe could\naffect to scorn. Plato is a gownsman; his garment, though of purple,\nand almost skywoven, is an academic robe, and hinders action with its\nvoluminous folds. But this mystic is awful to Caesar. Lycurgus himself\nwould bow.\nThe moral insight of Swedenborg, the correction of popular errors, the\nannouncement of ethical laws, take him out of comparison with any other\nmodern writer, and entitle him to a place, vacant for some ages, among\nthe lawgivers of mankind. That slow but commanding influence which he\nhas acquired, like that of other religious geniuses, must be excessive\nalso, and have its tides, before it subsides into a permanent amount.\nOf course, what is real and universal cannot be confined to the circle\nof those who sympathize strictly with his genius, but will pass forth\ninto the common stock of wise and just thinking. The world has a sure\nchemistry, by which it attracts what is excellent in its children, and\nlets fall the infirmities and limitations of the grandest mind.\nThat metempsychosis which is familiar in the old mythology of the\nGreeks, collected in Ovid, and in the Indian Transmigration, and is\nthere objective, or really takes place in bodies by alien will,--in\nSwedenborg's mind, has a more philosophic character. It is subjective,\nor depends entirely upon the thought of the person. All things in the\nuniverse arrange themselves to each person anew, according to his\nruling love. Man is such as his affection and thought are. Man is man\nby virtue of willing, not by virtue of knowing and understanding. As\nhe is, so he sees. The marriages of the world are broken up. Interiors\nassociate all in the spiritual world. Whatever the angels looked upon\nwas to them celestial. Each Satan appears to himself a man; to those\nas bad as he, a comely man; to the purified, a heap of carrion. Nothing\ncan resist states; everything gravitates; like will to like; what we\ncall poetic justice takes effect on the spot. We have come into a world\nwhich is a living poem. Every thing is as I am. Bird and beast is not\nbird and beast, but emanation and effluvia of the minds and wills of\nmen there present. Every one makes his own house and state. The ghosts\nare tormented with the fear of death, and cannot remember that they\nhave died. They who are in evil and falsehood are afraid of all others.\nSuch as have deprived themselves of charity, wander and flee; the\nsocieties which they approach discover their quality, and drive them\naway. The covetous seem to themselves to be abiding in cells where\ntheir money is deposited, and these to be infested with mice. They who\nplace merit in good works seem to themselves to cut wood. \"I asked\nsuch, if they were not wearied? They replied, that they have not yet\ndone work enough to merit heaven.\"\nHe delivers golden sayings, which express with singular beauty the\nethical laws; as when he uttered that famed sentence, that, \"in heaven\nthe angels are advancing continually to the springtime of their youth,\nso that the oldest angel appears the youngest:\" \"The more angels, the\nmore room:\" \"The perfection of man is the love of use:\" \"Man, in his\nperfect form, is heaven:\" \"What is from Him, is Him:\" \"Ends always\nascend as nature descends:\" And the truly poetic account of the writing\nin the inmost heaven, which, as it consists of inflexions according\nto the form of heaven, can be read without instruction He almost\njustifies his claim to preternatural vision, by strange insights of\nthe structure of the human body and mind. \"It is never permitted to\nany one, in heaven, to stand behind another and look at the back of\nhis head; for then the influx which is from the Lord is disturbed.\"\nThe angels, from the sound of the voice, know a man's love; from the\narticulation of the sound, his wisdom; and from the sense of the words,\nhis science.\nIn the \"Conjugal Love,\" he has unfolded the science of marriage. Of\nthis book, one would say, that, with the highest elements, it has\nfailed of success. It came near to be the Hymn of Love, which Plato\nattempted in the \"Banquet;\" the love, which, Dante says, Casella sang\namong the angels in Paradise; and which, as rightly celebrated, in its\ngenesis, fruition, and effect, might well entrance the souls, as it\nwould lay open the genesis of all institutions, customs, and manners.\nThe book had been grand, if the Hebraism had been omitted, and the law\nstated without Gothicism, as ethics, and with that scope for ascension\nof state which the nature of things requires. It is a fine Platonic\ndevelopment of the science of marriage; teaching that sex is universal,\nand not local; virility in the male qualifying every organ, act, and\nthought; and the feminine in woman. Therefore, in the real or spiritual\nworld, the nuptial union is not momentary, but incessant and total;\nand chastity not a local, but a universal virtue; unchastity being\ndiscovered as much in the trading, or planting, or speaking, or\nphilosophizing, as in generation; and that, though the virgins he saw\nin heaven were beautiful, the wives were incomparably more beautiful,\nand went on increasing in beauty evermore.\nYet Swedenborg, after his mode, pinned his theory to a temporary form.\nHe exaggerates the circumstance of marriage; and, though he finds false\nmarriages on the earth, fancies a wiser choice in heaven. But of\nprogressive souls, all loves and friendships are momentary. Do you\nlove me? means, Do you see the same truth? If you do, we are happy\nwith the same happiness; but presently one of us passes into the\nperception of new truth;--we are divorced, and no tension in nature\ncan hold us to each other. I know how delicious is this cup of love,--I\nexisting for you, you existing for me; but it is a child's clinging\nto his toy; an attempt to eternize the fireside and nuptial chamber;\nto keep the picture-alphabet through which our first lessons are\nprettily conveyed. The Eden of God is bare and grand: like the outdoor\nlandscape, remembered from the evening fireside, it seems cold and\ndesolate, whilst you cower over the coals; but, once abroad again, we\npity those who can forego the magnificence of nature, for candle-light\nand cards. Perhaps the true subject of the \"Conjugal Love\" is\nconversation, whose laws are profoundly eliminated. It is false, if\nliterally applied to marriage. For God is the bride or bridegroom of\nthe soul. Heaven is not the pairing of two, but the communion of all\nsouls. We meet, and dwell an instant under the temple of one thought,\nand part as though we parted not, to join another thought in other\nfellowships of joy. So far from there being anything divine in the low\nand proprietary sense of, Do you love me? it is only when you leave\nand lose me, by casting yourself on a sentiment which is higher than\nboth of us, that I draw near, and find myself at your side; and I am\nrepelled, if you fix your eye on me, and demand love. In fact, in the\nspiritual world, we change sexes every moment. You love the worth in\nme; then I am your husband: but it is not me, but the worth, that fixes\nthe love; and that worth is a drop of the ocean of worth that is beyond\nme. Meantime, I adore the greater worth in another, and so become his\nwife. He aspires to a higher worth in another spirit, and is wife of\nreceiver of that influence.\nWhether a self-inquisitorial habit, that he grew into, from jealousy\nof the sins to which men of thought are liable, he has acquired, in\ndisentangling and demonstrating that particular form of moral disease,\nan acumen which no conscience can resist. I refer to his feeling of\nthe profanation of thinking to what is good \"from scientifics.\" \"To\nreason about faith, is to doubt and deny.\" He was painfully alive to\nthe difference between knowing and doing, and this sensibility is\nincessantly expressed. Philosophers are, therefore, vipers, cockatrices,\nasps, hemorrhoids, presters, and flying serpents; literary men are\nconjurers and charlatans.\nBut this topic suggests a sad afterthought, that here we find the seat\nof his own pain. Possibly Swedenborg paid the penalty of introverted\nfaculties. Success, or a fortunate genius, seems to depend on a happy\nadjustment of heart and brain; on a due proportion, hard to hit, of\nmoral and mental power, which, perhaps, obeys the law of those chemical\nratios which make a proportion in volumes necessary to combination,\nas when gases will combine in certain fixed rates, but not at any rate.\nIt is hard to carry a full cup: and this man, profusely endowed in\nheart and mind, early fell into dangerous discord with himself. In his\nAnimal Kingdom, he surprises us, by declaring that he loved analysis,\nand not synthesis; and now, after his fiftieth year, he falls into\njealousy of his intellect; and, though aware that truth is not solitary,\nnor is goodness solitary, but both must ever mix and marry, he makes\nwar on his mind, takes the part of the conscience against it, and, on\nall occasions, traduces and blasphemes it. The violence is instantly\navenged. Beauty is disgraced, love is unlovely, when truth, the half\npart of heaven, is denied, as much as when a bitterness in men of\ntalent leads to satire, and destroys the judgment. He is wise, but\nwise in his own despite. There is an air of infinite grief, and the\nsound of wailing, all over and through this lurid universe. A vampyre\nsits in the seat of the prophet, and turns with gloomy appetite to the\nimages of pain. Indeed, a bird does not more readily weave its nest,\nor a mole bore into the ground, than this seer of souls substructs a\nnew hell and pit, each more abominable than the last, round every new\ncrew of offenders. He was let down through a column that seemed of\nbrass, but it was formed of angelic spirits, that he might descend\nsafely amongst the unhappy, and witness the vastation of souls; and\nheard there, for a long continuance, their lamentations; he saw their\ntormentors, who increase and strain pangs to infinity; he saw the hell\nof the jugglers, the hell of the assassins, the hell of the lascivious;\nthe hell of robbers, who kill and boil men; the infernal tun of the\ndeceitful; the excrementitious hells; the hell of the revengeful, whose\nfaces resembled a round, broad-cake, and their arms rotate like a\nwheel. Except Rabelais and Dean Swift, nobody ever had such science\nof filth and corruption.\nThese books should be used with caution. It is dangerous to sculpture\nthese evanescing images of thought. True in transition, they become\nfalse if fixed. It requires, for his just apprehension, almost a genius\nequal to his own. But when his visions become the stereotyped language\nof multitudes of persons, of all degrees of age and capacity, they are\nperverted. The wise people of the Greek race were accustomed to lead\nthe most intelligent and virtuous young men, as part of their education,\nthrough the Eleusinian mysteries, wherein, with much pomp and\ngraduation, the highest truths known to ancient wisdom were taught.\nAn ardent and contemplative young man, at eighteen or twenty years,\nmight read once these books of Swedenborg, these mysteries of love and\nconscience, and then throw them aside forever. Genius is ever haunted\nby similar dreams, when the hells and the heavens are opened to it.\nBut these pictures are to be held as mystical, that is, as a quite\narbitrary and accidental picture of the truth--not as the truth. Any\nother symbol would be as good: then this is safely seen.\nSwedenborg's system of the world wants central spontaneity; it is\ndynamic, not vital, and lacks power to generate life. There is no\nindividual in it. The universe is a gigantic crystal, all those atoms\nand laminae lie in uninterrupted order, and with unbroken unity, but\ncold and still. What seems an individual and a will, is none. There\nis an immense chain of intermediation, extending from center to\nextremes, which bereaves every agency of all freedom and character.\nThe universe, in his poem, suffers under a magnetic sleep, and only\nreflects the mind of the magnetizer. Every thought comes into each\nmind by influence from a society of spirits that surround it, and into\nthese from a higher society, and so on. All his types mean the same\nfew things. All his figures speak one speech. All his interlocutors\nSwedenborgize. Be they who they may, to this complexion must they come\nat last. This Charon ferries them all over in his boat; kings,\ncounselors, cavaliers, doctors, Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Hans Sloane,\nKing George II., Mahomet, or whosoever, and all gather one grimness\nof hue and style. Only when Cicero comes by, our gentle seer sticks\na little at saying he talked with Cicero, and, with a touch of human\nrelenting, remarks, \"one whom it was given me to believe was Cicero;\"\nand when the _soi disant_ Roman opens his mouth, Rome and eloquence\nhave ebbed away,--it is plain theologic Swedenborg, like the rest. His\nheavens and hells are dull; fault of want of individualism. The\nthousand-fold relation of men is not there. The interest that attaches\nin nature to each man, because he is right by his wrong, and wrong by\nhis right, because he defies all dogmatizing and classification, so\nmany allowances, and contingencies, and futurities, are to be taken\ninto account, strong by his vices, often paralyzed by his\nvirtues,--sinks into entire sympathy with his society. This want reacts\nto the center of the system. Though the agency of \"the Lord\" is in\nevery line referred to by name, it never becomes alive. There is no\nlustre in that eye which gazes from the center, and which should vivify\nthe immense dependency of beings.\nThe vice of Swedenborg's mind is its theologic determination. Nothing\nwith him has the liberality of universal wisdom, but we are always in\na church. That Hebrew muse, which taught the lore of right and wrong\nto man, had the same excess of influence for him, it has had for the\nnations. The mode, as well as the essence, was sacred. Palestine is\never the more valuable as a chapter in universal history, and ever the\nless an available element in education. The genius of Swedenborg,\nlargest of all modern souls in this department of thought, wasted\nitself in the endeavor to reanimate and conserve what had already\narrived at its natural term, and, in the great secular Providence, was\nretiring from its prominence, before western modes of thought and\nexpression. Swedenborg and Behmen both failed by attaching themselves\nto the Christian symbol, instead of to the moral sentiment, which\ncarries innumerable christianities, humanities, divinities, in its\nbosom.\nThe excess of influence shows itself in the incongruous importation\nof a foreign rhetoric. \"What have I to do,\" asks the impatient reader,\n\"with jasper and sardonyx, beryl and chalcedony; what with arks and\npassovers, ephahs and ephods; what with lepers and emerods; what with\nheave-offerings and unleavened bread; chariots of fire, dragons crowned\nand horned, behemoth and unicorn? Good for orientals, these are nothing\nto me. The more learning you bring to explain them, the more glaring\nthe impertinence. The more coherent and elaborate the system, the less\nI like it. I say, with the Spartan, 'Why do you speak so much to the\npurpose, of that which is nothing to the purpose?' My learning is such\nas God gave me in my birth and habit, in the delight and study of my\neyes, and not of another man's. Of all absurdities, this of some\nforeigner, purposing to take away my rhetoric, and substitute his own,\nand amuse me with pelican and stork, instead of thrush and robin;\npalm-trees and shittim-wood, instead of sassafras and hickory,--seems\nthe most needless.\" Locke said, \"God, when he makes the prophet, does\nnot unmake the man.\" Swedenborg's history points the remark. The parish\ndisputes, in the Swedish church, between the friends and foes of Luther\nand Melancthon, concerning \"faith alone,\" and \"works alone,\" intrude\nthemselves into his speculations upon the economy of the universe, and\nof the celestial societies. The Lutheran bishop's son, for whom the\nheavens are opened, so that he sees with eyes, and in the richest\nsymbolic forms, the awful truth of things, and utters again, in his\nbooks, as under a heavenly mandate, the indisputable secrets of moral\nnature,--with all these grandeurs resting upon him, remains the Lutheran\nbishop's son; his judgments are those of a Swedish polemic, and his\nvast enlargements purchased by adamantine limitations. He carries his\ncontroversial memory with him, in his visits to the souls. He is like\nMichel Angelo, who, in his frescoes, put the cardinal who had offended\nhim to roast under a mountain of devils; or, like Dante, who avenged,\nin vindictive melodies, all his private wrongs; or, perhaps still more\nlike Montaigne's parish priest, who, if a hailstorm passes over the\nvillage, thinks the day of doom has come, and the cannibals already\nhave got the pip. Swedenborg confounds us not less with the pains of\nMelancthon, and Luther, and Wolfius, and his own books, which he\nadvertises among the angels.\nUnder the same theologic cramp, many of his dogmas are bound. His\ncardinal position in morals is, that evils should be shunned as sins.\nBut he does not know what evil is, or what good is, who thinks any\nground remains to be occupied, after saying that evil is to be shunned\nas evil. I doubt not he was led by the desire to insert the element\nof personality of Deity. But nothing is added. One man, you say, dreads\ncrysipelas,--show him that this dread is evil: or, one dreads\nhell,--show him that dread is evil. He who loves goodness, harbors\nangels, reveres reverence, and lives with God. The less we have to do\nwith our sins, the better. No man can afford to waste his moments in\ncompunctions. \"That is active duty,\" say the Hindoos, \"which is not\nfor our bondage; that is knowledge, which is for our liberation; all\nother duty is good only unto weariness.\"\nAnother dogma, growing out of this pernicious theologic limitation,\nis this Inferno. Swedenborg has devils. Evil, according to old\nphilosophers, is good in the making. That pure malignity can exist,\nis the extreme proposition of unbelief. It is not to be entertained\nby a rational agent; it is atheism; it is the last profanation.\nEuripides rightly said,--\n\"Goodness and being in the gods are one; He who imputes ill to them\nmakes them none.\"\nTo what a painful perversion had Gothic theology arrived, that\nSwedenborg admitted no conversion for evil spirits! But the divine\neffort is never relaxed; the carrion in the sun will convert itself\nto grass and flowers; and man, though in brothels, or jails, or on\ngibbets, is on his way to all that is good and true. Burns, with the\nwild humor of his apostrophe to \"poor old Nickie Ben,\"\n\"O wad ye tak a thought, and mend!\"\nhas the advantage of the vindictive theologian. Everything is\nsuperficial, and perishes, but love and truth only. The largest is\nalways the truest sentiment, and we feel the more generous spirit of\nthe Indian Vishnu,-\"I am the same to all mankind. There is not one who\nis worthy of my love or hatred. They who serve me with adoration,--I\nam in them, and they in me. If one whose ways are altogether evil,\nserve me alone, he is as respectable as the just man; he is altogether\nwell employed; he soon becometh of a virtuous spirit, and obtaineth\neternal happiness.\"\nFor the anomalous pretension of Revelations of the other world,--only\nhis probity and genius can entitle it to any serious regard. His\nrevelations destroy their credit by running into detail. If a man say,\nthat the Holy Ghost hath informed him that the Last Judgment (or the\nlast of the judgments) took place in 1757; or, that the Dutch, in the\nother world, live in a heaven by themselves, and the English in a\nheaven by themselves; I reply, that the Spirit which is holy, is\nreserved, taciturn, and deals in laws. The rumors of ghosts and\nhobgoblins gossip and tell fortunes. The teachings of the high Spirit\nare abstemious, and, in regard to particulars, negative. Socrates'\nGenius did not advise him to act or to find, but if he proposed to do\nsomewhat not advantageous, it dissuaded him. \"What God is,\" he said,\n\"I know not; what he is not I know.\" The Hindoos have denominated the\nSupreme Being, the \"Internal Check.\" The illuminated Quakers explained\ntheir Light, not as somewhat which leads to any action, but it appears\nas an obstruction to anything unfit. But the right examples are private\nexperiences, which are absolutely at one on this point. Strictly\nspeaking, Swedenborg's revelation is a confounding of planes,--a capital\noffence in so learned a categorist. This is to carry the law of surface\ninto the plane of substance, to carry individualism and its fopperies\ninto the realm of essences and generals, which is dislocation and\nchaos.\nThe secret of heaven is kept from age to age. No imprudent, no sociable\nangel ever dropt an early syllable to answer the longings of saints,\nthe fears of mortals. We should have listened on our knees to any\nfavorite, who, by stricter obedience, had brought his thoughts into\nparallelism with the celestial currents, and could hint to human ears\nthe scenery and circumstance of the newly parted soul. But it is certain\nthat it must tally with what is best in nature. It must not be inferior\nin tone to the already known works of the artist who sculptures the\nglobes of the firmament, and writes the moral law. It must be fresher\nthan rainbows, stabler than mountains, agreeing with flowers, with\ntides, and the rising and setting of autumnal stars. Melodious poets\nshall be hoarse as street ballads, when once the penetrating key-note\nof nature and spirit is sounded,--the earth-beat, sea-beat, heart-beat\nwhich makes the tune to which the sun rolls, and the globule of blood,\nand the sap of trees.\nIn this mood, we hear the rumor that the seer has arrived, and his\ntale is told. But there is no beauty, no heaven: for angels, goblins.\nThe sad muse loves night and death, and the pit. His Inferno is\nmesmeric. His spiritual world bears the same relation to the\ngenerosities and joys of truth, of which human souls have already made\nus cognizant, as a man's bad dreams bear to his ideal life. It is\nindeed very like, in its endless power of lurid pictures, to the\nphenomena of dreaming, which nightly turns many an honest gentleman,\nbenevolent but dyspeptic, into a wretch, skulking like a dog about the\nouter yards and kennels of creation. When he mounts into the heavens,\nI do not hear its language. A man should not tell me that he has walked\namong the angels; his proof is, that his eloquence makes me one. Shall\nthe archangels be less majestic and sweet than the figures that have\nactually walked the earth? These angels that Swedenborg paints give\nus no very high idea of their discipline and culture; they are all\ncountry parsons; their heaven is a _fete champetre_, and evangelical\npicnic, or French distribution of prizes to virtuous peasants. Strange,\nscholastic, didactic, passionless, bloodless man, who denotes classes of\nsouls as a botanist disposes of a carex, and visits doleful hells as a\nstratum of chalk or hornblende! He has no sympathy. He goes up and down\nthe world of men, a modern Rhadamanthus in gold-headed cane and peruke,\nand with nonchalance, and the air of a referee, distributing souls. The\nwarm, many-weathered, passionate-peopled world is to him a grammar of\nhieroglyphs, or an emblematic freemason's procession. How different is\nJacob Behmen! he is tremulous with emotion, and listens awe-struck, with\nthe gentlest humanity, to the Teacher whose lessons he conveys; and when\nhe asserts that, \"in some sort, love is greater than God,\" his heart\nbeats so high that the thumping against his leathern coat is audible\nacross the centuries. 'Tis a great difference. Behmen is healthily and\nbeautifully wise, notwithstanding the mystical narrowness and\nincommunicableness. Swedenborg is disagreeably wise, and, with all his\naccumulated gifts, paralyzes and repels.\nIt is the best sign of a great nature, that it opens a foreground,\nand, like the breath of morning landscapes, invites us onward.\nSwedenborg is retrospective, nor can we divest him of his mattock and\nshroud. Some minds are forever restrained from descending into nature;\nothers are forever prevented from ascending out of it. With a force\nof many men, he could never break the umbilical cord which held him\nto nature, and he did not rise to the platform of pure genius.\nIt is remarkable that this man, who, by his perception of symbols, saw\nthe poetic construction of things, and the primary relation of mind\nto matter, remained entirely devoid of the whole apparatus of poetic\nexpression, which that perception creates. He knew the grammar and\nrudiments of the Mother-Tongue,--how could he not read off one strain\ninto music? Was he like Saadi, who, in his vision, designed to fill\nhis lap with the celestial flowers, as presents for his friends; but\nthe fragrance of the roses so intoxicated him, that the skirt dropped\nfrom his hands? or, is reporting a breach of the manners of that\nheavenly society? or, was it that he saw the vision intellectually,\nand hence that chiding of the intellectual that pervades his books?\nBe it as it may, his books have no melody, no emotion, no humor, no\nrelief to the dead prosaic level. In his profuse and accurate imagery\nis no pleasure, for there is no beauty. We wander forlorn in a lack-\nlustre landscape. No bird ever sang in all these gardens of the dead.\nThe entire want of poetry in so transcendent a mind betokens the\ndisease, and, like a hoarse voice in a beautiful person, is a kind of\nwarning. I think, sometimes, he will not be read longer. His great\nname will turn a sentence. His books have become a monument. His laurels\nso largely mixed with cypress, a charnel-breath so mingles with the\ntemple incense, that boys and maids will shun the spot.\nYet, in this immolation of genius and fame at the shrine of conscience,\nis a merit sublime beyond praise. He lived to purpose: he gave a\nverdict. He elected goodness as the clue to which the soul must cling\nin all this labyrinth of nature. Many opinions conflict as to the true\ncenter. In the shipwreck, some cling to running rigging, some to cask\nand barrel, some to spars, some to mast; the pilot chooses with\nscience,--I plant myself here; all will sink before this; \"he comes\nto land who sails with me.\" Do not rely on heavenly favor, or on\ncompassion to folly, or on prudence, on common sense, the old usage\nand main chance of men; nothing can keep you,--not fate, nor health,\nnor admirable intellect; none can keep you, but rectitude only,\nrectitude forever and ever!--and, with a tenacity that never swerved\nin all his studies, inventions, dreams, he adheres to this brave choice.\nI think of him as of some transmigratory votary of Indian legend, who\nsays, \"Though I be dog, or jackal, or pismire, in the last rudiments\nof nature, under what integument or ferocity, I cleave to right, as\nthe sure ladder that leads up to man and to God.\"\nSwedenborg has rendered a double service to mankind, which is now only\nbeginning to be known. By the science of experiment and use, he made\nhis first steps; he observed and published the laws of nature; and,\nascending by just degrees, from events to their summits and causes,\nhe was fired with piety at the harmonies he felt, and abandoned himself\nto his joy and worship. This was his first service. If the glory was\ntoo bright for his eyes to bear, if he staggered under the trance of\ndelight, the more excellent is the spectacle he saw, the realities of\nbeing which beam and blaze through him, and which no infirmities of\nthe prophet are suffered to obscure; and he renders a second passive\nservice to men, not less than the first,--perhaps, in the great circle\nof being, and in the retributions of spiritual nature, not less glorious\nor less beautiful to himself.\nIV. MONTAIGNE; OR, THE SKEPTIC.\nEvery fact is related on one side to sensation and, on the other, to\nmorals. The game of thought is, on the appearance of one of these two\nsides, to find the other; given the upper, to find the under side.\nNothing so thin, but has these two faces; and, when the observer has\nseen the obverse, he turns it over to see the reverse.\nLife is a pitching of this penny,--heads or tails. We never tire of\nthis game, because there is still a slight shudder of astonishment at\nthe exhibition of the other face, at the contrast of the two faces.\nA man is flushed with success, and bethinks himself what this good\nluck signifies. He drives his bargain in the street; but it occurs\nthat he also is bought and sold. He sees the beauty of a human face,\nand searches the cause of that beauty, which must be more beautiful.\nHe builds his fortunes, maintains the laws, cherishes his children;\nbut he asks himself, why? and whereto? This head and this tail are\ncalled, in the language of philosophy, Infinite and Finite; Relative\nand Absolute; Apparent and Real; and many fine names beside.\nEach man is born with a predisposition to one or the other of these\nsides of nature; and it will easily happen that men will be found\ndevoted to one or the other. One class has the perception of difference,\nand is conversant with facts and surfaces; cities and persons; and the\nbringing certain things to pass;--the men of talent and action. Another\nclass have the perception of identity, and are men of faith and\nphilosophy, men of genius.\nEach of these riders drives too fast. Plotinus believes only in\nphilosophers; Fenelon, in saints; Pindar and Byron, in poets. Read the\nhaughty language in which Plato and the Platonists speak of all men\nwho are not devoted to their own shining abstractions: other men are\nrats and mice. The literary class is usually proud and exclusive. The\ncorrespondence of Pope and Swift describes mankind around them as\nmonsters; and that of Goethe and Schiller, in our own time, is scarcely\nmore kind.\nIt is easy to see how this arrogance comes. The genius is a genius by\nthe first look he casts on any object. Is his eye creative? Does he\nnot rest in angles and colors, but beholds the design--he will presently\nundervalue the actual object. In powerful moments, his thought has\ndissolved the works of art and nature into their causes, so that the\nworks appear heavy and faulty. He has a conception of beauty which the\nsculptor cannot embody. Picture, statue, temple, railroad, steam-engine,\nexisted first in an artist's mind, without flaw, mistake, or friction,\nwhich impair the executed models. So did the church, the state, college,\ncourt, social circle, and all the institutions. It is not strange that\nthese men, remembering what they have seen and hoped of ideas, should\naffirm disdainfully the superiority of ideas. Having at some time seen\nthat the happy soul will carry all the arts in power, they say, Why\ncumber ourselves with superfluous realizations? and, like dreaming\nbeggars, they assume to speak and act as if these values were already\nsubstantiated.\nOn the other part, the men of toil and trade and luxury,--the animal\nworld, including the animal in the philosopher and poet also,--and the\npractical world, including the painful drudgeries which are never\nexcused to philosopher or poet any more than to the rest,--weigh heavily\non the other side. The trade in our streets believes in no metaphysical\ncauses, thinks nothing of the force which necessitated traders and a\ntrading planet to exist; no, but sticks to cotton, sugar, wool, and\nsalt. The ward meetings, on election days, are not softened by any\nmisgivings of the value of these ballotings. Hot life is streaming in\na single direction. To the men of this world, to the animal strength\nand spirits, to the men of practical power, whilst immersed in it, the\nman of ideas appears out of his reason. They alone have reason.\nThings always bring their own philosophy with them, that is, prudence.\nNo man acquires property without acquiring with it a little arithmetic,\nalso. In England, the richest country that ever existed, property\nstands for more, compared with personal ability, than in any other.\nAfter dinner, a man believes less, denies more; verities have lost\nsome charm. After dinner, arithmetic is the only science; ideas are\ndisturbing, incendiary, follies of young men, repudiated by the solid\nportion of society; and a man comes to be valued by his athletic and\nanimal qualities. Spence relates, that Mr. Pope was with Sir Godfrey\nKneller one day, when his nephew, a Guinea trader, came in. \"Nephew,\"\nsaid Sir Godfrey, \"you have the honor of seeing the two greatest men\nin the world.\" \"I don't know how great men you may be,\" said the Guinea\nman, \"but I don't like your looks. I have often bought a man much\nbetter than both of you, all muscles and bones, for ten guineas. Thus,\nthe men of the senses revenge themselves on the professors, and repay\nscorn for scorn. The first had leaped to conclusions not yet ripe, and\nsay more than is true; the others make themselves merry with the\nphilosopher, and weigh man by the pound.--They believe that mustard\nbites the tongue, that pepper is hot, friction-matches are incendiary,\nrevolvers to be avoided, and suspenders hold up pantaloons; that there\nis much sentiment in a chest of tea; and a man will be eloquent, if\nyou give him good wine. Are you tender and scrupulous,--you must eat\nmore mince-pie. They hold that Luther had milk in him when he said,\n\"Wer nicht liebt Wein, Weib, und Gesang Der bleibt ein Narr sein Leben\nlang,\"\nand when he advised a young scholar perplexed with fore-ordination and\nfree-will, to get well drunk. \"The nerves,\" says Cabanis, \"they are\nthe man.\" My neighbor, a jolly farmer, in the tavern bar-room, thinks\nthat the use of money is sure and speedy spending. \"For his part,\" he\nsays, \"he puts his down his neck, and gets the good of it.\"\nThe inconvenience of this way of thinking is, that it runs into\nindifferentism, and then into disgust. Life is eating us up. We shall\nbe fables presently. Keep cool: it will be all one a hundred years\nhence. Life's well enough; but we shall be glad to get out of it, and\nthey will all be glad to have us. Why should we fret and drudge? Our\nmeat will taste to-morrow as it did yesterday, and we may at last have\nhad enough of it. \"Ah,\" said my languid gentleman at Oxford, \"there's\nnothing new or true,--and no matter.\"\nWith a little more bitterness, the cynic moans: our life is like an\nass led to market by a bundle of hay being carried before him: he sees\nnothing but the bundle of hay. \"There is so much trouble in coming\ninto the world,\" said Lord Bolingbroke, \"and so much more, as well as\nmeanness, in going out of it, that 'tis hardly worth while to be here\nat all.\" I knew a philosopher of this kidney, who was accustomed briefly\nto sum up his experience of human nature in saying, \"Mankind is a\ndamned rascal:\" and the natural corollary is pretty sure to\nfollow,--\"The world lives by humbug, and so will I.\"\nThe abstractionist and the materialist thus mutually exasperating each\nother, and the scoffer expressing the worst of materialism, there\narises a third party to occupy the middle ground between these two,\nthe skeptic, namely. He finds both wrong by being in extremes. He\nlabors to plant his feet, to be the beam of the balance. He will not\ngo beyond his card. He sees the one-sidedness of these men of the\nstreet; he will not be a Gibeonite; he stands for the intellectual\nfaculties, a cool head, and whatever serves to keep it cool; no\nunadvised industry, no unrewarded self-devotion, no loss of the brains\nin toil. Am I an ox, or a dray?--You are both in extremes, he says.\nYou that will have all solid, and a world of pig-lead, deceive\nyourselves grossly. You believe yourselves rooted and grounded on\nadamant; and, yet, if we uncover the last facts of our knowledge, you\nare spinning like bubbles in a river, you know not whither or whence,\nand you are bottomed and capped and wrapped in delusions.\nNeither will he be betrayed to a book, and wrapped in a gown. The\nstudious class are their own victims; they are thin and pale, their\nfeet are cold, their heads are hot, the night is without sleep, the\nday a fear of interruption,--pallor, squalor, hunger, and egotism. If\nyou come near them, and see what conceits they entertain,--they are\nabstractionists, and spend their days and nights in dreaming some\ndreams; in expecting the homage of society to some precious scheme\nbuilt on a truth, but destitute of proportion in its presentment, of\njustness in its application, and of all energy of will in the schemer\nto embody and vitalize it.\nBut I see plainly, he says, that I cannot see. I know that human\nstrength is not in extremes, but in avoiding extremes. I, at least,\nwill shun the weakness of philosophizing beyond my depth. What is the\nuse of pretending to powers we have not? What is the use of pretending\nto assurances we have not, respecting the other life? Why exaggerate\nthe power of virtue? Why be an angel before your time? These strings,\nwound up too high, will snap. If there is a wish for immortality, and\nno evidence, why not say just that? If there are conflicting evidences,\nwhy not state them? If there is not ground for a candid thinker to\nmake up his mind, yea or nay,--why not suspend the judgment? I weary\nof these dogmatizers. I tire of these hacks of routine, who deny the\ndogmas. I neither affirm nor deny. I stand here to try the case. I am\nhere to consider,--to consider how it is. I will try to keep the balance\ntrue. Of what use to take the chair, and glibly rattle off theories\nof societies, religion, and nature, when I know that practical\nobjections lie in the way, insurmountable by me and by my mates? Why\nso talkative in public, when each of my neighbors can pin me to my\nseat by arguments I cannot refute? Why pretend that life is so simple\na game, when we know how subtle and elusive the Proteus is? Why think\nto shut up all things in your narrow coop, when we know there are not\none or two only, but ten, twenty, a thousand things, and unlike? Why\nfancy that you have all the truth in your keeping? There is much to\nsay on all sides.\nWho shall forbid a wise skepticism, seeing that there is no practical\nquestion on which anything more than an approximate solution can be\nhad? Is not marriage an open question when it is alleged, from the\nbeginning of the world, that such as are in the institution wish to\nget out, and such as are out wish to get in? And the reply of Socrates,\nto him who asked whether he should choose a wife, still remains\nreasonable, \"that, whether he should choose one or not, he would repent\nit.\" Is not the state a question? All society is divided in opinion\non the subject of the state. Nobody loves it; great numbers dislike\nit, and suffer conscientious scruples to allegiance: and the only\ndefense set up, is, the fear of doing worse in disorganizing. Is it\notherwise with the church? Or, to put any of the questions which touch\nmankind nearest,--shall the young man aim at a leading part in law,\nin politics, in trade? It will not be pretended that a success in\neither of these kinds is quite coincident with what is best and inmost\nin his mind. Shall he, then, cutting the stays that hold him fast to\nthe social state, put out to sea with no guidance but his genius? There\nis much to say on both sides. Remember the open question between the\npresent order of \"competition,\" and the friends of \"attractive and\nassociated labor.\" The generous minds embrace the proposition of labor\nshared by all; it is the only honesty; nothing else is safe. It is\nfrom the poor man's hut alone, that strength and virtue come; and yet,\non the other side, it is alleged that labor impairs the form, and\nbreaks the spirit of man, and the laborers cry unanimously, \"We have\nno thoughts.\" Culture, how indispensable! I cannot forgive you the\nwant of accomplishment; and yet, culture will instantly destroy that\nchiefest beauty of spontaneousness. Excellent is culture for a savage;\nbut once let him read in the book, and he is no longer able not to\nthink of Plutarch's heroes. In short, since true fortitude of\nunderstanding consists \"in not letting what we know be embarrassed by\nwhat we do not know,\" we ought to secure those advantages which we can\ncommand, and not risk them by clutching after the airy and unattainable.\nCome, no chimeras! Let us go abroad; let us mix in affairs; let us\nlearn, and get, and have, and climb. \"Men are a sort of moving plants,\nand, like trees, receive a great part of their nourishment from the\nair. If they keep too much at home, they pine.\" Let us have a robust,\nmanly life; let us know what we know, for certain; what we have, let\nit be solid, and seasonable, and our own. A world in the hand is worth\ntwo in the bush. Let us have to do with real men and women, and not\nwith skipping ghosts.\nThis, then, is the right ground of the skeptic,--this of consideration,\nof self-containing; not at all of unbelief; not at all of universal\ndenying, nor of universal doubting,--doubting even that he doubts;\nleast of all, of scoffing and profligate jeering at all that is stable\nand good. These are no more his moods than are those of religion and\nphilosophy. He is the considerer, the prudent, taking in sail, counting\nstock, husbanding his means, believing that a man has too many enemies,\nthan that he can afford to be his own; that we cannot give ourselves\ntoo many advantages, in this unequal conflict, with powers so vast and\nunweariable ranged on one side, and this little, conceited, vulnerable\npopinjay that a man is, bobbing up and down into every danger, on the\nother. It is a position taken up for better defense, as of more safety,\nand one that can be maintained; and it is one of more opportunity and\nrange; as, when we build a house, the rule is, to set it not too high\nnor too low, under the wind, but out of the dirt.\nThe philosophy we want is one of fluxions and mobility. The Spartan\nand Stoic schemes are too stark and stiff for our occasion. A theory\nof Saint John, and of non-resistance, seems, on the other hand, too\nthin and aerial. We want some coat woven of elastic steel, stout as\nthe first, and limber as the second. We want a ship in these billows\nwe inhabit. An angular, dogmatic house would be rent to chips and\nsplinters, in this storm of many elements. No, it must be tight, and\nfit to the form of man, to live at all; as a shell is the architecture\nof a house founded on the sea. The soul of man must be the type of our\nscheme, just as the body of man is the type after which a dwelling-house\nis built. Adaptiveness is the peculiarity of human nature. We are\ngolden averages, volitant stabilities, compensated or periodic errors,\nhouses founded on the sea. The wise skeptic wishes to have a near view\nof the best game, and the chief players; what is best in the planet;\nart and nature, places and events, but mainly men. Everything that is\nexcellent in mankind,--a form of grace, an arm of iron, lips of\npersuasion, a brain of resources, every one skilful to play and win,--he\nwill see and judge.\nThe terms of admission to this spectacle are, that he have a certain\nsolid and intelligible way of living of his own; some method of\nanswering the inevitable needs of human life; proof that he has played\nwith skill and success; that he has evinced the temper, stoutness, and\nthe range of qualities which, among his contemporaries and countrymen,\nentitle him to fellowship and trust. For, the secrets of life are not\nshown except to sympathy and likeness. Men do not confide themselves\nto boys, or coxcombs, or pedants, but to their peers. Some wise\nlimitation, as the modern phrase is; some condition between the\nextremes, and having itself a positive quality; some stark and\nsufficient man, who is not salt or sugar, but sufficiently related to\nthe world to do justice to Paris or London, and, at the same time, a\nvigorous and original thinker, whom cities cannot overawe, but who\nuses them,--is the fit person to occupy this ground of speculation.\nThese qualities meet in the character of Montaigne. And yet, since the\npersonal regard which I entertain for Montaigne may be unduly great,\nI will, under the shield of this prince of egotists, offer, as an\napology for electing him as the representative of skepticism, a word\nor two to explain how my love began and grew for this admirable gossip.\nA single odd volume of Cotton's translation of the Essays remained to\nme from my father's library, when a boy. It lay long neglected, until,\nafter many years, when I was newly escaped from college, I read the\nbook, and procured the remaining volumes. I remember the delight and\nwonder in which I lived with it. It seemed to me as if I had myself\nwritten the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my\nthought and experience. It happened, when in Paris, in 1833, that, in\nthe cemetery of Pere le Chaise, I came to a tomb of Augustus Collignon,\nwho died in 1830, aged sixty-eight years, and who, said the monument,\n\"lived to do right, and had formed himself to virtue on the Essays of\nMontaigne.\" Some years later, I became acquainted with an accomplished\nEnglish poet, John Sterling; and, in prosecuting my correspondence,\nI found that, from a love of Montaigne, he had made a pilgrimage to\nhis chateau, still standing near Castellan, in Perigord, and, after\ntwo hundred and fifty years, had copied from the walls of his library\nthe inscriptions which Montaigne had written there. That Journal of\nMr. Sterling's, published in the Westminster Review, Mr. Hazlitt has\nreprinted in the Prolegomenae to his edition of the Essays. I heard\nwith pleasure that one of the newly-discovered autographs of William\nShakspeare was in a copy of Florio's translation of Montaigne. It is\nthe only book which we certainly know to have been in the poet's\nlibrary. And, oddly enough, the duplicate copy of Florio, which the\nBritish Museum purchased, with a view of protecting the Shakspeare\nautograph (as I was informed in the Museum), turned out to have the\nautograph of Ben Jonson in the fly-leaf. Leigh Hunt relates of Lord\nByron, that Montaigne was the only great writer of past times whom he\nread with avowed satisfaction. Other coincidences, not needful to be\nmentioned here, concurred to make this old Gascon still new and immortal\nfor me.\nIn 1571, on the death of his father, Montaigne, then thirty-eight years\nold, retired from the practice of law, at Bordeaux, and settled himself\non his estate. Though he had been a man of pleasure, and sometimes a\ncourtier, his studious habits now grew on him, and he loved the compass,\nstaidness, and independence of the country gentleman's life. He took\nup his economy in good earnest, and made his farms yield the most.\nDownright and plain-dealing, and abhorring to be deceived or to\ndeceive, he was esteemed in the country for his sense and probity. In\nthe civil wars of the League, which converted every house into a fort,\nMontaigne kept his gates open, and his house without defense. All\nparties freely came and went, his courage and honor being universally\nesteemed. The neighboring lords and gentry brought jewels and papers\nto him for safekeeping. Gibbon reckons, in these bigoted times, but\ntwo men of liberality in France,--Henry IV. and Montaigne.\nMontaigne is the frankest and honestest of all writers. His French\nfreedom runs into grossness; but he has anticipated all censures by\nthe bounty of his own confessions. In his times, books were written\nto one sex only, and almost all were written in Latin; so that, in a\nhumorist, a certain nakedness of statement was permitted, which our\nmanners, of a literature addressed equally to both sexes, do not allow.\nBut, though a biblical plainness, coupled with a most uncanonical\nlevity, may shut his pages to many sensitive readers, yet the offence\nis superficial. He parades it: he makes the most of it; nobody can\nthink or say worse of him than he does. He pretends to most of the\nvices; and, if there be any virtue in him, he says, it got in by\nstealth. There is no man, in his opinion, who has not deserved hanging\nfive or six times; and he pretends no exception in his own behalf.\n\"Five or six as ridiculous stories,\" too, he says, \"can be told of me,\nas of any man living.\" But, with all this really superfluous frankness,\nthe opinion of an invincible probity grows into every reader's mind.\n\"When I the most strictly and religiously confess myself, I find that\nthe best virtue I have has in it some tincture of vice; and I am afraid\nthat Plato, in his purest virtue (I, who am as sincere and perfect a\nlover of virtue of that stamp as any other whatever), if he had\nlistened, and laid his ear close to himself, would have heard some\njarring sound of human mixture; but faint and remote, and only to be\nperceived by himself.\"\nHere is an impatience and fastidiousness at color or pretense of any\nkind. He has been in courts so long as to have conceived a furious\ndisgust at appearances; he will indulge himself with a little cursing\nand swearing; he will talk with sailors and gypsies, use flash and\nstreet ballads; he has stayed indoors till he is deadly sick; he will\nto the open air, though it rain bullets. He has seen too much of\ngentlemen of the long robe, until he wishes for cannibals; and is so\nnervous, by factitious life, that he thinks, the more barbarous man\nis, the better he is. He likes his saddle. You may read theology, and\ngrammar, and metaphysics elsewhere. Whatever you get here, shall smack\nof the earth and of real life, sweet, or smart, or stinging. He makes\nno hesitation to entertain you with the records of his disease; and\nhis journey to Italy is quite full of that matter. He took and kept\nthis position of equilibrium. Over his name, he drew an emblematic\npair of scales, and wrote, _Que sais-je?_ under it. As I look at\nhis effigy opposite the title-page, I seem to hear him say, \"You may\nplay old Poz, if you will; you may rail and exaggerate,--I stand here\nfor truth, and will not, for all the states, and churches, and revenues,\nand personal reputations of Europe, overstate the dry fact, as I see\nit; I will rather mumble and prose about what I certainly know,--my\nhouse and barns; my father, my wife, and my tenants; my old lean bald\npate; my knives and forks; what meats I eat, and what drinks I prefer;\nand a hundred straws just as ridiculous,--than I will write, with a\nfine crow-quill, a fine romance. I like gray days, and autumn and\nwinter weather. I am gray and autumnal myself, and think an undress,\nand old shoes that do not pinch my feet, and old friends who do not\nconstrain me, and plain topics where I do not need to strain myself\nand pump my brains, the most suitable. Our condition as men is risky\nand ticklish enough. One cannot be sure of himself and his fortune an\nhour, but he may be whisked off into some pitiable or ridiculous plight.\nWhy should I vapor and play the philosopher, instead of ballasting,\nthe best I can, this dancing balloon? So, at least, I live within\ncompass, keep myself ready for action, and can shoot the gulf, at last,\nwith decency. If there be anything farcical in such a life, the blame\nis not mine; let it lie at fate's and nature's door.\"\nThe Essays, therefore, are an entertaining soliloquy on every random\ntopic that comes into his head; treating everything without ceremony,\nyet with masculine sense. There have been men with deeper insight;\nbut, one would say, never a man with such abundance of thoughts; he\nis never dull, never insincere, and has the genius to make the reader\ncare for all that he cares for.\nThe sincerity and marrow of the man reaches to his sentences. I know\nnot anywhere the book that seems less written. It is the language of\nconversation transferred to a book. Cut these words, and they would\nbleed; they are vascular and alive. One has the same pleasure in it\nthat we have in listening to the necessary speech of men about their\nwork, when any unusual circumstance give momentary importance to the\ndialogue. For blacksmiths and teamsters do not trip in their speech;\nit is a shower of bullets. It is Cambridge men who correct themselves,\nand begin again at every half-sentence, and, moreover, will pun, and\nrefine too much, and swerve from the matter to the expression. Montaigne\ntalks with shrewdness, knows the world, and books, and himself, and\nuses the positive degree; never shrieks, or protests, or prays; no\nweakness, no convulsion, no superlative; does not wish to jump out of\nhis skin, or play any antics, or annihilate space or time; but is stout\nand solid; tastes every moment of the day; likes pain, because it makes\nhim feel himself, and realize things; as we pinch ourselves to know\nthat we are awake. He keeps the plain; he rarely mounts or sinks; likes\nto feel solid ground, and the stones underneath. His writing has no\nenthusiasms, no aspiration; contented, self-respecting, and keeping\nthe middle of the road. There is but one exception,--in his love for\nSocrates. In speaking of him, for once his cheek flushes, and his style\nrises to passion.\nMontaigne died of a quinsy, at the age of sixty, in 1592. When he came\nto die, he caused the mass to be celebrated in his chamber. At the age\nof thirty-three, he had been married. \"But,\" he says, \"might I have\nhad my own will, I would not have married Wisdom herself, if she would\nhave had me; but 'tis to much purpose to evade it, the common custom\nand use of life will have it so. Most of my actions are guided by\nexample, not choice.\" In the hour of death he gave the same weight to\ncustom. _Que sais-je?_ What do I know.\nThis book of Montaigne the world has endorsed, by translating it into\nall tongues, and printing seventy-five editions of it in Europe; and\nthat, too, a circulation somewhat chosen, namely, among courtiers,\nsoldiers, princes, men of the world, and men of wit and generosity.\nShall we say that Montaigne has spoken wisely, and given the right and\npermanent expression of the human mind, on the conduct of life?\nWe are natural believers. Truth, or the connection between cause and\neffect, alone interests us. We are persuaded that a thread runs through\nall things; all worlds are strung on it, as beads; and men, and events,\nand life, come to us, only because of that thread; they pass and repass,\nonly that we may know the direction and continuity of that line. A\nbook or statement which goes to show that there is no line, but random\nand chaos, a calamity out of nothing, a prosperity and no account of\nit, a hero born from a fool, a fool from a hero,--dispirits us. Seen\nor unseen, we believe the tie exists. Talent makes counterfeit ties;\ngenius finds the real ones. We hearken to the man of science, because\nwe anticipate the sequence in natural phenomena which he uncovers. We\nlove whatever affirms, connects, preserves; and dislike what scatters\nor pulls down. One man appears whose nature is to all men's eyes\nconserving and constructive; his presence supposes a well-ordered\nsociety, agriculture, trade, large institutions, and empire. If these\ndid not exist, they would begin to exist through his endeavors.\nTherefore, he cheers and comforts men, who feel all this in him very\nreadily. The nonconformist and the rebel say all manner of unanswerable\nthings against the existing republic, but discover to our sense no\nplan of house or state of their own. Therefore, though the town, and\nstate, and way of living, which our counselor contemplated, might be\na very modest or musty prosperity, yet men rightly go for him, and\nreject the reformer, so long as he comes only with axe and crowbar.\nBut though we are natural conservers and causationists, and reject a\nsour, dumpish unbelief, the skeptical class, which Montaigne represents,\nhave reason, and every man, at some time, belongs to it. Every superior\nmind will pass through this domain of equilibration,--I should rather\nsay, will know how to avail himself of the checks and balances in\nnature, as a natural weapon against the exaggeration and formalism of\nbigots and blockheads.\nSkepticism is the attitude assumed by the student in relation to the\nparticulars which society adores, but which he sees to be reverent\nonly in their tendency and spirit. The ground occupied by the skeptic\nis the vestibule of the temple. Society does not like to have any\nbreath of question blown on the existing order. But the interrogation\nof custom at all points is an inevitable stage in the growth of every\nsuperior mind, and is the evidence of its perception of the flowing\npower which remains itself in all changes.\nThe superior mind will find itself equally at odds with the evils of\nsociety, and with the projects that are offered to relieve them. The\nwise skeptic is a bad citizen; no conservative; he sees the selfishness\nof property, and the drowsiness of institutions. But neither is he fit\nto work with any democratic party that ever was constituted; for parties\nwish every one committed, and he penetrates the popular patriotism.\nHis politics are those of the \"Soul's Errand\" of Sir Walter Raleigh;\nor of Krishna, in the Bhagavat, \"There is none who is worthy of my\nlove or hatred;\" while he sentences law, physic, divinity, commerce,\nand custom. He is a reformer: yet he is no better member of the\nphilanthropic association. It turns out that he is not the champion\nof the operative, the pauper, the prisoner, the slave. It stands in\nhis mind, that our life in this world is not of quite so easy\ninterpretation as churches and school-books say. He does not wish to\ntake ground against these benevolences, to play the part of devil's\nattorney, and blazon every doubt and sneer that darkens the sun for\nhim. But he says, There are doubts.\nI mean to use the occasion, and celebrate the calendar-day of our Saint\nMichel de Montaigne, by counting and describing these doubts or\nnegations. I wish to ferret them out of their holes, and sun them a\nlittle. We must do with them as the police do with old rogues, who are\nshown up to the public at the marshal's office. They will never be so\nformidable, when once they have been identified and registered. But\nI mean honestly by them--that justice shall be done to their terrors.\nI shall not take Sunday objections, made up on purpose to be put down.\nI shall take the worst I can find, whether I can dispose of them, or\nthey of me.\nI do not press the skepticism of the materialist. I know the quadruped\nopinion will not prevail. 'Tis of no importance what bats and oxen\nthink. The first dangerous symptom I report is, the levity of intellect;\nas if it were fatal to earnestness to know much. Knowledge is the\nknowing that we cannot know. The dull pray; the geniuses are light\nmockers. How respectable is earnestness on every platform! but intellect\nkills it. Nay, San Carlo, my subtle and admirable friend, one of the\nmost penetrating of men, finds that all direct ascension, even of lofty\npiety, leads to this ghastly insight, and sends back the votary\norphaned. My astonishing San Carlo thought the lawgivers and saints\ninfected. They found the ark empty; saw, and would not tell; and tried\nto choke off their approaching followers, by saying, \"Action, action,\nmy dear fellows, is for you!\" Bad as was to me this detection by San\nCarlo, this frost in July, this blow from a brick, there was still a\nworse, namely, the cloy or satiety of the saints. In the mount of\nvision, ere they have yet risen from their knees, they say, \"We discover\nthat this our homage and beatitude is partial and deformed; we must\nfly for relief to the suspected and reviled Intellect, to the\nUnderstanding, the Mephistopheles, to the gymnastics of latent.\"\nThis is hobgoblin the first; and, though it has been the subject of\nmuch elegy, in our nineteenth century, from Byron, Goethe, and other\npoets of less fame, not to mention many distinguished private\nobservers,--I confess it is not very affecting to my imagination; for\nit seems to concern the shattering of baby-houses and crockery-shops.\nWhat flutters the church of Rome, or of England, or of Geneva, or of\nBoston, may yet be very far from touching any principle of faith. I\nthink that the intellect and moral sentiment are unanimous; and that,\nthough philosophy extirpates bugbears, yet it supplies the natural\nchecks of vice, and polarity to the soul. I think that the wiser a man\nis, the more stupendous he finds the natural and moral economy, and\nlifts himself to a more absolute reliance.\nThere is the power of moods, each setting at nought all but its own\ntissue of facts and beliefs. There is the power of complexions,\nobviously modifying the dispositions and sentiments. The beliefs and\nunbeliefs appear to be structural; and, as soon as each man attains\nthe poise and vivacity which allow the whole machinery to play, he\nwill not need extreme examples, but will rapidly alternate all opinions\nin his own life. Our life is March weather, savage and serene in one\nhour. We go forth austere, dedicated, believing in the iron links of\nDestiny, and will not turn on our heel to save our life; but a book,\nor a bust, or only the sound of a name, shoots a spark through the\nnerves, and we suddenly believe in will: my finger-ring shall be the\nseal of Solomon: fate is for imbeciles: all is possible to the resolved\nmind. Presently, a new experience gives a new turn to our thoughts:\ncommon sense resumes its tyranny: we say, \"Well, the army, after all,\nis the gate to fame, manners, and poetry: and, look you,--on the whole,\nselfishness plants best, prunes best, makes the best commerce, and the\nbest citizen.\" Are the opinions of a man on right and wrong, on fate\nand causation, at the mercy of a broken sleep or an indigestion? Is\nhis belief in God and Duty no deeper than a stomach evidence? And what\nguaranty for the permanence of his opinions? I like not the French\ncelerity,--a new church and state once a week.--This is the second\nnegation; and I shall let it pass for what it will. As far as it asserts\nrotation of states of mind, I suppose it suggests its own remedy,\nnamely, in the record of larger periods. What is the mean of many\nstates; of all the states? Does the general voice of ages affirm any\nprinciple, or is no community of sentiment discoverable in distant\ntimes and places? And when it shows the power of self-interest, I\naccept that as a part of the divine law, and must reconcile it with\naspiration the best I can.\nThe word Fate, or Destiny, expresses the sense of mankind, in all\nages,--that the laws of the world do not always befriend, but often\nhurt and crush us. Fate, in the shape of Kinde or nature, grows over\nus like grass. We paint Time with a scythe; Love and Fortune, blind;\nand Destiny, deaf. We have too little power of resistance against this\nferocity which champs us up. What front can we make against these\nunavoidable, victorious, maleficent forces? What can I do against the\ninfluence of Race, in my history? What can I do against hereditary and\nconstitutional habits, against scrofula, lymph, impotence? against\nclimate, against barbarism, in my country? I can reason down or deny\neverything, except this perpetual Belly; feed he must and will, and\nI cannot make him respectable.\nBut the main resistance which the affirmative impulse finds, and one\nincluding all others, is in the doctrine of the Illusionists. There\nis a painful rumor in circulation, that we have been practiced upon\nin all the principal performances of life, and free agency is the\nemptiest name. We have been sopped and drugged with the air, with food,\nwith woman, with children, with sciences, with events which leave us\nexactly where they found us. The mathematics, 'tis complained, leave\nthe mind where they find it: so do all sciences; and so do all events\nand actions. I find a man who has passed through all the sciences, the\nchurl he was; and, through all the offices, learned, civil, and social,\ncan detect the child. We are not the less necessitated to dedicate\nlife to them. In fact, we may come to accept it as the fixed rule and\ntheory of our state of education, that God is a substance, and his\nmethod is illusion. The eastern sages owned the goddess Yoganidra, the\ngreat illusory energy of Vishnu, by whom, as utter ignorance, the whole\nworld is beguiled.\nOr, shall I state it thus?--The astonishment of life, is, the absence\nof any appearance of reconciliation between the theory and practice\nof life. Reason, the prized reality, the Law, is apprehended, now and\nthen, for a serene and profound moment, amidst the hubbub of cares and\nworks which have no direct bearing on it;--is then lost, for months\nor years, and again found, for an interval, to be lost again. If we\ncompute it in time, we may, in fifty years, have half a dozen reasonable\nhours. But what are these cares and works the better? A method in the\nworld we do not see, but this parallelism of great and little, which\nnever react on each other, nor discover the smallest tendency to\nconverge. Experiences, fortunes, governings, readings, writings are\nnothing to the purpose; as when a man comes into the room, it does not\nappear whether he has been fed on yams or buffalo,--he has contrived\nto get so much bone and fibre as he wants, out of rice or out of snow.\nSo vast is the disproportion between the sky of law and the pismire\nof performance under it, that, whether he is a man of worth or a sot,\nis not so great a matter as we say. Shall I add, as one juggle of this\nenchantment, the stunning non-intercourse law which makes cooperation\nimpossible? The young spirit pants to enter society. But all the ways\nof culture and greatness lead to solitary imprisonment. He has been\noften baulked. He did not expect a sympathy with his thought from the\nvillage, but he went with it to the chosen and intelligent, and found\nno entertainment for it, but mere misapprehension, distaste, and\nscoffing. Men are strangely mistimed and misapplied; and the excellence\nof each is an inflamed individualism which separates him more.\nThere are these, and more than these diseases of thought, which our\nordinary teachers do not attempt to remove. Now shall we, because a\ngood nature inclines us to virtue's side, say, There are no doubts,--and\nlie for the right? Is life to be led in a brave or in a cowardly manner?\nand is not the satisfaction of the doubts essential to all manliness?\nIs the name of virtue to be a barrier to that which is virtue? Can you\nnot believe that a man of earnest and burly habit may find small good\nin tea, essays, and catechism, and want a rougher instruction, want\nmen, labor, trade, farming, war, hunger, plenty, love, hatred, doubt,\nand terror, to make things plain to him; and has he not a right to\ninsist on being convinced in his own way? When he is convinced, he\nwill be worth the pains.\nBelief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief\nin denying them. Some minds are incapable of skepticism. The doubts\nthey profess to entertain are rather a civility or accommodation to\nthe common discourse of their company. They may well give themselves\nleave to speculate, for they are secure of a return. Once admitted to\nthe heaven of thought, they see no relapse into night, but infinite\ninvitation on the other side. Heaven is within heaven, and sky over\nsky, and they are encompassed with divinities. Others there are, to\nwhom the heaven is brass, and it shuts down to the surface of the\nearth. It is a question of temperament, or of more or less immersion\nin nature. The last class must needs have a reflex or parasite faith;\nnot a sight of realities, but an instinctive reliance on the seers and\nbelievers of realities. The manners and thoughts of believers astonish\nthem, and convince them that these have seen something which is hid\nfrom themselves. But their sensual habit would fix the believer to his\nlast position, whilst he as inevitably advances; and presently the\nunbeliever, for love of belief, burns the believer.\nGreat believers are always reckoned infidels, impracticable, fantastic,\natheistic, and really men of no account. The spiritualist finds himself\ndriven to express his faith by a series of skepticisms. Charitable\nsouls come with their projects, and ask his cooperation. How can he\nhesitate? It is the rule of mere comity and courtesy to agree where\nyou can, and to turn your sentence with something auspicious, and not\nfreezing and sinister. But he is forced to say, \"O, these things will\nbe as they must be: what can you do? These particular griefs and crimes\nare the foliage and fruit of such trees as we see growing. It is vain\nto complain of the leaf or the berry: cut it off; it will bear another\njust as bad. You must begin your cure lower down.\" The generosities\nof the day prove an intractable element for him. The people's questions\nare not his; their methods are not his; and, against all the dictates\nof good nature, he is driven to say, he has no pleasure in them.\nEven the doctrines dear to the hope of man, of the divine Providence,\nand of the immortality of the soul, his neighbors cannot put the\nstatement so that he shall affirm it. But he denies out of more faith,\nand not less. He denies out of honesty. He had rather stand charged\nwith the imbecility of skepticism, than with untruth. I believe, he\nsays, in the moral design of the universe; it exists hospitably for\nthe weal of the souls; but your dogmas seem to me caricatures; why\nshould I make believe them? Will any say, this is cold and infidel?\nThe wise and magnanimous will not say so. They will exult in his\nfar-sighted good-will, that can abandon to the adversary all the ground\nof tradition and common belief, without losing a jot of strength. It\nsees to the end of all transgression. George Fox saw \"that there was\nan ocean of darkness and death; but withal, an infinite ocean of light\nand love which flowed over that of darkness.\"\nThe final solution in which skepticism is lost is in the moral\nsentiment, which never forfeits its supremacy. All moods may be safely\ntried, and their weight allowed to all objections: the moral sentiment\nas easily outweighs them all, as any one. This is the drop which\nbalances the sea. I play with the miscellany of facts, and take those\nsuperficial views which we call skepticism; but I know that they will\npresently appear to me in that order which makes skepticism impossible.\nA man of thought must feel the thought that is parent of the universe,\nthat the masses of nature do undulate and flow.\nThis faith avails to the whole emergency of life and objects. The world\nis saturated with deity and with law. He is content with just and\nunjust, with sots and fools, with the triumph of folly and fraud. He\ncan behold with serenity the yawning gulf between the ambition of man\nand his power of performance, between the demand and supply of power,\nwhich makes the tragedy of all souls.\nCharles Fourier announced that \"the attractions of man are proportioned\nto his destinies;\" in other words, that every desire predicts its own\nsatisfaction. Yet, all experience exhibits the reverse of this; the\nincompetency of power is the universal grief of young and ardent minds.\nThey accuse the divine Providence of a certain parsimony. It has shown\nthe heaven and earth to every child, and filled him with a desire for\nthe whole; a desire raging, infinite; a hunger, as of space to be\nfilled with planets; a cry of famine, as of devils for souls. Then for\nthe satisfaction,--to each man is administered a single drop, a bead\nof dew of vital power per day,--a cup as large as space, and one drop\nof the water of life in it. Each man woke in the morning, with an\nappetite that could eat the solar system like a cake; a spirit for\naction and passion without bounds; he could lay his hand on the morning\nstar; he could try conclusions with gravitation or chemistry; but, on\nthe first motion to prove his strength--hands, feet, senses, gave way,\nand would not serve him. He was an emperor deserted by his states, and\nleft to whistle by himself, or thrust into a mob of emperors, all\nwhistling: and still the sirens sang, \"The attractions are proportioned\nto the destinies.\" In every house, in the heart of each maiden, and\nof each boy, in the soul of the soaring saint, this chasm is found,--\nbetween the largest promise of ideal power, and the shabby experience.\nThe expansive nature of truth comes to our succor, elastic, not to be\nsurrounded. Man helps himself by larger generalizations. The lesson\nof life is practically to generalize; to believe what the years and\nthe centuries say against the hours; to resist the usurpation of\nparticulars; to penetrate to their catholic sense. Things seem to say\none thing, and say the reverse. The appearance is immoral; the result\nis moral. Things seem to tend downward, to justify despondency, to\npromote rogues, to defeat the just; and, by knaves, as by martyrs, the\njust cause is carried forward. Although knaves win in every political\nstruggle, although society seems to be delivered over from the hands\nof one set of criminals into the hands of another set of criminals,\nas fast as the government is changed, and the march of civilization\nis a train of felonies, yet, general ends are somehow answered. We\nsee, now, events forced on, which seem to retard or retrograde the\ncivility of ages. But the world-spirit is a good swimmer, and storms\nand waves cannot drown him. He snaps his finger at laws; and so,\nthroughout history, heaven seems to affect low and poor means. Through\nthe years and the centuries, through evil agents, through toys and\natoms, a great and beneficent tendency irresistibly streams.\nLet a man learn to look for the permanent in the mutable and fleeting;\nlet him learn to bear the disappearance of things he was wont to\nreverence, without losing his reverence; let him learn that he is here,\nnot to work, but to be worked upon; and that, though abyss open under\nabyss, and opinion displace opinion, all are at last contained in the\nEternal cause.--\n\"If my bark sink, 'tis to another sea.\"\nV. SHAKSPEARE; OR, THE POET.\nGreat men are more distinguished by range and extent than by\noriginality. If we require the originality which consists in weaving,\nlike a spider, their web from their own bowels; in finding clay, and\nmaking bricks and building the house, no great men are original. Nor\ndoes valuable originality consist in unlikeness to other men. The hero\nis in the press of knights, and the thick of events; and, seeing what\nmen want, and sharing their desire, he adds the needful length of sight\nand of arm, to come at the desired point. The greatest genius is the\nmost indebted man. A poet is no rattlebrain, saying what comes\nuppermost, and, because he says everything, saying, at last, something\ngood; but a heart in unison with his time and country. There is nothing\nwhimsical and fantastic in his production, but sweet and sad earnest,\nfreighted with the weightiest convictions, and pointed with the most\ndetermined aim which any man or class knows of in his times.\nThe Genius of our life is jealous of individuals, and will not have\nany individual great, except through the general. There is no choice\nto genius. A great man does not wake up on some fine morning, and say,\n\"I am full of life, I will go to sea, and find an Antarctic continent:\nto-day I will square the circle: I will ransack botany, and find a new\nfood for man: I have a new architecture in my mind: I foresee a new\nmechanic power;\" no, but he finds himself in the river of the thoughts\nand events, forced onward by the ideas and necessities of his\ncontemporaries. He stands where all the eyes of men look one way, and\ntheir hands all point in the direction in which he should go. The\nchurch has reared him amidst rites and pomps, and he carries out the\nadvice which her music gave him, and builds a cathedral needed by her\nchants and processions. He finds a war raging: it educates him by\ntrumpet, in barracks, and he betters the instruction. He finds two\ncounties groping to bring coal, or flour, or fish, from the place of\nproduction to the place of consumption, and he hits on a railroad.\nEvery master has found his materials collected, and his power lay in\nhis sympathy with his people, and in his love of the materials he\nwrought in. What an economy of power! and what a compensation for the\nshortness of life! All is done to his hand. The world has brought him\nthus far on his way. The human race has gone out before him, sunk the\nhills, filled the hollows, and bridged the rivers. Men, nations, poets,\nartisans, women, all have worked for him, and he enters into their\nlabors. Choose any other thing, out of the line of tendency, out of\nthe national feeling and history, and he would have all to do for\nhimself: his powers would be expended in the first preparations. Great\ngenial power, one would almost say, consists in not being original at\nall; in being altogether receptive; in letting the world do all, and\nsuffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed through the mind.\nShakspeare's youth fell in a time when the English people were\nimportunate for dramatic entertainments. The court took offence easily\nat political allusions, and attempted to suppress them. The Puritans,\na growing and energetic party, and the religious among the Anglican\nchurch, would suppress them. But the people wanted them. Inn-yards,\nhouses without roofs, and extemporaneous enclosures at country fairs,\nwere the ready theatres of strolling players. The people had tasted\nthis new joy; and, as we could not hope to suppress newspapers now,--no,\nnot by the strongest party,--neither then could king, prelate, or\npuritan, alone or united, suppress an organ, which was ballad, epic,\nnewspaper, caucus, lecture, punch, and library, at the same time.\nProbably king, prelate and puritan, all found their own account in it.\nIt had become, by all causes, a national interest,--by no means\nconspicuous, so that some great scholar would have thought of treating\nit in an English history,--but not a whit less considerable, because\nit was cheap, and of no account, like a baker's-shop. The best proof\nof its vitality is the crowd of writers which suddenly broke into this\nfield; Kyd, Marlow, Greene, Jonson, Chapman, Dekker, Webster, Heywood,\nMiddleton, Peele, Ford, Massinger, Beaumont, and Fletcher.\nThe secure possession, by the stage, of the public mind, is of the\nfirst importance to the poet who works for it. He loses no time in\nidle experiments. Here is audience and expectation prepared. In the\ncase of Shakespeare there is much more. At the time when he left\nStratford, and went up to London, a great body of stage-plays, of\nall dates and writers, existed in manuscript, and were in turn produced\non the boards. Here is the Tale of Troy, which the audience will bear\nhearing some part of every week; the Death of Julius Caesar, and other\nstories out of Plutarch, which they never tire of; a shelf full of\nEnglish history, from the chronicles of Brut and Arthur, down to the\nroyal Henries, which men hear eagerly; and a string of doleful\ntragedies, merry Italian tales, and Spanish voyages, which all the\nLondon 'prentices know. All the mass has been treated, with more or\nless skill, by every playwright, and the prompter has the soiled and\ntattered manuscripts. It is now no longer possible to say who wrote\nthem first. They have been the property of the Theatre so long, and\nso many rising geniuses have enlarged or altered them, inserting a\nspeech, or a whole scene, or adding a song, that no man can any longer\nclaim copyright on this work of numbers. Happily, no man wishes to.\nThey are not yet desired in that way. We have few readers, many\nspectators and hearers. They had best lie where they are.\nShakspeare, in common with his comrades, esteemed the mass of old\nplays, waste stock, in which any experiment could be freely tried. Had\nthe _prestige_ which hedges about a modern tragedy existed, nothing\ncould have been done. The rude warm blood of the living England\ncirculated in the play, as in street-ballads, and gave body which he\nwanted to his airy and majestic fancy. The poet needs a ground in\npopular tradition on which he may work, and which, again, may restrain\nhis art within the due temperance. It holds him to the people, supplies\na foundation for his edifice; and, in furnishing so much work done to\nhis hand, leaves him at leisure, and in full strength for the audacities\nof his imagination. In short, the poet owes to his legend what sculpture\nowed to the temple. Sculpture in Egypt, and in Greece, grew up in\nsubordination to architecture. It was the ornament of the temple wall:\nat first, a rude relief carved on pediments, then the relief became\nbolder, and a head or arm was projected from the wall, the groups being\nstill arrayed with reference to the building, which serves also as a\nframe to hold the figures; and when, at last, the greatest freedom of\nstyle and treatment was reached, the prevailing genius of architecture\nstill enforced a certain calmness and continence in the statue. As\nsoon as the statue was begun for itself, and with no reference to the\ntemple or palace, the art began to decline: freak, extravagance, and\nexhibition, took the place of the old temperance. This balance-wheel,\nwhich the sculptor found in architecture, the perilous irritability\nof poetic talent found in the accumulated dramatic materials to which\nthe people were already wonted, and which had a certain excellence\nwhich no single genius, however extraordinary, could hope to create.\nIn point of fact, it appears that Shakspeare did owe debts in all\ndirections, and was able to use whatever he found; and the amount of\nindebtedness may be inferred from Malone's laborious computations in\nregard to the First, Second, and Third parts of Henry VI., in which,\n\"out of 6043 lines, 1771 were written by some author preceding\nShakspeare; 2373 by him, on the foundation laid by his predecessors;\nand 1899 were entirely his own.\" And the preceding investigation hardly\nleaves a single drama of his absolute invention. Malone's sentence is\nan important piece of external history. In Henry VIII., I think I see\nplainly the cropping out of the original rock on which his own finer\nstratum was laid. The first play was written by a superior, thoughtful\nman, with a vicious ear. I can mark his lines, and know well their\ncadence. See Wolsey's soliloquy, and the following scene with Cromwell,\nwhere,--instead of the metre of Shakspeare, whose secret is, that the\nthought constructs the tune, so that reading for the sense will best\nbring out the rhythm,--here the lines are constructed on a given tune,\nand the verse has even a trace of pulpit eloquence. But the play\ncontains, through all its length, unmistakable traits of Shakspeare's\nhand, and some passages, as the account of the coronation, are like\nautographs. What is odd, the compliment to Queen Elizabeth is in the\nbad rhythm.\nShakspeare knew that tradition supplies a better fable that any\ninvention can. If he lost any credit of design, he augmented his\nresources; and, at that day our petulant demand for originality was\nnot so much pressed. There was no literature for the million. The\nuniversal reading, the cheap press, were unknown. A great poet, who\nappears in illiterate times, absorbs into his sphere all the light\nwhich is anywhere radiating. Every intellectual jewel, every flower\nof sentiment, it is his fine office to bring to his people; and he\ncomes to value his memory equally with his invention. He is therefore\nlittle solicitous whence his thoughts have been derived; whether through\ntranslation, whether through tradition, whether by travel in distant\ncountries, whether by inspiration; from whatever source, they are\nequally welcome to his uncritical audience. Nay, he borrows very near\nhome. Other men say wise things as well as he; only they say a good\nmany foolish things, and do not know when they have spoken wisely. He\nknows the sparkle of the true stone, and puts it in high place, wherever\nhe finds it. Such is the happy position of Homer, perhaps; of Chaucer,\nof Saadi. They felt that all wit was their wit. And they are librarians\nand historiographers, as well as poets. Each romancer was heir and\ndispenser of all the hundred tales of the world,--\n\"Presenting Thebes' and Pelops' line\nAnd the tale of Troy divine.\"\nThe influence of Chaucer is conspicuous in all our early literature;\nand, more recently, not only Pope and Dryden have been beholden to\nhim, but, in the whole society of English writers, a large\nunacknowledged debt is easily traced. One is charmed with the opulence\nwhich feeds so many pensioners. But Chaucer is a huge borrower. Chaucer,\nit seems, drew continually, through Lydgate and Caxton, from Guido di\nColonna, whose Latin romance of the Trojan war was in turn a compilation\nfrom Dares Phrygius, Ovid, and Statius. Then Petrarch, Boccaccio, and\nthe Provencal poets, are his benefactors: the Romaunt of the Rose is\nonly judicious translation from William of Lorris and John of Meun:\nTroilus and Creseide, from Lollius of Urbino: The Cock and the Fox,\nfrom the _Lais_ of Marie: The House of Fame, from the French or\nItalian: and poor Gower he uses as if he were only a brick-kiln or\nstone-quarry out of which to build his house. He steals by this\napology,--that what he takes has no worth where he finds it, and the\ngreatest where he leaves it. It has come to be practically a sort of\nrule in literature, that a man, having once shown himself capable of\noriginal writing, is entitled thenceforth to steal from the writings\nof others at discretion. Thought is the property of him who can\nentertain it; and of him who can adequately place it. A certain\nawkwardness marks the use of borrowed thoughts; but, as soon as we\nhave learned what to do with them, they become our own.\nThus, all originality is relative. Every thinker is retrospective. The\nlearned member of the legislature, at Westminster, or at Washington,\nspeaks and votes for thousands. Show us the constituency, and the now\ninvisible channels by which the senator is made aware of their wishes,\nthe crowd of practical and knowing men, who, by correspondence or\nconversation, are feeding him with evidence, anecdotes, and estimates,\nand it will bereave his fine attitude and resistance of something of\ntheir impressiveness. As Sir Robert Peel and Mr. Webster vote, so Locke\nand Rousseau think for thousands; and so there were fountains all\naround Homer, Menu, Saadi, or Milton, from which they drew; friends,\nlovers, books, traditions, proverbs,--all perished,--which, if seen,\nwould go to reduce the wonder. Did the bard speak with authority? Did\nhe feel himself, overmatched by any companion? The appeal is to the\nconsciousness of the writer. Is there at last in his breast a Delhi\nwhereof to ask concerning any thought or thing, whether it be verily\nso, yea or nay? and to have answer, and to rely on that? All the debt\nwhich such a man could contract to other wit, would never disturb his\nconsciousness of originality: for the ministrations of books, and of\nother minds, are a whiff of smoke to that most private reality with\nwhich he has conversed.\nIt is easy to see that what is best written or done by genius, in the\nworld, was no man's work, but came by wide social labor, when a thousand\nwrought like one, sharing the same impulse. Our English Bible is a\nwonderful specimen of the strength and music of the English language.\nBut it was not made by one man, or at one time; but centuries and\nchurches brought it to perfection. There never was a time when there\nwas not some translation existing. The Liturgy, admired for its energy\nand pathos, is an anthology of the piety of ages and nations, a\ntranslation of the prayers and forms of the Catholic church,--these\ncollected, too, in long periods, from the prayers and meditations of\nevery saint and sacred writer, all over the world. Grotius makes the\nlike remark in respect to the Lord's Prayer, that the single clauses\nof which it is composed were already in use, in the time of Christ,\nin the rabbinical forms. He picked out the grains of gold. The nervous\nlanguage of the Common Law, the impressive forms of our courts, and\nthe precision and substantial truth of the legal distinctions, are the\ncontribution of all the sharp-sighted, strong-minded men who have lived\nin the countries where these laws govern. The translation of Plutarch\ngets its excellence by being translation on translation. There never\nwas a time when there was none. All the truly diomatic and national\nphrases are kept, and all others successively picked out and thrown\naway. Something like the same process had gone on, long before, with\nthe originals of these books. The world takes liberties with\nworld-books. Vedas, Aesop's Fables, Pilpay, Arabian Nights, Cid, Iliad,\nRobin Hood, Scottish Minstrelsy, are not the work of single men. In\nthe composition of such works, the time thinks, the market thinks, the\nmason, the carpenter, the merchant, the farmer, the fop, all think for\nus. Every book supplies its time with one good word; every municipal\nlaw, every trade, every folly of the day, and the generic catholic\ngenius who is not afraid or ashamed to owe his originality to the\noriginality of all, stands with the next age as the recorder and\nembodiment of his own.\nWe have to thank the researches of antiquaries, and the Shakspeare\nSociety, for ascertaining the steps of the English drama, from the\nMysteries celebrated in churches and by churchmen, and the final\ndetachment from the church, and the completion of secular plays, from\nFerrex and Porrex, and Gammer Gurton's Needle, down to the possession\nof the stage by the very pieces which Shakspeare altered, remodelled,\nand finally made his own. Elated with success, and piqued by the growing\ninterest of the problem, they have left no book-stall unsearched, no\nchest in a garret unopened, no file of old yellow accounts to decompose\nin damp and worms, so keen was the hope to discover whether the boy\nShakspeare poached or not, whether he held horses at the theater door,\nwhether he kept school, and why he left in his will only his second-best\nbed to Ann Hathaway, his wife.\nThere is somewhat touching in the madness with which the passing age\nmischooses the object on which all candles shine, and all eyes are\nturned; the care with which it registers every trifle touching Queen\nElizabeth, and King James, and the Essexes, Leicesters, Burleighs, and\nBuckinghams; and let pass without a single valuable note the founder\nof another dynasty, which alone will cause the Tudor dynasty to be\nremembered,--the man who carries the Saxon race in him by the\ninspiration which feeds him, and on whose thoughts the foremost people\nof the world are now for some ages to be nourished, and minds to receive\nthis and not another bias. A popular player,--nobody suspected he was\nthe poet of the human race; and the secret was kept as faithfully from\npoets and intellectual men, as from courtiers and frivolous people.\nBacon, who took the inventory of the human understanding for his times,\nnever mentioned his name. Ben Jonson, though we have strained his few\nwords of regard and panegyric, had no suspicion of the elastic fame\nwhose first vibrations he was attempting. He no doubt thought the\npraise he has conceded to him generous, and esteemed himself, out of\nall question, the better poet of the two.\nIf it need wit to know wit, according to the proverb, Shakspeare's\ntime should be capable of recognizing it. Sir Henry Wotton was born\nfour years after Shakspeare, and died twenty-three years after him;\nand I find among his correspondents and acquaintances, the following\npersons: Theodore Beza, Isaac Casaubon, Sir Philip Sidney, Earl of\nEssex, Lord Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Milton, Sir Henry Vane,\nIsaac Walton, Dr. Donne, Abraham Cowley, Bellarmine, Charles Cotton,\nJohn Pym, John Hales, Kepler, Vieta, Albericus Gentilis, Paul Sarpi,\nAriminius; with all of whom exist some token of his having communicated,\nwithout enumerating many others, whom doubtless he saw,--Shakspeare,\nSpenser, Jonson, Beaumont, Massinger, two Herberts, Marlow, Chapman,\nand the rest. Since the constellation of great men who appeared in\nGreece in the time of Pericles, there was never any such society;--yet\ntheir genius failed them to find out the best head in the universe.\nOur poet's mask was impenetrable. You cannot see the mountain near.\nIt took a century to make it suspected; and not until two centuries\nhad passed, after his death, did any criticism which we think adequate\nbegin to appear. It was not possible to write the history of Shakspeare\ntill now; for he is the father of German literature: it was on the\nintroduction of Shakspeare into German by Lessing, and the translation\nof his works by Wieland and Schlegel, that the rapid burst of German\nliterature was most intimately connected. It was not until the\nnineteenth century, whose speculative genius is a sort of living Hamlet,\nthat the tragedy of Hamlet should find such wondering readers. Now,\nliterature, philosophy, and thought are Shakspearized. His mind is the\nhorizon beyond which, at present, we do not see. Our ears are educated\nto music by his rhythm. Coleridge and Goethe are the only critics who\nhave expressed our convictions with any adequate fidelity: but there\nis in all cultivated minds a silent appreciation of his superlative\npower and beauty, which, like Christianity, qualifies the period.\nThe Shakspeare Society have inquired in all directions, advertised the\nmissing facts, offered money for any information that will lead to\nproof; and with what results? Beside some important illustration of\nthe history of the English stage, to which I have adverted, they have\ngleaned a few facts touching the property, and dealings in regard to\nproperty, of the poet. It appears that, from year to year, he owned\na larger share in the Blackfriars' Theater: its wardrobe and other\nappurtenances were his: that he bought an estate in his native village,\nwith his earnings, as writer and shareholder; that he lived in the\nbest house in Stratford; was intrusted by his neighbors with their\ncommissions in London, as of borrowing money, and the like; that he\nwas a veritable farmer. About the time when he was writing Macbeth,\nhe sues Philip Rogers, in the borough-court of Stratford, for\nthirty-five shillings ten pence, for corn delivered to him at different\ntimes; and, in all respects, appears as a good husband, with no\nreputation for eccentricity or excess. He was a good-natured sort of\nman, an actor and shareholder in the theater, not in any striking\nmanner distinguished from other actors and managers. I admit the\nimportance of this information. It was well worth the pains that have\nbeen taken to procure it.\nBut whatever scraps of information concerning his condition these\nresearches may have rescued, they can shed no light upon that infinite\ninvention which is the concealed magnet of his attraction for us. We\nare very clumsy writers of history. We tell the chronicle of parentage,\nbirth, birthplace, schooling, schoolmates, earning of money, marriage,\npublication of books, celebrity, death; and when we have come to an\nend of this gossip, no ray of relation appears between it and the\ngoddess-born; and it seems as if, had we dipped at random into the\n\"Modern Plutarch,\" and read any other life there, it would have fitted\nthe poems as well, It is the essence of poetry to spring, like the\nrainbow daughter of Wonder, from the invisible, to abolish the past,\nand refuse all history. Malone, Warburton, Dyce, and Collier, have\nwasted their oil. The famed theaters, Covent Garden, Drury Lane, the\nPark, and Tremont, have vainly assisted. Betterton, Garrick, Kemble,\nKean, and Macready, dedicate their lives to this genius; him they\ncrown, elucidate, obey, and express. The genius knows them not. The\nrecitation begins; one golden word leaps out immortal from all this\npainted pedantry, and sweetly torments us with invitations to its own\ninaccessible homes. I remember, I went once to see the Hamlet of a\nfamed performer, the pride of the English stage; and all I then heard,\nand all I now remember, of the tragedian, was that in which the\ntragedian had no part; simply, Hamlet's question to the ghost,--\n\"What may this mean,\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel\nRevisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon?\"\nThat imagination which dilates the closet he writes into the world's\ndimension, crowds it with agents in rank and order, as quickly reduces\nthe big reality to be the glimpses of the moon. These tricks of his\nmagic spoil for us the illusions of the green-room. Can any biography\nshed light on the localities into which the Midsummer Night's Dream\nadmits me? Did Shakspeare confide to any notary or parish recorder,\nsacristan, or surrogate, in Stratford, the genesis of that delicate\ncreation? The forest of Arden, the nimble air of Scone Castle, the\nmoonlight of Portia's villa, \"the antres vast and desarts idle,\" of\nOthello's captivity,--where is the third cousin, or grand-nephew, the\nchancellor's file of accounts, or private letter, that has kept one\nword of those transcendent secrets. In fine, in this drama, as in all\ngreat works of art,--in the Cyclopaean architecture of Egypt and India;\nin the Phidian sculpture; the Gothic minsters; the Italian painting;\nthe Ballads of Spain and Scotland,--the Genius draws up the ladder\nafter him, when the creative age goes up to heaven, and gives way to\na new, who see the works, and ask in vain for a history.\nShakspeare is the only biographer of Shakspeare; and even he can tell\nnothing, except to the Shakspeare in us; that is, to our most\napprehensive and sympathetic hour. He cannot step from off his tripod,\nand give us anecdotes of his inspirations. Read the antique documents\nextricated, analyzed, and compared, by the assiduous Dyce and Collier;\nand now read one of those skyey sentences,--aerolites,--which seem to\nhave fallen out of heaven, and which, not your experience, but the man\nwithin the breast, has accepted as words of fate; and tell me if they\nmatch; if the former account in any manner for the latter; or, which\ngives the most historical insight into the man.\nHence, though our external history is so meager, yet, with Shakspeare\nfor biographer, instead of Aubrey and Rowe, we have really the\ninformation which is material, that which describes character and\nfortune; that which, if we were about to meet the man and deal with\nhim, would most import us to know. We have his recorded convictions\non those questions which knock for answer at every heart,--on life and\ndeath, on love, on wealth and poverty, on the prizes of life, and the\nways whereby we may come at them; on the characters of men, and the\ninfluences, occult and open, which affect their fortunes: and on those\nmysterious and demoniacal powers which defy our science, and which yet\ninterweave their malice and their gift in our brightest hours. Who\never read the volume of Sonnets, without finding that the poet had\nthere revealed, under masks that are no masks to the intelligent, the\nlore of friendship and of love; the confusion of sentiments in the\nmost susceptible, and, at the same time, the most intellectual of men?\nWhat trait of his private mind has he hidden in his dramas? One can\ndiscern, in his ample pictures of the gentleman and the king, what\nforms and humanities pleased him; his delight in troops of friends,\nin large hospitality, in cheerful giving. Let Timon, let Warwick, let\nAntonio the merchant, answer for his great heart. So far from Shakspeare\nbeing the least known, he is the one person, in all modern history,\nknown to us. What point of morals, of manners, of economy, of\nphilosophy, of religion, of taste, of the conduct of life, has he not\nsettled? What mystery has he not signified his knowledge of? What\noffice or function, or district of man's work, has he not remembered?\nWhat king has he not taught state, as Talma taught Napoleon? What\nmaiden has not found him finer than her delicacy? What lover has he\nnot outloved? What sage has he not outseen? What gentleman has he not\ninstructed in the rudeness of his behavior?\nSome able and appreciating critics think no criticism on Shakspeare\nvaluable, that does not rest purely on the dramatic merit; that he is\nfalsely judged as poet and philosopher. I think as highly as these\ncritics of his dramatic merit, but still think it secondary. He was\na full man, who liked to talk; a brain exhaling thoughts and images,\nwhich, seeking vent, found the drama next at hand. Had he been less,\nwe should have had to consider how well he filled his place, how good\na dramatist he was,--and he is the best in the world. But it turns\nout; that what he has to say is of that weight, as to withdraw some\nattention from the vehicle; and he is like some saint whose history\nis to be rendered into all languages, into verse and prose, into songs\nand pictures, and cut up into proverbs; so that the occasions which\ngave the saint's meaning the form of a conversation, or of a prayer,\nor of a code of laws, is immaterial compared with the universality of\nits application. So it fares with the wise Shakspeare and his book of\nlife. He wrote the airs for all our modern music: he wrote the text\nof modern life; the text of manners: he drew the man of England and\nEurope; the father of the man in America: he drew the man and described\nthe day, and what is done in it: he read the hearts of men and women,\ntheir probity, and their second thought, and wiles; the wiles of\ninnocence, and the transitions by which virtues and vices slide into\ntheir contraries: he could divide the mother's part from the father's\npart in the face of the child, or draw the fine demarcations of freedom\nand fate: he knew the laws of repression which make the police of\nnature: and all the sweets and all the terrors of human lot lay in his\nmind as truly but as softly as the landscape lies on the eye. And the\nimportance of this wisdom of life sinks the form, as of Drama or Epic,\nout of notice. 'Tis like making a question concerning the paper on\nwhich a king's message is written.\nShakspeare is as much out of the category of eminent authors, as he\nis out of the crowd. He is inconceivably wise; the others, conceivably.\nA good reader can, in a sort, nestle into Plato's brain, and think\nfrom thence; but not into Shakspeare's. We are still out of doors. For\nexecutive faculty, for creation, Shakspeare is unique. No man can\nimagine it better. He was the farthest reach of subtlety compatible\nwith an individual self,--the subtilest of authors, and only just\nwithin the possibility of authorship. With this wisdom of life, is the\nequal endowment of imaginative and of lyric power. He clothed the\ncreatures of his legend with form and sentiments, as if they were\npeople who had lived under his roof; and few real men have left such\ndistinct characters as these fictions. And they spoke in language as\nsweet as it was fit. Yet his talents never seduced him into an\nostentation, nor did he harp on one string. An omnipresent humanity\nco-ordinates all his faculties. Give a man of talents a story to tell,\nand his partiality will presently appear. He has certain observations,\nopinions, topics, which have some accidental prominence, and which he\ndisposes all to exhibit. He crams this part, and starves that other\npart, consulting not the fitness of the thing, but his fitness and\nstrength. But Shakspeare has no peculiarity, no importunate topic; but\nall is duly given; no veins, no curiosities: no cow-painter, no\nbird-fancier, no mannerist is he: he has no discoverable egotism: the\ngreat he tells greatly; the small subordinately. He is wise without\nemphasis or assertion; he is strong, as nature is strong, who lifts\nthe land into mountain slopes without effort, and by the same rule as\nshe floats a bubble in the air, and likes as well to do the one as the\nother. This makes that equality of power in farce, tragedy, narrative,\nand love-songs; a merit so incessant, that each reader is incredulous\nof the perception of other readers.\nThis power of expression, or of transferring the inmost truth of things\ninto music and verse, makes him the type of the poet, and has added\na new problem to metaphysics. This is that which throws him into natural\nhistory, as a main production of the globe, and as announcing new eras\nand ameliorations. Things were mirrored in his poetry without loss or\nblur: he could paint the fine with precision, the great with compass;\nthe tragic and comic indifferently, and without any distortion or\nfavor. He carried his powerful execution into minute details, to a\nhair point; finishes an eyelash or a dimple as firmly as he draws a\nmountain; and yet these like nature's, will bear the scrutiny of the\nsolar microscope.\nIn short, he is the chief example to prove that more or less of\nproduction, more or fewer pictures, is a thing indifferent. He had the\npower to make one picture. Daguerre learned how to let one flower etch\nits image on his plate of iodine; and then proceeds at leisure to etch\na million. There are always objects; but there was never representation.\nHere is perfect representation, at last; and now let the world of\nfigures sit for their portraits. No recipe can be given for the making\nof a Shakspeare; but the possibility of the translation of things into\nsong is demonstrated.\nHis lyric power lies in the genius of the piece. The sonnets, though\ntheir excellence is lost in the splendor of the dramas, are as\ninimitable as they: and it is not a merit of lines, but a total merit\nof the piece; like the tone of voice of some incomparable person, so\nis this a speech of poetic beings, and any clause as unproducible now\nas a whole poem.\nThough the speeches in the plays, and single lines, have a beauty which\ntempts the ear to pause on them for their euphuism, yet the sentence\nis so loaded with meaning, and so linked with its foregoers and\nfollowers, that the logician is satisfied. His means are as admirable\nas his ends; every subordinate invention, by which he helps himself\nto connect some irreconcilable opposites, is a poem too. He is not\nreduced to dismount and walk, because his horses are running off with\nhim in some distant direction: he always rides.\nThe finest poetry was first experience: but the thought has suffered\na transformation since it was an experience. Cultivated men often\nattain a good degree of skill in writing verses; but it is easy to\nread, through their poems, their personal history; any one acquainted\nwith parties can name every figure: this is Andrew, and that is Rachel.\nThe sense thus remains prosaic. It is a caterpillar with wings, and\nnot yet a butterfly. In the poet's mind, the fact has gone quite over\ninto the new element of thought, and has lost all that is exuvial.\nThis generosity abides with Shakspeare. We say, from the truth and\ncloseness of his pictures, that he knows the lesson by heart. Yet there\nis not a trace of egotism.\nOne more royal trait properly belongs to the poet. I mean his\ncheerfulness, without which no man can be a poet,--for beauty is his\naim. He loves virtue, not for its obligation, but for its grace: he\ndelights in the world, in man, in woman, for the lovely light that\nsparkles from them. Beauty, the spirit of joy and hilarity, he sheds\nover the universe. Epicurus relates, that poetry hath such charms that\na lover might forsake his mistress to partake of them. And the true\nbards have been noted for their firm and cheerful temper. Homer lies\nin sunshine; Chaucer is glad and erect; and Saadi says, \"It was rumored\nabroad that I was penitent; but what had I to do with repentance?\" Not\nless sovereign and cheerful,--much more sovereign and cheerful is the\ntone of Shakspeare. His name suggests joy and emancipation to the heart\nof men. If he should appear in any company of human souls, who would\nnot march in his troop? He touches nothing that does not borrow health\nand longevity from his festive style.\nAnd now, how stands the account of man with this bard and benefactor,\nwhen in solitude, shutting our ears to the reverberations of his fame,\nwe seek to strike the balance? Solitude has austere lessons; it can\nteach us to spare both heroes and poets; and it weighs Shakspeare also,\nand finds him to share the halfness and imperfections of humanity.\nShakspeare, Homer, Dante, Chaucer, saw the splendor of meaning that\nplays over the visible world; knew that a tree had another use than\nfor apples, and corn another than for meal, and the ball of the earth,\nthan for tillage and roads: that these things bore a second and finer\nharvest to the mind, being emblems of its thoughts, and conveying in\nall their natural history a certain mute commentary on human life.\nShakspeare employed them as colors to compose his picture. He rested\nin their beauty; and never took the step which seemed inevitable to\nsuch genius, namely, to explore the virtue which resides in these\nsymbols, and imparts this power,--what is that which they themselves\nsay? He converted the elements, which waited on his command, into\nentertainments. He was master of the revels to mankind. Is it not as\nif one should have, through majestic powers of science, the comets\ngiven into his hand, or the planets and their moons, and should draw\nthem from their orbits to glare with the municipal fireworks on a\nholiday night, and advertise in all towns, \"very superior pyrotechny\nthis evening!\" Are the agents of nature, and the power to understand\nthem, worth no more than a street serenade, or the breath of a cigar?\nOne remembers again the trumpet-text in the Koran--\"The heavens and\nthe earth, and all that is between them, think ye we have created them\nin jest?\" As long as the question is of talent and mental power, the\nworld of men has not his equal to show. But when the question is to\nlife, and its materials, and its auxiliaries, how does he profit me?\nWhat does it signify? It is but a Twelfth Night, or Midsummer-Night's\nDream, or a Winter Evening's Tale: what signifies another picture more\nor less? The Egyptian verdict of the Shakspeare Societies comes to\nmind, that he was a jovial actor and manager. I cannot marry this fact\nto his verse. Other admirable men have led lives in some sort of keeping\nwith their thought; but this man, in wide contrast. Had he been less,\nhad he reached only the common measure of great authors, of Bacon,\nMilton, Tasso, Cervantes, we might leave the fact in the twilight of\nhuman fate: but, that this man of men, he who gave to the science of\nmind a new and larger subject than had ever existed, and planted the\nstandard of humanity some furlongs forward into Chaos,--that he should\nnot be wise for himself,--it must even go into the world's history,\nthat the best poet led an obscure and profane life, using his genius\nfor the public amusement.\nWell, other men, priest and prophet, Israelite, German, and Swede,\nbeheld the same objects: they also saw through them that which was\ncontained. And to what purpose? The beauty straightway vanishes; they\nread commandments, all-excluding mountainous duty; an obligation, a\nsadness, as of piled mountains, fell on them, and life became ghastly,\njoyless, a pilgrim's progress, a probation, beleaguered round with\ndoleful histories of Adam's fall and curse, behind us; with doomsdays\nand purgatorial and penal fires before us; and the heart of the seer\nand the heart of the listener sank in them.  It must be conceded that\nthese are half-views of half-men. The world still wants its\npoet-priest, a reconciler, who shall not trifle with Shakspeare the\nplayer, nor shall grope in graves with Swedenborg the mourner; but who\nshall see, speak, and act, with equal inspiration. For knowledge will\nbrighten the sunshine; right is more beautiful than private affection;\nand love is compatible with universal wisdom.\nVI. NAPOLEON; OR, THE MAN OF THE WORLD.\nAmong the eminent persons of the nineteenth century, Bonaparte is far\nthe best known, and the most powerful; and owes his predominance to\nthe fidelity with which he expresses the tone of thought and belief,\nthe aims of the masses of active and cultivated men. It is Swedenborg's\ntheory, that every organ is made up of homogeneous particles; or, as\nit is sometimes expressed, every whole is made of similars; that is,\nthe lungs are composed of infinitely small lungs; the liver, of\ninfinitely small livers; the kidney, of little kidneys, etc. Following\nthis analogy, if any man is found to carry with him the power and\naffections of vast numbers, if Napoleon is France, if Napoleon is\nEurope, it is because the people whom he sways are little Napoleons.\nIn our society, there is a standing antagonism between the conservative\nand the democratic classes; between those who have made their fortunes,\nand the young and the poor who have fortunes to make; between the\ninterests of dead labor,--that is, the labor of hands long ago still\nin the grave, which labor is now entombed in money stocks, or in land\nand buildings owned by idle capitalists,--and the interests of living\nlabor, which seeks to possess itself of land, and buildings, and money\nstocks. The first class is timid, selfish, illiberal, hating innovation,\nand continually losing numbers by death. The second class is selfish\nalso, encroaching, bold, self-relying, always outnumbering the other,\nand recruiting its numbers every hour by births. It desires to keep\nopen every avenue to the competition of all, and to multiply\navenues;--the class of business men in America, in England, in France,\nand throughout Europe; the class of industry and skill. Napoleon is\nits representative. The instinct of active, brave, able men, throughout\nthe middle class everywhere, has pointed out Napoleon as the incarnate\nDemocrat. He had their virtues, and their vices; above all, he had\ntheir spirit or aim. That tendency is material, pointing at a sensual\nsuccess, and employing the richest and most various means to that end;\nconversant with mechanical powers, highly intellectual, widely and\naccurately learned and skilful, but subordinating all intellectual and\nspiritual forces into means to a material success. To be the rich man\nis the end. \"God has granted\" says the Koran, \"to every people a prophet\nin its own tongue.\" Paris, and London, and New York, the spirit of\ncommerce, of money, and material power, were also to have their prophet;\nand Bonaparte was qualified and sent.\nEvery one of the million readers of anecdotes, or memoirs, or lives\nof Napoleon, delights in the page, because he studies in it his own\nhistory. Napoleon is thoroughly modern, and, at the highest point of\nhis fortunes, has the very spirit of the newspapers. He is no saint,--to\nuse his own word, \"no capuchin,\" and he is no hero, in the high sense.\nThe man in the street finds in him the qualities and powers of other\nmen in the street. He finds him, like himself, by birth a citizen,\nwho, by very intelligible merits, arrived at such a commanding position,\nthat he could indulge all those tastes which the common man possesses,\nbut is obliged to conceal and deny; good society, good books, fast\ntraveling, dress, dinners, servants without number, personal weight,\nthe execution of his ideas, the standing in the attitude of a benefactor\nto all persons about him, the refined enjoyments of pictures, statues,\nmusic, palaces, and conventional honors,--precisely what is agreeable\nto the heart of every man in the nineteenth century,--this powerful\nman possessed.\nIt is true that a man of Napoleon's truth of adaptation to the mind\nof the masses around him becomes not merely representative, but actually\na monopolizer and usurper of other minds. Thus Mirabeau plagiarized\nevery good thought, every good word, that was spoken in France. Dumont\nrelates that he sat in the gallery of the Convention, and heard Mirabeau\nmake a speech. It struck Dumont that he could fit it with a peroration,\nwhich he wrote in pencil immediately, and showed to Lord Elgin, who\nsat by him. Lord Elgin approved it, and Dumont, in the evening, showed\nit to Mirabeau. Mirabeau read it, pronounced it admirable, and declared\nhe would incorporate it into his harangue, to-morrow, to the Assembly.\n\"It is impossible,\" said Dumont, \"as, unfortunately, I have shown it\nto Lord Elgin.\" \"If you have shown it to Lord Elgin, and to fifty\npersons beside, I shall still speak it to-morrow:\" and he did speak\nit, with much effect, at the next day's session. For Mirabeau, with\nhis overpowering personality, felt that these things, which his presence\ninspired, were as much his own, as if he had said them, and that his\nadoption of them gave them their weight. Much more absolute and\ncentralizing was the successor to Mirabeau's popularity, and to much\nmore than his predominance in France. Indeed, a man of Napoleon's stamp\nalmost ceases to have a private speech and opinion. He is so largely\nreceptive, and is so placed, that he comes to be a bureau for all the\nintelligence, wit, and power, of the age and country. He gains the\nbattle; he makes the code; he makes the system of weights and measures;\nhe levels the Alps; he builds the road. All distinguished engineers,\nsavants, statists, report to him; so likewise do all good heads in\nevery kind; he adopts the best measures, sets his stamp on them, and\nnot these alone, but on every happy and memorable expression. Every\nsentence spoken by Napoleon, and every line of his writing, deserves\nreading, as it is the sense of France.\nBonaparte was the idol of common men, because he had in transcendent\ndegree the qualities and powers of common men. There is a certain\nsatisfaction in coming down to the lowest ground of politics, for we\nget rid of cant and hypocrisy. Bonaparte wrought, in common with that\ngreat class he represented, for power and wealth,--but Bonaparte,\nspecially, without any scruple as to the means. All the sentiments\nwhich embarrass men's pursuit of these objects, he set aside. The\nsentiments were for women and children. Fontanes, in 1804, expressed\nNapoleon's own sense, when, in behalf of the Senate, he addressed\nhim,--\"Sire, the desire of perfection is the worst disease that ever\nafflicted the human mind.\" The advocates of liberty, and of progress,\nare \"ideologists;\"--a word of contempt often in his mouth;--\"Necker\nis an ideologist:\" \"Lafayette is an ideologist.\"\nAn Italian proverb, too well known, declares that, \"if you would\nsucceed, you must not be too good.\" It is an advantage, within certain\nlimits, to have renounced the dominion of the sentiments of piety,\ngratitude, and generosity; since, what was an impassable bar to us,\nand still is to others, becomes a convenient weapon for our purposes;\njust as the river which was a formidable barrier, winter transforms\ninto the smoothest of roads.\nNapoleon renounced, once for all, sentiments and affections, and would\nhelp himself with his hands and his head. With him is no miracle, and\nno magic. He is a worker in brass, in iron, in wood, in earth, in\nroads, in buildings, in money, and in troops, and a very consistent\nand wise master-workman. He is never weak and literary, but acts with\nthe solidity and the precision of natural agents. He has not lost his\nnative sense and sympathy with things. Men give way before such a man\nas before natural events. To be sure, there are men enough who are\nimmersed in things, as farmers, smiths, sailors, and mechanics\ngenerally; and we know how real and solid such men appear in the\npresence of scholars and grammarians; but these men ordinarily lack\nthe power of arrangement, and are like hands without a head. But\nBonaparte superadded to this mineral and animal force, insight and\ngeneralization, so that men saw in him combined the natural and the\nintellectual power, as if the sea and land had taken flesh and begun\nto cipher. Therefore the land and sea seem to presuppose him. He came\nunto his own, and they received him. This ciphering operative knows\nwhat he is working with, and what is the product. He knew the properties\nof gold and iron, of wheels and ships, of troops and diplomatists, and\nrequired that each should do after its kind.\nThe art of war was the game in which he exerted his arithmetic. It\nconsisted, according to him, in having always more forces than the\nenemy, on the point where the enemy is attacked, or where he attacks:\nand his whole talent is strained by endless manoeuvre and evolution,\nto march always on the enemy at an angle, and destroy his forces in\ndetail. It is obvious that a very small force, skilfully and rapidly\nmanoeuvring, so as always to bring two men against one at the point\nof engagement, will be an overmatch for a much larger body of men.\nThe times, his constitution, and his early circumstances, combined to\ndevelop this pattern democrat. He had the virtues of his class, and\nthe conditions for their activity. That common sense, which no sooner\nrespects any end, than it finds the means to effect it; the delight\nin the use of means; in the choice, simplification, and combining of\nmeans; the directness and thoroughness of his work; the prudence with\nwhich all was seen, and the energy with which all was done, make him\nthe natural organ and head of what I may almost call, from its extent,\nthe modern party.\nNature must have far the greatest share in every success, and so in\nhis. Such a man was wanted, and such a man was born; a man of stone\nand iron, capable of sitting on horseback sixteen or seventeen hours,\nof going many days together without rest or food, except by snatches,\nand with the speed and spring of a tiger in action; a man not\nembarrassed by any scruples; compact, instant, selfish, prudent, and\nof a perception which did not suffer itself to be balked or misled by\nany pretences of others, or any superstition, or any heat or haste of\nhis own. \"My hand of iron,\" he said, \"was not at the extremity of my\narm; it was immediately connected with my head.\" He respected the power\nof nature and fortune, and ascribed to it his superiority, instead of\nvaluing himself, like inferior men, on his opinionativeness and waging\nwar with nature. His favorite rhetoric lay in allusion to his star:\nand he pleased himself, as well as the people, when he styled himself\nthe \"Child of Destiny.\" \"They charge me,\" he said, \"with the commission\nof great crimes: men of my stamp do not commit crimes. Nothing has\nbeen more simple than my elevation: 'tis in vain to ascribe it to\nintrigue or crime: it was owing to the peculiarity of the times, and\nto my reputation of having fought well against the enemies of my\ncountry. I have always marched with the opinion of great masses, and\nwith events. Of what use, then, would crimes be to me?\" Again he said,\nspeaking of his son, \"My son cannot replace me; I could not replace\nmyself. I am the creature of circumstances.\" He had a directness of\naction never before combined with so much comprehension. He is a\nrealist, terrific to all talkers, and confused truth-obscuring persons.\nHe sees where the matter hinges, throws himself on the precise point\nof resistance, and slights all other considerations. He is strong in\nthe right manner, namely, by insight. He never blundered into victory,\nbut won his battles in his head, before he won them on the field. His\nprincipal means are in himself. He asks counsel of no other. In 1796,\nhe writes to the Directory: \"I have conducted the campaign without\nconsulting any one. I should have done no good, if I had been under\nthe necessity of conforming to the notions of another person. I have\ngained some advantages over superior forces, and when totally destitute\nof everything, because, in the persuasion that your confidence was\nreposed in me, my actions were as prompt as my thoughts.\"\nHistory is full, down to this day, of the imbecility of kings and\ngovernors. They are a class of persons much to be pitied, for they\nknow not what they should do. The weavers strike for bread; and the\nking and his ministers, not knowing what to do, meet them with bayonets.\nBut Napoleon understood his business. Here was a man who, in each\nmoment and emergency, knew what to do next. It is an immense comfort\nand refreshment to the spirits, not only of kings, but of citizens.\nFew men have any next; they live from hand to mouth, without plan, and\nare ever at the end of their line, and, after each action, wait for\nan impulse from abroad. Napoleon had been the first man of the world\nif his ends had been purely public. As he is, he inspires confidence\nand vigor by the extraordinary unity of his action. He is firm, sure,\nself-denying, self-postponing, sacrificing everything to his\naim,--money, troops, generals, and his own safety also, to his aim;\nnot misled, like common adventurers, by the splendor of his own means.\n\"Incidents ought not to govern policy,\" he said, \"but policy,\nincidents.\" \"To be hurried away by every event, is to have no political\nsystem at all. His victories were only so many doors, and he never for\na moment lost sight of his way onward, in the dazzle and uproar of the\npresent circumstance. He knew what to do, and he flew to his mark. He\nwould shorten a straight line to come at his object. Horrible anecdotes\nmay, no doubt, be collected from his history, of the price at which\nhe bought his successes; but he must not therefore be set down as\ncruel; but only as one who knew no impediment to his will; not\nbloodthirsty, not cruel,--but woe to what thing or person stood in his\nway! Not bloodthirsty, but not sparing of blood,--and pitiless. He saw\nonly the object: the obstacle must give way. \"Sire, General Clarke\ncannot combine with General Junot, for the dreadful fire of the Austrian\nbattery.\"--\"Let him carry the battery.\"--\"Sire, every regiment that\napproaches the heavy artillery is sacrified: Sire, what orders?\"--\n\"Forward, forward!\" Seruzier, a colonel of artillery, gives, in his\n\"Military Memoirs,\" the following sketch of a scene after the battle\nof Austerlitz.--\"At the moment in which the Russian army was making\nits retreat, painfully, but in good order, on the ice of the lake, the\nEmperor Napoleon came riding at full speed toward the artillery. 'You\nare losing time,' he cried; 'fire upon those masses; they must be\nengulfed; fire upon the ice!' The order remained unexecuted for ten\nminutes. In vain several officers and myself were placed on the slope\nof a hill to produce the effect; their balls and mine rolled upon the\nice, without breaking it up. Seeing that, I tried a simple method of\nelevating light howitzers. The almost perpendicular fall of the heavy\nprojectiles produced the desired effect. My method was immediately\nfollowed by the adjoining batteries, and in less than no time we buried\n'some' [Footnote: As I quote at second-hand, and cannot procure\nSeruzier, I dare not adopt the high figure I find.] thousands of\nRussians and Austrians under the waters of the lake.\"\nIn the plenitude of his resources, every obstacle seemed to vanish.\n\"There shall be no Alps,\" he said; and he built his perfect roads,\nclimbing by graded galleries their steepest precipices, until Italy\nwas as open to Paris as any town in France. He laid his bones to, and\nwrought for his crown. Having decided what was to be done, he did that\nwith might and main. He put out all his strength. He risked everything,\nand spared nothing, neither ammunition, nor money, nor troops, nor\ngenerals, nor himself.\nWe like to see everything do its office after its kind, whether it be\na milch-cow or a rattlesnake; and, if fighting be the best mode of\nadjusting national differences (as large majorities of men seem to\nagree), certainly Bonaparte was right in making it thorough. \"The grand\nprinciple of war,\" he said, \"was, that an army ought always to be\nready, by day and by night, and at all hours, to make all the resistance\nit is capable of making.\" He never economized his ammunition, but, on\na hostile position, rained a torrent of iron,--shells, balls,\ngrape-shot,--to annihilate all defense. On any point of resistance,\nhe concentrated squadron on squadron in overwhelming numbers, until\nit was swept out of existence. To a regiment of horse-chasseurs at\nLobenstein, two days before the battle of Jena, Napoleon said, \"My\nlads, you must not fear death; when soldiers brave death, they drive\nhim into the enemy's ranks.\" In the fury of assault, he no more spared\nhimself. He went to the edge of his possibility. It is plain that in\nItaly he did what he could, and all that he could. He came, several\ntimes, within an inch of ruin; and his own person was all but lost.\nHe was flung into the marsh at Arcola. The Austrians were between him\nand his troops, in the melee, and he was brought off with desperate\nefforts. At Lonato, and at other places, he was on the point of being\ntaken prisoner. He fought sixty battles. He had never enough. Each\nvictory was a new weapon. \"My power would fall, were I not to support\nit by new achievements. Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest\nmust maintain me.\" He felt, with every wise man, that as much life is\nneeded for conservation as for creation. We are always in peril, always\nin a bad plight, just on the edge of destruction, and only to be saved\nby invention and courage.\nThis vigor was guarded and tempered by the coldest prudence and\npunctuality. A thunderbolt in the attack, he was found invulnerable\nin his intrenchments. His very attack was never the inspiration of\ncourage, but the result of calculation. His idea of the best defense\nconsists in being still the attacking party. \"My ambition,\" he says,\n\"was great, but was of a cold nature.\" In one of his conversations\nwith Las Casas, he remarked, \"As to moral courage, I have rarely met\nwith the two-o'clock-in-the-morning kind; I mean unprepared courage,\nthat which, is necessary on an unexpected occasion; and which, in spite\nof the most unforeseen events, leaves full freedom of judgment and\ndecision;\" and he did not hesitate to declare that he was himself\neminently endowed with this \"two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage, and\nthat he had met with few persons equal to himself in this respect.\"\nEverything depended on the nicety of his combinations, and the stars\nwere not more punctual than his arithmetic. His personal attention\ndescended to the smallest particulars. \"At Montebello, I ordered\nKellermann to attack with eight hundred horse, and with these he\nseparated the six thousand Hungarian grenadiers, before the very eyes\nof the Austrian cavalry. This cavalry was half a league off, and\nrequired a quarter of an hour to arrive on the field of action; and\nI have observed, that it is always these quarters of an hour that\ndecide the fate of a battle.\" \"Before he fought a battle, Bonaparte\nthought little about what he should do in case of success, but a great\ndeal about what he should do in case of a reverse of fortune. \"The\nsame prudence and good sense mark all his behavior. His instructions\nto his secretary at the Tuilleries are worth remembering. \"During the\nnight, enter my chamber as seldom as possible. Do not wake me when you\nhave any good news to communicate; with that there is no hurry. But\nwhen you bring bad news, rouse me instantly, for then there is not a\nmoment to be lost.\" It was a whimsical economy of the same kind which\ndictated his practice, when general in Italy, in regard to his\nburdensome correspondence. He directed Bourienne to leave all letters\nunopened for three weeks, and then observed with satisfaction how large\na part of the correspondence had thus disposed of itself, and no longer\nrequired an answer. His achievement of business was immense, and\nenlarges the known powers of man. There have been many working kings,\nfrom Ulysses to William of Orange, but none who accomplished a tithe\nof this man's performance.\nTo these gifts of nature, Napoleon added the advantage of having been\nborn to a private and humble fortune. In his latter days, he had the\nweakness of wishing to add to his crowns and badges the prescription\nof aristocracy; but he knew his debt to his austere education, and\nmade no secret of his contempt for the born kings, and for \"the\nhereditary asses,\" as he coarsely styled the Bourbons. He said that,\n\"in their exile, they had learned nothing, and forgot nothing.\"\nBonaparte had passed through all the degrees of military service, but\nalso was citizen before he was emperor, and so had the key to\ncitizenship. His remarks and estimates discover the information and\njustness of measurement of the middle class. Those who had to deal\nwith him found that he was not to be imposed upon, but could cipher\nas well as another man. This appears in all parts of his Memoirs,\ndictated at St. Helena. When the expenses of the empress, of his\nhousehold, of his palaces, had accumulated great debts, Napoleon\nexamined the bills of the creditors himself, detected overcharges and\nerrors, and reduced the claims by considerable sums.\nHis grand weapon, namely, the millions whom he directed, he owed to\nthe representative character which clothed him. He interests us as he\nstands for France and for Europe; and he exists as captain and king,\nonly as far as the Revolution, or the interest of the industrious\nmasses found an organ and a leader in him. In the social interests,\nhe knew the meaning and value of labor, and threw himself naturally\non that side. I like an incident mentioned by one of his biographers\nat St. Helena. \"When walking with Mrs. Balcombe, some servants, carrying\nheavy boxes, passed by on the road, and Mrs. Balcombe desired them,\nin rather an angry tone, to keep back. Napoleon interfered, saying,\n'Respect the burden, Madam.'\" In the time of the empire, he directed\nattention to the improvement and embellishment of the market of the\ncapital. \"The market-place,\" he said, \"is the Louvre of the common\npeople.\" The principal works that have survived him are his magnificent\nroads. He filled the troops with his spirit, and a sort of freedom and\ncompanionship grew up between him and them, which the forms of his\ncourt never permitted between the officers and himself. They performed,\nunder his eye, that which no others could do. The best document of his\nrelation to his troops is the order of the day on the morning of the\nbattle of Austerlitz, in which Napoleon promises the troops that he\nwill keep his person out of reach of fire. This declaration, which is\nthe reverse of that ordinarily made by generals and sovereigns on the\neve of a battle, sufficiently explains the devotion of the army to\ntheir leader.\nBut though there is in particulars this identity between Napoleon and\nthe mass of the people, his real strength lay in their conviction that\nhe was their representative in his genius and aims, not only when he\ncourted, but when he controlled, and even when he decimated them by\nhis conscriptions. He knew, as well as any Jacobin in France, how to\nphilosophize on liberty and equality; and, when allusion was made to\nthe precious blood of centuries, which was spilled by the killing of\nthe Duc d'Enghien, he suggested, \"Neither is my blood ditch-water\" The\npeople felt that no longer the throne was occupied, and the land sucked\nof its nourishment, by a small class of legitimates, secluded from all\ncommunity with the children of the soil, and holding the ideas and\nsuperstitions of a long-forgotten state of society. Instead of that\nvampire, a man of themselves held, in the Tuilleries, knowledge and\nideas like their own, opening, of course, to them and their children,\nall places of power and trust. The day of sleepy, selfish policy, ever\nnarrowing the means and opportunities of young men, was ended, and a\nday of expansion and demand was come. A market for all the powers and\nproductions of man was opened: brilliant prizes glittered in the eyes\nof youth and talent. The old, iron-bound, feudal France was changed\ninto a young Ohio or New York; and those who smarted under the immediate\nrigors of the new monarch, pardoned them as the necessary severities\nof the military system which had driven out the oppressor. And even\nwhen the majority of the people had begun to ask, whether they had\nreally gained anything under the exhausting levies of men and money\nof the new master,--the whole talent of the country, in every rank and\nkindred, took his part, and defended him as its natural patron. In\n1814, when advised to rely on the higher classes, Napoleon said to\nthose around him, \"Gentlemen, in the situation in which I stand, my\nonly nobility is the rabble of the Faubourgs.\"\nNapoleon met this natural expectation. The necessity of his position\nrequired a hospitality to every sort of talent, and its appointment\nto trusts; and his feelings went along with this policy. Like every\nsuperior person, he undoubtedly felt a desire for men and compeers,\nand a wish to measure his power with other masters, and an impatience\nof fools and underlings. In Italy, he sought for men, and found none.\n\"Good God!\" he said, \"how rare men are! There are eighteen millions\nin Italy, and I have with difficulty found two,--Dandolo and Melzi.\"\nIn later years, with larger experience, his respect for mankind was\nnot increased. In a moment of bitterness, he said to one of his oldest\nfriends, \"Men deserve the contempt with which they inspire me. I have\nonly to put some gold lace on the coat of my virtuous republicans, and\nthey immediately become just what I wish them.\" This impatience at\nlevity was, however, an oblique tribute of respect to those able persons\nwho commanded his regard, not only when he found them friends and\ncoadjutors, but also when they resisted his will. He could not confound\nFox and Pitt, Carnot, Lafayette, and Bernadotte, with the danglers of\nhis court; and, in spite of the detraction which his systematic egotism\ndictated toward the great captains who conquered with and for him,\nample acknowledgements are made by him to Lannes Duroc, Kleber, Dessaix,\nMassena, Murat, Ney, and Augereau. If he felt himself their patron,\nand founder of their fortunes, as when he said, \"I made my generals\nout of mud,\" he could not hide his satisfaction in receiving from them\na seconding and support commensurate with the grandeur of his\nenterprise. In the Russian campaign, he was so much impressed by the\ncourage and resources of Marshal Ney, that he said, \"I have two hundred\nmillions in my coffers, and I would give them all for Ney.\" The\ncharacters which he has drawn of several of his marshals are\ndiscriminating, and, though they did not content the insatiable vanity\nof French officers, are, no doubt, substantially just. And, in fact,\nevery species of merit was sought and advanced under his government.\n\"I know,\" he said, \"the depth and draught of water of every one of my\ngenerals.\" Natural power was sure to be well received at his court.\nSeventeen men, in his time, were raised from common soldiers to the\nrank of king, marshal, duke, or general; and the crosses of his Legion\nof Honor were given to personal valor, and not to family connection.\n\"When soldiers have been baptized in the fire of a battle-field, they\nhave all one rank in my eyes.\"\nWhen a natural king becomes a titular king, everybody is pleased and\nsatisfied. The Revolution entitled the strong populace of the Faubourg\nSt. Antoine, and every horse-boy and powder-monkey in the army, to\nlook on Napoleon as flesh of his flesh, and the creature of his party:\nbut there is something in the success of grand talent which enlists\nan universal sympathy. For, in the prevalence of sense and spirit over\nstupidity and malversation, all reasonable men have an interest; and,\nas intellectual beings, we feel the air purified by the electric shock,\nwhen material force is overthrown by intellectual energies. As soon\nas we are removed out of the reach of local and accidental partialities,\nman feels that Napoleon fights for him; these are honest victories;\nthis strong steam-engine does our work. Whatever appeals to the\nimagination, by transcending the ordinary limits of human ability,\nwonderfully encourages and liberates us. This capacious head, revolving\nand disposing sovereignly trains of affairs, and animating such\nmultitudes of agents; this eye, which looked through Europe; this\nprompt invention; this inexhaustible resource;--what events! what\nromantic pictures! what strange situations!--when spying the Alps, by\na sunset in the Sicilian sea; drawing up his army for battle, in sight\nof the Pyramids, and saying to his troops, \"From the tops of those\npyramids, forty centuries look down on you;\" fording the Red Sea;\nwading in the gulf of the Isthmus of Suez. On the shore of Ptolemais,\ngigantic projects agitated him. \"Had Acre fallen, I should have changed\nthe face of the world.\" His army, on the night of the battle of\nAusterlitz, which was the anniversary of his inauguration as Emperor,\npresented him with a bouquet of forty standards taken in the fight.\nPerhaps it is a little puerile, the pleasure he took in making these\ncontrasts glaring; as when he pleased himself with making kings wait\nin his antechambers, at Tilsit, at Paris, and at Erfurt.\nWe cannot, in the universal imbecility, indecision, and indolence of\nmen, sufficiently congratulate ourselves on this strong and ready\nactor, who took occasion by the beard, and showed us how much may be\naccomplished by the mere force of such virtues as all men possess in\nless degrees; namely, by punctuality, by personal attention, by courage,\nand thoroughness. \"The Austrians,\" he said, \"do not know the value of\ntime.\" I should cite him, in his earlier years, as a model of prudence.\nHis power does not consist in any wild or extravagant force; in any\nenthusiasm, like Mahomet's; or singular power of persuasion; but in\nthe exercise of common sense on each emergency, instead of abiding by\nrules and customs. The lesson he teaches is that which vigor always\nteaches,--that there is always room for it. To what heaps of cowardly\ndoubts is not that man's life an answer. When he appeared, it was the\nbelief of all military men that there could be nothing new in war; as\nit is the belief of men to-day, that nothing new can be undertaken in\npolitics, or in church, or in letters, or in trade, or in farming, or\nin our social manners and customs; and as it is, at all times, the\nbelief of society that the world is used up. But Bonaparte knew better\nthan society; and, moreover, knew that he knew better. I think all men\nknow better than they do; know that the institutions we so volubly\ncommend are go-carts and baubles; but they dare not trust their\npresentiments. Bonaparte relied on his own sense, and did not care a\nbean for other people's. The world treated his novelties just as it\ntreats everybody's novelties,--made infinite objection: mustered all\nthe impediments; but he snapped his finger at their objections. \"What\ncreates great difficulty,\" he remarks, \"in the profession of the land\ncommander, is the necessity of feeding so many men and animals. If he\nallows himself to be guided by the commissaries, he will never stir,\nand all his expeditions will fail.\" An example of his common sense is\nwhat he says of the passage of the Alps in winter, which all writers,\none repeating after the other, had described as impracticable. \"The\nwinter,\" says Napoleon, \"is not the most unfavorable season for the\npassage of lofty mountains. The snow is then firm, the weather settled,\nand there is nothing to fear from avalanches, the real and only danger\nto be apprehended in the Alps. On those high mountains, there are often\nvery fine days in December, of a dry cold, with extreme calmness in\nthe air.\" Read his account, too, of the way in which battles are gained.\n\"In all battles, a moment occurs, when the bravest troops, after having\nmade the greatest efforts, feel inclined to run. That terror proceeds\nfrom a want of confidence in their own courage; and it only requires\na slight opportunity, a pretense, to restore confidence to them. The\nart is to give rise to the opportunity, and to invent the pretense.\nAt Arcola, I won the battle with twenty-five horsemen. I seized that\nmoment of lassitude, gave every man a trumpet, and gained the day with\nthis handful. You see that two armies are two bodies which meet, and\nendeavor to frighten each other: a moment of panic occurs, and that\nmoment must be turned to advantage. When a man has been present in\nmany actions, he distinguishes that moment without difficulty; it is\nas easy as casting up an addition.\"\nThis deputy of the nineteenth century added to his gifts a capacity\nfor speculation on general topics. He delighted in running through the\nrange of practical, of literary, and of abstract questions. His opinion\nis always original, and to the purpose. On the voyage to Egypt, he\nliked, after dinner, to fix on three or four persons to support a\nproposition, and as many to oppose it. He gave a subject, and the\ndiscussions turned on questions of religion, the different kinds of\ngovernment, and the art of war. One day, he asked, whether the planets\nwere inhabited? On another, what was the age of the world? Then he\nproposed to consider the probability of the destruction of the globe,\neither by water or by fire; at another time, the truth or fallacy of\npresentiments, and the interpretation of dreams. He was very fond of\ntalking of religion. In 1806, he conversed with Fournier, bishop of\nMontpelier, on matters of theology. There were two points on which\nthey could not agree, viz., that of hell, and that of salvation out\nof the pale of the church. The Emperor told Josephine, that he disputed\nlike a devil on these two points, on which the bishop was inexorable.\nTo the philosophers he readily yielded all that was proved against\nreligion as the work of men and time; but he would not hear of\nmaterialism. One fine night, on deck, amid a clatter of materialism,\nBonaparte pointed to the stars, and said, \"You may talk as long as you\nplease, gentlemen, but who made all that?\" He delighted in the\nconversation of men of science, particularly of Monge and Berthollet;\nbut the men of letters he slighted; \"they were manufacturers of\nphrases.\" Of medicine, too, he was fond of talking, and with those of\nits practitioners whom he most esteemed,-with Corvisart at Paris, and\nwith Antonomarchi at St. Helena. \"Believe me, \"he said to the last,\n\"we had better leave off all these remedies: life is a fortress which\nneither you nor I know anything about. Why throw obstacles in the way\nof its defense? Its own means are superior to all the apparatus of\nyour laboratories. Corvisart candidly agreed with me, that all your\nfilthy mixtures are good for nothing. Medicine is a collection of\nuncertain prescriptions, the results of which, taken collectively, are\nmore fatal than useful to mankind. Water, air, and cleanliness, are\nthe chief articles in my pharmacopeia.\"\nHis memoirs, dictated to Count Montholon and General Gourgaud, at St.\nHelena, have great value, after all the deduction that, it seems, is\nto be made from them, on account of his known disingenuousness. He has\nthe goodnature of strength and conscious superiority. I admire his\nsimple, clear narrative of his battles;--good as Caesar's; his\ngood-natured and sufficiently respectful account of Marshal Wurmser\nand his other antagonists, and his own equality as a writer to his\nvarying subject. The most agreeable portion is the Campaign in Egypt.\nHe had hours of thought and wisdom. In intervals of leisure, either\nin the camp or the palace, Napoleon appears as a man of genius,\ndirecting on abstract questions the native appetite for truth, and the\nimpatience of words, he was wont to show in war. He could enjoy every\nplay of invention, a romance, a _bon mot_, as well as a stratagem\nin a campaign. He delighted to fascinate Josephine and her ladies, in\na dim-lighted apartment, by the terrors of a fiction, to which his\nvoice and dramatic power lent every addition.\nI call Napoleon the agent or attorney of the middle class of modern\nsociety; of the throng who fill the markets, shops, counting-houses,\nmanufactories, ships, of the modern world, aiming to be rich. He was\nthe agitator, the destroyer of prescription, the internal improver,\nthe liberal, the radical, the inventor of means, the opener of doors\nand markets, the subverter of monopoly and abuse. Of course, the rich\nand aristocratic did not like him. England, the center of capital, and\nRome and Austria, centers of tradition and genealogy, opposed him. The\nconsternation of the dull and conservative classes, the terror of the\nfoolish old men and old women of the Roman conclave,--who in their\ndespair took hold of anything, and would cling to red-hot iron,--the\nvain attempts of statists to amuse and deceive him, of the emperor of\nAustria to bribe him; and the instinct of the young, ardent, and active\nmen, everywhere, which pointed him out as the giant of the middle\nclass, make his history bright and commanding. He had the virtues of\nthe masses of his constituents; he had also their vices. I am sorry\nthat the brilliant picture has its reverse. But that is the fatal\nquality which we discover in our pursuit of wealth, that it is\ntreacherous, and is bought by the breaking or weakening of the\nsentiments; and it is inevitable that we should find the same fact in\nthe history of this champion, who proposed to himself simply a brilliant\ncareer, without any stipulation or scruple concerning the means.\nBonaparte was singularly destitute of generous sentiments. The\nhighest-placed individual in the most cultivated age and population\nof the world,--he has not the merit of common truth and honesty. He\nis unjust to his generals; egotistic, and monopolizing; meanly stealing\nthe credit of their great actions from Kellermann, from Bernadotte;\nintriguing to involve his faithful Junot in hopeless bankruptcy, in\norder to drive him to a distance from Paris, because the familiarity\nof his manners offends the new pride of his throne. He is a boundless\nliar. The official paper, his \"Moniteurs,\" and all his bulletins, are\nproverbs for saying what he wished to be believed; and worse,--he sat,\nin his premature old age, in his lonely island, coldly falsifying\nfacts, and dates, and characters, and giving to history, a theatrical\neclat. Like all Frenchmen, he has a passion for stage effect. Every\naction that breathes of generosity is poisoned by this calculation.\nHis star, his love of glory, his doctrine of the immortality of the\nsoul, are all French. \"I must dazzle and astonish. If I were to give\nthe liberty of the press, my power could not last three days.\" To make\na great noise is his favorite design. \"A great reputation is a great\nnoise; the more there is made, the farther off it is heard. Laws,\ninstitutions, monuments, nations, all fall; but the noise continues,\nand resounds in after ages.\" His doctrine of immortality is simply\nfame. His theory of influence is not flattering. \"There are two levers\nfor moving men,--interest and fear. Love is a silly infatuation, depend\nupon it. Friendship is but a name. I love nobody. I do not even love\nmy brothers; perhaps Joseph, a little, from habit, and because he is\nmy elder; and Duroc, I love him too; but why?--because his character\npleases me; he is stern and resolute, and, I believe, the fellow never\nshed a tear. For my part, I know very well that I have no true friends.\nAs long as I continue to be what I am, I may have as many pretended\nfriends as I please. Leave sensibility to women; but men should be\nfirm in heart and purpose, or they should have nothing to do with war\nand government.\" He was thoroughly unscrupulous. He would steal,\nslander, assassinate, drown, and poison, as his interest dictated. He\nhad no generosity; but mere vulgar hatred; he was intensely selfish;\nhe was perfidious; he cheated at cards; he was a prodigious gossip;\nand opened letters; and delighted in his infamous police; and rubbed\nhis hands with joy when he had intercepted some morsel of intelligence\nconcerning the men and women about him, boasting that \"he knew\neverything;\" and interfered with the cutting the dresses of the women;\nand listened after the hurrahs and the compliments of the street,\nincognito. His manners were coarse. He treated women with low\nfamiliarity. He had the habit of pulling their ears and pinching their\ncheeks, when he was in good humor, and of pulling the ears and whiskers\nof men, and of striking and horse-play with them, to his last days.\nIt does not appear that he listened at keyholes, or, at least, that\nhe \"was caught at it\". In short, when you have penetrated through all\nthe circles of power and splendor, you were not dealing with a\ngentleman, at last; but with an impostor and a rogue; and he fully\ndeserves the epithet of Jupiter Scapin, or a sort of Scamp Jupiter.\nIn describing the two parties into which modern society divides\nitself,--the democrat and the conservative,--I said, Bonaparte\nrepresents the democrat, or the party of men of business, against the\nstationary or conservative party. I omitted then to say, what is\nmaterial to the statement, namely, that these two parties differ only\nas young and old. The democrat is a young conservative; the conservative\nis an old democrat. The aristocrat is the democrat ripe, and gone to\nseed,--because both parties stand on the one ground of the supreme\nvalue of property, which one endeavors to get, and the other to keep.\nBonaparte may be said to represent the whole history of this party,\nits youth and its age; yes, and with poetic justice, its fate, in his\nown. The counter-revolution, the counter-party, still waits for its\norgan and representative, in a lover and a man of truly public and\nuniversal aims.\nHere was an experiment, under the most favorable conditions, of the\npowers of intellect without conscience. Never was such a leader so\nendowed, and so weaponed; never leader found such aids and followers.\nAnd what was the result of this vast talent and power, of these immense\narmies, burned cities, squandered treasures, immolated millions of\nmen, of this demoralized Europe? It came to no result. All passed away,\nlike the smoke of his artillery and left no trace. He left France\nsmaller, poorer, feebler, than he found it; and the whole contest for\nfreedom was to be begun again. The attempt was, in principle, suicidal.\nFrance served him with life, and limb, and estate, as long as it could\nidentify its interest with him; but when men saw that after victory\nwas another war; after the destruction of armies, new conscriptions;\nand they who had toiled so desperately were never nearer to the\nreward,--they could not spend what they had earned, nor repose on their\ndown-beds, nor strut in their chateaux,--they deserted him. Men found\nthat his absorbing egotism was deadly to all other men. It resembled\nthe torpedo, which inflicts a succession of shocks on any one who takes\nhold of it, producing spasms which contract the muscles of the hand,\nso that the man cannot open his fingers; and the animal inflicts new\nand more violent shocks, until he paralyzes and kills his victim. So,\nthis exorbitant egotist narrowed, impoverished, and absorbed the power\nand existence of those who served him; and the universal cry of France,\nand of Europe, in 1814, was, \"enough of him;\" \"assez de Bonaparte.\"\nIt was not Bonaparte's fault. He did all that in him lay, to live and\nthrive without moral principle. It was the nature of things, the eternal\nlaw of man and of the world, which baulked and ruined him; and the\nresult, in a million experiments, will be the same. Every experiment,\nby multitudes or by individuals, that has a sensual and selfish aim,\nwill fail. The pacific Fourier will be as inefficient as the pernicious\nNapoleon. As long as our civilization is essentially one of property,\nof fences, of exclusiveness, it will be mocked by delusions. Our riches\nwill leave us sick; there will be bitterness in our laughter; and our\nwine will burn our mouth. Only that good profits, which we can taste\nwith all doors open, and which serves all men.\nVII. GOETHE; OR, THE WRITER\nI find a provision in the constitution of the world for the writer or\nsecretary, who is to report the doings of the miraculous spirit of\nlife that everywhere throbs and works. His office is a reception of\nthe facts into the mind, and then a selection of the eminent and\ncharacteristic experiences.\nNature will be reported. All things are engaged in writing their\nhistory. The planet, the pebble, goes attended by its shadow. The\nrolling rock leaves its scratches on the mountain; the river, its\nchannel in the soil; the animal, its bones in the stratum; the fern\nand leaf their modest epitaph in the coal. The falling drop makes its\nsculpture in the sand or the stone. Not a foot steps into the snow,\nor along the ground, but prints in characters more or less lasting,\na map of its march. Every act of the man inscribes itself in the\nmemories of his fellows, and in his own manners and face. The air is\nfull of sounds; the sky, of tokens; the ground is all memoranda and\nsignatures; and every object covered over with hints, which speak to\nthe intelligent.\nIn nature, this self-registration is incessant, and the narrative is\nthe print of the seal. It neither exceeds nor comes short of the fact.\nBut nature strives upward; and, in man, the report is something more\nthan print of the seal. It is a new and finer form of the original.\nThe record is alive, as that which it recorded is alive. In man, the\nmemory is a kind of looking-glass, which, having received the images\nof surrounding objects, is touched with life, and disposes them in a\nnew order. The facts which transpired do not lie in it inert; but some\nsubside, and others shine; so that soon we have a new picture, composed\nof the eminent experiences. The man cooperates. He loves to communicate;\nand that which is for him to say lies as a load on his heart until it\nis delivered. But, besides the universal joy of conversation, some men\nare born with exalted powers for this second creation. Men are born\nto write. The gardener saves every slip, and seed, and peach-stone;\nhis vocation is to be a planter of plants. Not less does the writer\nattend his affairs. Whatever he beholds or experiences, comes to him\nas a model, and sits for its picture. He counts it all nonsense that\nthey say, that some things are undescribable. He believes that all\nthat can be thought can be written, first or last; and he would report\nthe Holy Ghost, or attempt it. Nothing so broad, so subtle, or so dear,\nbut comes therefore commended to his pen,--and he will write. In his\neyes, a man is the faculty of reporting, and the universe is the\npossibility of being reported. In conversation, in calamity, he finds\nnew materials; as our German poet said, \"some god gave me the power\nto paint what I suffer.\" He draws his rents from rage and pain. By\nacting rashly, he buys the power of talking wisely. Vexations, and a\ntempest of passion, only fill his sails; as the good Luther writes,\n\"When I am angry I can pray well, and preach well;\" and if we knew the\ngenesis of fine-strokes of eloquence, they might recall the complaisance\nof Sultan Amurath, who struck off some Persian heads, that his\nphysician, Vesalius, might see the spasms in the muscles of the neck.\nHis failures are the preparation of his victories. A new thought, or\na crisis of passion, apprises him that all that he has yet learned and\nwritten is exoteric--is not the fact, but some rumor of the fact. What\nthen? Does he throw away the pen? No; he begins again to describe in\nthe new light which has shined on him,--if, by some means, he may yet\nsave some true word. Nature conspires. Whatever can be thought can be\nspoken, and still rises for utterance, though to rude and stammering\norgans. If they cannot compass it, it waits and works, until, at last,\nit moulds them to its perfect will, and is articulated.\nThis striving after imitative expression, which one meets everywhere,\nis significant of the aim of nature, but is mere stenography. There\nare higher degrees, and nature has more splendid endowments for those\nwhom she elects to a superior office; for the class of scholars or\nwriters, who see connection where the multitude see fragments, and who\nare impelled to exhibit the facts in order, and so to supply the axis\non which the frame of things turns. Nature has dearly at heart the\nformation of the speculative man, or scholar. It is an end never lost\nsight of, and is prepared in the original casting of things. He is no\npermissive or accidental appearance, but an organic agent, one of the\nestates of the realm, provided and prepared from of old and from\neverlasting, in the knitting and contexture of things. Presentiments,\nimpulses, cheer him. There is a certain heat in the breast, which\nattends the perception of a primary truth, which is the shining of the\nspiritual sun down into the shaft of the mine. Every thought which\ndawns on the mind, in the moment of its emergency announces its own\nrank,--whether it is some whimsy, or whether it is a power.\nIf he have his incitements, there is, on the other side, invitation\nand need enough of his gift. Society has, at all times, the same want,\nnamely, of one sane man with adequate powers of expression to held up\neach object of monomania in its right relation. The ambitious and\nmercenary bring their last new mumbo-jumbo, whether tariff, Texas,\nrailroad, Romanism, mesmerism, or California; and, by detaching the\nobject from its relations, easily succeed in making it seen in a glare;\nand a multitude go mad about it, and they are not to be reproved or\ncured by the opposite multitude, who are kept from this particular\ninsanity by an equal frenzy on another crochet. But let one man have\nthe comprehensive eye that can replace this isolated prodigy in its\nright neighborhood and bearings,--the illusion vanishes, and the\nreturning reason of the community thanks the reason of the monitor.\nThe scholar is the man of the ages, but he must also wish, with other\nmen, to stand well with his contemporaries. But there is a certain\nridicule, among superficial people, thrown on the scholars or clerisy,\nwhich is of no import, unless the scholars heed it. In this country,\nthe emphasis of conversation, and of public opinion, commends the\npractical man; and the solid portion of the community is named with\nsignificant respect in every circle. Our people are of Bonaparte's\nopinion concerning ideologists. Ideas are subversive of social order\nand comfort, and at last make a fool of the possessor. It is believed,\nthe ordering a cargo of goods from New York to Smyrna; or, the running\nup and down to procure a company of subscribers to set a-going five\nor ten thousand spindles; or, the negotiations of a caucus, and the\npractising on the prejudices and facility of country-people, to secure\ntheir votes in November,--is practical and commendable.\nIf I were to compare action of a much higher strain with a life of\ncontemplation, I should not venture to pronounce with much confidence\nin favor of the former. Mankind have such a deep stake in inward\nillumination, that there is much to be said by the hermit or monk in\ndefense of his life of thought and prayer. A certain partiality, a\nheadiness, and loss of balance, is the tax which all action must pay.\nAct, if you like,--but you do it at your peril. Men's actions are too\nstrong for them. Show me a man who has acted, and who has not been the\nvictim and slave of his action. What they have done commits and enforces\nthem to do the same again. The first act, which was to be an experiment,\nbecomes a sacrament. The fiery reformer embodies his aspiration in\nsome rite or covenant, and he and his friends cleave to the form and\nlose the aspiration. The Quaker has established Quakerism, the Shaker\nhas established his monastery and his dance; and, although each prates\nof spirit, there is no spirit, but repetition, which is anti-spiritual.\nBut where are his new things of today? In actions of enthusiasm, this\ndrawback appears: but in those lower activities, which have no higher\naim than to make us more comfortable and more cowardly, in actions of\ncunning, actions that steal and lie, actions that divorce the\nspeculative from the practical faculty, and put a ban on reason and\nsentiment, there is nothing else but drawback and negation. The Hindoos\nwrite in their sacred books, \"Children only, and not the learned, speak\nof the speculative and the practical faculties as two. They are but\none, for both obtain the selfsame end, and the place which is gained\nby the followers of the one is gained by the followers of the other.\nThat man seeth, who seeth that the speculative and the practical\ndoctrines are one.\" For great action must draw on the spiritual nature.\nThe measure of action is the sentiment from which it proceeds. The\ngreatest action may easily be one of the most private circumstances.\nThis disparagement will not come from the leaders, but from inferior\npersons. The robust gentlemen who stand at the head of the practical\nclass, share the ideas of the time, and have too much sympathy with\nthe speculative class. It is not from men excellent in any kind, that\ndisparagement of any other is to be looked for. With such, Talleyrand's\nquestion is ever the main one; not, is he rich? is he committed? is\nhe well-meaning? has he this or that faculty? is he of the movement?\nis he of the establishment?--but, Is he anybody? does he stand for\nsomething? He must be good of his kind. That is all that Talleyrand,\nall that State-street, all that the common sense of mankind asks. Be\nreal and admirable, not as we know, but as you know. Able men do not\ncare in what kind a man is able, so only that he is able. A master\nlikes a master, and does not stipulate whether it be orator, artist,\ncraftsman, or king.\nSociety has really no graver interest than the well-being of the\nliterary class. And it is not to be denied that men are cordial in\ntheir recognition and welcome of intellectual accomplishments. Still\nthe writer does not stand with us on any commanding ground. I think\nthis to be his own fault. A pound passes for a pound. There have been\ntimes when he was a sacred person; he wrote Bibles; the first hymns;\nthe codes; the epics; tragic songs; Sibylline verses; Chaldean oracles;\nLaconian sentences inscribed on temple walls. Every word was true, and\nwoke the nations to new life. He wrote without levity, and without\nchoice. Every word was carved, before his eyes, into the earth and\nsky; and the sun and stars were only letters of the same purport; and\nof no more necessity. But how can he be honored, when he does not honor\nhimself; when he loses himself in the crowd; when he is no longer the\nlawgiver, but the sycophant, ducking to the giddy opinion of a reckless\npublic; when he must sustain with shameless advocacy some bad\ngovernment, or must bark, all the year round, in opposition; or write\nconventional criticism, or profligate novels; or, at any rate, write\nwithout thought, and without recurrence, by day and night, to the\nsources of inspiration?\nSome reply to these questions may be furnished by looking over the\nlist of men of literary genius in our age. Among these, no more\ninstructive name occurs than that of Goethe, to represent the power\nand duties of the scholar or writer.\nI described Bonaparte as a representative of the popular external life\nand aims of the nineteenth century. Its other half, its poet, is Goethe,\na man quite domesticated in the century, breathing its air, enjoying\nits fruits, impossible at any earlier time, and taking away, by his\ncolossal parts, the reproach of weakness, which, but for him, would\nlie on the intellectual works of the period. He appears at a time when\na general culture has spread itself, and has smoothed down all sharp\nindividual traits; when, in the absence of heroic characters, a social\ncomfort and cooperation have come in. There is no poet, but scores of\npoetic writers; no Columbus, but hundreds of post-captains, with\ntransit-telescope, barometer, and concentrated soup and pemmican; no\nDemosthenes, no Chatham, but any number of clever parliamentary and\nforensic debaters; no prophet or saint, but colleges of divinity; no\nlearned man, but learned societies, a cheap press, reading-rooms, and\nbook-clubs, without number. There was never such a miscellany of facts.\nThe world extends itself like American trade. We conceive Greek or\nRoman life,--life in the middle ages--to be a simple and comprehensive\naffair; but modern life to respect a multitude of things, which is\ndistracting.\nGoethe was the philosopher of this multiplicity; hundred-handed,\nArgus-eyed, able and happy to cope with this rolling miscellany of\nfacts and sciences, and, by his own versatility, to dispose of them\nwith ease; a manly mind, unembarrassed by the variety of coats of\nconvention with which life had got encrusted, easily able by his\nsubtlety to pierce these, and to draw his strength from nature, with\nwhich he lived in full communion. What is strange, too, he lived in\na small town, in a petty state, in a defeated state, and in a time\nwhen Germany played no such leading part in the world's affairs as to\nswell the bosom of her sons with any metropolitan pride, such as might\nhave cheered a French, or English, or, once, a Roman or Attic genius.\nYet there is no trace of provincial limitation in his muse. He is not\na debtor to his position, but was born with a free and controlling\ngenius.\nThe Helena, or the second part of Faust, is a philosophy of literature\nset in poetry; the work of one who found himself the master of\nhistories, mythologies, philosophies, sciences, and national\nliteratures, in the encyclopaedical manner in which modern erudition,\nwith its international intercourse of the whole earth's population,\nresearches into Indian, Etruscan, and all Cyclopaean arts, geology,\nchemistry, astronomy; and every one of these kingdoms assuming a certain\naerial and poetic character, by reason of the multitude. One looks at\na king with reverence; but if one should chance to be at a congress\nof kings, the eye would take liberties with the peculiarities of each.\nThese are not wild miraculous songs, but elaborate forms, to which the\npoet has confided the results of eighty years of observation. This\nreflective and critical wisdom makes the poem more truly the flower\nof this time. It dates itself. Still he is a poet,--poet of a prouder\nlaurel than any contemporary, and under this plague of microscopes\n(for he seems to see out of every pore of his skin), strikes the harp\nwith a hero's strength and grace.\nThe wonder of the book is its superior intelligence. In the menstruum\nof this man's wit, the past and the present ages, and their religions,\npolitics, and modes of thinking, are dissolved into archetypes and\nideas. What new mythologies sail through his head! The Greeks said,\nthat Alexander went as far as Chaos; Goethe went, only the other day,\nas far; and one step farther he hazarded, and brought himself safe\nback. There is a heart-cheering freedom in his speculation. The immense\nhorizon which journeys with us lends its majesties to trifles, and to\nmatters of convenience and necessity, as to solemn and festal\nperformances. He was the soul of his century. If that was learned, and\nhad become, by population, compact organization, and drill of parts,\none great Exploring Expedition, accumulating a glut of facts and fruits\ntoo fast for any hitherto-existing savants to classify, this man's\nmind had ample chambers for the distribution of all. He had a power\nto unite the detached atoms again by their own law. He has clothed our\nmodern existence with poetry. Amid littleness and detail, he detected\nthe Genius of life, the old cunning Proteus, nestling close beside us,\nand showed that the dullness and prose we ascribe to the age was only\nanother of his masks:--\"His very flight is presence in disguise:\" that\nhe had put off a gay uniform for a fatigue dress, and was not a whit\nless vivacious or rich in Liverpool or the Hague, than once in Rome\nor Antioch. He sought him in public squares and main streets, in\nboulevards and hotels; and, in the solidest kingdom of routine and the\nsenses, he showed the lurking daemonic power; that, in actions of\nroutine, a thread of mythology and fable spins itself; and this, by\ntracing the pedigree of every usage and practice, every institution,\nutensil, and means, home to its origin in the structure of man. He had\nan extreme impatience of conjecture, and of rhetoric. \"I have guesses\nenough of my own; if a man write a book, let him set down only what\nhe knows.\" He writes in the plainest and lowest tone, omitting a great\ndeal more than he writes, and putting ever a thing for a word. He has\nexplained the distinction between the antique and the modern spirit\nand art. He has defined art, its scope and laws. He has said the best\nthings about nature that ever were said. He treats nature as the old\nphilosophers, as the seven wise masters did,--and, with whatever loss\nof French tabulation and dissection, poetry and humanity remain to us;\nand they have some doctorial skill. Eyes are better, on the whole,\nthan telescopes or microscopes. He has contributed a key to many parts\nof nature, through the rare turn for unity and simplicity in his mind.\nThus Goethe suggested the leading idea of modern botany, that a leaf,\nor the eye of a leaf, is the unit of botany, and that every part of\nthe plant is only a transformed leaf to meet a new condition; and, by\nvarying the conditions, a leaf may be converted into any other organ,\nand any other organ into a leaf. In like manner, in osteology, he\nassumed that one vertebra of the spine might be considered the unit\nof the skeleton; the head was only the uppermost vertebra transformed.\n\"The plant goes from knot to knot, closing, at last, with the flower\nand the seed. So the tape-worm, the caterpillar, goes from knot to\nknot, and closes with the head. Men and the higher animals are built\nup through the vertebrae, the powers being concentrated in the head.\"\nIn optics, again, he rejected the artificial theory of seven colors,\nand considered that every color was the mixture of light and darkness\nin new proportions. It is really of very little consequence what topic\nhe writes upon. He sees at every pore, and has a certain gravitation\ntoward truth. He will realize what you say. He hates to be trifled\nwith, and to be made to say over again some old wife's fable, that has\nhad possession of men's faith these thousand years. He may as well see\nif it is true as another. He sifts it. I am here, he would say, to be\nthe measure and judge of these things. Why should I take them on trust?\nAnd, therefore, what he says of religion, of passion, of marriage, of\nmanners, property, of paper money, of periods or beliefs, of omens,\nof luck, or whatever else, refuses to be forgotten.\nTake the most remarkable example that could occur of this tendency to\nverify every term in popular use. The Devil had played an important\npart in mythology in all times. Goethe would have no word that does\nnot cover a thing. The same measure will still serve: \"I have never\nheard of any crime which I might not have committed.\" So he flies at\nthe throat of this imp. He shall be real; he shall be modern; he shall\nbe European; he shall dress like a gentleman, and accept the manner,\nand walk in the streets, and be well initiated in the life of Vienna,\nand of Heidelberg, in 1820,--or he shall not exist. Accordingly, he\nstripped him of mythologic gear, of horns, cloven foot, harpoon tail,\nbrimstone, and blue-fire, and, instead of looking in books and pictures,\nlooked for him in his own mind, in every shade of coldness, selfishness,\nand unbelief that, in crowds, or in solitude, darkens over the human\nthought,--and found that the portrait gained reality and terror by\neverything he added, and by everything he took away. He found that the\nessence of this hobgoblin, which had hovered in shadow about the\nhabitations of men, ever since they were men, was pure intellect,\napplied,--as always there is a tendency,--to the service of the senses:\nand he flung into literature, in his Mephistopheles, the first organic\nfigure that has been added for some ages, and which will remain as\nlong as the Prometheus. I have no design to enter into any analysis\nof his numerous works. They consist of translations, criticisms, dramas,\nlyric and every other description of poems, literary journals, and\nportraits of distinguished men. Yet I cannot omit to specify the Wilhelm\nMeister.\nWilhelm Meister is a novel in every sense, the first of its kind,\ncalled by its admirers the only delineation of modern society,--as if\nother novels, those of Scott, for example, dealt with costume and\ncondition, this with the spirit of life. It is a book over which some\nveil is still drawn. It is read by very intelligent persons with wonder\nand delight. It is preferred by some such to Hamlet, as a work of\ngenius. I suppose no book of this century can compare with it in its\ndelicious sweetness, so new, so provoking to the mind, gratifying it\nwith so many and so solid thoughts, just insights into life, and\nmanners, and characters; so many good hints for the conduct of life,\nso many unexpected glimpses into a higher sphere, and never a trace\nof rhetoric or dullness. A very provoking book to the curiosity of\nyoung men of genius, but a very unsatisfactory one. Lovers of light\nreading, those who look in it for the entertainment they find in a\nromance, are disappointed. On the other hand, those who begin it with\nthe higher hope to read in it a worthy history of genius, and the just\naward of the laurels to its toils and denials, have also reason to\ncomplain. We had an English romance here, not long ago, professing to\nembody the hope of a new age, and to unfold the political hope of the\nparty called \"Young England,\" in which the only reward of virtue is\na seat in parliament, and a peerage. Goethe's romance has a conclusion\nas lame and immoral. George Sand, in Consuelo and its continuation,\nhas sketched a truer and more dignified picture. In the progress of\nthe story, the characters of the hero and heroine expand at a rate\nthat shivers the porcelain chess-table of aristocratic convention:\nthey quit the society and habits of their rank; they lose their wealth;\nthey become the servants of great ideas, and of the most generous\nsocial ends; until, at last, the hero, who is the center and fountain\nof an association for the rendering of the noblest benefits to the\nhuman race, no longer answers to his own titled name: it sounds foreign\nand remote in his ear.\n\"I am only man,\" he says; \"I breathe and work for man,\" and this in\npoverty and extreme sacrifices. Goethe's hero, on the contrary, has\nso many weaknesses and impurities, and keeps such bad company, that\nthe sober English public, when the book was translated, were disgusted.\nAnd yet it is so crammed with wisdom, with knowledge of the world, and\nwith knowledge of laws; the persons so truly and subtly drawn, and\nwith such few strokes, and not a word too much, the book remains ever\nso new and unexhausted, that we must even let it go its way, and be\nwilling to get what good from it we can, assured that it has only begun\nits office, and has millions of readers yet to serve.\nThe argument is the passage of a democrat to the aristocracy, using\nboth words in their best sense. And this passage is not made in any\nmean or creeping way, but through the hall door. Nature and character\nassist, and the rank is made real by sense and probity in the nobles.\nNo generous youth can escape this charm of reality in the book, so\nthat it is highly stimulating to intellect and courage. The ardent and\nholy Novalis characterized the book as \"thoroughly modern and prosaic;\nthe romantic is completely leveled in it; so is the poetry of nature;\nthe wonderful. The book treats only of the ordinary affairs of men:\nit is a poeticized civic and domestic story. The wonderful in it is\nexpressly treated as fiction and enthusiastic dreaming:\"--and yet,\nwhat is also characteristic, Novalis soon returned to this book, and\nit remained his favorite reading to the end of his life.\nWhat distinguishes Goethe for French and English readers, is a property\nwhich he shares with his nation,--a habitual reference to interior\ntruth. In England and in America there is a respect for talent; and,\nif it is exerted in support of any ascertained or intelligible interest\nor party, or in regular opposition to any, the public is satisfied.\nIn France, there is even a greater delight in intellectual brilliancy,\nfor its own sake. And, in all these countries, men of talent write\nfrom talent. It is enough if the understanding is occupied, the taste\npropitiated,--so many columns so many hours, filled in a lively and\ncreditable way. The German intellect wants the French sprightliness,\nthe fine practical understanding of the English, and the American\nadventure; but it has a certain probity, which never rests in a\nsuperficial performance, but asks steadily, To what end? A German\npublic asks for a controlling sincerity. Here is activity of thought;\nbut what is it for? What does the man mean? Whence, whence, all these\nthoughts?\nTalent alone cannot make a writer. There must be a man behind the book;\na personality which, by birth and quality, is pledged to the doctrines\nthere set forth, and which exists to see and state things so, and not\notherwise; holding things because they are things. If he cannot rightly\nexpress himself to-day, the same things subsist, and will open\nthemselves to-morrow. There lies the burden on his mind--the burden\nof truth to be declared,--more or less understood; and it constitutes\nhis business and calling in the world, to see those facts through, and\nto make them known. What signifies that he trips and stammers; that\nhis voice is harsh or hissing; that this method or his tropes are\ninadequate? That message will find method and imagery, articulation\nand melody. Though he were dumb, it would speak. If not,--if there be\nno such God's word in the man,--what care we how adroit, how fluent,\nhow brilliant he is?\nIt makes a great difference to the force of any sentence, whether there\nbe a man behind it, or no. In the learned journal, in the influential\nnewspaper, I discern no form; only some irresponsible shadow; oftener\nsome monied corporation, or some dangler, who hopes, in the mask and\nrobes of his paragraph, to pass for somebody. But, through every clause\nand part of speech of a right book, I meet the eyes of the most\ndetermined of men: his force and terror inundate every word: the commas\nand dashes are alive; so that the writing is athletic and nimble,--can\ngo far and live long.\nIn England and America, one may be an adept in the writing of a Greek\nor Latin poet, without any poetic taste or fire. That a man has spent\nyears on Plato and Proclus, does not afford a presumption that he holds\nheroic opinions, or undervalues the fashions of his town. But the\nGerman nation have the most ridiculous good faith on these subjects:\nthe student, out of the lecture-room, still broods on the lessons; and\nthe professor cannot divest himself of the fancy, that the truths of\nphilosophy have some application to Berlin and Munich. This earnestness\nenables them to out-see men of much more talent. Hence, almost all the\nvaluable distinctions which are current in higher conversation, have\nbeen derived to us from Germany. But, whilst men distinguished for wit\nand learning, in England and France, adopt their study and their side\nwith a certain levity, and are not understood to be very deeply engaged,\nfrom grounds of character, to the topic or the part they\nespouse,--Goethe, the head and body of the German nation, does not\nspeak from talent, but the truth shines through: he is very wise,\nthough his talent often veils his wisdom. However excellent his sentence\nis, he has somewhat better in view. It awakens my curiosity. He has\nthe formidable independence which converse with truth gives: hear you,\nor forbear, his fact abides; and your interest in the writer is not\nconfined to his story, and he dismissed from memory, when he has\nperformed his task creditably, as a baker when he has left his loaf;\nbut his work is the least part of him. The old Eternal Genius who built\nthe world has confided himself more to this man than to any other. I\ndare not say that Goethe ascended to the highest grounds from which\ngenius has spoken. He has not worshipped the highest unity; he is\nincapable of a self-surrender to the moral sentiment. There are nobler\nstrains in poetry than any he has sounded. There are writers poorer\nin talent, whose tone is purer, and more touches the heart. Goethe can\nnever be dear to men. His is not even the devotion to pure truth; but\nto truth for the sake of culture. He has no aims less large than the\nconquest of universal nature, of universal truth, to be his portion;\na man not to be bribed, nor deceived, nor overawed; of a stoical self-\ncommand and self-denial, and having one test for all men,--What can\nyou teach me? All possessions are valued by him for that only; rank,\nprivileges, health, time, being itself.\nHe is the type of culture, the amateur of all arts, and sciences, and\nevents; artistic, but not artist; spiritual, but not spiritualist.\nThere is nothing he had not right to know; there is no weapon in the\narmy of universal genius he did not take into his hand, but with\nperemptory heed that he should not be for a moment prejudiced by his\ninstruments. He lays a ray of light under every fact, and between\nhimself and his dearest property. From him nothing was hid, nothing\nwithholden. The lurking daemons sat to him, and the saint who saw the\ndaemons; and the metaphysical elements took form. \"Piety itself is no\naim, but only a means whereby, through purest inward peace, we may\nattain to highest culture.\" And his penetration of every secret of the\nfine arts will make Goethe still more statuesque. His affections help\nhim, like women employed by Cicero to worm out the secret of\nconspirators. Enmities he has none. Enemy of him you may be,--if so\nyou shall teach him aught which your good-will cannot,--were it only\nwhat experience will accrue from your ruin. Enemy and welcome, but\nenemy on high terms. He cannot hate anybody; his time is worth too\nmuch. Temperamental antagonisms may be suffered, but like feuds of\nemperors, who fight dignifiedly across kingdoms.\nHis autobiography, under the title of \"Poetry and Truth Out of My\nLife,\" is the expression of the idea,--now familiar to the world through\nthe German mind, but a novelty to England, Old and New, when that book\nappeared,--that a man exists for culture; not for what he can\naccomplish, but for what can be accomplished in him. The reaction of\nthings on the man is the only noteworthy result. An intellectual man\ncan see himself as a third person; therefore his faults and delusions\ninterest him equally with his successes. Though he wishes to prosper\nin affairs, he wishes more to know the history and destiny of man;\nwhilst the clouds of egotists drifting about him are only interested\nin a low success. This idea reigns in the _Dichtung und Wahrheit_,\nand directs the selection of the incidents; and nowise the external\nimportance of events, the rank of the personages, or the bulk of\nincomes. Of course, the book affords slender materials for what would\nbe reckoned with us a \"Life of Goethe;\"--few dates; no correspondence;\nno details of offices or employments; no light on his marriage; and,\na period of ten years, that should be the most active in his life,\nafter his settlement at Weimar, is sunk in silence. Meantime, certain\nlove-affairs, that came to nothing, as people say, have the strangest\nimportance: he crowds us with detail:--certain whimsical opinions,\ncosmogonies, and religions of his own invention, and, especially his\nrelations to remarkable minds, and to critical epochs of thought:--these\nhe magnifies. His \"Daily and Yearly Journal,\" his \"Italian Travels,\"\nhis \"Campaign in France\" and the historical part of his \"Theory of\nColors,\" have the same interest. In the last, he rapidly notices Kepler,\nRoger Bacon, Galileo, Newton, Voltaire, etc.; and the charm of this\nportion of the book consists in the simplest statement of the relation\nbetwixt these grandees of European scientific history and himself; the\nmere drawing of the lines from Goethe to Kepler, from Goethe to Bacon,\nfrom Goethe to Newton. The drawing of the line is for the time and\nperson, a solution of the formidable problem, and gives pleasure when\nIphigenia and Faust do not, without any cost of invention comparable\nto that of Iphigenia and Faust. This law giver of art is not an artist.\nWas it that he knew too much, that his sight was microscopic, and\ninterfered with the just perspective, the seeing of the whole? He is\nfragmentary; a writer of occasional poems, and of an encyclopaedia of\nsentences. When he sits down to write a drama or a tale, he collects\nand sorts his observations from a hundred sides, and combines them\ninto the body as fitly as he can. A great deal refuses to incorporate:\nthis he adds loosely, as letters, of the parties, leaves from their\njournals, or the like. A great deal still is left that will not find\nany place. This the bookbinder alone can give any cohesion to: and,\nhence, notwithstanding the looseness of many of his works, we have\nvolumes of detached paragraphs, aphorisms, xenien, etc.\nI suppose the worldly tone of his tales grew out of the calculations\nof self-culture. It was the infirmity of an admirable scholar, who\nloved the world out of gratitude; who knew where libraries, galleries,\narchitecture, laboratories, savants, and leisure, were to be had, and\nwho did not quite trust the compensations of poverty and nakedness.\nSocrates loved Athens; Montaigne, Paris; and Madame de Stael said, she\nwas only vulnerable on that side (namely, of Paris). It has its\nfavorable aspect. All the geniuses are usually so ill-assorted and\nsickly, that one is ever wishing them somewhere else. We seldom see\nanybody who is not uneasy or afraid to live. There is a slight blush\nof shame on the cheek of good men and aspiring men, and a spice of\ncaricature. But this man was entirely at home and happy in his century\nand the world. None was so fit to live, or more heartily enjoyed the\ngame. In this aim of culture, which is the genius of his works, is\ntheir power. The idea of absolute, eternal truth, without reference\nto my own enlargement by it, is higher. The surrender to the torrent,\nof poetic inspiration is higher; but compared with any motives on which\nbooks are written in England and America, this is very truth, and has\nthe power to inspire which belongs to truth. Thus has he brought back\nto a book some of its ancient might and dignity.\nGoethe, coming into an over-civilized time and country, when original\ntalent was oppressed under the load of books, and mechanical\nauxiliaries, and the distracting variety of claims, taught men how to\ndispose of this mountainous miscellany, and make it subservient. I\njoin Napoleon with him, as being both representatives of the impatience\nand reaction of nature against the morgue of conventions,--two stern\nrealists, who, with their scholars, have severally set the axe at the\nroot of the tree of cant and seeming, for this time, and for all time.\nThis cheerful laborer, with no external popularity or provocation,\ndrawing his motive and his plan from his own breast, tasked himself\nwith stints for a giant, and, without relaxation or rest, except by\nalternating his pursuits, worked on for eighty years with the steadiness\nof his first zeal.\nIt is the last lesson of modern science, that the highest simplicity\nof structure is produced, not by few elements, but by the highest\ncomplexity. Man is the most composite of all creatures: the\nwheel-insect, volvox globator, is at the other extreme. We shall learn\nto draw rents and revenues from the immense patrimony of the old and\nrecent ages. Goethe teaches courage, and the equivalence of all times:\nthat the disadvantages of any epoch exist only to the faint-hearted.\nGenius hovers with his sunshine and music close by the darkest and\ndeafest eras. No mortgage, no attainder, will hold on men or hours.\nThe world is young; the former great men call to us affectionately.\nWe too must write Bibles, to unite again the heavens and the earthly\nworld. The secret of genius is to suffer no fiction to exist for us;\nto realize all that we know; in the high refinement of modern life,\nin arts, in sciences, in books, in men, to exact good faith, reality,\nand a purpose; and first, last, midst, and without end, to honor every\ntruth by use.\nTHE END.", "source": "representative_men.txt"}
{"text": "FATE.\nDelicate omens traced in air\nTo the lone bard true witness bare;\nBirds with auguries on their wings\nChanted undeceiving things\nHim to beckon, him to warn;\nWell might then the poet scorn\nTo learn of scribe or courier\nHints writ in vaster character;\nAnd on his mind, at dawn of day,\nSoft shadows of the evening lay.\nFor the prevision is allied\nUnto the thing so signified;\nOr say, the foresight that awaits\nIs the same Genius that creates.\nFATE.\nIt chanced during one winter, a few years ago, that our cities were bent\non discussing the theory of the Age.  By an odd coincidence, four or\nfive noted men were each reading a discourse to the citizens of Boston\nor New York, on the Spirit of the Times.  It so happened that the\nsubject had the same prominence in some remarkable pamphlets and\njournals issued in London in the same season.  To me, however, the\nquestion of the times resolved itself into a practical question of the\nconduct of life.  How shall I live?  We are incompetent to solve the\ntimes.  Our geometry cannot span the huge orbits of the prevailing\nideas, behold their return, and reconcile their opposition. We can only\nobey our own polarity.  'Tis fine for us to speculate and elect our\ncourse, if we must accept an irresistible dictation.\nIn our first steps to gain our wishes, we come upon immovable\nlimitations.  We are fired with the hope to reform men.  After many\nexperiments, we find that we must begin earlier,--at school.  But the\nboys and girls are not docile; we can make nothing of them.  We decide\nthat they are not of good stock.  We must begin our reform earlier\nstill,--at generation: that is to say, there is Fate, or laws of the\nworld.\nBut if there be irresistible dictation, this dictation understands\nitself.  If we must accept Fate, we are not less compelled to affirm\nliberty, the significance of the individual, the grandeur of duty, the\npower of character.  This is true, and that other is true.  But our\ngeometry cannot span these extreme points, and reconcile them.  What to\ndo? By obeying each thought frankly, by harping, or, if you will,\npounding on each string, we learn at last its power.  By the same\nobedience to other thoughts, we learn theirs, and then comes some\nreasonable hope of harmonizing them.  We are sure, that, though we know\nnot how, necessity does comport with liberty, the individual with the\nworld, my polarity with the spirit of the times. The riddle of the age\nhas for each a private solution.  If one would study his own time, it\nmust be by this method of taking up in turn each of the leading topics\nwhich belong to our scheme of human life, and, by firmly stating all\nthat is agreeable to experience on one, and doing the same justice to\nthe opposing facts in the others, the true limitations will appear.  Any\nexcess of emphasis, on one part, would be corrected, and a just balance\nwould be made.\nBut let us honestly state the facts.  Our America has a bad name for\nsuperficialness.  Great men, great nations, have not been boasters and\nbuffoons, but perceivers of the terror of life, and have manned\nthemselves to face it.  The Spartan, embodying his religion in his\ncountry, dies before its majesty without a question.  The Turk, who\nbelieves his doom is written on the iron leaf in the moment when he\nentered the world, rushes on the enemy's sabre with undivided will.  The\nTurk, the Arab, the Persian, accepts the foreordained fate.\n\"On two days, it steads not to run from thy grave,\nThe appointed, and the unappointed day;\nOn the first, neither balm nor physician can save,\nNor thee, on the second, the Universe slay.\"\nThe Hindoo, under the wheel, is as firm.  Our Calvinists, in the last\ngeneration, had something of the same dignity.  They felt that the\nweight of the Universe held them down to their place. What could _they_\ndo?  Wise men feel that there is something which cannot be talked or\nvoted away,--a strap or belt which girds the world.\n\"The Destiny, minister general,\nThat executeth in the world o'er all,\nThe purveyance which God hath seen beforne,\nSo strong it is, that tho' the world had sworn\nThe contrary of a thing by yea or nay,\nYet sometime it shall fallen on a day\nThat falleth not oft in a thousand year;\nFor, certainly, our appetites here,\nBe it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,\nAll this is ruled by the sight above.\"\nCHAUCER: _The Knight's Tale_.\nThe Greek Tragedy expressed the same sense: \"Whatever is fated, that\nwill take place.  The great immense mind of Jove is not to be\ntransgressed.\"\nSavages cling to a local god of one tribe or town.  The broad ethics of\nJesus were quickly narrowed to village theologies, which preach an\nelection or favoritism.  And, now and then, an amiable parson, like Jung\nStilling, or Robert Huntington, believes in a pistareen-Providence,\nwhich, whenever the good man wants a dinner, makes that somebody shall\nknock at his door, and leave a half-dollar.  But Nature is no\nsentimentalist,--does not cosset or pamper us.  We must see that the\nworld is rough and surly, and will not mind drowning a man or a woman;\nbut swallows your ship like a grain of dust.  The cold, inconsiderate of\npersons, tingles your blood, benumbs your feet, freezes a man like an\napple.  The diseases, the elements, fortune, gravity, lightning, respect\nno persons.  The way of Providence is a little rude. The habit of snake\nand spider, the snap of the tiger and other leapers and bloody jumpers,\nthe crackle of the bones of his prey in the coil of the anaconda,--these\nare in the system, and our habits are like theirs.  You have just dined,\nand, however scrupulously the slaughter-house is concealed in the\ngraceful distance of miles, there is complicity,--expensive races,--race\nliving at the expense of race.  The planet is liable to shocks from\ncomets, perturbations from planets, rendings from earthquake and\nvolcano, alterations of climate, precessions of equinoxes.  Rivers dry\nup by opening of the forest.  The sea changes its bed.  Towns and\ncounties fall into it.  At Lisbon, an earthquake killed men like flies.\nAt Naples, three years ago, ten thousand persons were crushed in a few\nminutes.  The scurvy at sea; the sword of the climate in the west of\nAfrica, at Cayenne, at Panama, at New Orleans, cut off men like a\nmassacre.  Our western prairie shakes with fever and ague.  The cholera,\nthe small-pox, have proved as mortal to some tribes, as a frost to the\ncrickets, which, having filled the summer with noise, are silenced by a\nfall of the temperature of one night.  Without uncovering what does not\nconcern us, or counting how many species of parasites hang on a bombyx;\nor groping after intestinal parasites, or infusory biters, or the\nobscurities of alternate generation;--the forms of the shark, the\n_labrus_, the jaw of the sea-wolf paved with crushing teeth, the weapons\nof the grampus, and other warriors hidden in the sea,--are hints of\nferocity in the interiors of nature. Let us not deny it up and down.\nProvidence has a wild, rough, incalculable road to its end, and it is of\nno use to try to whitewash its huge, mixed instrumentalities, or to\ndress up that terrific benefactor in a clean shirt and white neckcloth\nof a student in divinity.\nWill you say, the disasters which threaten mankind are exceptional, and\none need not lay his account for cataclysms every day?  Aye, but what\nhappens once, may happen again, and so long as these strokes are not to\nbe parried by us, they must be feared.\nBut these shocks and ruins are less destructive to us, than the stealthy\npower of other laws which act on us daily.  An expense of ends to means\nis fate;--organization tyrannizing over character. The menagerie, or\nforms and powers of the spine, is a book of fate: the bill of the bird,\nthe skull of the snake, determines tyrannically its limits.  So is the\nscale of races, of temperaments; so is sex; so is climate; so is the\nreaction of talents imprisoning the vital power in certain directions.\nEvery spirit makes its house; but afterwards the house confines the\nspirit.\nThe gross lines are legible to the dull: the cabman is phrenologist so\nfar: he looks in your face to see if his shilling is sure.  A dome of\nbrow denotes one thing; a pot-belly another; a squint, a pugnose, mats\nof hair, the pigment of the epidermis, betray character.  People seem\nsheathed in their tough organization.  Ask Spurzheim, ask the doctors,\nask Quetelet, if temperaments decide nothing? or if there be anything\nthey do not decide?  Read the description in medical books of the four\ntemperaments, and you will think you are reading your own thoughts which\nyou had not yet told.  Find the part which black eyes, and which blue\neyes, play severally in the company.  How shall a man escape from his\nancestors, or draw off from his veins the black drop which he drew from\nhis father's or his mother's life?  It often appears in a family, as if\nall the qualities of the progenitors were potted in several jars,--some\nruling quality in each son or daughter of the house,--and sometimes the\nunmixed temperament, the rank unmitigated elixir, the family vice, is\ndrawn off in a separate individual, and the others are proportionally\nrelieved. We sometimes see a change of expression in our companion, and\nsay, his father, or his mother, comes to the windows of his eyes, and\nsometimes a remote relative.  In different hours, a man represents each\nof several of his ancestors, as if there were seven or eight of us\nrolled up in each man's skin,--seven or eight ancestors at least,--and\nthey constitute the variety of notes for that new piece of music which\nhis life is.  At the corner of the street, you read the possibility of\neach passenger, in the facial angle, in the complexion, in the depth of\nhis eye. His parentage determines it.  Men are what their mothers made\nthem.  You may as well ask a loom which weaves huckaback, why it does\nnot make cashmere, as expect poetry from this engineer, or a chemical\ndiscovery from that jobber.  Ask the digger in the ditch to explain\nNewton's laws: the fine organs of his brain have been pinched by\noverwork and squalid poverty from father to son, for a hundred years.\nWhen each comes forth from his mother's womb, the gate of gifts closes\nbehind him. Let him value his hands and feet, he has but one pair.  So\nhe has but one future, and that is already predetermined in his lobes,\nand described in that little fatty face, pig-eye, and squat form.  All\nthe privilege and all the legislation of the world cannot meddle or help\nto make a poet or a prince of him.\nJesus said, \"When he looketh on her, he hath committed adultery.\"  But\nhe is an adulterer before he has yet looked on the woman, by the\nsuperfluity of animal, and the defect of thought, in his constitution.\nWho meets him, or who meets her, in the street, sees that they are ripe\nto be each other's victim.\nIn certain men, digestion and sex absorb the vital force, and the\nstronger these are, the individual is so much weaker.  The more of these\ndrones perish, the better for the hive.  If, later, they give birth to\nsome superior individual, with force enough to add to this animal a new\naim, and a complete apparatus to work it out, all the ancestors are\ngladly forgotten.  Most men and most women are merely one couple more.\nNow and then, one has a new cell or camarilla opened in his brain,--an\narchitectural, a musical, or a philological knack, some stray taste or\ntalent for flowers, or chemistry, or pigments, or story-telling, a good\nhand for drawing, a good foot for dancing, an athletic frame for wide\njourneying, &c.--which skill nowise alters rank in the scale of nature,\nbut serves to pass the time, the life of sensation going on as before.\nAt last, these hints and tendencies are fixed in one, or in a\nsuccession.  Each absorbs so much food and force, as to become itself a\nnew centre.  The new talent draws off so rapidly the vital force, that\nnot enough remains for the animal functions, hardly enough for health;\nso that, in the second generation, if the like genius appear, the health\nis visibly deteriorated, and the generative force impaired.\nPeople are born with the moral or with the material bias;--uterine\nbrothers with this diverging destination: and I suppose, with high\nmagnifiers, Mr. Frauenhofer or Dr. Carpenter might come to distinguish\nin the embryo at the fourth day, this is a Whig, and that a Free-soiler.\nIt was a poetic attempt to lift this mountain of Fate, to reconcile this\ndespotism of race with liberty, which led the Hindoos to say, \"Fate is\nnothing but the deeds committed in a prior state of existence.\"  I find\nthe coincidence of the extremes of eastern and western speculation in\nthe daring statement of Schelling, \"there is in every man a certain\nfeeling, that he has been what he is from all eternity, and by no means\nbecame such in time.\"  To say it less sublimely,--in the history of the\nindividual is always an account of his condition, and he knows himself\nto be a party to his present estate.\nA good deal of our politics is physiological.  Now and then, a man of\nwealth in the heyday of youth adopts the tenet of broadest freedom.  In\nEngland, there is always some man of wealth and large connection\nplanting himself, during all his years of health, on the side of\nprogress, who, as soon as he begins to die, checks his forward play,\ncalls in his troops, and becomes conservative.  All conservatives are\nsuch from personal defects.  They have been effeminated by position or\nnature, born halt and blind, through luxury of their parents, and can\nonly, like invalids, act on the defensive.  But strong natures,\nbackwoodsmen, New Hampshire giants, Napoleons, Burkes, Broughams,\nWebsters, Kossuths, are inevitable patriots, until their life ebbs, and\ntheir defects and gout, palsy and money, warp them.\nThe strongest idea incarnates itself in majorities and nations, in the\nhealthiest and strongest. Probably, the election goes by avoirdupois\nweight, and, if you could weigh bodily the tonnage of any hundred of the\nWhig and the Democratic party in a town, on the Dearborn balance, as\nthey passed the hayscales, you could predict with certainty which party\nwould carry it.  On the whole, it would be rather the speediest way of\ndeciding the vote, to put the selectmen or the mayor and aldermen at the\nhayscales.\nIn science, we have to consider two things: power and circumstance.  All\nwe know of the egg, from each successive discovery, is, _another\nvesicle_; and if, after five hundred years, you get a better observer,\nor a better glass, he finds within the last observed another.  In\nvegetable and animal tissue, it is just alike, and all that the primary\npower or spasm operates, is, still, vesicles, vesicles.  Yes,--but the\ntyrannical Circumstance!  A vesicle in new circumstances, a vesicle\nlodged in darkness, Oken thought, became animal; in light, a plant.\nLodged in the parent animal, it suffers changes, which end in\nunsheathing miraculous capability in the unaltered vesicle, and it\nunlocks itself to fish, bird, or quadruped, head and foot, eye and claw.\nThe Circumstance is Nature.  Nature is, what you may do.  There is much\nyou may not.  We have two things,--the circumstance, and the life.  Once\nwe thought, positive power was all.  Now we learn, that negative power,\nor circumstance, is half. Nature is the tyrannous circumstance, the\nthick skull, the sheathed snake, the ponderous, rock-like jaw;\nnecessitated activity; violent direction; the conditions of a tool, like\nthe locomotive, strong enough on its track, but which can do nothing but\nmischief off of it; or skates, which are wings on the ice, but fetters\non the ground.\nThe book of Nature is the book of Fate.  She turns the gigantic\npages,--leaf after leaf,--never re-turning one.  One leaf she lays down,\na floor of granite; then a thousand ages, and a bed of slate; a thousand\nages, and a measure of coal; a thousand ages, and a layer of marl and\nmud: vegetable forms appear; her first misshapen animals, zoophyte,\ntrilobium, fish; then, saurians,--rude forms, in which she has only\nblocked her future statue, concealing under these unwieldly monsters the\nfine type of her coming king.  The face of the planet cools and dries,\nthe races meliorate, and man is born.  But when a race has lived its\nterm, it comes no more again.\nThe population of the world is a conditional population; not the best,\nbut the best that could live now; and the scale of tribes, and the\nsteadiness with which victory adheres to one tribe, and defeat to\nanother, is as uniform as the superposition of strata.  We know in\nhistory what weight belongs to race.  We see the English, French, and\nGermans planting themselves on every shore and market of America and\nAustralia, and monopolizing the commerce of these countries.  We like\nthe nervous and victorious habit of our own branch of the family. We\nfollow the step of the Jew, of the Indian, of the Negro.  We see how\nmuch will has been expended to extinguish the Jew, in vain.  Look at the\nunpalatable conclusions of Knox, in his \"Fragment of Races,\"--a rash and\nunsatisfactory writer, but charged with pungent and unforgetable truths.\n\"Nature respects race, and not hybrids.\"  \"Every race has its own\n_habitat_.\"  \"Detach a colony from the race, and it deteriorates to the\ncrab.\"  See the shades of the picture.  The German and Irish millions,\nlike the Negro, have a great deal of guano in their destiny.  They are\nferried over the Atlantic, and carted over America, to ditch and to\ndrudge, to make corn cheap, and then to lie down prematurely to make a\nspot of green grass on the prairie. One more fagot of these adamantine\nbandages, is, the new science of Statistics.  It is a rule, that the\nmost casual and extraordinary events--if the basis of population is\nbroad enough--become matter of fixed calculation.  It would not be safe\nto say when a captain like Bonaparte, a singer like Jenny Lind, or a\nnavigator like Bowditch, would be born in Boston: but, on a population\nof twenty or two hundred millions, something like accuracy may be\nhad.[1]\n[1] \"Everything which pertains to the human species, considered as a\nwhole, belongs to the order of physical facts.  The greater the\nnumber of individuals, the more does the influence of the\nindividual will disappear, leaving predominance to a series of\ngeneral facts dependent on causes by which society exists, and is\npreserved.\"--QUETELET.\n'Tis frivolous to fix pedantically the date of particular inventions.\nThey have all been invented over and over fifty times.  Man is the arch\nmachine, of which all these shifts drawn from himself are toy models.\nHe helps himself on each emergency by copying or duplicating his own\nstructure, just so far as the need is.  'Tis hard to find the right\nHomer, Zoroaster, or Menu; harder still to find the Tubal Cain, or\nVulcan, or Cadmus, or Copernicus, or Fust, or Fulton, the indisputable\ninventor.  There are scores and centuries of them. \"The air is full of\nmen.\"  This kind of talent so abounds, this constructive tool-making\nefficiency, as if it adhered to the chemic atoms, as if the air he\nbreathes were made of Vaucansons, Franklins, and Watts.\nDoubtless, in every million there will be an astronomer, a\nmathematician, a comic poet, a mystic. No one can read the history of\nastronomy, without perceiving that Copernicus, Newton, Laplace, are not\nnew men, or a new kind of men, but that Thales, Anaximenes, Hipparchus,\nEmpedocles, Aristarchus, Pythagoras, OEnopides, had anticipated them;\neach had the same tense geometrical brain, apt for the same vigorous\ncomputation and logic, a mind parallel to the movement of the world.\nThe Roman mile probably rested on a measure of a degree of the meridian.\nMahometan and Chinese know what we know of leap-year, of the Gregorian\ncalendar, and of the precession of the equinoxes.  As, in every barrel\nof cowries, brought to New Bedford, there shall be one _orangia_, so\nthere will, in a dozen millions of Malays and Mahometans, be one or two\nastronomical skulls. In a large city, the most casual things, and things\nwhose beauty lies in their casualty, are produced as punctually and to\norder as the baker's muffin for breakfast.  Punch makes exactly one\ncapital joke a week; and the journals contrive to furnish one good piece\nof news every day.\nAnd not less work the laws of repression, the penalties of violated\nfunctions.  Famine, typhus, frost, war, suicide, and effete races, must\nbe reckoned calculable parts of the system of the world.\nThese are pebbles from the mountain, hints of the terms by which our\nlife is walled up, and which show a kind of mechanical exactness, as of\na loom or mill, in what we call casual or fortuitous events.\nThe force with which we resist these torrents of tendency looks so\nridiculously inadequate, that it amounts to little more than a criticism\nor a protest made by a minority of one, under compulsion of millions.  I\nseemed, in the height of a tempest, to see men overboard struggling in\nthe waves, and driven about here and there.  They glanced intelligently\nat each other, but 'twas little they could do for one another; 'twas\nmuch if each could keep afloat alone.  Well, they had a right to their\neye-beams, and all the rest was Fate.\nWe cannot trifle with this reality, this cropping-out in our planted\ngardens of the core of the world. No picture of life can have any\nveracity that does not admit the odious facts.  A man's power is hooped\nin by a necessity, which, by many experiments, he touches on every side,\nuntil he learns its arc.\nThe element running through entire nature, which we popularly call Fate,\nis known to us as limitation.  Whatever limits us, we call Fate.  If we\nare brute and barbarous, the fate takes a brute and dreadful shape.  As\nwe refine, our checks become finer.  If we rise to spiritual culture,\nthe antagonism takes a spiritual form.  In the Hindoo fables, Vishnu\nfollows Maya through all her ascending changes, from insect and crawfish\nup to elephant; whatever form she took, he took the male form of that\nkind, until she became at last woman and goddess, and he a man and a\ngod.  The limitations refine as the soul purifies, but the ring of\nnecessity is always perched at the top.\nWhen the gods in the Norse heaven were unable to bind the Fenris Wolf\nwith steel or with weight of mountains,--the one he snapped and the\nother he spurned with his heel,--they put round his foot a limp band\nsofter than silk or cobweb, and this held him: the more he spurned it,\nthe stiffer it drew.  So soft and so stanch is the ring of Fate. Neither\nbrandy, nor nectar, nor sulphuric ether, nor hell-fire, nor ichor, nor\npoetry, nor genius, can get rid of this limp band.  For if we give it\nthe high sense in which the poets use it, even thought itself is not\nabove Fate: that too must act according to eternal laws, and all that is\nwilful and fantastic in it is in opposition to its fundamental essence.\nAnd, last of all, high over thought, in the world of morals, Fate\nappears as vindicator, levelling the high, lifting the low, requiring\njustice in man, and always striking soon or late, when justice is not\ndone.  What is useful will last; what is hurtful will sink.  \"The doer\nmust suffer,\" said the Greeks: \"you would soothe a Deity not to be\nsoothed.\"  \"God himself cannot procure good for the wicked,\" said the\nWelsh triad.  \"God may consent, but only for a time,\" said the bard of\nSpain.  The limitation is impassable by any insight of man.  In its last\nand loftiest ascensions, insight itself, and the freedom of the will, is\none of its obedient members.  But we must not run into generalizations\ntoo large, but show the natural bounds or essential distinctions, and\nseek to do justice to the other elements as well.\nThus we trace Fate, in matter, mind, and morals,--in race, in\nretardations of strata, and in thought and character as well.  It is\neverywhere bound or limitation.  But Fate has its lord; limitation its\nlimits; is different seen from above and from below; from within and\nfrom without.  For, though Fate is immense, so is power, which is the\nother fact in the dual world, immense.  If Fate follows and limits\npower, power attends and antagonizes Fate.  We must respect Fate as\nnatural history, but there is more than natural history. For who and\nwhat is this criticism that pries into the matter?  Man is not order of\nnature, sack and sack, belly and members, link in a chain, nor any\nignominious baggage, but a stupendous antagonism, a dragging together of\nthe poles of the Universe.  He betrays his relation to what is below\nhim,--thick-skulled, small-brained, fishy, quadrumanous,--quadruped\nill-disguised, hardly escaped into biped, and has paid for the new\npowers by loss of some of the old ones.  But the lightning which\nexplodes and fashions planets, maker of planets and suns, is in him.  On\none side, elemental order, sandstone and granite, rock-ledges, peat-bog,\nforest, sea and shore; and, on the other part, thought, the spirit which\ncomposes and decomposes nature,--here they are, side by side, god and\ndevil, mind and matter, king and conspirator, belt and spasm, riding\npeacefully together in the eye and brain of every man.\nNor can he blink the freewill.  To hazard the contradiction,--freedom is\nnecessary.  If you please to plant yourself on the side of Fate, and\nsay, Fate is all; then we say, a part of Fate is the freedom of man.\nForever wells up the impulse of choosing and acting in the soul.\nIntellect annuls Fate.  So far as a man thinks, he is free.  And though\nnothing is more disgusting than the crowing about liberty by slaves, as\nmost men are, and the flippant mistaking for freedom of some paper\npreamble like a \"Declaration of Independence,\" or the statute right to\nvote, by those who have never dared to think or to act, yet it is\nwholesome to man to look not at Fate, but the other way: the practical\nview is the other.  His sound relation to these facts is to use and\ncommand, not to cringe to them.  \"Look not on nature, for her name is\nfatal,\" said the oracle.  The too much contemplation of these limits\ninduces meanness.  They who talk much of destiny, their birth-star, &c.,\nare in a lower dangerous plane, and invite the evils they fear.\nI cited the instinctive and heroic races as proud believers in Destiny.\nThey conspire with it; a loving resignation is with the event.  But the\ndogma makes a different impression, when it is held by the weak and\nlazy.  'Tis weak and vicious people who cast the blame on Fate.  The\nright use of Fate is to bring up our conduct to the loftiness of nature.\nRude and invincible except by themselves are the elements.  So let man\nbe.  Let him empty his breast of his windy conceits, and show his\nlordship by manners and deeds on the scale of nature.  Let him hold his\npurpose as with the tug of gravitation.  No power, no persuasion, no\nbribe shall make him give up his point.  A man ought to compare\nadvantageously with a river, an oak, or a mountain.  He shall have not\nless the flow, the expansion, and the resistance of these.\n'Tis the best use of Fate to teach a fatal courage. Go face the fire at\nsea, or the cholera in your friend's house, or the burglar in your own,\nor what danger lies in the way of duty, knowing you are guarded by the\ncherubim of Destiny.  If you believe in Fate to your harm, believe it,\nat least, for your good.\nFor, if Fate is so prevailing, man also is part of it, and can confront\nfate with fate.  If the Universe have these savage accidents, our atoms\nare as savage in resistance.  We should be crushed by the atmosphere,\nbut for the reaction of the air within the body.  A tube made of a film\nof glass can resist the shock of the ocean, if filled with the same\nwater.  If there be omnipotence in the stroke, there is omnipotence of\nrecoil.\n1. But Fate against Fate is only parrying and defence: there are, also,\nthe noble creative forces. The revelation of Thought takes man out of\nservitude into freedom.  We rightly say of ourselves, we were born, and\nafterward we were born again, and many times.  We have successive\nexperiences so important, that the new forgets the old, and hence the\nmythology of the seven or the nine heavens.  The day of days, the great\nday of the feast of life, is that in which the inward eye opens to the\nUnity in things, to the omnipresence of law;--sees that what is must be,\nand ought to be, or is the best.  This beatitude dips from on high down\non us, and we see.  It is not in us so much as we are in it.  If the air\ncome to our lungs, we breathe and live; if not, we die.  If the light\ncome to our eyes, we see; else not.  And if truth come to our mind, we\nsuddenly expand to its dimensions, as if we grew to worlds.  We are as\nlawgivers; we speak for Nature; we prophesy and divine.\nThis insight throws us on the party and interest of the Universe,\nagainst all and sundry; against ourselves, as much as others.  A man\nspeaking from insight affirms of himself what is true of the mind:\nseeing its immortality, he says, I am immortal; seeing its\ninvincibility, he says, I am strong.  It is not in us, but we are in it.\nIt is of the maker, not of what is made.  All things are touched and\nchanged by it.  This uses, and is not used.  It distances those who\nshare it, from those who share it not.  Those who share it not are\nflocks and herds.  It dates from itself;--not from former men or better\nmen,--gospel, or constitution, or college, or custom.  Where it shines,\nNature is no longer intrusive, but all things make a musical or\npictorial impression.  The world of men show like a comedy without\nlaughter:--populations, interests, government, history;--'tis all toy\nfigures in a toy house.  It does not overvalue particular truths.  We\nhear eagerly every thought and word quoted from an intellectual man.\nBut, in his presence, our own mind is roused to activity, and we forget\nvery fast what he says, much more interested in the new play of our own\nthought, than in any thought of his.  'Tis the majesty into which we\nhave suddenly mounted, the impersonality, the scorn of egotisms, the\nsphere of laws, that engage us.  Once we were stepping a little this\nway, and a little that way; now, we are as men in a balloon, and do not\nthink so much of the point we have left, or the point we would make, as\nof the liberty and glory of the way.\nJust as much intellect as you add, so much organic power.  He who sees\nthrough the design, presides over it, and must will that which must be.\nWe sit and rule, and, though we sleep, our dream will come to pass.  Our\nthought, though it were only an hour old, affirms an oldest necessity,\nnot to be separated from thought, and not to be separated from will.\nThey must always have coexisted.  It apprises us of its sovereignty and\ngodhead, which refuse to be severed from it.  It is not mine or thine,\nbut the will of all mind.  It is poured into the souls of all men, as\nthe soul itself which constitutes them men.  I know not whether there\nbe, as is alleged, in the upper region of our atmosphere, a permanent\nwesterly current, which carries with it all atoms which rise to that\nheight, but I see, that when souls reach a certain clearness of\nperception, they accept a knowledge and motive above selfishness. A\nbreath of will blows eternally through the universe of souls in the\ndirection of the Right and Necessary.  It is the air which all\nintellects inhale and exhale, and it is the wind which blows the worlds\ninto order and orbit.\nThought dissolves the material universe, by carrying the mind up into a\nsphere where all is plastic. Of two men, each obeying his own thought,\nhe whose thought is deepest will be the strongest character.  Always one\nman more than another represents the will of Divine Providence to the\nperiod.\n2. If thought makes free, so does the moral sentiment.  The mixtures of\nspiritual chemistry refuse to be analyzed.  Yet we can see that with the\nperception of truth is joined the desire that it shall prevail.  That\naffection is essential to will. Moreover, when a strong will appears, it\nusually results from a certain unity of organization, as if the whole\nenergy of body and mind flowed in one direction. All great force is real\nand elemental.  There is no manufacturing a strong will.  There must be\na pound to balance a pound.  Where power is shown in will, it must rest\non the universal force.  Alaric and Bonaparte must believe they rest on\na truth, or their will can be bought or bent.  There is a bribe possible\nfor any finite will.  But the pure sympathy with universal ends is an\ninfinite force, and cannot be bribed or bent.  Whoever has had\nexperience of the moral sentiment cannot choose but believe in unlimited\npower.  Each pulse from that heart is an oath from the Most High.  I\nknow not what the word _sublime_ means, if it be not the intimations in\nthis infant of a terrific force.  A text of heroism, a name and anecdote\nof courage, are not arguments, but sallies of freedom.  One of these is\nthe verse of the Persian Hafiz, \"'Tis written on the gate of Heaven, 'Wo\nunto him who suffers himself to be betrayed by Fate!'\"  Does the reading\nof history make us fatalists?  What courage does not the opposite\nopinion show!  A little whim of will to be free gallantly contending\nagainst the universe of chemistry.\nBut insight is not will, nor is affection will. Perception is cold, and\ngoodness dies in wishes; as Voltaire said, 'tis the misfortune of worthy\npeople that they are cowards; \"_un des plus grands malheurs des honnetes\ngens c'est qu'ils sont des laches_.\" There must be a fusion of these two\nto generate the energy of will.  There can be no driving force, except\nthrough the conversion of the man into his will, making him the will,\nand the will him.  And one may say boldly, that no man has a right\nperception of any truth, who has not been reacted on by it, so as to be\nready to be its martyr.\nThe one serious and formidable thing in nature is a will.  Society is\nservile from want of will, and therefore the world wants saviours and\nreligions. One way is right to go: the hero sees it, and moves on that\naim, and has the world under him for root and support.  He is to others\nas the world. His approbation is honor; his dissent, infamy.  The glance\nof his eye has the force of sunbeams.  A personal influence towers up in\nmemory only worthy, and we gladly forget numbers, money, climate,\ngravitation, and the rest of Fate.\nWe can afford to allow the limitation, if we know it is the meter of the\ngrowing man.  We stand against Fate, as children stand up against the\nwall in their father's house, and notch their height from year to year.\nBut when the boy grows to man, and is master of the house, he pulls down\nthat wall, and builds a new and bigger.  'Tis only a question of time.\nEvery brave youth is in training to ride and rule this dragon.  His\nscience is to make weapons and wings of these passions and retarding\nforces. Now whether, seeing these two things, fate and power, we are\npermitted to believe in unity?  The bulk of mankind believe in two gods.\nThey are under one dominion here in the house, as friend and parent, in\nsocial circles, in letters, in art, in love, in religion: but in\nmechanics, in dealing with steam and climate, in trade, in politics,\nthey think they come under another; and that it would be a practical\nblunder to transfer the method and way of working of one sphere, into\nthe other.  What good, honest, generous men at home, will be wolves and\nfoxes on change!  What pious men in the parlor will vote for what\nreprobates at the polls!  To a certain point, they believe themselves\nthe care of a Providence.  But, in a steamboat, in an epidemic, in war,\nthey believe a malignant energy rules.\nBut relation and connection are not somewhere and sometimes, but\neverywhere and always.  The divine order does not stop where their sight\nstops. The friendly power works on the same rules, in the next farm, and\nthe next planet.  But, where they have not experience, they run against\nit, and hurt themselves.  Fate, then, is a name for facts not yet passed\nunder the fire of thought;--for causes which are impenetrated.\nBut every jet of chaos which threatens to exterminate us, is convertible\nby intellect into wholesome force.  Fate is unpenetrated causes.  The\nwater drowns ship and sailor, like a grain of dust.  But learn to swim,\ntrim your bark, and the wave which drowned it, will be cloven by it, and\ncarry it, like its own foam, a plume and a power.  The cold is\ninconsiderate of persons, tingles your blood, freezes a man like a\ndew-drop.  But learn to skate, and the ice will give you a graceful,\nsweet, and poetic motion.  The cold will brace your limbs and brain to\ngenius, and make you foremost men of time. Cold and sea will train an\nimperial Saxon race, which nature cannot bear to lose, and, after\ncooping it up for a thousand years in yonder England, gives a hundred\nEnglands, a hundred Mexicos.  All the bloods it shall absorb and\ndomineer: and more than Mexicos,--the secrets of water and steam, the\nspasms of electricity, the ductility of metals, the chariot of the air,\nthe ruddered balloon are awaiting you.\nThe annual slaughter from typhus far exceeds that of war; but right\ndrainage destroys typhus. The plague in the sea-service from scurvy is\nhealed by lemon juice and other diets portable or procurable: the\ndepopulation by cholera and small-pox is ended by drainage and\nvaccination; and every other pest is not less in the chain of cause and\neffect, and may be fought off.  And, whilst art draws out the venom, it\ncommonly extorts some benefit from the vanquished enemy.  The\nmischievous torrent is taught to drudge for man: the wild beasts he\nmakes useful for food, or dress, or labor; the chemic explosions are\ncontrolled like his watch.  These are now the steeds on which he rides.\nMan moves in all modes, by legs of horses, by wings of wind, by steam,\nby gas of balloon, by electricity, and stands on tiptoe threatening to\nhunt the eagle in his own element.  There's nothing he will not make his\ncarrier.\nSteam was, till the other day, the devil which we dreaded.  Every pot\nmade by any human potter or brazier had a hole in its cover, to let off\nthe enemy, lest he should lift pot and roof, and carry the house away.\nBut the Marquis of Worcester, Watt, and Fulton bethought themselves,\nthat, where was power, was not devil, but was God; that it must be\navailed of, and not by any means let off and wasted. Could he lift pots\nand roofs and houses so handily? he was the workman they were in search\nof.  He could be used to lift away, chain, and compel other devils, far\nmore reluctant and dangerous, namely, cubic miles of earth, mountains,\nweight or resistance of water, machinery, and the labors of all men in\nthe world; and time he shall lengthen, and shorten space.\nIt has not fared much otherwise with higher kinds of steam.  The opinion\nof the million was the terror of the world, and it was attempted, either\nto dissipate it, by amusing nations, or to pile it over with strata of\nsociety,--a layer of soldiers; over that, a layer of lords; and a king\non the top; with clamps and hoops of castles, garrisons, and police.\nBut, sometimes, the religious principle would get in, and burst the\nhoops, and rive every mountain laid on top of it.  The Fultons and Watts\nof politics, believing in unity, saw that it was a power, and, by\nsatisfying it, (as justice satisfies everybody,) through a different\ndisposition of society,--grouping it on a level, instead of piling it\ninto a mountain,--they have contrived to make of this terror the most\nharmless and energetic form of a State.\nVery odious, I confess, are the lessons of Fate. Who likes to have a\ndapper phrenologist pronouncing on his fortunes?  Who likes to believe\nthat he has hidden in his skull, spine, and pelvis, all the vices of a\nSaxon or Celtic race, which will be sure to pull him down,--with what\ngrandeur of hope and resolve he is fired,--into a selfish, huckstering,\nservile, dodging animal?  A learned physician tells us, the fact is\ninvariable with the Neapolitan, that, when mature, he assumes the forms\nof the unmistakable scoundrel.  That is a little overstated,--but may\npass.\nBut these are magazines and arsenals.  A man must thank his defects, and\nstand in some terror of his talents.  A transcendent talent draws so\nlargely on his forces, as to lame him; a defect pays him revenues on the\nother side.  The sufferance, which is the badge of the Jew, has made\nhim, in these days, the ruler of the rulers of the earth. If Fate is ore\nand quarry, if evil is good in the making, if limitation is power that\nshall be, if calamities, oppositions, and weights are wings and\nmeans,--we are reconciled.\nFate involves the melioration.  No statement of the Universe can have\nany soundness, which does not admit its ascending effort.  The direction\nof the whole, and of the parts, is toward benefit, and in proportion to\nthe health.  Behind every individual, closes organization: before him,\nopens liberty,--the Better, the Best.  The first and worst races are\ndead.  The second and imperfect races are dying out, or remain for the\nmaturing of higher.  In the latest race, in man, every generosity, every\nnew perception, the love and praise he extorts from his fellows, are\ncertificates of advance out of fate into freedom.  Liberation of the\nwill from the sheaths and clogs of organization which he has outgrown,\nis the end and aim of this world.  Every calamity is a spur and valuable\nhint; and where his endeavors do not yet fully avail, they tell as\ntendency. The whole circle of animal life,--tooth against\ntooth,--devouring war, war for food, a yelp of pain and a grunt of\ntriumph, until, at last, the whole menagerie, the whole chemical mass is\nmellowed and refined for higher use,--pleases at a sufficient\nperspective.\nBut to see how fate slides into freedom, and freedom into fate, observe\nhow far the roots of every creature run, or find, if you can, a point\nwhere there is no thread of connection.  Our life is consentaneous and\nfar-related.  This knot of nature is so well tied, that nobody was ever\ncunning enough to find the two ends.  Nature is intricate, overlapped,\ninterweaved, and endless.  Christopher Wren said of the beautiful King's\nCollege chapel, \"that, if anybody would tell him where to lay the first\nstone, he would build such another.\"  But where shall we find the first\natom in this house of man, which is all consent, inosculation, and\nbalance of parts?\nThe web of relation is shown in _habitat_, shown in hybernation.  When\nhybernation was observed, it was found, that, whilst some animals became\ntorpid in winter, others were torpid in summer: hybernation then was a\nfalse name.  The _long sleep_ is not an effect of cold, but is regulated\nby the supply of food proper to the animal.  It becomes torpid when the\nfruit or prey it lives on is not in season, and regains its activity\nwhen its food is ready.\nEyes are found in light; ears in auricular air; feet on land; fins in\nwater; wings in air; and, each creature where it was meant to be, with a\nmutual fitness.  Every zone has its own Fauna. There is adjustment\nbetween the animal and its food, its parasite, its enemy.  Balances are\nkept. It is not allowed to diminish in numbers, nor to exceed.  The like\nadjustments exist for man.  His food is cooked, when he arrives; his\ncoal in the pit; the house ventilated; the mud of the deluge dried; his\ncompanions arrived at the same hour, and awaiting him with love,\nconcert, laughter, and tears. These are coarse adjustments, but the\ninvisible are not less.  There are more belongings to every creature\nthan his air and his food.  His instincts must be met, and he has\npredisposing power that bends and fits what is near him to his use.  He\nis not possible until the invisible things are right for him, as well as\nthe visible.  Of what changes, then, in sky and earth, and in finer\nskies and earths, does the appearance of some Dante or Columbus apprise\nus!\nHow is this effected?  Nature is no spendthrift, but takes the shortest\nway to her ends.  As the general says to his soldiers, \"if you want a\nfort, build a fort,\" so nature makes every creature do its own work and\nget its living,--is it planet, animal, or tree.  The planet makes\nitself.  The animal cell makes itself;--then, what it wants.  Every\ncreature,--wren or dragon,--shall make its own lair. As soon as there is\nlife, there is self-direction, and absorbing and using of material.\nLife is freedom,--life in the direct ratio of its amount.  You may be\nsure, the new-born man is not inert.  Life works both voluntarily and\nsupernaturally in its neighborhood. Do you suppose, he can be estimated\nby his weight in pounds, or, that he is contained in his skin,--this\nreaching, radiating, jaculating fellow? The smallest candle fills a mile\nwith its rays, and the papillae of a man run out to every star.\nWhen there is something to be done, the world knows how to get it done.\nThe vegetable eye makes leaf, pericarp, root, bark, or thorn, as the\nneed is; the first cell converts itself into stomach, mouth, nose, or\nnail, according to the want: the world throws its life into a hero or a\nshepherd; and puts him where he is wanted.  Dante and Columbus were\nItalians, in their time: they would be Russians or Americans to-day.\nThings ripen, new men come.  The adaptation is not capricious.  The\nulterior aim, the purpose beyond itself, the correlation by which\nplanets subside and crystallize, then animate beasts and men, will not\nstop, but will work into finer particulars, and from finer to finest.\nThe secret of the world is, the tie between person and event.  Person\nmakes event, and event person. The \"times,\" \"the age,\" what is that, but\na few profound persons and a few active persons who epitomize the\ntimes?--Goethe, Hegel, Metternich, Adams, Calhoun, Guizot, Peel, Cobden,\nKossuth, Rothschild, Astor, Brunel, and the rest.  The same fitness must\nbe presumed between a man and the time and event, as between the sexes,\nor between a race of animals and the food it eats, or the inferior races\nit uses.  He thinks his fate alien, because the copula is hidden.  But\nthe soul contains the event that shall befall it, for the event is only\nthe actualization of its thoughts; and what we pray to ourselves for is\nalways granted.  The event is the print of your form.  It fits you like\nyour skin.  What each does is proper to him.  Events are the children of\nhis body and mind.  We learn that the soul of Fate is the soul of us, as\nHafiz sings,\nAlas! till now I had not known,\nMy guide and fortune's guide are one.\nAll the toys that infatuate men, and which they play for,--houses, land,\nmoney, luxury, power, fame, are the selfsame thing, with a new gauze or\ntwo of illusion overlaid.  And of all the drums and rattles by which men\nare made willing to have their heads broke, and are led out solemnly\nevery morning to parade,--the most admirable is this by which we are\nbrought to believe that events are arbitrary, and independent of\nactions.  At the conjuror's, we detect the hair by which he moves his\npuppet, but we have not eyes sharp enough to descry the thread that ties\ncause and effect.\nNature magically suits the man to his fortunes, by making these the\nfruit of his character.  Ducks take to the water, eagles to the sky,\nwaders to the sea margin, hunters to the forest, clerks to\ncounting-rooms, soldiers to the frontier.  Thus events grow on the same\nstem with persons; are sub-persons. The pleasure of life is according to\nthe man that lives it, and not according to the work or the place. Life\nis an ecstasy.  We know what madness belongs to love,--what power to\npaint a vile object in hues of heaven.  As insane persons are\nindifferent to their dress, diet, and other accommodations, and, as we\ndo in dreams, with equanimity, the most absurd acts, so, a drop more of\nwine in our cup of life will reconcile us to strange company and work.\nEach creature puts forth from itself its own condition and sphere, as\nthe slug sweats out its slimy house on the pear-leaf, and the woolly\naphides on the apple perspire their own bed, and the fish its shell.  In\nyouth, we clothe ourselves with rainbows, and go as brave as the zodiac.\nIn age, we put out another sort of perspiration,--gout, fever,\nrheumatism, caprice, doubt, fretting, and avarice.\nA man's fortunes are the fruit of his character. A man's friends are his\nmagnetisms.  We go to Herodotus and Plutarch for examples of Fate; but\nwe are examples.  \"_Quisque suos patimur manes_.\"  The tendency of every\nman to enact all that is in his constitution is expressed in the old\nbelief, that the efforts which we make to escape from our destiny only\nserve to lead us into it: and I have noticed, a man likes better to be\ncomplimented on his position, as the proof of the last or total\nexcellence, than on his merits.\nA man will see his character emitted in the events that seem to meet,\nbut which exude from and accompany him.  Events expand with the\ncharacter.  As once he found himself among toys, so now he plays a part\nin colossal systems, and his growth is declared in his ambition, his\ncompanions, and his performance.  He looks like a piece of luck, but is\na piece of causation;--the mosaic, angulated and ground to fit into the\ngap he fills.  Hence in each town there is some man who is, in his brain\nand performance, an explanation of the tillage, production, factories,\nbanks, churches, ways of living, and society, of that town.  If you do\nnot chance to meet him, all that you see will leave you a little\npuzzled: if you see him, it will become plain.  We know in Massachusetts\nwho built New Bedford, who built Lynn, Lowell, Lawrence, Clinton,\nFitchburg, Holyoke, Portland, and many another noisy mart.  Each of\nthese men, if they were transparent, would seem to you not so much men,\nas walking cities, and, wherever you put them, they would build one.\nHistory is the action and reaction of these two,--Nature and\nThought;--two boys pushing each other on the curb-stone of the pavement.\nEverything is pusher or pushed: and matter and mind are in perpetual\ntilt and balance, so.  Whilst the man is weak, the earth takes up him.\nHe plants his brain and affections.  By and by he will take up the\nearth, and have his gardens and vineyards in the beautiful order and\nproductiveness of his thought.  Every solid in the universe is ready to\nbecome fluid on the approach of the mind, and the power to flux it is\nthe measure of the mind.  If the wall remain adamant, it accuses the\nwant of thought.  To a subtler force, it will stream into new forms,\nexpressive of the character of the mind. What is the city in which we\nsit here, but an aggregate of incongruous materials, which have obeyed\nthe will of some man?  The granite was reluctant, but his hands were\nstronger, and it came.  Iron was deep in the ground, and well combined\nwith stone; but could not hide from his fires.  Wood, lime, stuffs,\nfruits, gums, were dispersed over the earth and sea, in vain.  Here they\nare, within reach of every man's day-labor,--what he wants of them. The\nwhole world is the flux of matter over the wires of thought to the poles\nor points where it would build.  The races of men rise out of the ground\npreoccupied with a thought which rules them, and divided into parties\nready armed and angry to fight for this metaphysical abstraction. The\nquality of the thought differences the Egyptian and the Roman, the\nAustrian and the American.  The men who come on the stage at one period\nare all found to be related to each other. Certain ideas are in the air.\nWe are all impressionable, for we are made of them; all impressionable,\nbut some more than others, and these first express them.  This explains\nthe curious contemporaneousness of inventions and discoveries.  The\ntruth is in the air, and the most impressionable brain will announce it\nfirst, but all will announce it a few minutes later.  So women, as most\nsusceptible, are the best index of the coming hour. So the great man,\nthat is, the man most imbued with the spirit of the time, is the\nimpressionable man,--of a fibre irritable and delicate, like iodine to\nlight.  He feels the infinitesimal attractions. His mind is righter than\nothers, because he yields to a current so feeble as can be felt only by\na needle delicately poised.\nThe correlation is shown in defects.  Moeller, in his Essay on\nArchitecture, taught that the building which was fitted accurately to\nanswer its end, would turn out to be beautiful, though beauty had not\nbeen intended.  I find the like unity in human structures rather\nvirulent and pervasive; that a crudity in the blood will appear in the\nargument; a hump in the shoulder will appear in the speech and\nhandiwork.  If his mind could be seen, the hump would be seen.  If a man\nhas a seesaw in his voice, it will run into his sentences, into his\npoem, into the structure of his fable, into his speculation, into his\ncharity.  And, as every man is hunted by his own daemon, vexed by his\nown disease, this checks all his activity.\nSo each man, like each plant, has his parasites. A strong, astringent,\nbilious nature has more truculent enemies than the slugs and moths that\nfret my leaves.  Such an one has curculios, borers, knife-worms: a\nswindler ate him first, then a client, then a quack, then smooth,\nplausible gentlemen, bitter and selfish as Moloch.\nThis correlation really existing can be divined. If the threads are\nthere, thought can follow and show them.  Especially when a soul is\nquick and docile; as Chaucer sings,\n\"Or if the soul of proper kind\nBe so perfect as men find,\nThat it wot what is to come,\nAnd that he warneth all and some\nOf every of their aventures,\nBy previsions or figures;\nBut that our flesh hath not might\nIt to understand aright\nFor it is warned too darkly.\"--\nSome people are made up of rhyme, coincidence, omen, periodicity, and\npresage: they meet the person they seek; what their companion prepares\nto say to them, they first say to him; and a hundred signs apprise them\nof what is about to befall.\nWonderful intricacy in the web, wonderful constancy in the design this\nvagabond life admits.  We wonder how the fly finds its mate, and yet\nyear after year we find two men, two women, without legal or carnal tie,\nspend a great part of their best time within a few feet of each other.\nAnd the moral is, that what we seek we shall find; what we flee from\nflees from us; as Goethe said, \"what we wish for in youth, comes in\nheaps on us in old age,\" too often cursed with the granting of our\nprayer: and hence the high caution, that, since we are sure of having\nwhat we wish, we beware to ask only for high things.\nOne key, one solution to the mysteries of human condition, one solution\nto the old knots of fate, freedom, and foreknowledge, exists, the\npropounding, namely, of the double consciousness.  A man must ride\nalternately on the horses of his private and his public nature, as the\nequestrians in the circus throw themselves nimbly from horse to horse,\nor plant one foot on the back of one, and the other foot on the back of\nthe other.  So when a man is the victim of his fate, has sciatica in his\nloins, and cramp in his mind; a club-foot and a club in his wit; a sour\nface, and a selfish temper; a strut in his gait, and a conceit in his\naffection; or is ground to powder by the vice of his race; he is to\nrally on his relation to the Universe, which his ruin benefits. Leaving\nthe daemon who suffers, he is to take sides with the Deity who secures\nuniversal benefit by his pain.\nTo offset the drag of temperament and race, which pulls down, learn this\nlesson, namely, that by the cunning co-presence of two elements, which\nis throughout nature, whatever lames or paralyzes you, draws in with it\nthe divinity, in some form, to repay.  A good intention clothes itself\nwith sudden power.  When a god wishes to ride, any chip or pebble will\nbud and shoot out winged feet, and serve him for a horse.\nLet us build altars to the Blessed Unity which holds nature and souls in\nperfect solution, and compels every atom to serve an universal end.  I\ndo not wonder at a snow-flake, a shell, a summer landscape, or the glory\nof the stars; but at the necessity of beauty under which the universe\nlies; that all is and must be pictorial; that the rainbow, and the curve\nof the horizon, and the arch of the blue vault are only results from the\norganism of the eye. There is no need for foolish amateurs to fetch me\nto admire a garden of flowers, or a sun-gilt cloud, or a waterfall, when\nI cannot look without seeing splendor and grace.  How idle to choose a\nrandom sparkle here or there, when the indwelling necessity plants the\nrose of beauty on the brow of chaos, and discloses the central intention\nof Nature to be harmony and joy.\nLet us build altars to the Beautiful Necessity. If we thought men were\nfree in the sense, that, in a single exception one fantastical will\ncould prevail over the law of things, it were all one as if a child's\nhand could pull down the sun.  If, in the least particular, one could\nderange the order of nature,--who would accept the gift of life?\nLet us build altars to the Beautiful Necessity, which secures that all\nis made of one piece; that plaintiff and defendant, friend and enemy,\nanimal and planet, food and eater, are of one kind.  In astronomy, is\nvast space, but no foreign system; in geology, vast time, but the same\nlaws as to-day. Why should we be afraid of Nature, which is no other\nthan \"philosophy and theology embodied\"? Why should we fear to be\ncrushed by savage elements, we who are made up of the same elements? Let\nus build to the Beautiful Necessity, which makes man brave in believing\nthat he cannot shun a danger that is appointed, nor incur one that is\nnot; to the Necessity which rudely or softly educates him to the\nperception that there are no contingencies; that Law rules throughout\nexistence, a Law which is not intelligent but intelligence,--not\npersonal nor impersonal,--it disdains words and passes understanding; it\ndissolves persons; it vivifies nature; yet solicits the pure in heart to\ndraw on all its omnipotence.\nII.\nPOWER.\nHis tongue was framed to music,\nAnd his hand was armed with skill,\nHis face was the mould of beauty,\nAnd his heart the throne of will.\nPOWER.\nThere is not yet any inventory of a man's faculties, any more than a\nbible of his opinions.  Who shall set a limit to the influence of a\nhuman being? There are men, who, by their sympathetic attractions, carry\nnations with them, and lead the activity of the human race.  And if\nthere be such a tie, that, wherever the mind of man goes, nature will\naccompany him, perhaps there are men whose magnetisms are of that force\nto draw material and elemental powers, and, where they appear, immense\ninstrumentalities organize around them.  Life is a search after power;\nand this is an element with which the world is so saturated,--there is\nno chink or crevice in which it is not lodged,--that no honest seeking\ngoes unrewarded.  A man should prize events and possessions as the ore\nin which this fine mineral is found; and he can well afford to let\nevents and possessions, and the breath of the body go, if their value\nhas been added to him in the shape of power.  If he have secured the\nelixir, he can spare the wide gardens from which it was distilled. A\ncultivated man, wise to know and bold to perform, is the end to which\nnature works, and the education of the will is the flowering and result\nof all this geology and astronomy.\nAll successful men have agreed in one thing,--they were _causationists_.\nThey believed that things went not by luck, but by law; that there was\nnot a weak or a cracked link in the chain that joins the first and last\nof things.  A belief in causality, or strict connection between every\ntrifle and the principle of being, and, in consequence, belief in\ncompensation, or, that nothing is got for nothing,--characterizes all\nvaluable minds, and must control every effort that is made by an\nindustrious one. The most valiant men are the best believers in the\ntension of the laws.  \"All the great captains,\" said Bonaparte, \"have\nperformed vast achievements by conforming with the rules of the art,--by\nadjusting efforts to obstacles.\"\nThe key to the age may be this, or that, or the other, as the young\norators describe;--the key to all ages is--Imbecility; imbecility in the\nvast majority of men, at all times, and, even in heroes, in all but\ncertain eminent moments; victims of gravity, custom, and fear.  This\ngives force to the strong,--that the multitude have no habit of\nself-reliance or original action.\nWe must reckon success a constitutional trait. Courage,--the old\nphysicians taught, (and their meaning holds, if their physiology is a\nlittle mythical,)--courage, or the degree of life, is as the degree of\ncirculation of the blood in the arteries. \"During passion, anger, fury,\ntrials of strength, wrestling, fighting, a large amount of blood is\ncollected in the arteries, the maintenance of bodily strength requiring\nit, and but little is sent into the veins.  This condition is constant\nwith intrepid persons.\"  Where the arteries hold their blood, is courage\nand adventure possible.  Where they pour it unrestrained into the veins,\nthe spirit is low and feeble.  For performance of great mark, it needs\nextraordinary health.  If Eric is in robust health, and has slept well,\nand is at the top of his condition, and thirty years old, at his\ndeparture from Greenland, he will steer west, and his ships will reach\nNewfoundland.  But take out Eric, and put in a stronger and bolder\nman,--Biorn, or Thorfin,--and the ships will, with just as much ease,\nsail six hundred, one thousand, fifteen hundred miles further, and reach\nLabrador and New England.  There is no chance in results.  With adults,\nas with children, one class enter cordially into the game, and whirl\nwith the whirling world; the others have cold hands, and remain\nbystanders; or are only dragged in by the humor and vivacity of those\nwho can carry a dead weight.  The first wealth is health.  Sickness is\npoor-spirited, and cannot serve any one: it must husband its resources\nto live.  But health or fulness answers its own ends, and has to spare,\nruns over, and inundates the neighborhoods and creeks of other men's\nnecessities.\nAll power is of one kind, a sharing of the nature of the world.  The\nmind that is parallel with the laws of nature will be in the current of\nevents, and strong with their strength.  One man is made of the same\nstuff of which events are made; is in sympathy with the course of\nthings; can predict it. Whatever befalls, befalls him first; so that he\nis equal to whatever shall happen.  A man who knows men, can talk well\non politics, trade, law, war, religion.  For, everywhere, men are led in\nthe same manners.\nThe advantage of a strong pulse is not to be supplied by any labor, art,\nor concert.  It is like the climate, which easily rears a crop, which no\nglass, or irrigation, or tillage, or manures, can elsewhere rival.  It\nis like the opportunity of a city like New York, or Constantinople,\nwhich needs no diplomacy to force capital or genius or labor to it.\nThey come of themselves, as the waters flow to it.  So a broad, healthy,\nmassive understanding seems to lie on the shore of unseen rivers, of\nunseen oceans, which are covered with barks, that, night and day, are\ndrifted to this point.  That is poured into its lap, which other men lie\nplotting for.  It is in everybody's secret; anticipates everybody's\ndiscovery; and if it do not command every fact of the genius and the\nscholar, it is because it is large and sluggish, and does not think them\nworth the exertion which you do.\nThis affirmative force is in one, and is not in another, as one horse\nhas the spring in him, and another in the whip.  \"On the neck of the\nyoung man,\" said Hafiz, \"sparkles no gem so gracious as enterprise.\"\nImport into any stationary district, as into an old Dutch population in\nNew York or Pennsylvania, or among the planters of Virginia, a colony of\nhardy Yankees, with seething brains, heads full of steam-hammer, pulley,\ncrank, and toothed wheel,--and everything begins to shine with values.\nWhat enhancement to all the water and land in England, is the arrival of\nJames Watt or Brunel!  In every company, there is not only the active\nand passive sex, but, in both men and women, a deeper and more important\n_sex of mind_, namely, the inventive or creative class of both men and\nwomen, and the uninventive or accepting class. Each _plus_ man\nrepresents his set, and, if he have the accidental advantage of personal\nascendency,--which implies neither more nor less of talent, but merely\nthe temperamental or taming eye of a soldier or a schoolmaster, (which\none has, and one has not, as one has a black moustache and one a blond,)\nthen quite easily and without envy or resistance, all his coadjutors and\nfeeders will admit his right to absorb them.  The merchant works by\nbook-keeper and cashier; the lawyer's authorities are hunted up by\nclerks; the geologist reports the surveys of his subalterns; Commander\nWilkes appropriates the results of all the naturalists attached to the\nExpedition; Thorwaldsen's statue is finished by stone-cutters; Dumas has\njourneymen; and Shakspeare was theatre-manager, and used the labor of\nmany young men, as well as the playbooks.\nThere is always room for a man of force, and he makes room for many.\nSociety is a troop of thinkers, and the best heads among them take the\nbest places.  A feeble man can see the farms that are fenced and tilled,\nthe houses that are built. The strong man sees the possible houses and\nfarms. His eye makes estates, as fast as the sun breeds clouds.\nWhen a new boy comes into school, when a man travels, and encounters\nstrangers every day, or, when into any old club a new comer is\ndomesticated, that happens which befalls, when a strange ox is driven\ninto a pen or pasture where cattle are kept; there is at once a trial of\nstrength between the best pair of horns and the new comer, and it is\nsettled thenceforth which is the leader.  So now, there is a measuring\nof strength, very courteous, but decisive, and an acquiescence\nthenceforward when these two meet.  Each reads his fate in the other's\neyes.  The weaker party finds, that none of his information or wit quite\nfits the occasion. He thought he knew this or that: he finds that he\nomitted to learn the end of it.  Nothing that he knows will quite hit\nthe mark, whilst all the rival's arrows are good, and well thrown.  But\nif he knew all the facts in the encyclopaedia, it would not help him:\nfor this is an affair of presence of mind, of attitude, of aplomb: the\nopponent has the sun and wind, and, in every cast, the choice of weapon\nand mark; and, when he himself is matched with some other antagonist,\nhis own shafts fly well and hit. 'Tis a question of stomach and\nconstitution.  The second man is as good as the first,--perhaps better;\nbut has not stoutness or stomach, as the first has, and so his wit seems\nover-fine or under-fine.\nHealth is good,--power, life, that resists disease, poison, and all\nenemies, and is conservative, as well as creative.  Here is question,\nevery spring, whether to graft with wax, or whether with clay; whether\nto whitewash or to potash, or to prune; but the one point is the thrifty\ntree.  A good tree, that agrees with the soil, will grow in spite of\nblight, or bug, or pruning, or neglect, by night and by day, in all\nweathers and all treatments.  Vivacity, leadership, must be had, and we\nare not allowed to be nice in choosing.  We must fetch the pump with\ndirty water, if clean cannot be had.  If we will make bread, we must\nhave contagion, yeast, emptyings, or what not, to induce fermentation\ninto the dough: as the torpid artist seeks inspiration at any cost, by\nvirtue or by vice, by friend or by fiend, by prayer or by wine.  And we\nhave a certain instinct, that where is great amount of life, though\ngross and peccant, it has its own checks and purifications, and will be\nfound at last in harmony with moral laws.\nWe watch in children with pathetic interest, the degree in which they\npossess recuperative force. When they are hurt by us, or by each other,\nor go to the bottom of the class, or miss the annual prizes, or are\nbeaten in the game,--if they lose heart, and remember the mischance in\ntheir chamber at home, they have a serious check.  But if they have the\nbuoyancy and resistance that preoccupies them with new interest in the\nnew moment,--the wounds cicatrize, and the fibre is the tougher for the\nhurt.\nOne comes to value this _plus_ health, when he sees that all\ndifficulties vanish before it.  A timid man listening to the alarmists\nin Congress, and in the newspapers, and observing the profligacy of\nparty,--sectional interests urged with a fury which shuts its eyes to\nconsequences, with a mind made up to desperate extremities, ballot in\none hand, and rifle in the other,--might easily believe that he and his\ncountry have seen their best days, and he hardens himself the best he\ncan against the coming ruin.  But, after this has been foretold with\nequal confidence fifty times, and government six per cents have not\ndeclined a quarter of a mill, he discovers that the enormous elements of\nstrength which are here in play, make our politics unimportant.\nPersonal power, freedom, and the resources of nature strain every\nfaculty of every citizen.  We prosper with such vigor, that, like\nthrifty trees, which grow in spite of ice, lice, mice, and borers, so we\ndo not suffer from the profligate swarms that fatten on the national\ntreasury.  The huge animals nourish huge parasites, and the rancor of\nthe disease attests the strength of the constitution.  The same energy\nin the Greek _Demos_ drew the remark, that the evils of popular\ngovernment appear greater than they are; there is compensation for them\nin the spirit and energy it awakens. The rough and ready style which\nbelongs to a people of sailors, foresters, farmers, and mechanics, has\nits advantages.  Power educates the potentate. As long as our people\nquote English standards they dwarf their own proportions.  A Western\nlawyer of eminence said to me he wished it were a penal offence to bring\nan English law-book into a court in this country, so pernicious had he\nfound in his experience our deference to English precedent. The very\nword 'commerce' has only an English meaning, and is pinched to the cramp\nexigencies of English experience.  The commerce of rivers, the commerce\nof railroads, and who knows but the commerce of air-balloons, must add\nan American extension to the pond-hole of admiralty.  As long as our\npeople quote English standards, they will miss the sovereignty of power;\nbut let these rough riders,--legislators in shirt-sleeves,--Hoosier,\nSucker, Wolverine, Badger,--or whatever hard head Arkansas, Oregon, or\nUtah sends, half orator, half assassin, to represent its wrath and\ncupidity at Washington,--let these drive as they may; and the\ndisposition of territories and public lands, the necessity of balancing\nand keeping at bay the snarling majorities of German, Irish, and of\nnative millions, will bestow promptness, address, and reason, at last,\non our buffalo-hunter, and authority and majesty of manners.  The\ninstinct of the people is right.  Men expect from good whigs, put into\noffice by the respectability of the country, much less skill to deal\nwith Mexico, Spain, Britain, or with our own malcontent members, than\nfrom some strong transgressor, like Jefferson, or Jackson, who first\nconquers his own government, and then uses the same genius to conquer\nthe foreigner.  The senators who dissented from Mr. Polk's Mexican war,\nwere not those who knew better, but those who, from political position,\ncould afford it; not Webster, but Benton and Calhoun.\nThis power, to be sure, is not clothed in satin. 'Tis the power of Lynch\nlaw, of soldiers and pirates; and it bullies the peaceable and loyal.\nBut it brings its own antidote; and here is my point,--that all kinds of\npower usually emerge at the same time; good energy, and bad; power of\nmind, with physical health; the ecstasies of devotion, with the\nexasperations of debauchery.  The same elements are always present, only\nsometimes these conspicuous, and sometimes those; what was yesterday\nforeground, being to-day background,--what was surface, playing now a\nnot less effective part as basis.  The longer the drought lasts, the\nmore is the atmosphere surcharged with water.  The faster the ball falls\nto the sun, the force to fly off is by so much augmented.  And, in\nmorals, wild liberty breeds iron conscience; natures with great impulses\nhave great resources, and return from far.  In politics, the sons of\ndemocrats will be whigs; whilst red republicanism, in the father, is a\nspasm of nature to engender an intolerable tyrant in the next age. On\nthe other hand, conservatism, ever more timorous and narrow, disgusts\nthe children, and drives them for a mouthful of fresh air into\nradicalism.\nThose who have most of this coarse energy,--the 'bruisers,' who have run\nthe gauntlet of caucus and tavern through the county or the state, have\ntheir own vices, but they have the good nature of strength and courage.\nFierce and unscrupulous, they are usually frank and direct, and above\nfalsehood. Our politics fall into bad hands, and churchmen and men of\nrefinement, it seems agreed, are not fit persons to send to Congress.\nPolitics is a deleterious profession, like some poisonous handicrafts.\nMen in power have no opinions, but may be had cheap for any opinion, for\nany purpose,--and if it be only a question between the most civil and\nthe most forcible, I lean to the last.  These Hoosiers and Suckers are\nreally better than the snivelling opposition.  Their wrath is at least\nof a bold and manly cast.  They see, against the unanimous declarations\nof the people, how much crime the people will bear; they proceed from\nstep to step, and they have calculated but too justly upon their\nExcellencies, the New England governors, and upon their Honors, the New\nEngland legislators.  The messages of the governors and the resolutions\nof the legislatures, are a proverb for expressing a sham virtuous\nindignation, which, in the course of events, is sure to be belied.\nIn trade, also, this energy usually carries a trace of ferocity.\nPhilanthropic and religious bodies do not commonly make their executive\nofficers out of saints.  The communities hitherto founded by\nSocialists,--the Jesuits, the Port-Royalists, the American communities\nat New Harmony, at Brook Farm, at Zoar, are only possible, by installing\nJudas as steward.  The rest of the offices may be filled by good\nburgesses.  The pious and charitable proprietor has a foreman not quite\nso pious and charitable.  The most amiable of country gentlemen has a\ncertain pleasure in the teeth of the bull-dog which guards his orchard.\nOf the Shaker society, it was formerly a sort of proverb in the country,\nthat they always sent the devil to market.  And in representations of\nthe Deity, painting, poetry, and popular religion have ever drawn the\nwrath from Hell. It is an esoteric doctrine of society, that a little\nwickedness is good to make muscle; as if conscience were not good for\nhands and legs, as if poor decayed formalists of law and order cannot\nrun like wild goats, wolves, and conies; that, as there is a use in\nmedicine for poisons, so the world cannot move without rogues; that\npublic spirit and the ready hand are as well found among the malignants.\n'Tis not very rare, the coincidence of sharp private and political\npractice, with public spirit, and good neighborhood.\nI knew a burly Boniface who for many years kept a public-house in one of\nour rural capitals. He was a knave whom the town could ill spare. He was\na social, vascular creature, grasping and selfish.  There was no crime\nwhich he did not or could not commit.  But he made good friends of the\nselectmen, served them with his best chop, when they supped at his\nhouse, and also with his honor the Judge, he was very cordial, grasping\nhis hand. He introduced all the fiends, male and female, into the town,\nand united in his person the functions of bully, incendiary, swindler,\nbarkeeper, and burglar. He girdled the trees, and cut off the horses'\ntails of the temperance people, in the night.  He led the rummies' and\nradicals in town-meeting with a speech.  Meantime, he was civil, fat,\nand easy, in his house, and precisely the most public-spirited citizen.\nHe was active in getting the roads repaired and planted with\nshade-trees; he subscribed for the fountains, the gas, and the\ntelegraph; he introduced the new horse-rake, the new scraper, the\nbaby-jumper, and what not, that Connecticut sends to the admiring\ncitizens.  He did this the easier, that the peddler stopped at his\nhouse, and paid his keeping, by setting up his new trap on the\nlandlord's premises.\nWhilst thus the energy for originating and executing work, deforms\nitself by excess, and so our axe chops off our own fingers,--this evil\nis not without remedy.  All the elements whose aid man calls in, will\nsometimes become his masters, especially those of most subtle force.\nShall he, then, renounce steam, fire, and electricity, or, shall he\nlearn to deal with them?  The rule for this whole class of agencies\nis,--all _plus_ is good; only put it in the right place.\nMen of this surcharge of arterial blood cannot live on nuts, herb-tea,\nand elegies; cannot read novels, and play whist; cannot satisfy all\ntheir wants at the Thursday Lecture, or the Boston Athenaeum.  They pine\nfor adventure, and must go to Pike's Peak; had rather die by the hatchet\nof a Pawnee, than sit all day and every day at a counting-room desk.\nThey are made for war, for the sea, for mining, hunting, and clearing;\nfor hair-breadth adventures, huge risks, and the joy of eventful living.\nSome men cannot endure an hour of calm at sea.  I remember a poor Malay\ncook, on board a Liverpool packet, who, when the wind blew a gale, could\nnot contain his joy; \"Blow!\" he cried, \"me do tell you, blow!\"  Their\nfriends and governors must see that some vent for their explosive\ncomplexion is provided.  The roisters who are destined for infamy at\nhome, if sent to Mexico, will \"cover you with glory,\" and come back\nheroes and generals.  There are Oregons, Californias, and Exploring\nExpeditions enough appertaining to America, to find them in files to\ngnaw, and in crocodiles to eat.  The young English are fine animals,\nfull of blood, and when they have no wars to breathe their riotous\nvalors in, they seek for travels as dangerous as war, diving into\nMaelstroms; swimming Hellesponts; wading up the snowy Himmaleh; hunting\nlion, rhinoceros, elephant, in South Africa; gypsying with Borrow in\nSpain and Algiers; riding alligators in South America with Waterton;\nutilizing Bedouin, Sheik, and Pacha, with Layard; yachting among the\nicebergs of Lancaster Sound; peeping into craters on the equator; or\nrunning on the creases of Malays in Borneo.\nThe excess of virility has the same importance in general history, as in\nprivate and industrial life. Strong race or strong individual rests at\nlast on natural forces, which are best in the savage, who, like the\nbeasts around him, is still in reception of the milk from the teats of\nNature.  Cut off the connection between any of our works, and this\naboriginal source, and the work is shallow.  The people lean on this,\nand the mob is not quite so bad an argument as we sometimes say, for it\nhas this good side.  \"March without the people,\" said a French deputy\nfrom the tribune, \"and you march into night: their instincts are a\nfinger-pointing of Providence, always turned toward real benefit.  But\nwhen you espouse an Orleans party, or a Bourbon, or a Montalembert\nparty, or any other but an organic party, though you mean well, you have\na personality instead of a principle, which will inevitably drag you\ninto a corner.\"\nThe best anecdotes of this force are to be had from savage life, in\nexplorers, soldiers, and buccaneers.  But who cares for fallings-out of\nassassins, and fights of bears, or grindings of icebergs? Physical force\nhas no value, where there is nothing else.  Snow in snow-banks, fire in\nvolcanoes and solfataras is cheap.  The luxury of ice is in tropical\ncountries, and midsummer days.  The luxury of fire is, to have a little\non our hearth: and of electricity, not volleys of the charged cloud, but\nthe manageable stream on the battery-wires.  So of spirit, or energy;\nthe rests or remains of it in the civil and moral man, are worth all the\ncannibals in the Pacific.\nIn history, the great moment is, when the savage is just ceasing to be a\nsavage, with all his hairy Pelasgic strength directed on his opening\nsense of beauty:--and you have Pericles and Phidias,--not yet passed\nover into the Corinthian civility. Everything good in nature and the\nworld is in that moment of transition, when the swarthy juices still\nflow plentifully from nature, but their astringency or acridity is got\nout by ethics and humanity.\nThe triumphs of peace have been in some proximity to war.  Whilst the\nhand was still familiar with the sword-hilt, whilst the habits of the\ncamp were still visible in the port and complexion of the gentleman, his\nintellectual power culminated: the compression and tension of these\nstern conditions is a training for the finest and softest arts, and can\nrarely be compensated in tranquil times, except by some analogous vigor\ndrawn from occupations as hardy as war.\nWe say that success is constitutional; depends on a _plus_ condition of\nmind and body, on power of work, on courage: that it is of main efficacy\nin carrying on the world, and, though rarely found in the right state\nfor an article of commerce, but oftener in the supersaturate or excess,\nwhich makes it dangerous and destructive, yet it cannot be spared, and\nmust be had in that form, and absorbents provided to take off its edge.\nThe affirmative class monopolize the homage of mankind.  They originate\nand execute all the great feats.  What a force was coiled up in the\nskull of Napoleon!  Of the sixty thousand men making his army at Eylau,\nit seems some thirty thousand were thieves and burglars.  The men whom,\nin peaceful communities, we hold if we can, with iron at their legs, in\nprisons, under the muskets of sentinels, this man dealt with, hand to\nhand, dragged them to their duty, and won his victories by their\nbayonets.\nThis aboriginal might gives a surprising pleasure when it appears under\nconditions of supreme refinement, as in the proficients in high art.\nWhen Michel Angelo was forced to paint the Sistine Chapel in fresco, of\nwhich art he knew nothing, he went down into the Pope's gardens behind\nthe Vatican, and with a shovel dug out ochres, red and yellow, mixed\nthem with glue and water with his own hands, and having, after many\ntrials, at last suited himself, climbed his ladders, and painted away,\nweek after week, month after month, the sibyls and prophets.  He\nsurpassed his successors in rough vigor, as much as in purity of\nintellect and refinement.  He was not crushed by his one picture left\nunfinished at last.  Michel was wont to draw his figures first in\nskeleton, then to clothe them with flesh, and lastly to drape them.\n\"Ah!\" said a brave painter to me, thinking on these things, \"if a man\nhas failed, you will find he has dreamed instead of working.  There is\nno way to success in our art, but to take off your coat, grind paint,\nand work like a digger on the railroad, all day and every day.\"\nSuccess goes thus invariably with a certain plus or positive power: an\nounce of power must balance an ounce of weight.  And, though a man\ncannot return into his mother's womb, and be born with new amounts of\nvivacity, yet there are two economies, which are the best _succedanea_\nwhich the case admits.  The first is, the stopping off decisively our\nmiscellaneous activity, and concentrating our force on one or a few\npoints; as the gardener, by severe pruning, forces the sap of the tree\ninto one or two vigorous limbs, instead of suffering it to spindle into\na sheaf of twigs.\n\"Enlarge not thy destiny,\" said the oracle: \"endeavor not to do more\nthan is given thee in charge.\"  The one prudence in life is\nconcentration; the one evil is dissipation: and it makes no difference\nwhether our dissipations are coarse or fine; property and its cares,\nfriends, and a social habit, or politics, or music, or feasting.\nEverything is good which takes away one plaything and delusion more, and\ndrives us home to add one stroke of faithful work.  Friends, books,\npictures, lower duties, talents, flatteries, hopes,--all are\ndistractions which cause oscillations in our giddy balloon, and make a\ngood poise and a straight course impossible.  You must elect your work;\nyou shall take what your brain can, and drop all the rest.  Only so, can\nthat amount of vital force accumulate, which can make the step from\nknowing to doing.  No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has,\nthe step from knowing to doing is rarely taken.  'Tis a stop out of a\nchalk circle of imbecility into fruitfulness. Many an artist lacking\nthis, lacks all: he sees the masculine Angelo or Cellini with despair.\nHe, too, is up to Nature and the First Cause in his thought.  But the\nspasm to collect and swing his whole being into one act, he has not.\nThe poet Campbell said, that \"a man accustomed to work was equal to any\nachievement he resolved on, and, that, for himself, necessity not\ninspiration was the prompter of his muse.\"\nConcentration is the secret of strength in politics, in war, in trade,\nin short, in all management of human affairs.  One of the high anecdotes\nof the world is the reply of Newton to the inquiry, \"how he had been\nable to achieve his discoveries?\"--\"By always intending my mind.\"  Or if\nyou will have a text from politics, take this from Plutarch: \"There was,\nin the whole city, but one street in which Pericles was ever seen, the\nstreet which led to the market-place and the council house.  He declined\nall invitations to banquets, and all gay assemblies and company.  During\nthe whole period of his administration, he never dined at the table of a\nfriend.\"  Or if we seek an example from trade,--\"I hope,\" said a good\nman to Rothschild, \"your children are not too fond of money and\nbusiness: I am sure you would not wish that.\"--\"I am sure I should wish\nthat: I wish them to give mind, soul, heart, and body to business,--that\nis the way to be happy.  It requires a great deal of boldness and a\ngreat deal of caution, to make a great fortune, and when you have got\nit, it requires ten times as much wit to keep it.  If I were to listen\nto all the projects proposed to me, I should ruin myself very soon.\nStick to one business, young man.  Stick to your brewery, (he said this\nto young Buxton,) and you will be the great brewer of London.  Be\nbrewer, and banker, and merchant, and manufacturer, and you will soon be\nin the Gazette.\"\nMany men are knowing, many are apprehensive and tenacious, but they do\nnot rush to a decision. But in our flowing affairs a decision must be\nmade,--the best, if you can; but any is better than none.  There are\ntwenty ways of going to a point, and one is the shortest; but set out at\nonce on one.  A man who has that presence of mind which can bring to him\non the instant all he knows, is worth for action a dozen men who know as\nmuch, but can only bring it to light slowly.  The good Speaker in the\nHouse is not the man who knows the theory of parliamentary tactics, but\nthe man who decides off-hand.  The good judge is not he who does\nhair-splitting justice to every allegation, but who, aiming at\nsubstantial justice, rules something intelligible for the guidance of\nsuitors. The good lawyer is not the man who has an eye to every side and\nangle of contingency, and qualifies all his qualifications, but who\nthrows himself on your part so heartily, that he can get you out of a\nscrape.  Dr. Johnson said, in one of his flowing sentences, \"Miserable\nbeyond all names of wretchedness is that unhappy pair, who are doomed to\nreduce beforehand to the principles of abstract reason all the details\nof each domestic day.  There are cases where little can be said, and\nmuch must be done.\"\nThe second substitute for temperament is drill, the power of use and\nroutine.  The hack is a better roadster than the Arab barb.  In\nchemistry, the galvanic stream, slow, but continuous, is equal in power\nto the electric spark, and is, in our arts, a better agent.  So in human\naction, against the spasm of energy, we offset the continuity of drill.\nWe spread the same amount of force over much time, instead of condensing\nit into a moment.  'Tis the same ounce of gold here in a ball, and there\nin a leaf.  At West Point, Col. Buford, the chief engineer, pounded with\na hammer on the trunnions of a cannon, until he broke them off.  He\nfired a piece of ordnance some hundred times in swift succession, until\nit burst.  Now which stroke broke the trunnion? Every stroke.  Which\nblast burst the piece? Every blast.  \"_Diligence passe sens_\" Henry\nVIII. was wont to say, or, great is drill.  John Kemble said, that the\nworst provincial company of actors would go through a play better than\nthe best amateur company.  Basil Hall likes to show that the worst\nregular troops will beat the best volunteers.  Practice is nine tenths.\nA course of mobs is good practice for orators.  All the great speakers\nwere bad speakers at first. Stumping it through England for seven years,\nmade Cobden a consummate debater.  Stumping it through New England for\ntwice seven, trained Wendell Phillips.  The way to learn German, is, to\nread the same dozen pages over and over a hundred times, till you know\nevery word and particle in them, and can pronounce and repeat them by\nheart.  No genius can recite a ballad at first reading, so well as\nmediocrity can at the fifteenth or twentieth reading.  The rule for\nhospitality and Irish 'help,' is, to have the same dinner every day\nthroughout the year.  At last, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy learns to cook it to a\nnicety, the host learns to carve it, and the guests are well served.  A\nhumorous friend of mine thinks, that the reason why Nature is so perfect\nin her art, and gets up such inconceivably fine sunsets, is, that she\nhas learned how, at last, by dint of doing the same thing so very often.\nCannot one converse better on a topic on which he has experience, than\non one which is new?  Men whose opinion is valued on 'Change, are only\nsuch as have a special experience, and off that ground their opinion is\nnot valuable, \"More are made good by exercitation, than by nature,\" said\nDemocritus.  The friction in nature is so enormous that we cannot spare\nany power.  It is not question to express our thought, to elect our way,\nbut to overcome resistances of the medium and material in everything we\ndo.  Hence the use of drill, and the worthlessness of amateurs to cope\nwith practitioners.  Six hours every day at the piano, only to give\nfacility of touch; six hours a day at painting, only to give command of\nthe odious materials, oil, ochres, and brushes.  The masters say, that\nthey know a master in music, only by seeing the pose of the hands on the\nkeys;--so difficult and vital an act is the command of the instrument.\nTo have learned the use of the tools, by thousands of manipulations; to\nhave learned the arts of reckoning, by endless adding and dividing, is\nthe power of the mechanic and the clerk. I remarked in England, in\nconfirmation of a frequent experience at home, that, in literary\ncircles, the men of trust and consideration, bookmakers, editors,\nuniversity deans and professors, bishops, too, were by no means men of\nthe largest literary talent, but usually of a low and ordinary\nintellectuality, with a sort of mercantile activity and working talent.\nIndifferent hacks and mediocrities tower, by pushing their forces to a\nlucrative point, or by working power, over multitudes of superior men,\nin Old as in New England.\nI have not forgotten that there are sublime considerations which limit\nthe value of talent and superficial success.  We can easily overpraise\nthe vulgar hero.  There are sources on which we have not drawn.  I know\nwhat I abstain from.  I adjourn what I have to say on this topic to the\nchapters on Culture and Worship.  But this force or spirit, being the\nmeans relied on by Nature for bringing the work of the day about,--as\nfar as we attach importance to household life, and the prizes of the\nworld, we must respect that.  And I hold, that an economy may be applied\nto it; it is as much a subject of exact law and arithmetic as fluids and\ngases are; it may be husbanded, or wasted; every man is efficient only\nas he is a container or vessel of this force, and never was any signal\nact or achievement in history, but by this expenditure.  This is not\ngold, but the gold-maker; not the fame, but the exploit.\nIf these forces and this husbandry are within reach of our will, and the\nlaws of them can be read, we infer that all success, and all conceivable\nbenefit for man, is also, first or last, within his reach, and has its\nown sublime economies by which it may be attained.  The world is\nmathematical, and has no casualty, in all its vast and flowing curve.\nSuccess has no more eccentricity, than the gingham and muslin we weave\nin our mills.  I know no more affecting lesson to our busy, plotting New\nEngland brains, than to go into one of the factories with which we have\nlined all the watercourses in the States.  A man hardly knows how much\nhe is a machine, until he begins to make telegraph, loom, press, and\nlocomotive, in his own image.  But in these, he is forced to leave out\nhis follies and hindrances, so that when we go to the mill, the machine\nis more moral than we.  Let a man dare go to a loom, and see if he be\nequal to it.  Let machine confront machine, and see how they come out.\nThe world-mill is more complex than the calico-mill, and the architect\nstooped less.  In the gingham-mill, a broken thread or a shred spoils\nthe web through a piece of a hundred yards, and is traced back to the\ngirl that wove it, and lessens her wages.  The stockholder, on being\nshown this, rubs his hands with delight.  Are you so cunning, Mr.\nProfitless, and do you expect to swindle your master and employer, in\nthe web you weave?  A day is a more magnificent cloth than any muslin,\nthe mechanism that makes it is infinitely cunninger, and you shall not\nconceal the sleezy, fraudulent, rotten hours you have slipped into the\npiece, nor fear that any honest thread, or straighter steel, or more\ninflexible shaft, will not testify in the web.\nIII.\nWEALTH.\nWho shall tell what did befall,\nFar away in time, when once,\nOver the lifeless ball,\nHung idle stars and suns?\nWhat god the element obeyed?\nWings of what wind the lichen bore,\nWafting the puny seeds of power,\nWhich, lodged in rock, the rock abrade?\nAnd well the primal pioneer\nKnew the strong task to it assigned\nPatient through Heaven's enormous year\nTo build in matter home for mind.\nFrom air the creeping centuries drew\nThe matted thicket low and wide,\nThis must the leaves of ages strew\nThe granite slab to clothe and hide,\nEre wheat can wave its golden pride.\nWhat smiths, and in what furnace, rolled\n(In dizzy aeons dim and mute\nThe reeling brain can ill compute)\nCopper and iron, lead, and gold?\nWhat oldest star the fame can save\nOf races perishing to pave\nThe planet with a floor of lime?\nDust is their pyramid and mole:\nWho saw what ferns and palms were pressed\nUnder the tumbling mountain's breast,\nIn the safe herbal of the coal?\nBut when the quarried means were piled,\nAll is waste and worthless, till\nArrives the wise selecting will,\nAnd, out of slime and chaos, Wit\nDraws the threads of fair and fit.\nThen temples rose, and towns, and marts,\nThe shop of toil, the hall of arts;\nThen flew the sail across the seas\nTo feed the North from tropic trees;\nThe storm-wind wove, the torrent span,\nWhere they were bid the rivers ran;\nNew slaves fulfilled the poet's dream,\nGalvanic wire, strong-shouldered steam.\nThen docks were built, and crops were stored,\nAnd ingots added to the hoard.\nBut, though light-headed man forget,\nRemembering Matter pays her debt:\nStill, through her motes and masses, draw\nElectric thrills and ties of Law,\nWhich bind the strengths of Nature wild\nTo the conscience of a child.\nWEALTH.\nAs soon as a stranger is introduced into any company, one of the first\nquestions which all wish to have answered, is, How does that man get his\nliving?  And with reason.  He is no whole man until he knows how to earn\na blameless livelihood. Society is barbarous, until every industrious\nman can get his living without dishonest customs.\nEvery man is a consumer, and ought to be a producer.  He fails to make\nhis place good in the world, unless he not only pays his debt, but also\nadds something to the common wealth.  Nor can he do justice to his\ngenius, without making some larger demand on the world than a bare\nsubsistence.  He is by constitution expensive, and needs to be rich.\nWealth has its source in applications of the mind to nature, from the\nrudest strokes of spade and axe, up to the last secrets of art.\nIntimate ties subsist between thought and all production; because a\nbetter order is equivalent to vast amounts of brute labor.  The forces\nand the resistances are Nature's, but the mind acts in bringing things\nfrom where they abound to where they are wanted; in wise combining; in\ndirecting the practice of the useful arts, and in the creation of finer\nvalues, by fine art, by eloquence, by song, or the reproductions of\nmemory.  Wealth is in applications of mind to nature, and the art of\ngetting rich consists not in industry, much less in saving, but in a\nbetter order, in timeliness, in being at the right spot.  One man has\nstronger arms, or longer legs; another sees by the course of streams,\nand growth of markets, where land will be wanted, makes a clearing to\nthe river, goes to sleep, and wakes up rich.  Steam is no stronger now,\nthan it was a hundred years ago; but is put to better use.  A clever\nfellow was acquainted with the expansive force of steam; he also saw the\nwealth of wheat and grass rotting in Michigan.  Then he cunningly screws\non the steam-pipe to the wheat-crop.  Puff now, O Steam! The steam puffs\nand expands as before, but this time it is dragging all Michigan at its\nback to hungry New York and hungry England.  Coal lay in ledges under\nthe ground since the Flood, until a laborer with pick and windlass\nbrings it to the surface.  We may well call it black diamonds.  Every\nbasket is power and civilization.  For coal is a portable climate.  It\ncarries the heat of the tropics to Labrador and the polar circle: and it\nis the means of transporting itself whithersoever it is wanted. Watt and\nStephenson whispered in the ear of mankind their secret, that a\nhalf-ounce of coal will draw two tons a mile, and coal carries coal, by\nrail and by boat, to make Canada as warm as Calcutta, and with its\ncomfort brings its industrial power.\nWhen the farmer's peaches are taken from under the tree, and carried\ninto town, they have a new look, and a hundredfold value over the fruit\nwhich grew on the same bough, and lies fulsomely on the ground.  The\ncraft of the merchant is this bringing a thing from where it abounds, to\nwhere it is costly.\nWealth begins in a tight roof that keeps the rain and wind out; in a\ngood pump that yields you plenty of sweet water; in two suits of\nclothes, so to change your dress when you are wet; in dry sticks to\nburn; in a good double-wick lamp; and three meals; in a horse, or a\nlocomotive, to cross the land; in a boat to cross the sea; in tools to\nwork with; in books to read; and so, in giving, on all sides, by tools\nand auxiliaries, the greatest possible extension to our powers, as if it\nadded feet, and hands, and eyes, and blood, length to the day, and\nknowledge, and good-will.\nWealth begins with these articles of necessity. And here we must recite\nthe iron law which Nature thunders in these northern climates.  First,\nshe requires that each man should feed himself. If, happily, his fathers\nhave left him no inheritance, he must go to work, and by making his\nwants less, or his gains more, he must draw himself out of that state of\npain and insult in which she forces the beggar to lie.  She gives him no\nrest until this is done: she starves, taunts, and torments him, takes\naway warmth, laughter, sleep, friends, and daylight, until he has fought\nhis way to his own loaf.  Then, less peremptorily, but still with sting\nenough, she urges him to the acquisition of such things as belong to\nhim.  Every warehouse and shop-window, every fruit-tree, every thought\nof every hour, opens a new want to him, which it concerns his power and\ndignity to gratify.  It is of no use to argue the wants down: the\nphilosophers have laid the greatness of man in making his wants few; but\nwill a man content himself with a hut and a handful of dried pease?  He\nis born to be rich.  He is thoroughly related; and is tempted out by his\nappetites and fancies to the conquest of this and that piece of nature,\nuntil he finds his well-being in the use of his planet, and of more\nplanets than his own.  Wealth requires, besides the crust of bread and\nthe roof,--the freedom of the city, the freedom of the earth,\ntravelling, machinery, the benefits of science, music, and fine arts,\nthe best culture, and the best company.  He is the rich man who can\navail himself of all men's faculties.  He is the richest man who knows\nhow to draw a benefit from the labors of the greatest number of men, of\nmen in distant countries, and in past times.  The same correspondence\nthat is between thirst in the stomach, and water in the spring, exists\nbetween the whole of man and the whole of nature.  The elements offer\ntheir service to him.  The sea, washing the equator and the poles,\noffers its perilous aid, and the power and empire that follow it,--day\nby day to his craft and audacity.  \"Beware of me,\" it says, \"but if you\ncan hold me, I am the key to all the lands.\"  Fire offers, on its side,\nan equal power.  Fire, steam, lightning, gravity, ledges of rock, mines\nof iron, lead, quicksilver, tin, and gold; forests of all woods; fruits\nof all climates; animals of all habits; the powers of tillage; the\nfabrics of his chemic laboratory; the webs of his loom; the masculine\ndraught of his locomotive, the talismans of the machine-shop; all grand\nand subtile things, minerals, gases, ethers, passions, war, trade,\ngovernment, are his natural playmates, and, according to the excellence\nof the machinery in each human being, is his attraction for the\ninstruments he is to employ.  The world is his tool-chest, and he is\nsuccessful, or his education is carried on just so far, as is the\nmarriage of his faculties with nature, or, the degree in which he takes\nup things into himself.\nThe strong race is strong on these terms.  The Saxons are the merchants\nof the world; now, for a thousand years, the leading race, and by\nnothing more than their quality of personal independence, and, in its\nspecial modification, pecuniary independence. No reliance for bread and\ngames on the government, no clanship, no patriarchal style of living by\nthe revenues of a chief, no marrying-on,--no system of clientship suits\nthem; but every man must pay his scot.  The English are prosperous and\npeaceable, with their habit of considering that every man must take care\nof himself, and has himself to thank, if he do not maintain and improve\nhis position in society.\nThe subject of economy mixes itself with morals, inasmuch as it is a\nperemptory point of virtue that a man's independence be secured.\nPoverty demoralizes.  A man in debt is so far a slave; and Wall-street\nthinks it easy for a _millionaire_ to be a man of his word, a man of\nhonor, but, that, in failing circumstances, no man can be relied on to\nkeep his integrity.  And when one observes in the hotels and palaces of\nour Atlantic capitals, the habit of expense, the riot of the senses, the\nabsence of bonds, clanship, fellow-feeling of any kind, he feels, that,\nwhen a man or a woman is driven to the wall, the chances of integrity\nare frightfully diminished, as if virtue were coming to be a luxury\nwhich few could afford, or, as Burke said, \"at a market almost too high\nfor humanity.\"  He may fix his inventory of necessities and of\nenjoyments on what scale he pleases, but if he wishes the power and\nprivilege of thought, the chalking out his own career, and having\nsociety on his own terms, he must bring his wants within his proper\npower to satisfy.\nThe manly part is to do with might and main what you can do.  The world\nis full of fops who never did anything, and who have persuaded beauties\nand men of genius to wear their fop livery, and these will deliver the\nfop opinion, that it is not respectable to be seen earning a living;\nthat it is much more respectable to spend without earning; and this\ndoctrine of the snake will come also from the elect sons of light; for\nwise men are not wise at all hours, and will speak five times from their\ntaste or their humor, to once from their reason. The brave workman, who\nmight betray his feeling of it in his manners, if he do not succumb in\nhis practice, must replace the grace or elegance forfeited, by the merit\nof the work done.  No matter whether he make shoes, or statues, or laws.\nIt is the privilege of any human work which is well done to invest the\ndoer with a certain haughtiness. He can well afford not to conciliate,\nwhose faithful work will answer for him.  The mechanic at his bench\ncarries a quiet heart and assured manners, and deals on even terms with\nmen of any condition. The artist has made his picture so true, that it\ndisconcerts criticism.  The statue is so beautiful, that it contracts no\nstain from the market, but makes the market a silent gallery for itself.\nThe case of the young lawyer was pitiful to disgust,--a paltry matter of\nbuttons or tweezer-cases; but the determined youth saw in it an aperture\nto insert his dangerous wedges, made the insignificance of the thing\nforgotten, and gave fame by his sense and energy to the name and affairs\nof the Tittleton snuffbox factory.\nSociety in large towns is babyish, and wealth is made a toy.  The life\nof pleasure is so ostentatious, that a shallow observer must believe\nthat this is the agreed best use of wealth, and, whatever is pretended,\nit ends in cosseting.  But, if this were the main use of surplus\ncapital, it would bring us to barricades, burned towns, and tomahawks,\npresently.  Men of sense esteem wealth to be the assimilation of nature\nto themselves, the converting of the sap and juices of the planet to the\nincarnation and nutriment of their design.  Power is what they\nwant,--not candy;--power to execute their design, power to give legs and\nfeet, form and actuality to their thought, which, to a clear-sighted\nman, appears the end for which the Universe exists, and all its\nresources might be well applied. Columbus thinks that the sphere is a\nproblem for practical navigation, as well as for closet geometry, and\nlooks on all kings and peoples as cowardly landsmen, until they dare fit\nhim out.  Few men on the planet have more truly belonged to it.  But he\nwas forced to leave much of his map blank. His successors inherited his\nmap, and inherited his fury to complete it.\nSo the men of the mine, telegraph, mill, map, and survey,--the\nmonomaniacs, who talk up their project in marts, and offices, and\nentreat men to subscribe:--how did our factories get built? how did\nNorth America get netted with iron rails, except by the importunity of\nthese orators, who dragged all the prudent men in?  Is party the madness\nof many for the gain of a few?  This _speculative_ genius is the madness\nof few for the gain of the world.  The projectors are sacrificed, but\nthe public is the gainer.  Each of these idealists, working after his\nthought, would make it tyrannical, if he could.  He is met and\nantagonized by other speculators, as hot as he.  The equilibrium is\npreserved by these counteractions, as one tree keeps down another in the\nforest, that it may not absorb all the sap in the ground.  And the\nsupply in nature of railroad presidents, copper-miners,\ngrand-junctioners, smoke-burners, fire-annihilators, &c., is limited by\nthe same law which keeps the proportion in the supply of carbon, of\nalum, and of hydrogen.\nTo be rich is to have a ticket of admission to the master-works and\nchief men of each race.  It is to have the sea, by voyaging; to visit\nthe mountains, Niagara, the Nile, the desert, Rome, Paris,\nConstantinople; to see galleries, libraries, arsenals, manufactories.\nThe reader of Humboldt's \"Cosmos\" follows the marches of a man whose\neyes, ears, and mind are armed by all the science, arts, and implements\nwhich mankind have any where accumulated, and who is using these to add\nto the stock.  So is it with Denon, Beckford, Belzoni, Wilkinson,\nLayard, Kane, Lepsius, and Livingston.  \"The rich man,\" says Saadi, \"is\neverywhere expected and at home.\"  The rich take up something more of\nthe world into man's life. They include the country as well as the town,\nthe ocean-side, the White Hills, the Far West, and the old European\nhomesteads of man, in their notion of available material.  The world is\nhis, who has money to go over it.  He arrives at the sea-shore, and a\nsumptuous ship has floored and carpeted for him the stormy Atlantic, and\nmade it a luxurious hotel, amid the horrors of tempests.  The Persians\nsay, \"'Tis the same to him who wears a shoe, as if the whole earth were\ncovered with leather.\"\nKings are said to have long arms, but every man should have long arms,\nand should pluck his living, his instruments, his power, and his\nknowing, from the sun, moon, and stars.  Is not then the demand to be\nrich legitimate?  Yet, I have never seen a rich man.  I have never seen\na man as rich as all men ought to be, or, with an adequate command of\nnature.  The pulpit and the press have many commonplaces denouncing the\nthirst for wealth; but if men should take these moralists at their word,\nand leave off aiming to be rich, the moralists would rush to rekindle at\nall hazards this love of power in the people, lest civilization should\nbe undone.  Men are urged by their ideas to acquire the command over\nnature.  Ages derive a culture from the wealth of Roman Caesars, Leo\nTenths, magnificent Kings of France, Grand Dukes of Tuscany, Dukes of\nDevonshire, Townleys, Vernons, and Peels, in England; or whatever great\nproprietors.  It is the interest of all men, that there should be\nVaticans and Louvres full of noble works of art; British Museums, and\nFrench Gardens of Plants, Philadelphia Academies of Natural History,\nBodleian, Ambrosian, Royal, Congressional Libraries.  It is the interest\nof all that there should be Exploring Expeditions; Captain Cooks to\nvoyage round the world, Rosses, Franklins, Richardsons, and Kanes, to\nfind the magnetic and the geographic poles.  We are all richer for the\nmeasurement of a degree of latitude on the earth's surface.  Our\nnavigation is safer for the chart.  How intimately our knowledge of the\nsystem of the Universe rests on that!--and a true economy in a state or\nan individual will forget its frugality in behalf of claims like these.\nWhilst it is each man's interest, that, not only ease and convenience of\nliving, but also wealth or surplus product should exist somewhere, it\nneed not be in his hands.  Often it is very undesirable to him.  Goethe\nsaid well, \"nobody should be rich but those who understand it.\"  Some\nmen are born to own, and can animate all their possessions.  Others\ncannot: their owning is not graceful; seems to be a compromise of their\ncharacter: they seem to steal their own dividends.  They should own who\ncan administer; not they who hoard and conceal; not they who, the\ngreater proprietors they are, are only the greater beggars, but they\nwhose work carves out work for more, opens a path for all.  For he is\nthe rich man in whom the people are rich, and he is the poor man in whom\nthe people are poor: and how to give all access to the masterpieces of\nart and nature, is the problem of civilization.  The socialism of our\nday has done good service in setting men on thinking how certain\ncivilizing benefits, now only enjoyed by the opulent, can be enjoyed by\nall.  For example, the providing to each man the means and apparatus of\nscience, and of the arts.  There are many articles good for occasional\nuse, which few men are able to own. Every man wishes to see the ring of\nSaturn, the satellites and belts of Jupiter and Mars; the mountains and\ncraters in the moon: yet how few can buy a telescope! and of those,\nscarcely one would like the trouble of keeping it in order, and\nexhibiting it.  So of electrical and chemical apparatus, and many the\nlike things.  Every man may have occasion to consult books which he does\nnot care to possess, such as cyclopedias, dictionaries, tables, charts,\nmaps, and public documents: pictures also of birds, beasts, fishes,\nshells, trees, flowers, whose names he desires to know.\nThere is a refining influence from the arts of Design on a prepared\nmind, which is as positive as that of music, and not to be supplied from\nany other source.  But pictures, engravings, statues, and casts, beside\ntheir first cost, entail expenses, as of galleries and keepers for the\nexhibition; and the use which any man can make of them is rare, and\ntheir value, too, is much enhanced by the numbers of men who can share\ntheir enjoyment.  In the Greek cities, it was reckoned profane, that any\nperson should pretend a property in a work of art, which belonged to all\nwho could behold it.  I think sometimes,--could I only have music on my\nown terms;--could I live in a great city, and know where I could go\nwhenever I wished the ablution and inundation of musical waves,--that\nwere a bath and a medicine.\nIf properties of this kind were owned by states, towns, and lyceums,\nthey would draw the bonds of neighborhood closer.  A town would exist to\nan intellectual purpose.  In Europe, where the feudal forms secure the\npermanence of wealth in certain families, those families buy and\npreserve those things, and lay them open to the public.  But in America,\nwhere democratic institutions divide every estate into small portions,\nafter a few years, the public should step into the place of these\nproprietors, and provide this culture and inspiration for the citizen.\nMan was born to be rich, or, inevitably grows rich by the use of his\nfaculties; by the union of thought with nature.  Property is an\nintellectual production.  The game requires coolness, right reasoning,\npromptness, and patience in the players. Cultivated labor drives out\nbrute labor.  An infinite number of shrewd men, in infinite years, have\narrived at certain best and shortest ways of doing, and this accumulated\nskill in arts, cultures, harvestings, curings, manufactures,\nnavigations, exchanges, constitutes the worth of our world to-day.\nCommerce is a game of skill, which every man cannot play, which few men\ncan play well.  The right merchant is one who has the just average of\nfaculties we call _common sense_; a man of a strong affinity for facts,\nwho makes up his decision on what he has seen.  He is thoroughly\npersuaded of the truths of arithmetic.  There is always a reason, _in\nthe man_, for his good or bad fortune, and so, in making money.  Men\ntalk as if there were some magic about this, and believe in magic, in\nall parts of life.  He knows, that all goes on the old road, pound for\npound, cent for cent,--for every effect a perfect cause,--and that good\nluck is another name for tenacity of purpose.  He insures himself in\nevery transaction, and likes small and sure gains.  Probity and\ncloseness to the facts are the basis, but the masters of the art add a\ncertain long arithmetic.  The problem is, to combine many and remote\noperations, with the accuracy and adherence to the facts, which is easy\nin near and small transactions; so to arrive at gigantic results,\nwithout any compromise of safety.  Napoleon was fond of telling the\nstory of the Marseilles banker, who said to his visitor, surprised at\nthe contrast between the splendor of the banker's chateau and\nhospitality, and the meanness of the counting-room in which he had seen\nhim,--\"Young man, you are too young to understand how masses are\nformed,--the true and only power,--whether composed of money, water, or\nmen, it is all alike,--a mass is an immense centre of motion, but it\nmust be begun, it must be kept up:\"--and he might have added, that the\nway in which it must be begun and kept up, is, by obedience to the law\nof particles.\nSuccess consists in close appliance to the laws of the world, and, since\nthose laws are intellectual and moral, an intellectual and moral\nobedience. Political Economy is as good a book wherein to read the life\nof man, and the ascendency of laws over all private and hostile\ninfluences, as any Bible which has come down to us.\nMoney is representative, and follows the nature and fortunes of the\nowner.  The coin is a delicate meter of civil, social, and moral\nchanges.  The farmer is covetous of his dollar, and with reason. It is\nno waif to him.  He knows how many strokes of labor it represents.  His\nbones ache with the day's work that earned it.  He knows how much land\nit represents;--how much rain, frost, and sunshine.  He knows that, in\nthe dollar, he gives you so much discretion and patience, so much\nhoeing, and threshing.  Try to lift his dollar; you must lift all that\nweight.  In the city, where money follows the skit of a pen, or a lucky\nrise in exchange, it comes to be looked on as light.  I wish the farmer\nheld it dearer, and would spend it only for real bread; force for force.\nThe farmer's dollar is heavy, and the clerk's is light and nimble; leaps\nout of his pocket; jumps on to cards and faro-tables: but still more\ncurious is its susceptibility to metaphysical changes.  It is the finest\nbarometer of social storms, and announces revolutions.\nEvery step of civil advancement makes every man's dollar worth more.  In\nCalifornia, the country where it grew,--what would it buy?  A few years\nsince, it would buy a shanty, dysentery, hunger, bad company, and crime.\nThere are wide countries, like Siberia, where it would buy little else\nto-day, than some petty mitigation of suffering. In Rome, it will buy\nbeauty and magnificence. Forty years ago, a dollar would not buy much in\nBoston.  Now it will buy a great deal more in our old town, thanks to\nrailroads, telegraphs, steamers, and the contemporaneous growth of New\nYork, and the whole country.  Yet there are many goods appertaining to a\ncapital city, which are not yet purchasable here, no, not with a\nmountain of dollars. A dollar in Florida is not worth a dollar in\nMassachusetts.  A dollar is not value, but representative of value, and,\nat last, of moral values.  A dollar is rated for the corn it will buy,\nor to speak strictly, not for the corn or house-room, but for Athenian\ncorn, and Roman house-room,--for the wit, probity, and power, which we\neat bread and dwell in houses to share and exert.  Wealth is mental;\nwealth is moral.  The value of a dollar is, to buy just things: a dollar\ngoes on increasing in value with all the genius, and all the virtue of\nthe world.  A dollar in a university, is worth more than a dollar in a\njail; in a temperate, schooled, law-abiding community, than in some sink\nof crime, where dice, knives, and arsenic, are in constant play.\nThe \"Bank-Note Detector\" is a useful publication. But the current\ndollar, silver or paper, is itself the detector of the right and wrong\nwhere it circulates.  Is it not instantly enhanced by the increase of\nequity?  If a trader refuses to sell his vote, or adheres to some odious\nright, he makes so much more equity in Massachusetts; and every acre in\nthe State is more worth, in the hour of his action. If you take out of\nState-street the ten honestest merchants, and put in ten roguish\npersons, controlling the same amount of capital,--the rates of insurance\nwill indicate it; the soundness of banks will show it: the highways will\nbe less secure: the schools will feel it; the children will bring home\ntheir little dose of the poison: the judge will sit less firmly on the\nbench, and his decisions be less upright; he has lost so much support\nand constraint,--which all need; and the pulpit will betray it, in a\nlaxer rule of life.  An apple-tree, if you take out every day for a\nnumber of days, a load of loam, and put in a load of sand about its\nroots,--will find it out.  An apple-tree is a stupid kind of creature,\nbut if this treatment be pursued for a short time, I think it would\nbegin to mistrust something.  And if you should take out of the powerful\nclass engaged in trade a hundred good men, and put in a hundred bad, or,\nwhat is just the same thing, introduce a demoralizing institution, would\nnot the dollar, which is not much stupider than an apple-tree, presently\nfind it out?  The value of a dollar is social, as it is created by\nsociety. Every man who removes into this city, with any purchasable\ntalent or skill in him, gives to every man's labor in the city, a new\nworth.  If a talent is anywhere born into the world, the community of\nnations is enriched; and, much more, with a new degree of probity.  The\nexpense of crime, one of the principal charges of every nation, is so\nfar stopped.  In Europe, crime is observed to increase or abate with the\nprice of bread.  If the Rothschilds at Paris do not accept bills, the\npeople at Manchester, at Paisley, at Birmingham, are forced into the\nhighway, and landlords are shot down in Ireland.  The police records\nattest it.  The vibrations are presently felt in New York, New Orleans,\nand Chicago.  Not much otherwise, the economical power touches the\nmasses through the political lords.  Rothschild refuses the Russian\nloan, and there is peace, and the harvests are saved.  He takes it, and\nthere is war, and an agitation through a large portion of mankind, with\nevery hideous result, ending in revolution, and a new order.\nWealth brings with it its own checks and balances.  The basis of\npolitical economy is non-interference.  The only safe rule is found in\nthe self-adjusting meter of demand and supply.  Do not legislate.\nMeddle, and you snap the sinews with your sumptuary laws.  Give no\nbounties: make equal laws: secure life and property, and you need not\ngive alms.  Open the doors of opportunity to talent and virtue, and they\nwill do themselves justice, and property will not be in bad hands. In a\nfree and just commonwealth, property rushes from the idle and imbecile,\nto the industrious, brave, and persevering.\nThe laws of nature play through trade, as a toy-battery exhibits the\neffects of electricity.  The level of the sea is not more surely kept,\nthan is the equilibrium of value in society, by the demand and supply:\nand artifice or legislation punishes itself, by reactions, gluts, and\nbankruptcies.  The sublime laws play indifferently through atoms and\ngalaxies. Whoever knows what happens in the getting and spending of a\nloaf of bread and a pint of beer; that no wishing will change the\nrigorous limits of pints and penny loaves; that, for all that is\nconsumed, so much less remains in the basket and pot; but what is gone\nout of these is not wasted, but well spent, if it nourish his body, and\nenable him to finish his task;--knows all of political economy that the\nbudgets of empires can teach him.  The interest of petty economy is this\nsymbolization of the great economy; the way in which a house, and a\nprivate man's methods, tally with the solar system, and the laws of give\nand take, throughout nature; and, however wary we are of the falsehoods\nand petty tricks which we suicidally play off on each other, every man\nhas a certain satisfaction, whenever his dealing touches on the\ninevitable facts; when he sees that things themselves dictate the price,\nas they always tend to do, and, in large manufactures, are seen to do.\nYour paper is not fine or coarse enough,--is too heavy, or too thin.\nThe manufacturer says, he will furnish you with just that thickness or\nthinness you want; the pattern is quite indifferent to him; here is his\nschedule;--any variety of paper, as cheaper or dearer, with the prices\nannexed.  A pound of paper costs so much, and you may have it made up in\nany pattern you fancy.\nThere is in all our dealings a self-regulation that supersedes\nchaffering.  You will rent a house, but must have it cheap.  The owner\ncan reduce the rent, but so he incapacitates himself from making proper\nrepairs, and the tenant gets not the house he would have, but a worse\none; besides, that a relation a little injurious is established between\nlandlord and tenant.  You dismiss your laborer, saying, \"Patrick, I\nshall send for you as soon as I cannot do without you.\"  Patrick goes\noff contented, for he knows that the weeds will grow with the potatoes,\nthe vines must be planted, next week, and, however unwilling you may be,\nthe cantelopes, crook-necks, and cucumbers will send for him.  Who but\nmust wish that all labor and value should stand on the same simple and\nsurly market?  If it is the best of its kind, it will.  We must have\njoiner, locksmith, planter, priest, poet, doctor, cook, weaver, ostler;\neach in turn, through the year.\nIf a St. Michael's pear sells for a shilling, it costs a shilling to\nraise it.  If, in Boston, the best securities offer twelve _per cent._\nfor money, they have just six _per cent._ of insecurity.  You may not\nsee that the fine pear costs you a shilling, but it costs the community\nso much.  The shilling represents the number of enemies the pear has,\nand the amount of risk in ripening it.  The price of coal shows the\nnarrowness of the coal-field, and a compulsory confinement of the miners\nto a certain district.  All salaries are reckoned on contingent, as well\nas on actual services.  \"If the wind were always southwest by west,\"\nsaid the skipper, \"women might take ships to sea.\"  One might say, that\nall things are of one price; that nothing is cheap or dear; and that the\napparent disparities that strike us, are only a shopman's trick of\nconcealing the damage in your bargain.  A youth coming into the city\nfrom his native New Hampshire farm, with its hard fare still fresh in\nhis remembrance, boards at a first-class hotel, and believes he must\nsomehow have outwitted Dr. Franklin and Malthus, for luxuries are cheap.\nBut he pays for the one convenience of a better dinner, by the loss of\nsome of the richest social and educational advantages.  He has lost what\nguards! what incentives!  He will perhaps find by and by, that he left\nthe Muses at the door of the hotel, and found the Furies inside.  Money\noften costs too much, and power and pleasure are not cheap.  The ancient\npoet said, \"the gods sell all things at a fair price.\"\nThere is an example of the compensations in the commercial history of\nthis country.  When the European wars threw the carrying-trade of the\nworld, from 1800 to 1812, into American bottoms, a seizure was now and\nthen made of an American ship.  Of course, the loss was serious to the\nowner, but the country was indemnified; for we charged threepence a\npound for carrying cotton, sixpence for tobacco, and so on; which paid\nfor the risk and loss, and brought into the country an immense\nprosperity, early marriages, private wealth, the building of cities, and\nof states: and, after the war was over, we received compensation over\nand above, by treaty, for all the seizures.  Well, the Americans grew\nrich and great.  But the pay-day comes round.  Britain, France, and\nGermany, which our extraordinary profits had impoverished, send out,\nattracted by the fame of our advantages, first their thousands, then\ntheir millions, of poor people, to share the crop. At first, we employ\nthem, and increase our prosperity: but, in the artificial system of\nsociety and of protected labor, which we also have adopted and enlarged,\nthere come presently checks and stoppages.  Then we refuse to employ\nthese poor men. But they will not so be answered.  They go into the poor\nrates, and, though we refuse wages, we must now pay the same amount in\nthe form of taxes.  Again, it turns out that the largest proportion of\ncrimes are committed by foreigners.  The cost of the crime, and the\nexpense of courts, and of prisons, we must bear, and the standing army\nof preventive police we must pay.  The cost of education of the\nposterity of this great colony, I will not compute.  But the gross\namount of these costs will begin to pay back what we thought was a net\ngain from our transatlantic customers of 1800. It is vain to refuse this\npayment.  We cannot get rid of these people, and we cannot get rid of\ntheir will to be supported.  That has become an inevitable element of\nour politics; and, for their votes, each of the dominant parties courts\nand assists them to get it executed.  Moreover, we have to pay, not what\nwould have contented them at home, but what they have learned to think\nnecessary here; so that opinion, fancy, and all manner of moral\nconsiderations complicate the problem.\nThere are a few measures of economy which will bear to be named without\ndisgust; for the subject is tender, and we may easily have too much of\nit; and therein resembles the hideous animalcules of which our bodies\nare built up,--which, offensive in the particular, yet compose valuable\nand effective masses.  Our nature and genius force us to respect ends,\nwhilst we use means.  We must use the means, and yet, in our most\naccurate using, somehow screen and cloak them, as we can only give them\nany beauty, by a reflection of the glory of the end.  That is the good\nhead, which serves the end, and commands the means.  The rabble are\ncorrupted by their means: the means are too strong for them, and they\ndesert their end.\n1. The first of these measures is that each man's expense must proceed\nfrom his character.  As long as your genius buys, the investment is\nsafe, though you spend like a monarch.  Nature arms each man with some\nfaculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any\nother, and thus makes him necessary to society.  This native\ndetermination guides his labor and his spending.  He wants an equipment\nof means and tools proper to his talent.  And to save on this point,\nwere to neutralize the special strength and helpfulness of each mind. Do\nyour work, respecting the excellence of the work, and not its\nacceptableness.  This is so much economy, that, rightly read, it is the\nsum of economy.  Profligacy consists not in spending years of time or\nchests of money,--but in spending them off the line of your career.  The\ncrime which bankrupts men and states, is, job-work;--declining from your\nmain design, to serve a turn here or there. Nothing is beneath you, if\nit is in the direction of your life: nothing is great or desirable, if\nit is off from that.  I think we are entitled here to draw a straight\nline, and say, that society can never prosper, but must always be\nbankrupt, until every man does that which he was created to do.\nSpend for your expense, and retrench the expense which is not yours.\nAllston, the painter, was wont to say, that he built a plain house, and\nfilled it with plain furniture, because he would hold out no bribe to\nany to visit him, who had not similar tastes to his own.  We are\nsympathetic, and, like children, want everything we see.  But it is a\nlarge stride to independence,--when a man, in the discovery of his\nproper talent, has sunk the necessity for false expenses.  As the\nbetrothed maiden, by one secure affection, is relieved from a system of\nslaveries,--the daily inculcated necessity of pleasing all,--so the man\nwho has found what he can do, can spend on that, and leave all other\nspending.  Montaigne said, \"When he was a younger brother, he went brave\nin dress and equipage, but afterward his chateau and farms might answer\nfor him.\"  Let a man who belongs to the class of nobles, those, namely,\nwho have found out that they can do something, relieve himself of all\nvague squandering on objects not his.  Let the realist not mind\nappearances.  Let him delegate to others the costly courtesies and\ndecorations of social life.  The virtues are economists, but some of the\nvices are also. Thus, next to humility, I have noticed that pride is a\npretty good husband.  A good pride is, as I reckon it, worth from five\nhundred to fifteen hundred a year.  Pride is handsome, economical: pride\neradicates so many vices, letting none subsist but itself, that it seems\nas if it were a great gain to exchange vanity for pride.  Pride can go\nwithout domestics, without fine clothes, can live in a house with two\nrooms, can eat potato, purslain, beans, lyed corn, can work on the soil,\ncan travel afoot, can talk with poor men, or sit silent well-contented\nin fine saloons.  But vanity costs money, labor, horses, men, women,\nhealth, and peace, and is still nothing at last, a long way leading\nnowhere.--Only one drawback; proud people are intolerably selfish, and\nthe vain are gentle and giving.\nArt is a jealous mistress, and, if a man have a genius for painting,\npoetry, music, architecture, or philosophy, he makes a bad husband, and\nan ill provider, and should be wise in season, and not fetter himself\nwith duties which will embitter his days, and spoil him for his proper\nwork.  We had in this region, twenty years ago, among our educated men,\na sort of Arcadian fanaticism, a passionate desire to go upon the land,\nand unite farming to intellectual pursuits.  Many effected their\npurpose, and made the experiment, and some became downright ploughmen;\nbut all were cured of their faith that scholarship and practical\nfarming, (I mean, with one's own hands,) could be united.\nWith brow bent, with firm intent, the pale scholar leaves his desk to\ndraw a freer breath, and get a juster statement of his thought, in the\ngarden-walk. He stoops to pull up a purslain, or a dock, that is choking\nthe young corn, and finds there are two: close behind the last, is a\nthird; he reaches out his hand to a fourth; behind that, are four\nthousand and one.  He is heated and untuned, and, by and by, wakes up\nfrom his idiot dream of chickweed and red-root, to remember his morning\nthought, and to find, that, with his adamantine purposes, he has been\nduped by a dandelion.  A garden is like those pernicious machineries we\nread of, every month, in the newspapers, which catch a man's coat-skirt\nor his hand, and draw in his arm, his leg, and his whole body to\nirresistible destruction.  In an evil hour he pulled down his wall, and\nadded a field to his homestead.  No land is bad, but land is worse.  If\na man own land, the land owns him. Now let him leave home, if he dare.\nEvery tree and graft, every hill of melons, row of corn, or quickset\nhedge, all he has done, and all he means to do, stand in his way, like\nduns, when he would go out of his gate.  The devotion to these vines and\ntrees he finds poisonous.  Long free walks, a circuit of miles, free his\nbrain, and serve his body. Long marches are no hardship to him.  He\nbelieves he composes easily on the hills.  But this pottering in a few\nsquare yards of garden is dispiriting and drivelling.  The smell of the\nplants has drugged him, and robbed him of energy.  He finds a catalepsy\nin his bones.  He grows peevish and poor-spirited.  The genius of\nreading and of gardening are antagonistic, like resinous and vitreous\nelectricity.  One is concentrative in sparks and shocks: the other is\ndiffuse strength; so that each disqualifies its workman for the other's\nduties.\nAn engraver whose hands must be of an exquisite delicacy of stroke,\nshould not lay stone walls.  Sir David Brewster gives exact instructions\nfor microscopic observation:--\"Lie down on your back, and hold the\nsingle lens and object over your eye,\" &c. &c.  How much more the seeker\nof abstract truth, who needs periods of isolation, and rapt\nconcentration, and almost a going out of the body to think!\n2. Spend after your genius, _and by system_. Nature goes by rule, not by\nsallies and saltations. There must be system in the economies.  Saving\nand unexpensiveness will not keep the most pathetic family from ruin,\nnor will bigger incomes make free spending safe.  The secret of success\nlies never in the amount of money, but in the relation of income to\noutgo; as if, after expense has been fixed at a certain point, then new\nand steady rills of income, though never so small, being added, wealth\nbegins.  But in ordinary, as means increase, spending increases faster,\nso that, large incomes, in England and elsewhere, are found not to help\nmatters;--the eating quality of debt does not relax its voracity.  When\nthe cholera is in the potato, what is the use of planting larger crops?\nIn England, the richest country in the universe, I was assured by shrewd\nobservers, that great lords and ladies had no more guineas to give away\nthan other people; that liberality with money is as rare, and as\nimmediately famous a virtue as it is here.  Want is a growing giant whom\nthe coat of Have was never large enough to cover.  I remember in\nWarwickshire, to have been shown a fair manor, still in the same name as\nin Shakspeare's time.  The rent-roll, I was told, is some fourteen\nthousand pounds a year: but, when the second son of the late proprietor\nwas born, the father was perplexed how to provide for him.  The eldest\nson must inherit the manor; what to do with this supernumerary?  He was\nadvised to breed him for the Church, and to settle him in the\nrectorship, which was in the gift of the family; which was done.  It is\na general rule in that country, that bigger incomes do not help anybody.\nIt is commonly observed, that a sudden wealth, like a prize drawn in a\nlottery, or a large bequest to a poor family, does not permanently\nenrich.  They have served no apprenticeship to wealth, and, with the\nrapid wealth, come rapid claims: which they do not know how to deny, and\nthe treasure is quickly dissipated.\nA system must be in every economy, or the best single expedients are of\nno avail.  A farm is a good thing, when it begins and ends with itself,\nand does not need a salary, or a shop, to eke it out. Thus, the cattle\nare a main link in the chain-ring. If the non-conformist or aesthetic\nfarmer leaves out the cattle, and does not also leave out the want which\nthe cattle must supply, he must fill the gap by begging or stealing.\nWhen men now alive were born, the farm yielded everything that was\nconsumed on it.  The farm yielded no money, and the farmer got on\nwithout.  If he fell sick, his neighbors came in to his aid: each gave a\nday's work; or a half day; or lent his yoke of oxen, or his horse, and\nkept his work even: hoed his potatoes, mowed his hay, reaped his rye;\nwell knowing that no man could afford to hire labor, without selling his\nland.  In autumn, a farmer could sell an ox or a hog, and get a little\nmoney to pay taxes withal. Now, the farmer buys almost all he\nconsumes,--tin-ware, cloth, sugar, tea, coffee, fish, coal,\nrailroad-tickets, and newspapers.\nA master in each art is required, because the practice is never with\nstill or dead subjects, but they change in your hands.  You think\nfarm-buildings and broad acres a solid property: but its value is\nflowing like water.  It requires as much watching as if you were\ndecanting wine from a cask. The farmer knows what to do with it, stops\nevery leak, turns all the streamlets to one reservoir, and decants wine:\nbut a blunderhead comes out of Cornhill, tries his hand, and it all\nleaks away.  So is it with granite streets, or timber townships, as with\nfruit or flowers.  Nor is any investment so permanent, that it can be\nallowed to remain without incessant watching, as the history of each\nattempt to lock up an inheritance through two generations for an unborn\ninheritor may show.\nWhen Mr. Cockayne takes a cottage in the country, and will keep his cow,\nhe thinks a cow is a creature that is fed on hay, and gives a pail of\nmilk twice a day.  But the cow that he buys gives milk for three months;\nthen her bag dries up.  What to do with a dry cow? who will buy her?\nPerhaps he bought also a yoke of oxen to do his work; but they get blown\nand lame.  What to do with blown and lame oxen?  The farmer fats his,\nafter the spring-work is done, and kills them in the fall. But how can\nCockayne, who has no pastures, and leaves his cottage daily in the cars,\nat business hours, be pothered with fatting and killing oxen? He plants\ntrees; but there must be crops, to keep the trees in ploughed land.\nWhat shall be the crops?  He will have nothing to do with trees, but\nwill have grass.  After a year or two, the grass must be turned up and\nploughed: now what crops? Credulous Cockayne!\n3. Help comes in the custom of the country, and the rule of _Impera\nparendo_.  The rule is not to dictate, nor to insist on carrying out\neach of your schemes by ignorant wilfulness, but to learn practically\nthe secret spoken from all nature, that things themselves refuse to be\nmismanaged, and will show to the watchful their own law.  Nobody need\nstir hand or foot.  The custom of the country will do it all.  I know\nnot how to build or to plant; neither how to buy wood, nor what to do\nwith the house-lot, the field, or the wood-lot, when bought.  Never\nfear: it is all settled how it shall be, long beforehand, in the custom\nof the country, whether to sand, or whether to clay it, when to plough,\nand how to dress, whether to grass, or to corn; and you cannot help or\nhinder it.  Nature has her own best mode of doing each thing, and she\nhas somewhere told it plainly, if we will keep our eyes and ears open.\nIf not, she will not be slow in undeceiving us, when we prefer our own\nway to hers.  How often we must remember the art of the surgeon, which,\nin replacing the broken bone, contents itself with releasing the parts\nfrom false position; they fly into place by the action of the muscles.\nOn this art of nature all our arts rely.\nOf the two eminent engineers in the recent construction of railways in\nEngland, Mr. Brunel went straight from terminus to terminus, through\nmountains, over streams, crossing highways, cutting ducal estates in\ntwo, and shooting through this man's cellar, and that man's attic\nwindow, and so arriving at his end, at great pleasure to geometers, but\nwith cost to his company.  Mr. Stephenson, on the contrary, believing\nthat the river knows the way, followed his valley, as implicitly as our\nWestern Railroad follows the Westfield River, and turned out to be the\nsafest and cheapest engineer.  We say the cows laid out Boston.  Well,\nthere are worse surveyors.  Every pedestrian in our pastures has\nfrequent occasion to thank the cows for cutting the best path through\nthe thicket, and over the hills: and travellers and Indians know the\nvalue of a buffalo-trail, which is sure to be the easiest possible pass\nthrough the ridge.\nWhen a citizen, fresh from Dock-square, or Milk-street, comes out and\nbuys land in the country, his first thought is to a fine outlook from\nhis windows: his library must command a western view: a sunset every\nday, bathing the shoulder of Blue Hills, Wachusett, and the peaks of\nMonadnoc and Uncanoonuc.  What, thirty acres, and all this magnificence\nfor fifteen hundred dollars!  It would be cheap at fifty thousand.  He\nproceeds at once, his eyes dim with tears of joy, to fix the spot for\nhis corner-stone.  But the man who is to level the ground, thinks it\nwill take many hundred loads of gravel to fill the hollow to the road.\nThe stonemason who should build the well thinks he shall have to dig\nforty feet: the baker doubts he shall never like to drive up to the\ndoor: the practical neighbor cavils at the position of the barn; and the\ncitizen comes to know that his predecessor the farmer built the house in\nthe right spot for the sun and wind, the spring, and water-drainage, and\nthe convenience to the pasture, the garden, the field, and the road.  So\nDock-square yields the point, and things have their own way.  Use has\nmade the farmer wise, and the foolish citizen learns to take his\ncounsel.  From step to step he comes at last to surrender at discretion.\nThe farmer affects to take his orders; but the citizen says, You may ask\nme as often as you will, and in what ingenious forms, for an opinion\nconcerning the mode of building my wall, or sinking my well, or laying\nout my acre, but the ball will rebound to you.  These are matters on\nwhich I neither know, nor need to know anything.  These are questions\nwhich you and not I shall answer.\nNot less, within doors, a system settles itself paramount and tyrannical\nover master and mistress, servant and child, cousin and acquaintance.\n'Tis in vain that genius or virtue or energy of character strive and cry\nagainst it.  This is fate.  And 'tis very well that the poor husband\nreads in a book of a new way of living, and resolves to adopt it at\nhome: let him go home and try it, if he dare.\n4. Another point of economy is to look for seed of the same kind as you\nsow: and not to hope to buy one kind with another kind.  Friendship buys\nfriendship; justice, justice; military merit, military success.  Good\nhusbandry finds wife, children, and household.  The good merchant large\ngains, ships, stocks, and money.  The good poet fame, and literary\ncredit; but not either, the ether. Yet there is commonly a confusion of\nexpectations on these points.  Hotspur lives for the moment; praises\nhimself for it; and despises Furlong, that he does not.  Hotspur, of\ncourse, is poor; and Furlong a good provider.  The odd circumstance is,\nthat Hotspur thinks it a superiority in himself, this improvidence,\nwhich ought to be rewarded with Furlong's lands.\nI have not at all completed my design.  But we must not leave the topic,\nwithout casting one glance into the interior recesses.  It is a doctrine\nof philosophy, that man is a being of degrees; that there is nothing in\nthe world, which is not repeated in his body; his body being a sort of\nminiature or summary of the world: then that there is nothing in his\nbody, which is not repeated as in a celestial sphere in his mind: then,\nthere is nothing in his brain, which is not repeated in a higher sphere,\nin his moral system.\n5. Now these things are so in Nature.  All things ascend, and the royal\nrule of economy is, that it should ascend also, or, whatever we do must\nalways have a higher aim.  Thus it is a maxim, that money is another\nkind of blood.  _Pecunia alter sanguis_: or, the estate of a man is only\na larger kind of body, and admits of regimen analogous to his bodily\ncirculations.  So there is no maxim of the merchant, _e.g._, \"Best use\nof money is to pay debts;\" \"Every business by itself;\" \"Best time is\npresent time;\" \"The right investment is in tools of your trade;\" or the\nlike, which does not admit of an extended sense.  The counting-room\nmaxims liberally expounded are laws of the Universe.  The merchant's\neconomy is a coarse symbol of the soul's economy.  It is, to spend for\npower, and not for pleasure.  It is to invest income; that is to say, to\ntake up particulars into generals; days into integral eras,--literary,\nemotive, practical, of its life, and still to ascend in its investment.\nThe merchant has but one rule, _absorb and invest_: he is to be\ncapitalist: the scraps and filings must be gathered back into the\ncrucible; the gas and smoke must be burned, and earnings must not go to\nincrease expense, but to capital again.  Well, the man must be\ncapitalist.  Will he spend his income, or will he invest?  His body and\nevery organ is under the same law.  His body is a jar, in which the\nliquor of life is stored.  Will he spend for pleasure?  The way to ruin\nis short and facile.  Will he not spend, but hoard for power?  It passes\nthrough the sacred fermentations, by that law of Nature whereby\neverything climbs to higher platforms, and bodily vigor becomes mental\nand moral vigor.  The bread he eats is first strength and animal\nspirits: it becomes, in higher laboratories, imagery and thought; and in\nstill higher results, courage and endurance.  This is the right compound\ninterest; this is capital doubled, quadrupled, centupled; man raised to\nhis highest power.\nThe true thrift is always to spend on the higher plane; to invest and\ninvest, with keener avarice, that he may spend in spiritual creation,\nand not in augmenting animal existence.  Nor is the man enriched, in\nrepeating the old experiments of animal sensation, nor unless through\nnew powers and ascending pleasures, he knows himself by the actual\nexperience of higher good, to be already on the way to the highest.\nIV.\nCULTURE\nCan rules or tutors educate\nThe semigod whom we await?\nHe must be musical,\nTremulous, impressional,\nAlive to gentle influence\nOf landscape and of sky,\nAnd tender to the spirit-touch\nOf man's or maiden's eye:\nBut, to his native centre fast,\nShall into Future fuse the Past,\nAnd the world's flowing fates in his own mould recast.\nCULTURE.\nThe word of ambition at the present day is Culture.  Whilst all the\nworld is in pursuit of power, and of wealth as a means of power, culture\ncorrects the theory of success.  A man is the prisoner of his power.  A\ntopical memory makes him an almanac; a talent for debate, a disputant;\nskill to get money makes him a miser, that is, a beggar.  Culture\nreduces these inflammations by invoking the aid of other powers against\nthe dominant talent, and by appealing to the rank of powers.  It watches\nsuccess.  For performance, Nature has no mercy, and sacrifices the\nperformer to get it done; makes a dropsy or a tympany of him.  If she\nwants a thumb, she makes one at the cost of arms and legs, and any\nexcess of power in one part is usually paid for at once by some defect\nin a contiguous part.\nOur efficiency depends so much on our concentration, that Nature usually\nin the instances where a marked man is sent into the world, overloads\nhim with bias, sacrificing his symmetry to his working power.  It is\nsaid, no man can write but one book; and if a man have a defect, it is\napt to leave its impression on all his performances.  If she creates a\npoliceman like Fouche, he is made up of suspicions and of plots to\ncircumvent them.  \"The air,\" said Fouche, \"is full of poniards.\"  The\nphysician Sanctorius spent his life in a pair of scales, weighing his\nfood.  Lord Coke valued Chaucer highly, because the Canon Yeman's Tale\nillustrates the statute _Hen. V. Chap._ 4, against alchemy.  I saw a man\nwho believed the principal mischiefs in the English state were derived\nfrom the devotion to musical concerts.  A freemason, not long since, set\nout to explain to this country, that the principal cause of the success\nof General Washington, was, the aid he derived from the freemasons.\nBut worse than the harping on one string, Nature has secured\nindividualism, by giving the private person a high conceit of his weight\nin the system. The pest of society is egotists.  There are dull and\nbright, sacred and profane, coarse and fine egotists. 'Tis a disease\nthat, like influenza, falls on all constitutions.  In the distemper\nknown to physicians as _chorea_, the patient sometimes turns round, and\ncontinues to spin slowly on one spot.  Is egotism a metaphysical\nvarioloid of this malady?  The man runs round a ring formed by his own\ntalent, falls into an admiration of it, and loses relation to the world.\nIt is a tendency in all minds.  One of its annoying forms, is a craving\nfor sympathy.  The sufferers parade their miseries, tear the lint from\ntheir bruises, reveal their indictable crimes, that you may pity them.\nThey like sickness, because physical pain will extort some show of\ninterest from the bystanders, as we have seen children, who, finding\nthemselves of no account when grown people come in, will cough till they\nchoke, to draw attention.\nThis distemper is the scourge of talent,--of artists, inventors, and\nphilosophers.  Eminent spiritualists shall have an incapacity of putting\ntheir act or word aloof from them, and seeing it bravely for the nothing\nit is.  Beware of the man who says, \"I am on the eve of a revelation.\"\nIt is speedily punished, inasmuch as this habit invites men to humor it,\nand by treating the patient tenderly, to shut him up in a narrower\nselfism, and exclude him from the great world of God's cheerful fallible\nmen and women.  Let us rather be insulted, whilst we are insultable.\nReligious literature has eminent examples, and if we run over our\nprivate list of poets, critics, philanthropists, and philosophers, we\nshall find them infected with this dropsy and elephantiasis, which we\nought to have tapped.\nThis goitre of egotism is so frequent among notable persons, that we\nmust infer some strong necessity in nature which it subserves; such as\nwe see in the sexual attraction.  The preservation of the species was a\npoint of such necessity, that Nature has secured it at all hazards by\nimmensely overloading the passion, at the risk of perpetual crime and\norder.  So egotism has its root in the cardinal necessity by which each\nindividual persists to be what he is.\nThis individuality is not only not inconsistent with culture, but is the\nbasis of it.  Every valuable nature is there in its own right, and the\nstudent we speak to must have a motherwit invincible by his culture,\nwhich uses all books, arts, facilities, and elegancies of intercourse,\nbut is never subdued and lost in them.  He only is a well-made man who\nhas a good determination.  And the end of culture is not to destroy\nthis, God forbid! but to train away all impediment and mixture, and\nleave nothing but pure power.  Our student must have a style and\ndetermination, and be a master in his own specialty. But, having this,\nhe must put it behind him.  He must have a catholicity, a power to see\nwith a free and disengaged look every object.  Yet is this private\ninterest and self so overcharged, that, if a man seeks a companion who\ncan look at objects for their own sake, and without affection or\nself-reference, he will find the fewest who will give him that\nsatisfaction; whilst most men are afflicted with a coldness, an\nincuriosity, as soon as any object does not connect with their\nself-love.  Though they talk of the object before them, they are\nthinking of themselves, and their vanity is laying little traps for your\nadmiration.\nBut after a man has discovered that there are limits to the interest\nwhich his private history has for mankind, he still converses with his\nfamily, or a few companions,--perhaps with half a dozen personalities\nthat are famous in his neighborhood.  In Boston, the question of life is\nthe names of some eight or ten men.  Have you seen Mr. Allston, Doctor\nChanning, Mr. Adams, Mr. Webster, Mr. Greenough?  Have you heard\nEverett, Garrison, Father Taylor, Theodore Parker?  Have you talked with\nMessieurs Turbinewheel, Summitlevel, and Lacofrupees?  Then you may as\nwell die.  In New York, the question is of some other eight, or ten, or\ntwenty.  Have you seen a few lawyers, merchants, and brokers,--two or\nthree scholars, two or three capitalists, two or three editors of\nnewspapers?  New York is a sucked orange.  All conversation is at an\nend, when we have discharged ourselves of a dozen personalities,\ndomestic or imported, which make up our American existence. Nor do we\nexpect anybody to be other than a faint copy of these heroes.\nLife is very narrow.  Bring any club or company of intelligent men\ntogether again after ten years, and if the presence of some penetrating\nand calming genius could dispose them to frankness, what a confession of\ninsanities would come up!  The \"causes\" to which we have sacrificed,\nTariff or Democracy, Whigism or Abolition, Temperance or Socialism,\nwould show like roots of bitterness and dragons of wrath: and our\ntalents are as mischievous as if each had been seized upon by some bird\nof prey, which had whisked him away from fortune, from truth, from the\ndear society of the poets, some zeal, some bias, and only when he was,\nnow gray and nerveless, was it relaxing its claws, and he awaking to\nsober perceptions.\nCulture is the suggestion from certain best thoughts, that a man has a\nrange of affinities, through which he can modulate the violence of any\nmaster-tones that have a droning preponderance in his scale, and succor\nhim against himself.  Culture redresses his balance, puts him among his\nequals and superiors, revives the delicious sense of sympathy, and warns\nhim of the dangers of solitude and repulsion.\n'Tis not a compliment but a disparagement to consult a man only on\nhorses, or on steam, or on theatres, or on eating, or on books, and,\nwhenever he appears, considerately to turn the conversation to the\nbantling he is known to fondle.  In the Norse heaven of our forefathers,\nThor's house had five hundred and forty floors; and man's house has five\nhundred and forty floors.  His excellence is facility of adaptation and\nof transition through many related points, to wide contrasts and\nextremes.  Culture kills his exaggeration, his conceit of his village or\nhis city.  We must leave our pets at home, when we go into the street,\nand meet men on broad grounds of good meaning and good sense. No\nperformance is worth loss of geniality.  'Tis a cruel price we pay for\ncertain fancy goods called fine arts and philosophy.  In the Norse\nlegend, Allfadir did not get a drink of Mimir's spring, (the fountain of\nwisdom,) until he left his eye in pledge.  And here is a pedant that\ncannot unfold his wrinkles, nor conceal his wrath at interruption by the\nbest, if their conversation do not fit his impertinency,--here is he to\nafflict us with his personalities.  'Tis incident to scholars, that each\nof them fancies he is pointedly odious in his community. Draw him out of\nthis limbo of irritability. Cleanse with healthy blood his parchment\nskin. You restore to him his eyes which he left in pledge at Mimir's\nspring.  If you are the victim of your doing, who cares what you do?  We\ncan spare your opera, your gazetteer, your chemic analysis, your\nhistory, your syllogisms.  Your man of genius pays dear for his\ndistinction.  His head runs up into a spire, and instead of a healthy\nman, merry and wise, he is some mad dominie.  Nature is reckless of the\nindividual.  When she has points to carry, she carries them.  To wade in\nmarshes and sea-margins is the destiny of certain birds, and they are so\naccurately made for this, that they are imprisoned in those places.\nEach animal out of its _habitat_ would starve.  To the physician, each\nman, each woman, is an amplification of one organ.  A soldier, a\nlocksmith, a bank-clerk, and a dancer could not exchange functions.  And\nthus we are victims of adaptation.\nThe antidotes against this organic egotism, are, the range and variety\nof attractions, as gained by acquaintance with the world, with men of\nmerit, with classes of society, with travel, with eminent persons, and\nwith the high resources of philosophy, art, and religion: books, travel,\nsociety, solitude.\nThe hardiest skeptic who has seen a horse broken, a pointer trained, or,\nwho has visited a menagerie, or the exhibition of the Industrious Fleas,\nwill not deny the validity of education.  \"A boy,\" says Plato, \"is the\nmost vicious of all wild beasts;\" and, in the same spirit, the old\nEnglish poet Gascoigne says, \"a boy is better unborn than untaught.\"\nThe city breeds one kind of speech and manners; the back-country a\ndifferent style; the sea, another; the army, a fourth.  We know that an\narmy which can be confided in, may be formed by discipline; that, by\nsystematic discipline all men may be made heroes: Marshal Lannes said to\na French officer, \"Know, Colonel, that none but a poltroon will boast\nthat he never was afraid.\"  A great part of courage is the courage of\nhaving done the thing before.  And, in all human action, those faculties\nwill be strong which are used.  Robert Owen said, \"Give me a tiger, and\nI will educate him.\"  'Tis inhuman to want faith in the power of\neducation, since to meliorate, is the law of nature; and men are valued\nprecisely as they exert onward or meliorating force.  On the other hand,\npoltroonery is the acknowledging an inferiority to be incurable.\nIncapacity of melioration is the only mortal distemper.  There are\npeople who can never understand a trope, or any second or expanded sense\ngiven to your words, or any humor; but remain literalists, after hearing\nthe music, and poetry, and rhetoric, and wit, of seventy or eighty\nyears.  They are past the help of surgeon or clergy.  But even these can\nunderstand pitchforks and the cry of fire! and I have noticed in some of\nthis class a marked dislike of earthquakes.\nLet us make our education brave and preventive. Politics is an\nafter-work, a poor patching.  We are always a little late.  The evil is\ndone, the law is passed, and we begin the up-hill agitation for repeal\nof that of which we ought to have prevented the enacting.  We shall one\nday learn to supersede politics by education.  What we call our\nroot-and-branch reforms of slavery, war, gambling, intemperance, is only\nmedicating the symptoms.  We must begin higher up, namely, in Education.\nOur arts and tools give to him who can handle them much the same\nadvantage over the novice, as if you extended his life, ten, fifty, or a\nhundred years.  And I think it the part of good sense to provide every\nfine soul with such culture, that it shall not, at thirty or forty\nyears, have to say, \"This which I might do is made hopeless through my\nwant of weapons.\"\nBut it is conceded that much of our training fails of effect; that all\nsuccess is hazardous and rare; that a large part of our cost and pains\nis thrown away.  Nature takes the matter into her own hands, and, though\nwe must not omit any jot of our system, we can seldom be sure that it\nhas availed much, or, that as much good would not have accrued from a\ndifferent system.\nBooks, as containing the finest records of human wit, must always enter\ninto our notion of culture. The best heads that ever existed, Pericles,\nPlato, Julius Caesar, Shakspeare, Goethe, Milton, were well-read,\nuniversally educated men, and quite too wise to undervalue letters.\nTheir opinion has weight, because they had means of knowing the opposite\nopinion.  We look that a great man should be a good reader, or, in\nproportion to the spontaneous power should be the assimilating power.\nGood criticism is very rare, and always precious. I am always happy to\nmeet persons who perceive the transcendent superiority of Shakspeare\nover all other writers.  I like people who like Plato. Because this love\ndoes not consist with self-conceit.\nBut books are good only as far as a boy is ready for them.  He sometimes\ngets ready very slowly. You send your child to the schoolmaster, but\n'tis the schoolboys who educate him.  You send him to the Latin class,\nbut much of his tuition comes, on his way to school, from the\nshop-windows.  You like the strict rules and the long terms; and he\nfinds his best leading in a by-way of his own, and refuses any\ncompanions but of his choosing.  He hates the grammar and _Gradus_, and\nloves guns, fishing-rods, horses, and boats.  Well, the boy is right;\nand you are not fit to direct his bringing up, if your theory leaves out\nhis gymnastic training. Archery, cricket, gun and fishing-rod, horse and\nboat, are all educators, liberalizers; and so are dancing, dress, and\nthe street-talk; and,--provided only the boy has resources, and is of a\nnoble and ingenuous strain,--these will not serve him less than the\nbooks.  He learns chess, whist, dancing, and theatricals.  The father\nobserves that another boy has learned algebra and geometry in the same\ntime.  But the first boy has acquired much more than these poor games\nalong with them.  He is infatuated for weeks with whist and chess; but\npresently will find out, as you did, that when he rises from the game\ntoo long played, he is vacant and forlorn, and despises himself.\nThenceforward it takes place with other things, and has its due weight\nin his experience.  These minor skills and accomplishments, for example,\ndancing, are tickets of admission to the dress-circle of mankind, and\nthe being master of them enables the youth to judge intelligently of\nmuch, on which, otherwise, he would give a pedantic squint.  Landor\nsaid, \"I have suffered more from my bad dancing, than from all the\nmisfortunes and miseries of my life put together.\"  Provided always the\nboy is teachable, (for we are not proposing to make a statue out of\npunk,) football, cricket, archery, swimming, skating, climbing, fencing,\nriding, are lessons in the art of power, which it is his main business\nto learn;--riding, specially, of which Lord Herbert of Cherbury said, \"a\ngood rider on a good horse is as much above himself and others as the\nworld can make him.\"  Besides, the gun, fishing-rod, boat, and horse,\nconstitute, among all who use them, secret freemasonries.  They are as\nif they belonged to one club.\nThere is also a negative value in these arts. Their chief use to the\nyouth, is, not amusement, but to be known for what they are, and not to\nremain to him occasions of heart-burn.  We are full of superstitions.\nEach class fixes its eyes on the advantages it has not; the refined, on\nrude strength; the democrat, on birth and breeding.  One of the benefits\nof a college education is, to show the boy its little avail.  I knew a\nleading man in a leading city, who, having set his heart on an education\nat the university, and missed it, could never quite feel himself the\nequal of his own brothers who had gone thither.  His easy superiority to\nmultitudes of professional men could never quite countervail to him this\nimaginary defect.  Balls, riding, wine-parties, and billiards, pass to a\npoor boy for something fine and romantic, which they are not; and a free\nadmission to them on an equal footing, if it were possible, only once or\ntwice, would be worth ten times its cost, by undeceiving him.\nI am not much an advocate for travelling, and I observe that men run\naway to other countries, because they are not good in their own, and run\nback to their own, because they pass for nothing in the new places.  For\nthe most part, only the light characters travel.  Who are you that have\nno task to keep you at home?  I have been quoted as saying captious\nthings about travel; but I mean to do justice.  I think, there is a\nrestlessness in our people, which argues want of character.  All\neducated Americans, first or last, go to Europe;--perhaps, because it is\ntheir mental home, as the invalid habits of this country might suggest.\nAn eminent teacher of girls said, \"the idea of a girl's education, is,\nwhatever qualifies them for going to Europe.\"  Can we never extract this\ntape-worm of Europe from the brain of our countrymen?  One sees very\nwell what their fate must be.  He that does not fill a place at home,\ncannot abroad.  He only goes there to hide his insignificance in a\nlarger crowd.  You do not think you will find anything there which you\nhave not seen at home?  The stuff of all countries is just the same.  Do\nyou suppose, there is any country where they do not scald milkpans, and\nswaddle the infants, and burn the brushwood, and broil the fish? What is\ntrue anywhere is true everywhere.  And let him go where he will, he can\nonly find so much beauty or worth as he carries.\nOf course, for some men, travel may be useful. Naturalists, discoverers,\nand sailors are born.  Some men are made for couriers, exchangers,\nenvoys, missionaries, bearers of despatches, as others are for farmers\nand working-men.  And if the man is of a light and social turn, and\nNature has aimed to make a legged and winged creature, framed for\nlocomotion, we must follow her hint, and furnish him with that breeding\nwhich gives currency, as sedulously as with that which gives worth.  But\nlet us not be pedantic, but allow to travel its full effect. The boy\ngrown up on the farm, which he has never left, is said in the country to\nhave had no chance, and boys and men of that condition look upon work on\na railroad, or drudgery in a city, as opportunity. Poor country boys of\nVermont and Connecticut formerly owed what knowledge they had, to their\npeddling trips to the Southern States.  California and the Pacific Coast\nis now the university of this class, as Virginia was in old times.  'To\nhave some chance' is their word.  And the phrase 'to know the world,' or\nto travel, is synonymous with all men's ideas of advantage and\nsuperiority.  No doubt, to a man of sense, travel offers advantages. As\nmany languages as he has, as many friends, as many arts and trades, so\nmany times is he a man. A foreign country is a point of comparison,\nwherefrom to judge his own.  One use of travel, is, to recommend the\nbooks and works of home; [we go to Europe to be Americanized;] and\nanother, to find men.  For, as Nature has put fruits apart in latitudes,\na new fruit in every degree, so knowledge and fine moral quality she\nlodges in distant men. And thus, of the six or seven teachers whom each\nman wants among his contemporaries, it often happens, that one or two of\nthem live on the other side of the world.\nMoreover, there is in every constitution a certain solstice, when the\nstars stand still in our inward firmament, and when there is required\nsome foreign force, some diversion or alterative to prevent stagnation.\nAnd, as a medical remedy, travel seems one of the best.  Just as a man\nwitnessing the admirable effect of ether to lull pain, and meditating on\nthe contingencies of wounds, cancers, lockjaws, rejoices in Dr.\nJackson's benign discovery, so a man who looks at Paris, at Naples, or\nat London, says, 'If I should be driven from my own home, here, at\nleast, my thoughts can be consoled by the most prodigal amusement and\noccupation which the human race in ages could contrive and accumulate.'\nAkin to the benefit of foreign travel, the aesthetic value of railroads\nis to unite the advantages of town and country life, neither of which we\ncan spare. A man should live in or near a large town, because, let his\nown genius be what it may, it will repel quite as much of agreeable and\nvaluable talent as it draws, and, in a city, the total attraction of all\nthe citizens is sure to conquer, first or last, every repulsion, and\ndrag the most improbable hermit within its walls some day in the year.\nIn town, he can find the swimming-school, the gymnasium, the\ndancing-master, the shooting-gallery, opera, theatre, and panorama; the\nchemist's shop, the museum of natural history; the gallery of fine arts;\nthe national orators, in their turn; foreign travellers, the libraries,\nand his club.  In the country, he can find solitude and reading, manly\nlabor, cheap living, and his old shoes; moors for game, hills for\ngeology, and groves for devotion.  Aubrey writes, \"I have heard Thomas\nHobbes say, that, in the Earl of Devon's house, in Derbyshire, there was\na good library and books enough for him, and his lordship stored the\nlibrary with what books he thought fit to be bought.  But the want of\ngood conversation was a very great inconvenience, and, though he\nconceived he could order his thinking as well as another, yet he found a\ngreat defect.  In the country, in long time, for want of good\nconversation, one's understanding and invention contract a moss on them,\nlike an old paling in an orchard.\"\nCities give us collision.  'Tis said, London and New York take the\nnonsense out of a man.  A great part of our education is sympathetic and\nsocial.  Boys and girls who have been brought up with well-informed and\nsuperior people, show in their manners an inestimable grace.  Fuller\nsays, that \"William, Earl of Nassau, won a subject from the King of\nSpain, every time he put off his hat.\"  You cannot have one well-bred\nman, without a whole society of such.  They keep each other up to any\nhigh point.  Especially women;--it requires a great many cultivated\nwomen,--saloons of bright, elegant, reading women, accustomed to ease\nand refinement, to spectacles, pictures, sculpture, poetry, and to\nelegant society, in order that you should have one Madame de Stael.  The\nhead of a commercial house, or a leading lawyer or politician is brought\ninto daily contact with troops of men from all parts of the country, and\nthose too the driving-wheels, the business men of each section, and one\ncan hardly suggest for an apprehensive man a more searching culture.\nBesides, we must remember the high social possibilities of a million of\nmen.  The best bribe which London offers to-day to the imagination, is,\nthat, in such a vast variety of people and conditions, one can believe\nthere is room for persons of romantic character to exist, and that the\npoet, the mystic, and the hero may hope to confront their counterparts.\nI wish cities could teach their best lesson,--of quiet manners.  It is\nthe foible especially of American youth,--pretension.  The mark of the\nman of the world is absence of pretension.  He does not make a speech;\nhe takes a low business-tone, avoids all brag, is nobody, dresses\nplainly, promises not at all, performs much, speaks in monosyllables,\nhugs his fact.  He calls his employment by its lowest name, and so takes\nfrom evil tongues their sharpest weapon.  His conversation clings to the\nweather and the news, yet he allows himself to be surprised into\nthought, and the unlocking of his learning and philosophy.  How the\nimagination is piqued by anecdotes of some great man passing incognito,\nas a king in gray clothes,--of Napoleon affecting a plain suit at his\nglittering levee; of Burns, or Scott, or Beethoven, or Wellington, or\nGoethe, or any container of transcendent power, passing for nobody; of\nEpaminondas, \"who never says anything, but will listen eternally;\" of\nGoethe, who preferred trifling subjects and common expressions in\nintercourse with strangers, worse rather than better clothes, and to\nappear a little more capricious than he was.  There are advantages in\nthe old hat and box-coat.  I have heard, that, throughout this country,\na certain respect is paid to good broadcloth; but dress makes a little\nrestraint: men will not commit themselves.  But the box-coat is like\nwine; it unlocks the tongue, and men say what they think.  An old poet\nsays,\n\"Go far and go sparing,\nFor you'll find it certain,\nThe poorer and the baser you appear,\nThe more you'll look through still.\"[2]\n[2] Beaumont and Fletcher: _The Tamer Tamed_.\nNot much otherwise Milnes writes, in the \"Lay of the Humble,\"\n\"To me men are for what they are,\nThey wear no masks with me.\"\n'Tis odd that our people should have--not water on the brain,--but a\nlittle gas there.  A shrewd foreigner said of the Americans, that,\n\"whatever they say has a little the air of a speech.\"  Yet one of the\ntraits down in the books as distinguishing the Anglo-Saxon, is, a trick\nof self-disparagement.  To be sure, in old, dense countries, among a\nmillion of good coats, a fine coat comes to be no distinction, and you\nfind humorists.  In an English party, a man with no marked manners or\nfeatures, with a face like red dough, unexpectedly discloses wit,\nlearning, a wide range of topics, and personal familiarity with good men\nin all parts of the world, until you think you have fallen upon some\nillustrious personage.  Can it be that the American forest has refreshed\nsome weeds of old Pictish barbarism just ready to die out,--the love of\nthe scarlet feather, of beads, and tinsel?  The Italians are fond of red\nclothes, peacock plumes, and embroidery; and I remember one rainy\nmorning in the city of Palermo, the street was in a blaze with scarlet\numbrellas.  The English have a plain taste.  The equipages of the\ngrandees are plain.  A gorgeous livery indicates new and awkward city\nwealth. Mr. Pitt, like Mr. Pym, thought the title of _Mister_ good\nagainst any king in Europe.  They have piqued themselves on governing\nthe whole world in the poor, plain, dark Committee-room which the House\nof Commons sat in, before the fire.\nWhilst we want cities as the centres where the best things are found,\ncities degrade us by magnifying trifles.  The countryman finds the town\na chophouse, a barber's shop.  He has lost the lines of grandeur of the\nhorizon, hills and plains, and with them, sobriety and elevation.  He\nhas come among a supple, glib-tongued tribe, who live for show, servile\nto public opinion.  Life is dragged down to a fracas of pitiful cares\nand disasters.  You say the gods ought to respect a life whose objects\nare their own; but in cities they have betrayed you to a cloud of\ninsignificant annoyances:\n\"Mirmidons, race feconde,\nMirmidons,\nEnfin nous commandons;\nJupiter livre le monde\nAux mirmidons, aux mirmidons.\"[3]\n'Tis heavy odds\nAgainst the gods,\nWhen they will match with myrmidons.\nWe spawning, spawning myrmidons,\nOur turn to-day! we take command,\nJove gives the globe into the hand\nOf myrmidons, of myrmidons.\n[3] Beranger.\nWhat is odious but noise, and people who scream and bewail? people whose\nvane points always east, who live to dine, who send for the doctor, who\ncoddle themselves, who toast their feet on the register, who intrigue to\nsecure a padded chair, and a corner out of the draught.  Suffer them\nonce to begin the enumeration of their infirmities, and the sun will go\ndown on the unfinished tale.  Let these triflers put us out of conceit\nwith petty comforts.  To a man at work, the frost is but a color: the\nrain, the wind, he forgot them when he came in.  Let us learn to live\ncoarsely, dress plainly, and lie hard. The least habit of dominion over\nthe palate has certain good effects not easily estimated.  Neither will\nwe be driven into a quiddling abstemiousness.  'Tis a superstition to\ninsist on a special diet.  All is made at last of the same chemical\natoms.\nA man in pursuit of greatness feels no little wants.  How can you mind\ndiet, bed, dress, or salutes or compliments, or the figure you make in\ncompany, or wealth, or even the bringing things to pass, when you think\nhow paltry are the machinery and the workers?  Wordsworth was praised to\nme, in Westmoreland, for having afforded to his country neighbors an\nexample of a modest household where comfort and culture were secured,\nwithout display. And a tender boy who wears his rusty cap and outgrown\ncoat, that he may secure the coveted place in college, and the right in\nthe library, is educated to some purpose.  There is a great deal of\nself-denial and manliness in poor and middle-class houses, in town and\ncountry, that has not got into literature, and never will, but that\nkeeps the earth sweet; that saves on superfluities, and spends on\nessentials; that goes rusty, and educates the boy; that sells the horse,\nbut builds the school; works early and late, takes two looms in the\nfactory, three looms, six looms, but pays off the mortgage on the\npaternal farm, and then goes back cheerfully to work again.\nWe can ill spare the commanding social benefits of cities; they must be\nused; yet cautiously, and haughtily,--and will yield their best values\nto him who best can do without them.  Keep the town for occasions, but\nthe habits should be formed to retirement.  Solitude, the safeguard of\nmediocrity, is to genius the stern friend, the cold, obscure shelter\nwhere moult the wings which will bear it farther than suns and stars.\nHe who should inspire and lead his race must be defended from travelling\nwith the souls of other men, from living, breathing, reading, and\nwriting in the daily, time-worn yoke of their opinions.  \"In the\nmorning,--solitude;\" said Pythagoras; that Nature may speak to the\nimagination, as she does never in company, and that her favorite may\nmake acquaintance with those divine strengths which disclose themselves\nto serious and abstracted thought.  'Tis very certain that Plato,\nPlotinus, Archimedes, Hermes, Newton, Milton, Wordsworth, did not live\nin a crowd, but descended into it from time to time as benefactors: and\nthe wise instructor will press this point of securing to the young soul\nin the disposition of time and the arrangements of living, periods and\nhabits of solitude.  The high advantage of university-life is often the\nmere mechanical one, I may call it, of a separate chamber and\nfire,--which parents will allow the boy without hesitation at Cambridge,\nbut do not think needful at home.  We say solitude, to mark the\ncharacter of the tone of thought; but if it can be shared between two or\nmore than two, it is happier, and not less noble. \"We four,\" wrote\nNeander to his sacred friends, \"will enjoy at Halle the inward\nblessedness of a _civitas Dei_, whose foundations are forever\nfriendship.  The more I know you, the more I dissatisfy and must\ndissatisfy all my wonted companions. Their very presence stupefies me.\nThe common understanding withdraws itself from the one centre of all\nexistence.\"\nSolitude takes off the pressure of present importunities that more\ncatholic and humane relations may appear.  The saint and poet seek\nprivacy to ends the most public and universal: and it is the secret of\nculture, to interest the man more in his public, than in his private\nquality.  Here is a new poem, which elicits a good many comments in the\njournals, and in conversation.  From these it is easy, at last, to\neliminate the verdict which readers passed upon it; and that is, in the\nmain, unfavorable. The poet, as a craftsman, is only interested in the\npraise accorded to him, and not in the censure, though it be just.  And\nthe poor little poet hearkens only to that, and rejects the censure, as\nproving incapacity in the critic.  But the poet _cultivated_ becomes a\nstockholder in both companies,--say Mr. Curfew,--in the Curfew stock,\nand in the _humanity_ stock; and, in the last, exults as much in the\ndemonstration of the unsoundness of Curfew, as his interest in the\nformer gives him pleasure in the currency of Curfew.  For, the\ndepreciation of his Curfew stock only shows the immense values of the\nhumanity stock.  As soon as he sides with his critic against himself,\nwith joy, he is a cultivated man.\nWe must have an intellectual quality in all property and in all action,\nor they are nought.  I must have children, I must have events, I must\nhave a social state and history, or my thinking and speaking want body\nor basis.  But to give these accessories any value, I must know them as\ncontingent and rather showy possessions, which pass for more to the\npeople than to me.  We see this abstraction in scholars, as a matter of\ncourse: but what a charm it adds when observed in practical men.\nBonaparte, like Caesar, was intellectual, and could look at every object\nfor itself, without affection.  Though an egotist _a l'outrance_, he\ncould criticize a play, a building, a character, on universal grounds,\nand give a just opinion.  A man known to us only as a celebrity in\npolitics or in trade, gains largely in our esteem if we discover that he\nhas some intellectual taste or skill; as when we learn of Lord Fairfax,\nthe Long Parliament's general, his passion for antiquarian studies; or\nof the French regicide Carnot, his sublime genius in mathematics; or of\na living banker, his success in poetry; or of a partisan journalist, his\ndevotion to ornithology.  So, if in travelling in the dreary\nwildernesses of Arkansas or Texas, we should observe on the next seat a\nman reading Horace, or Martial, or Calderon, we should wish to hug him.\nIn callings that require roughest energy, soldiers, sea-captains, and\ncivil engineers sometimes betray a fine insight, if only through a\ncertain gentleness when off duty; a good-natured admission that there\nare illusions, and who shall say that he is not their sport? We only\nvary the phrase, not the doctrine, when we say, that culture opens the\nsense of beauty. A man is a beggar who only lives to the useful, and,\nhowever he may serve as a pin or rivet in the social machine, cannot be\nsaid to have arrived at self-possession.  I suffer, every day, from the\nwant of perception of beauty in people.  They do not know the charm with\nwhich all moments and objects can be embellished, the charm of manners,\nof self-command, of benevolence.  Repose and cheerfulness are the badge\nof the gentleman,--repose in energy.  The Greek battle-pieces are calm;\nthe heroes, in whatever violent actions engaged, retain a serene aspect;\nas we say of Niagara, that it falls without speed.  A cheerful,\nintelligent face is the end of culture, and success enough. For it\nindicates the purpose of Nature and wisdom attained.\nWhen our higher faculties are in activity, we are domesticated, and\nawkwardness and discomfort give place to natural and agreeable\nmovements.  It is noticed, that the consideration of the great periods\nand spaces of astronomy induces a dignity of mind, and an indifference\nto death.  The influence of fine scenery, the presence of mountains,\nappeases our irritations and elevates our friendships.  Even a high\ndome, and the expansive interior of a cathedral, have a sensible effect\non manners.  I have heard that stiff people lose something of their\nawkwardness under high ceilings, and in spacious halls. I think,\nsculpture and painting have an effect to teach us manners, and abolish\nhurry.\nBut, over all, culture must reinforce from higher influx the empirical\nskills of eloquence, or of politics, or of trade, and the useful arts.\nThere is a certain loftiness of thought and power to marshal and adjust\nparticulars, which can only come from an insight of their whole\nconnection.  The orator who has once seen things in their divine order,\nwill never quite lose sight of this, and will come to affairs as from a\nhigher ground, and, though he will say nothing of philosophy, he will\nhave a certain mastery in dealing with them, and an incapableness of\nbeing dazzled or frighted, which will distinguish his handling from that\nof attorneys and factors.  A man who stands on a good footing with the\nheads of parties at Washington, reads the rumors of the newspapers, and\nthe guesses of provincial politicians, with a key to the right and wrong\nin each statement, and sees well enough where all this will end.\nArchimedes will look through your Connecticut machine, at a glance, and\njudge of its fitness. And much more, a wise man who knows not only what\nPlato, but what Saint John can show him, can easily raise the affair he\ndeals with, to a certain majesty.  Plato says, Pericles owed this\nelevation to the lessons of Anaxagoras.  Burke descended from a higher\nsphere when he would influence human affairs.  Franklin, Adams,\nJefferson, Washington, stood on a fine humanity, before which the brawls\nof modern senates are but pot-house politics.\nBut there are higher secrets of culture, which are not for the\napprentices, but for proficients. These are lessons only for the brave.\nWe must know our friends under ugly masks.  The calamities are our\nfriends.  Ben Jonson specifies in his address to the Muse:--\n\"Get him the time's long grudge, the court's ill-will,\nAnd, reconciled, keep him suspected still,\nMake him lose all his friends, and, what is worse,\nAlmost all ways to any better course;\nWith me thou leav'st a better Muse than thee,\nAnd which thou brought'st me, blessed Poverty.\"\nWe wish to learn philosophy by rote, and play at heroism.  But the wiser\nGod says, Take the shame, the poverty, and the penal solitude, that\nbelong to truth-speaking.  Try the rough water as well as the smooth.\nRough water can teach lessons worth knowing.  When the state is unquiet,\npersonal qualities are more than ever decisive.  Fear not a revolution\nwhich will constrain you to live five years in one.  Don't be so tender\nat making an enemy now and then.  Be willing to go to Coventry\nsometimes, and let the populace bestow on you their coldest contempts.\nThe finished man of the world must eat of every apple once.  He must\nhold his hatreds also at arm's length, and not remember spite.  He has\nneither friends nor enemies, but values men only as channels of power.\nHe who aims high, must dread an easy home and popular manners.  Heaven\nsometimes hedges a rare character about with ungainliness and odium, as\nthe burr that protects the fruit.  If there is any great and good thing\nin store for you, it will not come at the first or the second call, nor\nin the shape of fashion, ease, and city drawing-rooms.  Popularity is\nfor dolls.  \"Steep and craggy,\" said Porphyry, \"is the path of the\ngods.\"  Open your Marcus Antoninus.  In the opinion of the ancients, he\nwas the great man who scorned to shine, and who contested the frowns of\nfortune.  They preferred the noble vessel too late for the tide,\ncontending with winds and waves, dismantled and unrigged, to her\ncompanion borne into harbor with colors flying and guns firing.  There\nis none of the social goods that may not be purchased too dear, and mere\namiableness must not take rank with high aims and self-subsistency.\nBettine replies to Goethe's mother, who chides her disregard of\ndress,--\"If I cannot do as I have a mind, in our poor Frankfort, I shall\nnot carry things far.\"  And the youth must rate at its true mark the\ninconceivable levity of local opinion. The longer we live, the more we\nmust endure the elementary existence of men and women; and every brave\nheart must treat society as a child, and never allow it to dictate.\n\"All that class of the severe and restrictive virtues,\" said Burke, \"are\nalmost too costly for humanity.\"  Who wishes to be severe?  Who wishes\nto resist the eminent and polite, in behalf of the poor, and low, and\nimpolite? and who that dares do it, can keep his temper sweet, his\nfrolic spirits?  The high virtues are not debonair, but have their\nredress in being illustrious at last. What forests of laurel we bring,\nand the tears of mankind, to those who stood firm against the opinion of\ntheir contemporaries!  The measure of a master is his success in\nbringing all men round to his opinion twenty years later.\nLet me say here, that culture cannot begin too early.  In talking with\nscholars, I observe that they lost on ruder companions those years of\nboyhood which alone could give imaginative literature a religious and\ninfinite quality in their esteem.  I find, too, that the chance for\nappreciation is much increased by being the son of an appreciator, and\nthat these boys who now grow up are caught not only years too late, but\ntwo or three births too late, to make the best scholars of.  And I think\nit a presentable motive to a scholar, that, as, in an old community, a\nwell-born proprietor is usually found, after the first heats of youth,\nto be a careful husband, and to feel a habitual desire that the estate\nshall suffer no harm by his administration, but shall be delivered down\nto the next heir in as good condition as he received it;--so, a\nconsiderate man will reckon himself a subject of that secular\nmelioration by which mankind is mollified, cured, and refined, and will\nshun every expenditure of his forces on pleasure or gain, which will\njeopardize this social and secular accumulation.\nThe fossil strata show us that Nature began with rudimental forms, and\nrose to the more complex, as fast as the earth was fit for their\ndwelling-place; and that the lower perish, as the higher appear.  Very\nfew of our race can be said to be yet finished men. We still carry\nsticking to us some remains of the preceding inferior quadruped\norganization.  We call these millions men; but they are not yet men.\nHalf-engaged in the soil, pawing to get free, man needs all the music\nthat can be brought to disengage him.  If Love, red Love, with tears and\njoy; if Want with his scourge; if War with his cannonade; if\nChristianity with its charity; if Trade with its money; if Art with its\nportfolios; if Science with her telegraphs through the deeps of space\nand time; can set his dull nerves throbbing, and by loud taps on the\ntough chrysalis, can break its walls, and let the new creature emerge\nerect and free,--make way, and sing paean!  The age of the quadruped is\nto go out,--the age of the brain and of the heart is to come in.  The\ntime will come when the evil forms we have known can no more be\norganized. Man's culture can spare nothing, wants all the material.  He\nis to convert all impediments into instruments, all enemies into power.\nThe formidable mischief will only make the more useful slave. And if one\nshall read the future of the race hinted in the organic effort of Nature\nto mount and meliorate, and the corresponding impulse to the Better in\nthe human being, we shall dare affirm that there is nothing he will not\novercome and convert, until at last culture shall absorb the chaos and\ngehenna. He will convert the Furies into Muses, and the hells into\nbenefit.\nV.\nBEHAVIOR.\nGrace, Beauty, and Caprice\nBuild this golden portal;\nGraceful women, chosen men\nDazzle every mortal:\nTheir sweet and lofty countenance\nHis enchanting food;\nHe need not go to them, their forms\nBeset his solitude.\nHe looketh seldom in their face,\nHis eyes explore the ground,\nThe green grass is a looking-glass\nWhereon their traits are found.\nLittle he says to them,\nSo dances his heart in his breast,\nTheir tranquil mien bereaveth him\nOf wit, of words, of rest.\nToo weak to win, too fond to shun\nThe tyrants of his doom,\nThe much deceived Endymion\nSlips behind a tomb.\nBEHAVIOR.\nThe soul which animates Nature is not less significantly published in\nthe figure, movement, and gesture of animated bodies, than in its last\nvehicle of articulate speech.  This silent and subtile language is\nManners; not _what_, but _how_.  Life expresses.  A statue has no\ntongue, and needs none.  Good tableaux do not need declamation. Nature\ntells every secret once.  Yes, but in man she tells it all the time, by\nform, attitude, gesture, mien, face, and parts of the face, and by the\nwhole action of the machine.  The visible carriage or action of the\nindividual, as resulting from his organization and his will combined, we\ncall manners. What are they but thought entering the hands and feet,\ncontrolling the movements of the body, the speech and behavior?\nThere is always a best way of doing everything, if it be to boil an egg.\nManners are the happy ways of doing things; each once a stroke of genius\nor of love,--now repeated and hardened into usage. They form at last a\nrich varnish, with which the routine of life is washed, and its details\nadorned. If they are superficial, so are the dew-drops which give such a\ndepth to the morning meadows. Manners are very communicable: men catch\nthem from each other.  Consuelo, in the romance, boasts of the lessons\nshe had given the nobles in manners, on the stage; and, in real life,\nTalma taught Napoleon the arts of behavior.  Genius invents fine\nmanners, which the baron and the baroness copy very fast, and, by the\nadvantage of a palace, better the instruction.  They stereotype the\nlesson they have learned into a mode.\nThe power of manners is incessant,--an element as unconcealable as fire.\nThe nobility cannot in any country be disguised, and no more in a\nrepublic or a democracy, than in a kingdom.  No man can resist their\ninfluence.  There are certain manners which are learned in good society,\nof that force, that, if a person have them, he or she must be\nconsidered, and is everywhere welcome, though without beauty, or wealth,\nor genius.  Give a boy address and accomplishments, and you give him the\nmastery of palaces and fortunes where he goes. He has not the trouble of\nearning or owning them; they solicit him to enter and possess.  We send\ngirls of a timid, retreating disposition to the boarding-school, to the\nriding-school, to the ballroom, or wheresoever they can come into\nacquaintance and nearness of leading persons of their own sex; where\nthey might learn address, and see it near at hand. The power of a woman\nof fashion to lead, and also to daunt and repel, derives from their\nbelief that she knows resources and behaviors not known to them; but\nwhen these have mastered her secret, they learn to confront her, and\nrecover their self-possession.\nEvery day bears witness to their gentle rule. People who would obtrude,\nnow do not obtrude. The mediocre circle learns to demand that which\nbelongs to a high state of nature or of culture. Your manners are always\nunder examination, and by committees little suspected,--a police in\ncitizens' clothes,--but are awarding or denying you very high prizes\nwhen you least think of it.\nWe talk much of utilities,--but 'tis our manners that associate us.  In\nhours of business, we go to him who knows, or has, or does this or that\nwhich we want, and we do not let our taste or feeling stand in the way.\nBut this activity over, we return to the indolent state, and wish for\nthose we can be at ease with: those who will go where we go, whose\nmanners do not offend us, whose social tone chimes with ours.  When we\nreflect on their persuasive and cheering force; how they recommend,\nprepare, and draw people together; how, in all clubs, manners make the\nmembers; how manners make the fortune of the ambitious youth; that, for\nthe most part, his manners marry him, and, for the most part, he marries\nmanners; when we think what keys they are, and to what secrets; what\nhigh lessons and inspiring tokens of character they convey; and what\ndivination is required in us, for the reading of this fine telegraph, we\nsee what range the subject has, and what relations to convenience,\npower, and beauty.\nTheir first service is very low,--when they are the minor morals: but\n'tis the beginning of civility,--to make us, I mean, endurable to each\nother. We prize them for their rough-plastic, abstergent force; to get\npeople out of the quadruped state; to get them washed, clothed, and set\nup on end; to slough their animal husks and habits; compel them to be\nclean; overawe their spite and meanness, teach them to stifle the base,\nand choose the generous expression, and make them know how much happier\nthe generous behaviors are.\nBad behavior the laws cannot reach.  Society is infested with rude,\ncynical, restless, and frivolous persons who prey upon the rest, and\nwhom, a public opinion concentrated into good manners, forms accepted by\nthe sense of all, can reach:--the contradictors and railers at public\nand private tables, who are like terriers, who conceive it the duty of a\ndog of honor to growl at any passer-by, and do the honors of the house\nby barking him out of sight:--I have seen men who neigh like a horse\nwhen you contradict them, or say something which they do not\nunderstand:--then the overbold, who make their own invitation to your\nhearth; the persevering talker, who gives you his society in large,\nsaturating doses; the pitiers of themselves,--a perilous class; the\nfrivolous Asmodeus, who relies on you to find him in ropes of sand to\ntwist; the monotones; in short, every stripe of absurdity;--these are\nsocial inflictions which the magistrate cannot cure or defend you from,\nand which must be intrusted to the restraining force of custom, and\nproverbs, and familiar rules of behavior impressed on young people in\ntheir school-days.\nIn the hotels on the banks of the Mississippi, they print, or used to\nprint, among the rules of the house, that \"no gentleman can be permitted\nto come to the public table without his coat;\" and in the same country,\nin the pews of the churches, little placards plead with the worshipper\nagainst the fury of expectoration.  Charles Dickens self-sacrificingly\nundertook the reformation of our American manners in unspeakable\nparticulars.  I think the lesson was not quite lost; that it held bad\nmanners up, so that the churls could see the deformity. Unhappily, the\nbook had its own deformities.  It ought not to need to print in a\nreading-room a caution to strangers not to speak loud; nor to persons\nwho look over fine engravings, that they should be handled like cobwebs\nand butterflies' wings; nor to persons who look at marble statues, that\nthey shall not smite them with canes.  But, even in the perfect\ncivilization of this city, such cautions are not quite needless in the\nAthenaeum and City Library.\nManners are factitious, and grow out of circumstance as well as out of\ncharacter.  If you look at the pictures of patricians and of peasants,\nof different periods and countries, you will see how well they match the\nsame classes in our towns.  The modern aristocrat not only is well drawn\nin Titian's Venetian doges, and in Roman coins and statues, but also in\nthe pictures which Commodore Perry brought home of dignitaries in Japan.\nBroad lands and great interests not only arrive to such heads as can\nmanage them, but form manners of power.  A keen eye, too, will see nice\ngradations of rank, or see in the manners the degree of homage the party\nis wont to receive.  A prince who is accustomed every day to be courted\nand deferred to by the highest grandees, acquires a corresponding\nexpectation, and a becoming mode of receiving and replying to this\nhomage.\nThere are always exceptional people and modes. English grandees affect\nto be farmers.  Claverhouse is a fop, and, under the finish of dress,\nand levity of behavior, hides the terror of his war.  But Nature and\nDestiny are honest, and never fail to leave their mark, to hang out a\nsign for each and for every quality.  It is much to conquer one's face,\nand perhaps the ambitious youth thinks he has got the whole secret when\nhe has learned, that disengaged manners are commanding.  Don't be\ndeceived by a facile exterior.  Tender men sometimes have strong wills.\nWe had, in Massachusetts, an old statesman, who had sat all his life in\ncourts and in chairs of state, without overcoming an extreme\nirritability of face, voice, and bearing: when he spoke, his voice would\nnot serve him; it cracked, it broke, it wheezed, it piped;--little cared\nhe; he knew that it had got to pipe, or wheeze, or screech his argument\nand his indignation.  When he sat down, after speaking, he seemed in a\nsort of fit, and held on to his chair with both hands: but underneath\nall this irritability, was a puissant will, firm, and advancing, and a\nmemory in which lay in order and method like geologic strata every fact\nof his history, and under the control of his will.\nManners are partly factitious, but, mainly, there must be capacity for\nculture in the blood.  Else all culture is vain.  The obstinate\nprejudice in favor of blood, which lies at the base of the feudal and\nmonarchical fabrics of the old world, has some reason in common\nexperience.  Every man,--mathematician, artist, soldier, or\nmerchant,--looks with confidence for some traits and talents in his own\nchild, which he would not dare to presume in the child of a stranger.\nThe Orientalists are very orthodox on this point.  \"Take a thorn-bush,\"\nsaid the emir Abdel-Kader, \"and sprinkle it for a whole year with\nwater;--it will yield nothing but thorns. Take a date-tree, leave it\nwithout culture, and it will always produce dates.  Nobility is the\ndate-tree, and the Arab populace is a bush of thorns.\"\nA main fact in the history of manners is the wonderful expressiveness of\nthe human body.  If it were made of glass, or of air, and the thoughts\nwere written on steel tablets within, it could not publish more truly\nits meaning than now.  Wise men read very sharply all your private\nhistory in your look and gait and behavior.  The whole economy of nature\nis bent on expression.  The tell-tale body is all tongues.  Men are like\nGeneva watches with crystal faces which expose the whole movement.  They\ncarry the liquor of life flowing up and down in these beautiful bottles,\nand announcing to the curious how it is with them. The face and eyes\nreveal what the spirit is doing, how old it is, what aims it has.  The\neyes indicate the antiquity of the soul, or, through how many forms it\nhas already ascended.  It almost violates the proprieties, if we say\nabove the breath here, what the confessing eyes do not hesitate to utter\nto every street passenger.\nMan cannot fix his eye on the sun, and so far seems imperfect.  In\nSiberia, a late traveller found men who could see the satellites of\nJupiter with their unarmed eye.  In some respects the animals excel us.\nThe birds have a longer sight, beside the advantage by their wings of a\nhigher observatory. A cow can bid her calf by secret signal, probably of\nthe eye, to run away, or to lie down and hide itself.  The jockeys say\nof certain horses, that \"they look over the whole ground.\"  The outdoor\nlife, and hunting, and labor, give equal vigor to the human eye.  A\nfarmer looks out at you as strong as the horse; his eye-beam is like the\nstroke of a staff.  An eye can threaten like a loaded and levelled gun,\nor can insult like hissing or kicking; or, in its altered mood, by beams\nof kindness, it can make the heart dance with joy.\nThe eye obeys exactly the action of the mind. When a thought strikes us,\nthe eyes fix, and remain gazing at a distance; in enumerating the names\nof persons or of countries, as France, Germany, Spain, Turkey, the eyes\nwink at each new name.  There is no nicety of learning sought by the\nmind, which the eyes do not vie in acquiring. \"An artist,\" said Michel\nAngelo, \"must have his measuring tools not in the hand, but in the eye;\"\nand there is no end to the catalogue of its performances, whether in\nindolent vision, (that of health and beauty,) or in strained vision,\n(that of art and labor.)\nEyes are bold as lions,--roving, running, leaping, here and there, far\nand near.  They speak all languages.  They wait for no introduction;\nthey are no Englishmen; ask no leave of age, or rank; they respect\nneither poverty nor riches, neither learning nor power, nor virtue, nor\nsex, but intrude, and come again, and go through and through you, in a\nmoment of time.  What inundation of life and thought is discharged from\none soul into another, through them!  The glance is natural magic.  The\nmysterious communication established across a house between two entire\nstrangers, moves all the springs of wonder.  The communication by the\nglance is in the greatest part not subject to the control of the will.\nIt is the bodily symbol of identity of nature.  We look into the eyes to\nknow if this other form is another self, and the eyes will not lie, but\nmake a faithful confession what inhabitant is there.  The revelations\nare sometimes terrific.  The confession of a low, usurping devil is\nthere made, and the observer shall seem to feel the stirring of owls,\nand bats, and horned hoofs, where he looked for innocence and\nsimplicity.  'Tis remarkable, too, that the spirit that appears at the\nwindows of the house does at once invest himself in a new form of his\nown, to the mind of the beholder.\nThe eyes of men converse as much as their tongues, with the advantage,\nthat the ocular dialect needs no dictionary, but is understood all the\nworld over.  When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another, a\npractised man relies on the language of the first.  If the man is off\nhis centre, the eyes show it.  You can read in the eyes of your\ncompanion, whether your argument hits him, though his tongue will not\nconfess it.  There is a look by which a man shows he is going to say a\ngood thing, and a look when he has said it.  Vain and forgotten are all\nthe fine offers and offices of hospitality, if there is no holiday in\nthe eye. How many furtive inclinations avowed by the eye, though\ndissembled by the lips!  One comes away from a company, in which, it may\neasily happen, he has said nothing, and no important remark has been\naddressed to him, and yet, if in sympathy with the society, he shall not\nhave a sense of this fact, such a stream of life has been flowing into\nhim, and out from him, through the eyes.  There are eyes, to be sure,\nthat give no more admission into the man than blueberries.  Others are\nliquid and deep,--wells that a man might fall into;--others are\naggressive and devouring, seem to call out the police, take all too much\nnotice, and require crowded Broadways, and the security of millions, to\nprotect individuals against them.  The military eye I meet, now darkly\nsparkling under clerical, now under rustic brows.  'Tis the city of\nLacedaemon; 'tis a stack of bayonets.  There are asking eyes, asserting\neyes, prowling eyes; and eyes full of fate,--some of good, and some of\nsinister omen. The alleged power to charm down insanity, or ferocity in\nbeasts, is a power behind the eye.  It must be a victory achieved in the\nwill, before it can be signified in the eye.  'Tis very certain that\neach man carries in his eye the exact indication of his rank in the\nimmense scale of men, and we are always learning to read it.  A complete\nman should need no auxiliaries to his personal presence. Whoever looked\non him would consent to his will, being certified that his aims were\ngenerous and universal. The reason why men do not obey us, is because\nthey see the mud at the bottom of our eye.\nIf the organ of sight is such a vehicle of power, the other features\nhave their own.  A man finds room in the few square inches of the face\nfor the traits of all his ancestors; for the expression of all his\nhistory, and his wants.  The sculptor, and Winckelmann, and Lavater,\nwill tell you how significant a feature is the nose; how its forms\nexpress strength or weakness of will, and good or bad temper.  The nose\nof Julius Caesar, of Dante, and of Pitt, suggest \"the terrors of the\nbeak.\"  What refinement, and what limitations, the teeth betray! \"Beware\nyou don't laugh,\" said the wise mother, \"for then you show all your\nfaults.\"\nBalzac left in manuscript a chapter, which he called \"_Theorie de la\ndemarche_\" in which he says: \"The look, the voice, the respiration, and\nthe attitude or walk, are identical.  But, as it has not been given to\nman, the power to stand guard, at once, over these four different\nsimultaneous expressions of his thought, watch that one which speaks out\nthe truth, and you will know the whole man.\"\nPalaces interest us mainly in the exhibition of manners, which, in the\nidle and expensive society dwelling in them, are raised to a high art.\nThe maxim of courts is, that manner is power.  A calm and resolute\nbearing, a polished speech, an embellishment of trifles, and the art of\nhiding all uncomfortable feeling, are essential to the courtier: and\nSaint Simon, and Cardinal de Retz, and Roederer, and an encyclopaedia of\nMemoires, will instruct you, if you wish, in those potent secrets.\nThus, it is a point of pride with kings, to remember faces and names.\nIt is reported of one prince, that his head had the air of leaning\ndownwards, in order not to humble the crowd.  There are people who come\nin ever like a child with a piece of good news.  It was said of the late\nLord Holland, that he always came down to breakfast with the air of a\nman who had just met with some signal good-fortune.  In \"_Notre Dame_,\"\nthe grandee took his place on the dais, with the look of one who is\nthinking of something else.  But we must not peep and eavesdrop at\npalace-doors.\nFine manners need the support of fine manners in others.  A scholar may\nbe a well-bred man, or he may not.  The enthusiast is introduced to\npolished scholars in society, and is chilled and silenced by finding\nhimself not in their element.  They all have somewhat which he has not,\nand, it seems, ought to have.  But if he finds the scholar apart from\nhis companions, it is then the enthusiast's turn, and the scholar has no\ndefence, but must deal on his terms.  Now they must fight the battle out\non their private strengths.  What is the talent of that character so\ncommon,--the successful man of the world,--in all marts, senates, and\ndrawing-rooms?  Manners: manners of power; sense to see his advantage,\nand manners up to it.  See him approach his man.  He knows that troops\nbehave as they are handled at first;--that is his cheap secret; just\nwhat happens to every two persons who meet on any affair,--one instantly\nperceives that he has the key of the situation, that his will\ncomprehends the other's will, as the cat does the mouse; and he has only\nto use courtesy, and furnish good-natured reasons to his victim to cover\nup the chain, lest he be shamed into resistance.\nThe theatre in which this science of manners has a formal importance is\nnot with us a court, but dress-circles, wherein, after the close of the\nday's business, men and women meet at leisure, for mutual entertainment,\nin ornamented drawing-rooms. Of course, it has every variety of\nattraction and merit; but, to earnest persons, to youths or maidens who\nhave great objects at heart, we cannot extol it highly.  A well-dressed,\ntalkative company, where each is bent to amuse the other.--yet the\nhigh-born Turk who came hither fancied that every woman seemed to be\nsuffering for a chair; that all the talkers were brained and exhausted\nby the deoxygenated air: it spoiled the best persons: it put all on\nstilts.  Yet here are the secret biographies written and read.  The\naspect of that man is repulsive: I do not wish to deal with him.  The\nother is irritable, shy, and on his guard.  The youth looks humble and\nmanly: I choose him.  Look on this woman.  There is not beauty, nor\nbrilliant sayings, nor distinguished power to serve you; but all see her\ngladly; her whole air and impression are healthful.  Here come the\nsentimentalists, and the invalids.  Here is Elise, who caught cold in\ncoming into the world, and has always increased it since.  Here are\ncreep-mouse manners; and thievish manners.  \"Look at Northcote,\" said\nFuseli; \"he looks like a rat that has seen a cat.\"  In the shallow\ncompany, easily excited, easily tired, here is the columnar Bernard: the\nAlleghanies do not express more repose than his behavior.  Here are the\nsweet following eyes of Cecile: it seemed always that she demanded the\nheart.  Nothing can be more excellent in kind than the Corinthian grace\nof Gertrude's manners, and yet Blanche, who has no manners, has better\nmanners than she; for the movements of Blanche are the sallies of a\nspirit which is sufficient for the moment, and she can afford to express\nevery thought by instant action.\nManners have been somewhat cynically defined to be a contrivance of wise\nmen to keep fools at a distance.  Fashion is shrewd to detect those who\ndo not belong to her train, and seldom wastes her attentions.  Society\nis very swift in its instincts, and, if you do not belong to it, resists\nand sneers at you; or quietly drops you.  The first weapon enrages the\nparty attacked; the second is still more effective, but is not to be\nresisted, as the date of the transaction is not easily found.  People\ngrow up and grow old under this infliction, and never suspect the truth,\nascribing the solitude which acts on them very injuriously, to any cause\nbut the right one.\nThe basis of good manners is self-reliance.  Necessity is the law of all\nwho are not self-possessed. Those who are not self-possessed, obtrude,\nand pain us.  Some men appear to feel that they belong to a Pariah\ncaste.  They fear to offend, they bend and apologize, and walk through\nlife with a timid step. As we sometimes dream that we are in a\nwell-dressed company without any coat, so Godfrey acts ever as if he\nsuffered from some mortifying circumstance.  The hero should find\nhimself at home, wherever he is; should impart comfort by his own\nsecurity and good-nature to all beholders.  The hero is suffered to be\nhimself.  A person of strong mind comes to perceive that for him an\nimmunity is secured so long as he renders to society that service which\nis native and proper to him,--an immunity from all the observances, yea,\nand duties, which society so tyrannically imposes on the rank and file\nof its members.  \"Euripides,\" says Aspasia, \"has not the fine manners of\nSophocles; but,\"--she adds good-humoredly, \"the movers and masters of\nour souls have surely a right to throw out their limbs as carelessly as\nthey please, on the world that belongs to them, and before the creatures\nthey have animated.\"[4]\n[4] Landor: Pericles and Aspasia.\nManners require time, as nothing is more vulgar than haste.  Friendship\nshould be surrounded with ceremonies and respects, and not crushed into\ncorners.  Friendship requires more time than poor busy men can usually\ncommand.  Here comes to me Roland, with a delicacy of sentiment leading\nand inwrapping him like a divine cloud or holy ghost.  'Tis a great\ndestitution to both that this should not be entertained with large\nleisures, but contrariwise should be balked by importunate affairs.\nBut through this lustrous varnish, the reality is ever shining.  'Tis\nhard to keep the _what_ from breaking through this pretty painting of\nthe _how_. The core will come to the surface.  Strong will and keen\nperception overpower old manners, and create new; and the thought of the\npresent moment has a greater value than all the past.  In persons of\ncharacter, we do not remark manners, because of their instantaneousness.\nWe are surprised by the thing done, out of all power to watch the way of\nit.  Yet nothing is more charming than to recognize the great style\nwhich runs through the actions of such.  People masquerade before us in\ntheir fortunes, titles, offices, and connections, as academic or civil\npresidents, or senators, or professors, or great lawyers, and impose on\nthe frivolous, and a good deal on each other, by these fames.  At least,\nit is a point of prudent good manners to treat these reputations\ntenderly, as if they were merited. But the sad realist knows these\nfellows at a glance, and they know him; as when in Paris the chief of\nthe police enters a ballroom, so many diamonded pretenders shrink and\nmake themselves as inconspicuous as they can, or give him a supplicating\nlook as they pass.  \"I had received,\" said a sibyl, \"I had received at\nbirth the fatal gift of penetration:\"--and these Cassandras are always\nborn.\nManners impress as they indicate real power.  A man who is sure of his\npoint, carries a broad and contented expression, which everybody reads.\nAnd you cannot rightly train one to an air and manner, except by making\nhim the kind of man of whom that manner is the natural expression.\nNature forever puts a premium on reality.  What is done for effect, is\nseen to be done for effect; what is done for love, is felt to be done\nfor love.  A man inspires affection and honor, because he was not lying\nin wait for these.  The things of a man for which we visit him, were\ndone in the dark and the cold.  A little integrity is better than any\ncareer.  So deep are the sources of this surface-action, that even the\nsize of your companion seems to vary with his freedom of thought.  Not\nonly is he larger, when at ease, and his thoughts generous, but\neverything around him becomes variable with expression.  No carpenter's\nrule, no rod and chain, will measure the dimensions of any house or\nhouse-lot: go into the house: if the proprietor is constrained and\ndeferring, 'tis of no importance how large his house, how beautiful his\ngrounds,--you quickly come to the end of all: but if the man is\nself-possessed, happy, and at home, his house is deep-founded,\nindefinitely large and interesting, the roof and dome buoyant as the\nsky.  Under the humblest roof, the commonest person in plain clothes\nsits there massive, cheerful, yet formidable like the Egyptian colossi.\nNeither Aristotle, nor Leibnitz, nor Junius, nor Champollion has set\ndown the grammar-rules of this dialect, older than Sanscrit; but they\nwho cannot yet read English, can read this.  Men take each other's\nmeasure, when they meet for the first time,--and every time they meet.\nHow do they get this rapid knowledge, even before they speak, of each\nother's power and dispositions?  One would say, that the persuasion of\ntheir speech is not in what they say,--or, that men do not convince by\ntheir argument,--but by their personality, by who they are, and what\nthey said and did heretofore. A man already strong is listened to, and\neverything he says is applauded.  Another opposes him with sound\nargument, but the argument is scouted, until by and by it gets into the\nmind of some weighty person; then it begins to tell on the community.\nSelf-reliance is the basis of behavior, as it is the guaranty that the\npowers are not squandered in too much demonstration.  In this country,\nwhere school education is universal, we have a superficial culture, and\na profusion of reading and writing and expression.  We parade our\nnobilities in poems and orations, instead of working them up into\nhappiness. There is a whisper out of the ages to him who can understand\nit,--'whatever is known to thyself alone, has always very great value.'\nThere is some reason to believe, that, when a man does not write his\npoetry, it escapes by other vents through him, instead of the one vent\nof writing; clings to his form and manners, whilst poets have often\nnothing poetical about them except their verses.  Jacobi said, that\n\"when a man has fully expressed his thought, he has somewhat less\npossession of it.\"  One would say, the rule is,--What a man is\nirresistibly urged to say, helps him and us.  In explaining his thought\nto others, he explains it to himself: but when he opens it for show, it\ncorrupts him.\nSociety is the stage on which manners are shown; novels are their\nliterature.  Novels are the journal or record of manners; and the new\nimportance of these books derives from the fact, that the novelist\nbegins to penetrate the surface, and treat this part of life more\nworthily.  The novels used to be all alike, and had a quite vulgar tone.\nThe novels used to lead us on to a foolish interest in the fortunes of\nthe boy and girl they described. The boy was to be raised from a humble\nto a high position.  He was in want of a wife and a castle, and the\nobject of the story was to supply him with one or both.  We watched\nsympathetically, step by step, his climbing, until, at last, the point\nis gained, the wedding day is fixed, and we follow the gala procession\nhome to the castle, when the doors are slammed in our face, and the poor\nreader is left outside in the cold, not enriched by so much as an idea,\nor a virtuous impulse.\nBut the victories of character are instant, and victories for all.  Its\ngreatness enlarges all.  We are fortified by every heroic anecdote.  The\nnovels are as useful as Bibles, if they teach you the secret, that the\nbest of life is conversation, and the greatest success is confidence, or\nperfect understanding between sincere people.  'Tis a French definition\nof friendship, _rien que s'entendre_, good understanding. The highest\ncompact we can make with our fellow, is,--'Let there be truth between us\ntwo for evermore.'  That is the charm in all good novels, as it is the\ncharm in all good histories, that the heroes mutually understand, from\nthe first, and deal loyally, and with a profound trust in each other. It\nis sublime to feel and say of another, I need never meet, or speak, or\nwrite to him: we need not reinforce ourselves, or send tokens of\nremembrance: I rely on him as on myself: if he did thus or thus, I know\nit was right.\nIn all the superior people I have met, I notice directness, truth spoken\nmore truly, as if everything of obstruction, of malformation, had been\ntrained away.  What have they to conceal?  What have they to exhibit?\nBetween simple and noble persons, there is always a quick intelligence:\nthey recognize at sight, and meet on a better ground than the talents\nand skills they may chance to possess, namely, on sincerity and\nuprightness.  For, it is not what talents or genius a man has, but how\nhe is to his talents, that constitutes friendship and character.  The\nman that stands by himself, the universe stands by him also.  It is\nrelated of the monk Basle, that, being excommunicated by the Pope, he\nwas, at his death, sent in charge of an angel to find a fit place of\nsuffering in hell; but, such was the eloquence and good-humor of the\nmonk, that, wherever he went he was received gladly, and civilly\ntreated, even by the most uncivil angels: and, when he came to discourse\nwith them, instead of contradicting or forcing him, they took his part,\nand adopted his manners: and even good angels came from far, to see him,\nand take up their abode with him.  The angel that was sent to find a\nplace of torment for him, attempted to remove him to a worse pit, but\nwith no better success; for such was the contented spirit of the monk,\nthat he found something to praise in every place and company, though in\nhell, and made a kind of heaven of it.  At last the escorting angel\nreturned with his prisoner to them that sent him, saying, that no\nphlegethon could be found that would burn him; for that, in whatever\ncondition, Basle remained incorrigibly Basle.  The legend says, his\nsentence was remitted, and he was allowed to go into heaven, and was\ncanonized as a saint.\nThere is a stroke of magnanimity in the correspondence of Bonaparte with\nhis brother Joseph, when the latter was King of Spain, and complained\nthat he missed in Napoleon's letters the affectionate tone which had\nmarked their childish correspondence. \"I am sorry,\" replies Napoleon,\n\"you think you shall find your brother again only in the Elysian Fields.\nIt is natural, that at forty, he should not feel towards you as he did\nat twelve.  But his feelings towards you have greater truth and\nstrength. His friendship has the features of his mind.\"\nHow much we forgive to those who yield us the rare spectacle of heroic\nmanners!  We will pardon them the want of books, of arts, and even of\nthe gentler virtues.  How tenaciously we remember them!  Here is a\nlesson which I brought along with me in boyhood from the Latin School,\nand which ranks with the best of Roman anecdotes. Marcus Scaurus was\naccused by Quintus Varius Hispanus, that he had excited the allies to\ntake arms against the Republic.  But he, full of firmness and gravity,\ndefended himself in this manner: \"Quintus Varius Hispanus alleges that\nMarcus Scaurus, President of the Senate, excited the allies to arms:\nMarcus Scaurus, President of the Senate, denies it.  There is no\nwitness.  Which do you believe, Romans?\"  \"_Utri creditis, Quirites?_\"\nWhen he had said these words, he was absolved by the assembly of the\npeople.\nI have seen manners that make a similar impression with personal beauty;\nthat give the like exhilaration, and refine us like that; and, in\nmemorable experiences, they are suddenly better than beauty, and make\nthat superfluous and ugly.  But they must be marked by fine perception,\nthe acquaintance with real beauty.  They must always show self-control:\nyou shall not be facile, apologetic, or leaky, but king over your word;\nand every gesture and action shall indicate power at rest.  Then they\nmust be inspired by the good heart.  There is no beautifier of\ncomplexion, or form, or behavior, like the wish to scatter joy and not\npain around us.\n'Tis good to give a stranger a meal, or a night's lodging.  'Tis better\nto be hospitable to his good meaning and thought, and give courage to a\ncompanion.  We must be as courteous to a man as we are to a picture,\nwhich we are willing to give the advantage of a good light.  Special\nprecepts are not to be thought of: the talent of well-doing contains\nthem all.  Every hour will show a duty as paramount as that of my whim\njust now; and yet I will write it,--that there is one topic peremptorily\nforbidden to all well-bred, to all rational mortals, namely, their\ndistempers.  If you have not slept, or if you have slept, or if you have\nheadache, or sciatica, or leprosy, or thunder-stroke, I beseech you, by\nall angels, to hold your peace, and not pollute the morning, to which\nall the housemates bring serene and pleasant thoughts, by corruption and\ngroans.  Come out of the azure. Love the day.  Do not leave the sky out\nof your landscape.  The oldest and the most deserving person should come\nvery modestly into any newly awaked company, respecting the divine\ncommunications, out of which all must be presumed to have newly come.\nAn old man who added an elevating culture to a large experience of life,\nsaid to me, \"When you come into the room, I think I will study how to\nmake humanity beautiful to you.\"\nAs respects the delicate question of culture, I do not think that any\nother than negative rules can be laid down.  For positive rules, for\nsuggestion, Nature alone inspires it.  Who dare assume to guide a youth,\na maid, to perfect manners?--the golden mean is so delicate,\ndifficult,--say frankly, unattainable.  What finest hands would not be\nclumsy to sketch the genial precepts of the young girl's demeanor?  The\nchances seem infinite against success; and yet success is continually\nattained. There must not be secondariness, and 'tis a thousand to one\nthat her air and manner will at once betray that she is not primary, but\nthat there is some other one or many of her class, to whom she\nhabitually postpones herself.  But Nature lifts her easily, and without\nknowing it, over these impossibilities, and we are continually surprised\nwith graces and felicities not only unteachable, but undescribable.\nVI.\nWORSHIP.\nThis is he, who, felled by foes,\nSprung harmless up, refreshed by blows\nHe to captivity was sold,\nBut him no prison-bars would hold:\nThough they sealed him in a rock,\nMountain chains he can unlock:\nThrown to lions for their meat,\nThe crouching lion kissed his feet:\nBound to the stake, no flames appalled,\nBut arched o'er him an honoring vault.\nThis is he men miscall Fate,\nThreading dark ways, arriving late,\nBut ever coming in time to crown\nThe truth, and hurl wrongdoers down.\nHe is the oldest, and best known,\nMore near than aught thou call'st thy own,\nYet, greeted in another's eyes,\nDisconcerts with glad surprise.\nThis is Jove, who, deaf to prayers,\nFloods with blessings unawares.\nDraw, if thou canst, the mystic line,\nSevering rightly his from thine,\nWhich is human, which divine.\nWORSHIP.\nSome of my friends have complained, when the preceding papers were read,\nthat we discussed Fate, Power, and Wealth, on too low a platform; gave\ntoo much line to the evil spirit of the times; too many cakes to\nCerberus; that we ran Cudworth's risk of making, by excess of candor,\nthe argument of atheism so strong, that he could not answer it. I have\nno fears of being forced in my own despite to play, as we say, the\ndevil's attorney.  I have no infirmity of faith; no belief that it is of\nmuch importance what I or any man may say: I am sure that a certain\ntruth will be said through me, though I should be dumb, or though I\nshould try to say the reverse.  Nor do I fear skepticism for any good\nsoul.  A just thinker will allow full swing to his skepticism.  I dip my\npen in the blackest ink, because I am not afraid of falling into my\ninkpot. I have no sympathy with a poor man I knew, who, when suicides\nabounded, told me he dared not look at his razor.  We are of different\nopinions at different hours, but we always may be said to be at heart on\nthe side of truth.\nI see not why we should give ourselves such sanctified airs.  If the\nDivine Providence has hid from men neither disease, nor deformity, nor\ncorrupt society, but has stated itself out in passions, in war, in\ntrade, in the love of power and pleasure, in hunger and need, in\ntyrannies, literatures, and arts,--let us not be so nice that we cannot\nwrite these facts down coarsely as they stand, or doubt but there is a\ncounter-statement as ponderous, which we can arrive at, and which, being\nput, will make all square.  The solar system has no anxiety about its\nreputation, and the credit of truth and honesty is as safe; nor have I\nany fear that a skeptical bias can be given by leaning hard on the sides\nof fate, of practical power, or of trade, which the doctrine of Faith\ncannot down-weigh.  The strength of that principle is not measured in\nounces and pounds: it tyrannizes at the centre of Nature. We may well\ngive skepticism as much line as we can.  The spirit will return, and\nfill us.  It drives the drivers.  It counterbalances any accumulations\nof power.\n\"Heaven kindly gave our blood a moral flow.\"\nWe are born loyal.  The whole creation is made of hooks and eyes, of\nbitumen, of sticking-plaster, and whether your community is made in\nJerusalem or in California, of saints or of wreckers, it coheres in a\nperfect ball.  Men as naturally make a state, or a church, as\ncaterpillars a web.  If they were more refined, it would be less formal,\nit would be nervous, like that of the Shakers, who, from long habit of\nthinking and feeling together, it is said, are affected in the same way,\nat the same time, to work and to play, and as they go with perfect\nsympathy to their tasks in the field or shop, so are they inclined for a\nride or a journey at the same instant, and the horses come up with the\nfamily carriage unbespoken to the door.\nWe are born believing.  A man bears beliefs, as a tree bears apples.  A\nself-poise belongs to every particle; and a rectitude to every mind, and\nis the Nemesis and protector of every society.  I and my neighbors have\nbeen bred in the notion, that, unless we came soon to some good\nchurch,--Calvinism, or Behmenism, or Romanism, or Mormonism,--there\nwould be a universal thaw and dissolution. No Isaiah or Jeremy has\narrived.  Nothing can exceed the anarchy that has followed in our skies.\nThe stern old faiths have all pulverized.  'Tis a whole population of\ngentlemen and ladies out in search of religions.  'Tis as flat anarchy\nin our ecclesiastic realms, as that which existed in Massachusetts, in\nthe Revolution, or which prevails now on the slope of the Rocky\nMountains or Pike's Peak.  Yet we make shift to live.  Men are loyal.\nNature has self-poise in all her works; certain proportions in which\noxygen and azote combine, and, not less a harmony in faculties, a\nfitness in the spring and the regulator.\nThe decline of the influence of Calvin, or Fenelon, or Wesley, or\nChanning, need give us no uneasiness.  The builder of heaven has not so\nill constructed his creature as that the religion, that is, the public\nnature, should fall out: the public and the private element, like north\nand south, like inside and outside, like centrifugal and centripetal,\nadhere to every soul, and cannot be subdued, except the soul is\ndissipated.  God builds his temple in the heart on the ruins of churches\nand religions.\nIn the last chapters, we treated some particulars of the question of\nculture.  But the whole state of man is a state of culture; and its\nflowering and completion may be described as Religion, or Worship.\nThere is always some religion, some hope and fear extended into the\ninvisible,--from the blind boding which nails a horseshoe to the mast or\nthe threshold, up to the song of the Elders in the Apocalypse.  But the\nreligion cannot rise above the state of the votary.  Heaven always bears\nsome proportion to earth.  The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal,\nof the crusaders a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.  In all\nages, souls out of time, extraordinary, prophetic, are born, who are\nrather related to the system of the world, than to their particular age\nand locality. These announce absolute truths, which, with whatever\nreverence received, are speedily dragged down into a savage\ninterpretation.  The interior tribes of our Indians, and some of the\nPacific islanders, flog their gods, when things take an unfavorable\nturn.  The Greek poets did not hesitate to let loose their petulant wit\non their deities also.  Laomedon, in his anger at Neptune and Apollo,\nwho had built Troy for him, and demanded their price, does not hesitate\nto menace them that he will cut their ears off.[5]  Among our Norse\nforefathers, King Olaf's mode of converting Eyvind to Christianity was\nto put a pan of glowing coals on his belly, which burst asunder.  \"Wilt\nthou now, Eyvind, believe in Christ?\" asks Olaf, in excellent faith.\nAnother argument was an adder put into the mouth of the reluctant\ndisciple Rand, who refused to believe.\n[5] Iliad, Book xxi. 1. 455.\nChristianity, in the romantic ages, signified European culture,--the\ngrafted or meliorated tree in a crab forest.  And to marry a pagan wife\nor husband, was to marry Beast, and voluntarily to take a step backwards\ntowards the baboon.\n\"Hengist had verament\nA daughter both fair and gent,\nBut she was heathen Sarazine,\nAnd Vortigern for love fine\nHer took to fere and to wife,\nAnd was cursed in all his life;\nFor he let Christian wed heathen,\nAnd mixed our blood as flesh and mathen.\"[6]\n[6] Moths or worms\nWhat Gothic mixtures the Christian creed drew from the pagan sources,\nRichard of Devizes's chronicle of Richard I.'s crusade, in the twelfth\ncentury, may show.  King Richard taunts God with forsaking him: \"O fie!\nO how unwilling should I be to forsake thee, in so forlorn and dreadful\na position, were I thy lord and advocate, as thou art mine.  In sooth,\nmy standards will in future be despised, not through my fault, but\nthrough thine: in sooth, not through any cowardice of my warfare, art\nthou thyself, my king and my God conquered, this day, and not Richard\nthy vassal.\"  The religion of the early English poets is anomalous, so\ndevout and so blasphemous, in the same breath.  Such is Chaucer's\nextraordinary confusion of heaven and earth in the picture of Dido.\n\"She was so fair,\nSo young, so lusty, with her eyen glad,\nThat if that God that heaven and earthe made\nWould have a love for beauty and goodness,\nAnd womanhede, truth, and seemliness,\nWhom should he loven but this lady sweet?\nThere n' is no woman to him half so meet.\"\nWith these grossnesses, we complacently compare our own taste and\ndecorum.  We think and speak with more temperance and gradation,--but is\nnot indifferentism as bad as superstition?\nWe live in a transition period, when the old faiths which comforted\nnations, and not only so, but made nations, seem to have spent their\nforce. I do not find the religions of men at this moment very creditable\nto them, but either childish and insignificant, or unmanly and\neffeminating.  The fatal trait is the divorce between religion and\nmorality.  Here are know-nothing religions, or churches that proscribe\nintellect; scortatory religions; slave-holding and slave-trading\nreligions; and, even in the decent populations, idolatries wherein the\nwhiteness of the ritual covers scarlet indulgence.  The lover of the old\nreligion complains that our contemporaries, scholars as well as\nmerchants, succumb to a great despair,--have corrupted into a timorous\nconservatism, and believe in nothing.  In our large cities, the\npopulation is godless, materialized,--no bond, no fellow-feeling, no\nenthusiasm.  These are not men, but hungers, thirsts, fevers, and\nappetites walking.  How is it people manage to live on,--so aimless as\nthey are?  After their peppercorn aims are gained, it seems as if the\nlime in their bones alone held them together, and not any worthy\npurpose.  There is no faith in the intellectual, none in the moral\nuniverse.  There is faith in chemistry, in meat, and wine, in wealth, in\nmachinery, in the steam-engine, galvanic battery, turbine-wheels, sewing\nmachines, and in public opinion, but not in divine causes.  A silent\nrevolution has loosed the tension of the old religious sects, and, in\nplace of the gravity and permanence of those societies of opinion, they\nrun into freak and extravagance. In creeds never was such levity;\nwitness the heathenisms in Christianity, the periodic \"revivals,\" the\nMillennium mathematics, the peacock ritualism, the retrogression to\nPopery, the maundering of Mormons, the squalor of Mesmerism, the\ndeliration of rappings, the rat and mouse revelation, thumps in\ntable-drawers, and black art.  The architecture, the music, the prayer,\npartake of the madness: the arts sink into shift and make-believe.  Not\nknowing what to do, we ape our ancestors; the churches stagger backward\nto the mummeries of the dark ages.  By the irresistible maturing of the\ngeneral mind, the Christian traditions have lost their hold. The dogma\nof the mystic offices of Christ being dropped, and he standing on his\ngenius as a moral teacher, 'tis impossible to maintain the old emphasis\nof his personality; and it recedes, as all persons must, before the\nsublimity of the moral laws. From this change, and in the momentary\nabsence of any religious genius that could offset the immense material\nactivity, there is a feeling that religion is gone.  When Paul Leroux\noffered his article \"_Dieu_\" to the conductor of a leading French\njournal, he replied, \"_La question de Dieu manque d'actualite_.\"  In\nItaly, Mr. Gladstone said of the late King of Naples, \"it has been a\nproverb, that he has erected the negation of God into a system of\ngovernment.\"  In this country, the like stupefaction was in the air, and\nthe phrase \"higher law\" became a political jibe.  What proof of\ninfidelity, like the toleration and propagandism of slavery?  What, like\nthe direction of education?  What, like the facility of conversion?\nWhat, like the externality of churches that once sucked the roots of\nright and wrong, and now have perished away till they are a speck of\nwhitewash on the wall?  What proof of skepticism like the base rate at\nwhich the highest mental and moral gifts are held?  Let a man attain the\nhighest and broadest culture that any American has possessed, then let\nhim die by sea-storm, railroad collision, or other accident, and all\nAmerica will acquiesce that the best thing has happened to him; that,\nafter the education has gone far, such is the expensiveness of America,\nthat the best use to put a fine person to, is, to drown him to save his\nboard.\nAnother scar of this skepticism is the distrust in human virtue.  It is\nbelieved by well-dressed proprietors that there is no more virtue than\nthey possess; that the solid portion of society exist for the arts of\ncomfort: that life is an affair to put somewhat between the upper and\nlower mandibles. How prompt the suggestion of a low motive! Certain\npatriots in England devoted themselves for years to creating a public\nopinion that should break down the corn-laws and establish free trade.\n'Well,' says the man in the street, 'Cobden got a stipend out of it.'\nKossuth fled hither across the ocean to try if he could rouse the New\nWorld to a sympathy with European liberty.  'Aye,' says New York, 'he\nmade a handsome thing of it, enough to make him comfortable for life.'\nSee what allowance vice finds in the respectable and well-conditioned\nclass.  If a pickpocket intrude into the society of gentlemen, they\nexert what moral force they have, and he finds himself uncomfortable,\nand glad to get away.  But if an adventurer go through all the forms,\nprocure himself to be elected to a post of trust, as of senator, or\npresident,--though by the same arts as we detest in the\nhouse-thief,--the same gentlemen who agree to discountenance the private\nrogue, will be forward to show civilities and marks of respect to the\npublic one: and no amount of evidence of his crimes will prevent them\ngiving him ovations, complimentary dinners, opening their own houses to\nhim, and priding themselves on his acquaintance.  We were not deceived\nby the professions of the private adventurer,--the louder he talked of\nhis honor, the faster we counted our spoons; but we appeal to the\nsanctified preamble of the messages and proclamations of the public\nsinner, as the proof of sincerity.  It must be that they who pay this\nhomage have said to themselves, On the whole, we don't know about this\nthat you call honesty; a bird in the hand is better.\nEven well-disposed, good sort of people are touched with the same\ninfidelity, and for brave, straightforward action, use half-measures and\ncompromises.  Forgetful that a little measure is a great error,\nforgetful that a wise mechanic uses a sharp tool, they go on choosing\nthe dead men of routine.  But the official men can in nowise help you in\nany question of to-day, they deriving entirely from the old dead things.\nOnly those can help in counsel or conduct who did not make a party\npledge to defend this or that, but who were appointed by God Almighty,\nbefore they came into the world, to stand for this which they uphold.\nIt has been charged that a want of sincerity in the leading men is a\nvice general throughout American society.  But the multitude of the sick\nshall not make us deny the existence of health.  In spite of our\nimbecility and terrors, and \"universal decay of religion,\" &c. &c., the\nmoral sense reappears to-day with the same morning newness that has been\nfrom of old the fountain of beauty and strength. You say, there is no\nreligion now.  'Tis like saying in rainy weather, there is no sun, when\nat that moment we are witnessing one of his superlative effects. The\nreligion of the cultivated class now, to be sure, consists in an\navoidance of acts and engagements which it was once their religion to\nassume.  But this avoidance will yield spontaneous forms in their due\nhour.  There is a principle which is the basis of things, which all\nspeech aims to say, and all action to evolve, a simple, quiet,\nundescribed, undescribable presence, dwelling very peacefully in us, our\nrightful lord: we are not to do, but to let do; not to work, but to be\nworked upon; and to this homage there is a consent of all thoughtful and\njust men in all ages and conditions.  To this sentiment belong vast and\nsudden enlargements of power. 'Tis remarkable that our faith in ecstasy\nconsists with total inexperience of it.  It is the order of the world to\neducate with accuracy the senses and the understanding; and the enginery\nat work to draw out these powers in priority, no doubt, has its office.\nBut we are never without a hint that these powers are mediate and\nservile, and that we are one day to deal with real being,--essences with\nessences. Even the fury of material activity has some results friendly\nto moral health.  The energetic action of the times develops\nindividualism, and the religious appear isolated.  I esteem this a step\nin the right direction.  Heaven deals with us on no representative\nsystem.  Souls are not saved in bundles.  The Spirit saith to the man,\n'How is it with thee? thee personally? is it well? is it ill?'  For a\ngreat nature, it is a happiness to escape a religious\ntraining,--religion of character is so apt to be invaded. Religion must\nalways be a crab fruit: it cannot be grafted and keep its wild beauty.\n\"I have seen,\" said a traveller who had known the extremes of society,\n\"I have seen human nature in all its forms, it is everywhere the same,\nbut the wilder it is, the more virtuous.\"\nWe say, the old forms of religion decay, and that a skepticism\ndevastates the community.  I do not think it can be cured or stayed by\nany modification of theologic creeds, much less by theologic discipline.\nThe cure for false theology is motherwit. Forget your books and\ntraditions, and obey your moral perceptions at this hour.  That which is\nsignified by the words \"moral\" and \"spiritual,\" is a lasting essence,\nand, with whatever illusions we have loaded them, will certainly bring\nback the words, age after age, to their ancient meaning. I know no words\nthat mean so much.  In our definitions, we grope after the _spiritual_\nby describing it as invisible.  The true meaning of _spiritual_ is\n_real_; that law which executes itself, which works without means, and\nwhich cannot be conceived as not existing.  Men talk of \"mere\nmorality,\"--which is much as if one should say, 'poor God, with nobody\nto help him.'  I find the omnipresence and the almightiness in the\nreaction of every atom in Nature.  I can best indicate by examples those\nreactions by which every part of Nature replies to the purpose of the\nactor,--beneficently to the good, penally to the bad.  Let us replace\nsentimentalism by realism, and dare to uncover those simple and terrible\nlaws which, be they seen or unseen, pervade and govern.\nEvery man takes care that his neighbor shall not cheat him.  But a day\ncomes when he begins to care that he do not cheat his neighbor.  Then\nall goes well.  He has changed his market-cart into a chariot of the\nsun.  What a day dawns, when we have taken to heart the doctrine of\nfaith! to prefer, as a better investment, being to doing; being to\nseeming; logic to rhythm and to display; the year to the day; the life\nto the year; character to performance;--and have come to know, that\njustice will be done us; and, if our genius is slow, the term will be\nlong.\n'Tis certain that worship stands in some commanding relation to the\nhealth of man, and to his highest powers, so as to be, in some manner,\nthe source of intellect.  All the great ages have been ages of belief.\nI mean, when there was any extraordinary power of performance, when\ngreat national movements began, when arts appeared, when heroes existed,\nwhen poems were made, the human soul was in earnest, and had fixed its\nthoughts on spiritual verities, with as strict a grasp as that of the\nhands on the sword, or the pencil, or the trowel.  It is true that\ngenius takes its rise out of the mountains of rectitude; that all beauty\nand power which men covet, are somehow born out of that Alpine district;\nthat any extraordinary degree of beauty in man or woman involves a moral\ncharm.  Thus, I think, we very slowly admit in another man a higher\ndegree of moral sentiment than our own,--a finer conscience, more\nimpressionable, or, which marks minuter degrees; an ear to hear acuter\nnotes of right and wrong, than we can.  I think we listen suspiciously\nand very slowly to any evidence to that point.  But, once satisfied of\nsuch superiority, we set no limit to our expectation of his genius.  For\nsuch persons are nearer to the secret of God than others; are bathed by\nsweeter waters; they hear notices, they see visions, where others are\nvacant.  We believe that holiness confers a certain insight, because not\nby our private, but by our public force, can we share and know the\nnature of things.\nThere is an intimate interdependence of intellect and morals.  Given the\nequality of two intellects,--which will form the most reliable\njudgments, the good, or the bad hearted?  \"The heart has its arguments,\nwith which the understanding is not acquainted.\"  For the heart is at\nonce aware of the state of health or disease, which is the controlling\nstate, that is, of sanity or of insanity, prior, of course, to all\nquestion of the ingenuity of arguments, the amount of facts, or the\nelegance of rhetoric.  So intimate is this alliance of mind and heart,\nthat talent uniformly sinks with character. The bias of errors of\nprinciple carries away men into perilous courses, as soon as their will\ndoes not control their passion or talent.  Hence the extraordinary\nblunders, and final wrong head, into which men spoiled by ambition\nusually fall.  Hence the remedy for all blunders, the cure of blindness,\nthe cure of crime, is love.  \"As much love, so much mind,\" said the\nLatin proverb.  The superiority that has no superior; the redeemer and\ninstructor of souls, as it is their primal essence, is love.\nThe moral must be the measure of health.  If your eye is on the eternal,\nyour intellect will grow, and your opinions and actions will have a\nbeauty which no learning or combined advantages of other men can rival.\nThe moment of your loss of faith, and acceptance of the lucrative\nstandard, will be marked in the pause, or solstice of genius, the\nsequent retrogression, and the inevitable loss of attraction to other\nminds.  The vulgar are sensible of the change in you, and of your\ndescent, though they clap you on the back, and congratulate you on your\nincreased common sense.\nOur recent culture has been in natural science. We have learned the\nmanners of the sun and of the moon, of the rivers and the rains, of the\nmineral and elemental kingdoms, of plants and animals. Man has learned\nto weigh the sun, and its weight neither loses nor gains.  The path of a\nstar, the moment of an eclipse, can be determined to the fraction of a\nsecond.  Well, to him the book of History, the book of love, the lures\nof passion, and the commandments of duty are opened: and the next lesson\ntaught, is, the continuation of the inflexible law of matter into the\nsubtile kingdom of will, and of thought; that, if, in sidereal ages,\ngravity and projection keep their craft, and the ball never loses its\nway in its wild path through space,--a secreter gravitation, a secreter\nprojection, rule not less tyrannically in human history, and keep the\nbalance of power from age to age unbroken.  For, though the new element\nof freedom and an individual has been admitted, yet the primordial atoms\nare prefigured and predetermined to moral issues, are in search of\njustice, and ultimate right is done. Religion or worship is the attitude\nof those who see this unity, intimacy, and sincerity; who see that,\nagainst all appearances, the nature of things works for truth and right\nforever.\n'Tis a short sight to limit our faith in laws to those of gravity, of\nchemistry, of botany, and so forth.  Those laws do not stop where our\neyes lose them, but push the same geometry and chemistry up into the\ninvisible plane of social and rational life, so that, look where we\nwill, in a boy's game, or in the strifes of races, a perfect reaction, a\nperpetual judgment keeps watch and ward.  And this appears in a class of\nfacts which concerns all men, within and above their creeds.\nShallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances: It was somebody's\nname, or he happened to be there at the time, or, it was so then, and\nanother day it would have been otherwise.  Strong men believe in cause\nand effect.  The man was born to do it, and his father was born to be\nthe father of him and of this deed, and, by looking narrowly, you shall\nsee there was no luck in the matter, but it was all a problem in\narithmetic, or an experiment in chemistry.  The curve of the flight of\nthe moth is preordained, and all things go by number, rule, and weight.\nSkepticism is unbelief in cause and effect.  A man does not see, that,\nas he eats, so he thinks: as he deals, so he is, and so he appears; he\ndoes not see, that his son is the son of his thoughts and of his\nactions; that fortunes are not exceptions but fruits; that relation and\nconnection are not somewhere and sometimes, but everywhere and always;\nno miscellany, no exemption, no anomaly,--but method, and an even web;\nand what comes out, that was put in.  As we are, so we do; and as we do,\nso is it done to us; we are the builders of our fortunes; cant and lying\nand the attempt to secure a good which does not belong to us, are, once\nfor all, balked and vain.  But, in the human mind, this tie of fate is\nmade alive.  The law is the basis of the human mind.  In us, it is\ninspiration; out there in Nature, we see its fatal strength.  We call it\nthe moral sentiment.\nWe owe to the Hindoo Scriptures a definition of Law, which compares well\nwith any in our Western books.  \"Law it is, which is without name, or\ncolor, or hands, or feet; which is smallest of the least, and largest of\nthe large; all, and knowing all things; which hears without ears, sees\nwithout eyes, moves without feet, and seizes without hands.\"\nIf any reader tax me with using vague and traditional phrases, let me\nsuggest to him, by a few examples, what kind of a trust this is, and how\nreal. Let me show him that the dice are loaded; that the colors are\nfast, because they are the native colors of the fleece; that the globe\nis a battery, because every atom is a magnet; and that the police and\nsincerity of the Universe are secured by God's delegating his divinity\nto every particle; that there is no room for hypocrisy, no margin for\nchoice.\nThe countryman leaving his native village, for the first time, and going\nabroad, finds all his habits broken up.  In a new nation and language,\nhis sect, as Quaker, or Lutheran, is lost.  What! it is not then\nnecessary to the order and existence of society?  He misses this, and\nthe commanding eye of his neighborhood, which held him to decorum. This\nis the peril of New York, of New Orleans, of London, of Paris, to young\nmen.  But after a little experience, he makes the discovery that there\nare no large cities,--none large enough to hide in; that the censors of\naction are as numerous and as near in Paris, as in Littleton or\nPortland; that the gossip is as prompt and vengeful.  There is no\nconcealment, and, for each offence, a several vengeance; that, reaction,\nor _nothing for nothing, or, things are as broad as they are long_, is\nnot a rule for Littleton or Portland, but for the Universe.\nWe cannot spare the coarsest muniment of virtue.  We are disgusted by\ngossip; yet it is of importance to keep the angels in their proprieties.\nThe smallest fly will draw blood, and gossip is a weapon impossible to\nexclude from the privatest, highest, selectest.  Nature created a police\nof many ranks.  God has delegated himself to a million deputies.  From\nthese low external penalties, the scale ascends.  Next come the\nresentments, the fears, which injustice calls out; then, the false\nrelations in which the offender is put to other men; and the reaction of\nhis fault on himself, in the solitude and devastation of his mind.\nYou cannot hide any secret.  If the artist succor his flagging spirits\nby opium or wine, his work will characterize itself as the effect of\nopium or wine. If you make a picture or a statue, it sets the beholder\nin that state of mind you had, when you made it.  If you spend for show,\non building, or gardening, or on pictures, or on equipages, it will so\nappear.  We are all physiognomists and penetrators of character, and\nthings themselves are detective. If you follow the suburban fashion in\nbuilding a sumptuous-looking house for a little money, it will appear to\nall eyes as a cheap dear house.  There is no privacy that cannot be\npenetrated.  No secret can be kept in the civilized world.  Society is a\nmasked ball, where every one hides his real character, and reveals it by\nhiding.  If a man wish to conceal anything he carries, those whom he\nmeets know that he conceals somewhat, and usually know what he conceals.\nIs it otherwise if there be some belief or some purpose he would bury in\nhis breast? 'Tis as hard to hide as fire.  He is a strong man who can\nhold down his opinion.  A man cannot utter two or three sentences,\nwithout disclosing to intelligent ears precisely where he stands in life\nand thought, namely, whether in the kingdom of the senses and the\nunderstanding, or, in that of ideas and imagination, in the realm of\nintuitions and duty.  People seem not to see that their opinion of the\nworld is also a confession of character. We can only see what we are,\nand if we misbehave we suspect others.  The fame of Shakspeare or of\nVoltaire, of Thomas a Kempis, or of Bonaparte, characterizes those who\ngive it.  As gas-light is found to be the best nocturnal police, so the\nuniverse protects itself by pitiless publicity.\nEach must be armed--not necessarily with musket and pike.  Happy, if,\nseeing these, he can feel that he has better muskets and pikes in his\nenergy and constancy.  To every creature is his own weapon, however\nskilfully concealed from himself, a good while.  His work is sword and\nshield. Let him accuse none, let him injure none.  The way to mend the\nbad world, is to create the right world.  Here is a low political\neconomy plotting to cut the throat of foreign competition, and establish\nour own;--excluding others by force, or making war on them; or, by\ncunning tariffs, giving preference to worse wares of ours.  But the real\nand lasting victories are those of peace, and not of war. The way to\nconquer the foreign artisan, is, not to kill him, but to beat his work.\nAnd the Crystal Palaces and World Fairs, with their committees and\nprizes on all kinds of industry, are the result of this feeling.  The\nAmerican workman who strikes ten blows with his hammer, whilst the\nforeign workman only strikes one, is as really vanquishing that\nforeigner, as if the blows were aimed at and told on his person.  I look\non that man as happy, who, when there is question of success, looks into\nhis work for a reply, not into the market, not into opinion, not into\npatronage.  In every variety of human employment, in the mechanical and\nin the fine arts, in navigation, in farming, in legislating, there are\namong the numbers who do their task perfunctorily, as we say, or just to\npass, and as badly as they dare,--there are the working-men, on whom the\nburden of the business falls,--those who love work, and love to see it\nrightly done, who finish their task for its own sake; and the state and\nthe world is happy, that has the most of such finishers.  The world will\nalways do justice at last to such finishers: it cannot otherwise. He who\nhas acquired the ability, may wait securely the occasion of making it\nfelt and appreciated, and know that it will not loiter.  Men talk as if\nvictory were something fortunate.  Work is victory. Wherever work is\ndone, victory is obtained.  There is no chance, and no blanks.  You want\nbut one verdict: if you have your own, you are secure of the rest.  And\nyet, if witnesses are wanted, witnesses are near.  There was never a man\nborn so wise or good, but one or more companions came into the world\nwith him, who delight in his faculty, and report it.  I cannot see\nwithout awe, that no man thinks alone, and no man acts alone, but the\ndivine assessors who came up with him into life,--now under one\ndisguise, now under another,--like a police in citizens' clothes, walk\nwith him, step for step, through all the kingdom of time.\nThis reaction, this sincerity is the property of all things.  To make\nour word or act sublime, we must make it real.  It is our system that\ncounts, not the single word or unsupported action.  Use what language\nyou will, you can never say anything but what you are.  What I am, and\nwhat I think, is conveyed to you, in spite of my efforts to hold it\nback.  What I am has been secretly conveyed from me to another, whilst I\nwas vainly making up my mind to tell him it.  He has heard from me what\nI never spoke.\nAs men get on in life, they acquire a love for sincerity, and somewhat\nless solicitude to be lulled or amused.  In the progress of the\ncharacter, there is an increasing faith in the moral sentiment, and a\ndecreasing faith in propositions.  Young people admire talents, and\nparticular excellences.  As we grow older, we value total powers and\neffects, as the spirit, or quality of the man.  We have another sight,\nand a new standard; an insight which disregards what is done _for_ the\neye, and pierces to the doer; an ear which hears not what men say, but\nhears what they do not say.\nThere was a wise, devout man who is called, in the Catholic Church, St.\nPhilip Neri, of whom many anecdotes touching his discernment and\nbenevolence are told at Naples and Rome.  Among the nuns in a convent\nnot far from Rome, one had appeared, who laid claim to certain rare\ngifts of inspiration and prophecy, and the abbess advised the Holy\nFather, at Rome, of the wonderful powers shown by her novice.  The Pope\ndid not well know what to make of these new claims, and Philip coming in\nfrom a journey, one day, he consulted him. Philip undertook to visit the\nnun, and ascertain her character.  He threw himself on his mule, all\ntravel-soiled as he was, and hastened through the mud and mire to the\ndistant convent.  He told the abbess the wishes of his Holiness, and\nbegged her to summon the nun without delay.  The nun was sent for, and,\nas soon as she came into the apartment, Philip stretched out his leg all\nbespattered with mud, and desired her to draw off his boots. The young\nnun, who had become the object of much attention and respect, drew back\nwith anger, and refused the office: Philip ran out of doors, mounted his\nmule, and returned instantly to the Pope; \"Give yourself no uneasiness,\nHoly Father, any longer: here is no miracle, for here is no humility.\"\nWe need not much mind what people please to say, but what they must say;\nwhat their natures say, though their busy, artful, Yankee understandings\ntry to hold back, and choke that word, and to articulate something\ndifferent.  If we will sit quietly,--what they ought to say is said,\nwith their will, or against their will.  We do not care for you, let us\npretend what we will:--we are always looking through you to the dim\ndictator behind you.  Whilst your habit or whim chatters, we civilly and\nimpatiently wait until that wise superior shall speak again.  Even\nchildren are not deceived by the false reasons which their parents give\nin answer to their questions, whether touching natural facts, or\nreligion, or persons.  When the parent, instead of thinking how it\nreally is, puts them off with a traditional or a hypocritical answer,\nthe children perceive that it is traditional or hypocritical.  To a\nsound constitution the defect of another is at once manifest: and the\nmarks of it are only concealed from us by our own dislocation. An\nanatomical observer remarks, that the sympathies of the chest, abdomen,\nand pelvis, tell at last on the face, and on all its features.  Not only\ndoes our beauty waste, but it leaves word how it went to waste.\nPhysiognomy and phrenology are not new sciences, but declarations of the\nsoul that it is aware of certain new sources of information.  And now\nsciences of broader scope are starting up behind these.  And so for\nourselves, it is really of little importance what blunders in statement\nwe make, so only we make no wilful departures from the truth.  How a\nman's truth comes to mind, long after we have forgotten all his words!\nHow it comes to us in silent hours, that truth is our only armor in all\npassages of life and death!  Wit is cheap, and anger is cheap; but if\nyou cannot argue or explain yourself to the other party, cleave to the\ntruth against me, against thee, and you gain a station from which you\ncannot be dislodged.  The other party will forget the words that you\nspoke, but the part you took continues to plead for you.\nWhy should I hasten to solve every riddle which life offers me?  I am\nwell assured that the Questioner, who brings me so many problems, will\nbring the answers also in due time.  Very rich, very potent, very\ncheerful Giver that he is, he shall have it all his own way, for me.\nWhy should I give up my thought, because I cannot answer an objection to\nit?  Consider only, whether it remains in my life the same it was.  That\nonly which we have within, can we see without.  If we meet no gods, it\nis because we harbor none.  If there is grandeur in you, you will find\ngrandeur in porters and sweeps.  He only is rightly immortal, to whom\nall things are immortal.  I have read somewhere, that none is\naccomplished, so long as any are incomplete; that the happiness of one\ncannot consist with the misery of any other.\nThe Buddhists say, \"No seed will die:\" every seed will grow.  Where is\nthe service which can escape its remuneration?  What is vulgar, and the\nessence of all vulgarity, but the avarice of reward? 'Tis the difference\nof artisan and artist, of talent and genius, of sinner and saint.  The\nman whose eyes are nailed not on the nature of his act, but on the\nwages, whether it be money, or office, or fame,--is almost equally low.\nHe is great, whose eyes are opened to see that the reward of actions\ncannot be escaped, because he is transformed into his action, and taketh\nits nature, which bears its own fruit, like every other tree.  A great\nman cannot be hindered of the effect of his act, because it is\nimmediate.  The genius of life is friendly to the noble, and in the dark\nbrings them friends from far. Fear God, and where you go, men shall\nthink they walk in hallowed cathedrals.\nAnd so I look on those sentiments which make the glory of the human\nbeing, love, humility, faith, as being also the intimacy of Divinity in\nthe atoms; and, that, as soon as the man is right, assurances and\nprevisions emanate from the interior of his body and his mind; as, when\nflowers reach their ripeness, incense exhales from them, and, as a\nbeautiful atmosphere is generated from the planet by the averaged\nemanations from all its rocks and soils.\nThus man is made equal to every event.  He can face danger for the\nright.  A poor, tender, painful body, he can run into flame or bullets\nor pestilence, with duty for his guide.  He feels the insurance of a\njust employment.  I am not afraid of accident, as long as I am in my\nplace.  It is strange that superior persons should not feel that they\nhave some better resistance against cholera, than avoiding green peas\nand salads.  Life is hardly respectable,--is it? if it has no generous,\nguaranteeing task, no duties or affections, that constitute a necessity\nof existing.  Every man's task is his life-preserver.  The conviction\nthat his work is dear to God and cannot be spared, defends him.  The\nlightning-rod that disarms the cloud of its threat is his body in its\nduty.  A high aim reacts on the means, on the days, on the organs of the\nbody.  A high aim is curative, as well as arnica. \"Napoleon,\" says\nGoethe, \"visited those sick of the plague, in order to prove that the\nman who could vanquish fear, could vanquish the plague also; and he was\nright.  'Tis incredible what force the will has in such cases: it\npenetrates the body, and puts it in a state of activity, which repels\nall hurtful influences; whilst fear invites them.\"\nIt is related of William of Orange, that, whilst he was besieging a town\non the continent, a gentleman sent to him on public business came to his\ncamp, and, learning that the King was before the walls, he ventured to\ngo where he was.  He found him directing the operation of his gunners,\nand, having explained his errand, and received his answer, the King\nsaid, \"Do you not know, sir, that every moment you spend here is at the\nrisk of your life?\"  \"I run no more risk,\" replied the gentleman, \"than\nyour Majesty.\"  \"Yes,\" said the King, \"but my duty brings me here, and\nyours does not.\"  In a few minutes, a cannon-ball fell on the spot, and\nthe gentleman was killed.\nThus can the faithful student reverse all the warnings of his early\ninstinct, under the guidance of a deeper instinct.  He learns to welcome\nmisfortune, learns that adversity is the prosperity of the great.  He\nlearns the greatness of humility. He shall work in the dark, work\nagainst failure, pain, and ill-will.  If he is insulted, he can be\ninsulted; all his affair is not to insult.  Hafiz writes,\nAt the last day, men shall wear\nOn their heads the dust,\nAs ensign and as ornament\nOf their lowly trust.\nThe moral equalizes all; enriches, empowers all. It is the coin which\nbuys all, and which all find in their pocket.  Under the whip of the\ndriver, the slave shall feel his equality with saints and heroes. In the\ngreatest destitution and calamity, it surprises man with a feeling of\nelasticity which makes nothing of loss.\nI recall some traits of a remarkable person whose life and discourse\nbetrayed many inspirations of this sentiment.  Benedict was always great\nin the present time.  He had hoarded nothing from the past, neither in\nhis cabinets, neither in his memory.  He had no designs on the future,\nneither for what he should do to men, nor for what men should do for\nhim.  He said, 'I am never beaten until I know that I am beaten.  I meet\npowerful brutal people to whom I have no skill to reply.  They think\nthey have defeated me.  It is so published in society, in the journals;\nI am defeated in this fashion, in all men's sight, perhaps on a dozen\ndifferent lines.  My ledger may show that I am in debt, cannot yet make\nmy ends meet, and vanquish the enemy so.  My race may not be prospering:\nwe are sick, ugly, obscure, unpopular.  My children may be worsted. I\nseem to fail in my friends and clients, too.  That is to say, in all the\nencounters that have yet chanced, I have not been weaponed for that\nparticular occasion, and have been historically beaten; and yet, I know,\nall the time, that I have never been beaten; have never yet fought,\nshall certainly fight, when my hour comes, and shall beat.'  \"A man,\"\nsays the Vishnu Sarma, \"who having well compared his own strength or\nweakness with that of others, after all doth not know the difference, is\neasily overcome by his enemies.\"\n'I spent,' he said, 'ten months in the country. Thick-starred Orion was\nmy only companion. Wherever a squirrel or a bee can go with security, I\ncan go.  I ate whatever was set before me; I touched ivy and dogwood.\nWhen I went abroad, I kept company with every man on the road, for I\nknew that my evil and my good did not come from these, but from the\nSpirit, whose servant I was. For I could not stoop to be a circumstance,\nas they did, who put their life into their fortune and their company.  I\nwould not degrade myself by casting about in my memory for a thought,\nnor by waiting for one.  If the thought come, I would give it\nentertainment.  It should, as it ought, go into my hands and feet; but\nif it come not spontaneously, it comes not rightly at all.  If it can\nspare me, I am sure I can spare it.  It shall be the same with my\nfriends.  I will never woo the loveliest.  I will not ask any friendship\nor favor.  When I come to my own, we shall both know it.  Nothing will\nbe to be asked or to be granted.'  Benedict went out to seek his friend,\nand met him on the way; but he expressed no surprise at any\ncoincidences.  On the other hand, if he called at the door of his\nfriend, and he was not at home, he did not go again; concluding that he\nhad misinterpreted the intimations.\nHe had the whim not to make an apology to the same individual whom he\nhad wronged.  For this, he said, was a piece of personal vanity; but he\nwould correct his conduct in that respect in which he had faulted, to\nthe next person he should meet.  Thus, he said, universal justice was\nsatisfied.\nMira came to ask what she should do with the poor Genesee woman who had\nhired herself to work for her, at a shilling a day, and, now sickening,\nwas like to be bedridden on her hands.  Should she keep her, or should\nshe dismiss her?  But Benedict said, 'Why ask?  One thing will clear\nitself as the thing to be done, and not another, when the hour comes.\nIs it a question, whether to put her into the street?  Just as much\nwhether to thrust the little Jenny on your arm into the street.  The\nmilk and meal you give the beggar, will fatten Jenny.  Thrust the woman\nout, and you thrust your babe out of doors, whether it so seem to you or\nnot.'\nIn the Shakers, so called, I find one piece of belief, in the doctrine\nwhich they faithfully hold, that encourages them to open their doors to\nevery wayfaring man who proposes to come among them; for, they say, the\nSpirit will presently manifest to the man himself, and to the society,\nwhat manner of person he is, and whether he belongs among them. They do\nnot receive him, they do not reject him. And not in vain have they worn\ntheir clay coat, and drudged in their fields, and shuffled in their\nBruin dance, from year to year, if they have truly learned thus much\nwisdom.\nHonor him whose life is perpetual victory; him, who, by sympathy with\nthe invisible and real, finds support in labor, instead of praise; who\ndoes not shine, and would rather not.  With eyes open, he makes the\nchoice of virtue, which outrages the virtuous; of religion, which\nchurches stop their discords to burn and exterminate; for the highest\nvirtue is always against the law.\nMiracle comes to the miraculous, not to the arithmetician.  Talent and\nsuccess interest me but moderately.  The great class, they who affect\nour imagination, the men who could not make their hands meet around\ntheir objects, the rapt, the lost, the fools of ideas,--they suggest\nwhat they cannot execute.  They speak to the ages, and are heard from\nafar.  The Spirit does not love cripples and malformations.  If there\never was a good man, be certain, there was another, and will be more.\nAnd so in relation to that future hour, that spectre clothed with beauty\nat our curtain by night, at our table by day,--the apprehension, the\nassurance of a coming change.  The race of mankind have always offered\nat least this implied thanks for the gift of existence,--namely, the\nterror of its being taken away; the insatiable curiosity and appetite\nfor its continuation.  The whole revelation that is vouchsafed us, is,\nthe gentle trust, which, in our experience we find, will cover also with\nflowers the slopes of this chasm.\nOf immortality, the soul, when well employed, is incurious.  It is so\nwell, that it is sure it will be well.  It asks no questions of the\nSupreme Power. The son of Antiochus asked his father, when he would join\nbattle?  \"Dost thou fear,\" replied the King, \"that thou only in all the\narmy wilt not hear the trumpet?\"  'Tis a higher thing to confide, that,\nif it is best we should live, we shall live,--'tis higher to have this\nconviction, than to have the lease of indefinite centuries and\nmillenniums and aeons.  Higher than the question of our duration is the\nquestion of our deserving.  Immortality will come to such as are fit for\nit, and he who would be a great soul in future, must be a great soul\nnow. It is a doctrine too great to rest on any legend, that is, on any\nman's experience but our own.  It must be proved, if at all, from our\nown activity and designs, which imply an interminable future for their\nplay.\nWhat is called religion effeminates and demoralizes. Such as you are,\nthe gods themselves could not help you.  Men are too often unfit to\nlive, from their obvious inequality to their own necessities, or, they\nsuffer from politics, or bad neighbors, or from sickness, and they would\ngladly know that they were to be dismissed from the duties of life.  But\nthe wise instinct asks, 'How will death help them?'  These are not\ndismissed when they die.  You shall not wish for death out of\npusillanimity.  The weight of the Universe is pressed down on the\nshoulders of each moral agent to hold him to his task.  The only path of\nescape known in all the worlds of God is performance.  You must do your\nwork, before you shall be released.  And as far as it is a question of\nfact respecting the government of the Universe, Marcus Antoninus summed\nthe whole in a word, \"It is pleasant to die, if there be gods; and sad\nto live, if there be none.\"\nAnd so I think that the last lesson of life, the choral song which rises\nfrom all elements and all angels, is, a voluntary obedience, a\nnecessitated freedom.  Man is made of the same atoms as the world is, he\nshares the same impressions, predispositions, and destiny.  When his\nmind is illuminated, when his heart is kind, he throws himself joyfully\ninto the sublime order, and does, with knowledge, what the stones do by\nstructure.\nThe religion which is to guide and fulfil the present and coming ages,\nwhatever else it be, must be intellectual.  The scientific mind must\nhave a faith which is science.  \"There are two things,\" said Mahomet,\n\"which I abhor, the learned in his infidelities, and the fool in his\ndevotions.\"  Our times are impatient of both, and specially of the last.\nLet us have nothing now which is not its own evidence.  There is surely\nenough for the heart and imagination in the religion itself.  Let us not\nbe pestered with assertions and half-truths, with emotions and snuffle.\nThere will be a new church founded on moral science, at first cold and\nnaked, a babe in a manger again, the algebra and mathematics of ethical\nlaw, the church of men to come, without shawms, or psaltery, or sackbut;\nbut it will have heaven and earth for its beams and rafters; science for\nsymbol and illustration; it will fast enough gather beauty, music,\npicture, poetry.  Was never stoicism so stern and exigent as this shall\nbe.  It shall send man home to his central solitude, shame these social,\nsupplicating manners, and make him know that much of the time he must\nhave himself to his friend.  He shall expect no cooeperation, he shall\nwalk with no companion.  The nameless Thought, the nameless Power, the\nsuperpersonal Heart,--he shall repose alone on that.  He needs only his\nown verdict.  No good fame can help, no bad fame can hurt him.  The Laws\nare his consolers, the good Laws themselves are alive, they know if he\nhave kept them, they animate him with the leading of great duty, and an\nendless horizon.  Honor and fortune exist to him who always recognizes\nthe neighborhood of the great, always feels himself in the presence of\nhigh causes.\nVII.\nCONSIDERATIONS BY THE WAY.\nHear what British Merlin sung,\nOf keenest eye and truest tongue.\nSay not, the chiefs who first arrive\nUsurp the seats for which all strive;\nThe forefathers this land who found\nFailed to plant the vantage-ground;\nEver from one who comes to-morrow\nMen wait their good and truth to borrow.\nBut wilt thou measure all thy road,\nSee thou lift the lightest load.\nWho has little, to him who has less, can spare,\nAnd thou, Cyndyllan's son! beware\nPonderous gold and stuffs to bear,\nTo falter ere thou thy task fulfil,--\nOnly the light-armed climb the hill.\nThe richest of all lords is Use,\nAnd ruddy Health the loftiest Muse.\nLive in the sunshine, swim the sea,\nDrink the wild air's salubrity:\nWhere the star Canope shines in May,\nShepherds are thankful, and nations gay.\nThe music that can deepest reach,\nAnd cure all ill, is cordial speech:\nMask thy wisdom with delight,\nToy with the bow, yet hit the white.\nOf all wit's uses, the main one\nIs to live well with who has none.\nCleave to thine acre; the round year\nWill fetch all fruits and virtues here:\nFool and foe may harmless roam,\nLoved and lovers bide at home,\nA day for toil, an hour for sport,\nBut for a friend is life too short.\nCONSIDERATIONS BY THE WAY.\nAlthough this garrulity of advising is born with us, I confess that life\nis rather a subject of wonder, than of didactics.  So much fate, so much\nirresistible dictation from temperament and unknown inspiration enters\ninto it, that we doubt we can say anything out of our own experience\nwhereby to help each other.  All the professions are timid and expectant\nagencies.  The priest is glad if his prayers or his sermon meet the\ncondition of any soul; if of two, if of ten, 'tis a signal success.  But\nhe walked to the church without any assurance that he knew the\ndistemper, or could heal it.  The physician prescribes hesitatingly out\nof his few resources, the same tonic or sedative to this new and\npeculiar constitution, which he has applied with various success to a\nhundred men before.  If the patient mends, he is glad and surprised.\nThe lawyer advises the client, and tells his story to the jury, and\nleaves it with them, and is as gay and as much relieved as the client,\nif it turns out that he has a verdict.  The judge weighs the arguments,\nand puts a brave face on the matter, and, since there must be a\ndecision, decides as he can, and hopes he has done justice, and given\nsatisfaction to the community; but is only an advocate after all.  And\nso is all life a timid and unskilful spectator.  We do what we must, and\ncall it by the best names. We like very well to be praised for our\naction, but our conscience says, \"Not unto us.\"  'Tis little we can do\nfor each other.  We accompany the youth with sympathy, and manifold old\nsayings of the wise, to the gate of the arena, but 'tis certain that not\nby strength of ours, or of the old sayings, but only on strength of his\nown, unknown to us or to any, he must stand or fall.  That by which a\nman conquers in any passage, is a profound secret to every other being\nin the world, and it is only as he turns his back on us and on all men,\nand draws on this most private wisdom, that any good can come to him.\nWhat we have, therefore, to say of life, is rather description, or, if\nyou please, celebration, than available rules.\nYet vigor is contagious, and whatever makes us either think or feel\nstrongly, adds to our power, and enlarges our field of action.  We have\na debt to every great heart, to every fine genius; to those who have put\nlife and fortune on the cast of an act of justice; to those who have\nadded new sciences; to those who have refined life by elegant pursuits.\n'Tis the fine souls who serve us, and not what is called fine society.\nFine society is only a self-protection against the vulgarities of the\nstreet and the tavern.  Fine society, in the common acceptation, has\nneither ideas nor aims.  It renders the service of a perfumery, or a\nlaundry, not of a farm or factory.  'Tis an exclusion and a precinct.\nSidney Smith said, \"A few yards in London cement or dissolve\nfriendship.\"  It is an unprincipled decorum; an affair of clean linen\nand coaches, of gloves, cards, and elegance in trifles.  There are other\nmeasures of self-respect for a man, than the number of clean shirts he\nputs on every day. Society wishes to be amused.  I do not wish to be\namused.  I wish that life should not be cheap, but sacred.  I wish the\ndays to be as centuries, loaded, fragrant.  Now we reckon them as\nbank-days, by some debt which is to be paid us, or which we are to pay,\nor some pleasure we are to taste.  Is all we have to do to draw the\nbreath in, and blow it out again?  Porphyry's definition is better;\n\"Life is that which holds matter together.\"  The babe in arms is a\nchannel through which the energies we call fate, love, and reason,\nvisibly stream.  See what a cometary train of auxiliaries man carries\nwith him, of animals, plants, stones, gases, and imponderable elements.\nLet us infer his ends from this pomp of means.  Mirabeau said, \"Why\nshould we feel ourselves to be men, unless it be to succeed in\neverything, everywhere.  You must say of nothing, _That is beneath me_,\nnor feel that anything can be out of your power.  Nothing is impossible\nto the man who can will.  _Is that necessary?  That shall be_:--this is\nthe only law of success.\"  Whoever said it, this is in the right key.\nBut this is not the tone and genius of the men in the street. In the\nstreets, we grow cynical.  The men we meet are coarse and torpid.  The\nfinest wits have their sediment.  What quantities of fribbles, paupers,\ninvalids, epicures, antiquaries, politicians, thieves, and triflers of\nboth sexes, might be advantageously spared!  Mankind divides itself into\ntwo classes,--benefactors and malefactors.  The second class is vast,\nthe first a handful.  A person seldom falls sick, but the bystanders are\nanimated with a faint hope that he will die:--quantities of poor lives;\nof distressing invalids; of cases for a gun. Franklin said, \"Mankind are\nvery superficial and dastardly: they begin upon a thing, but, meeting\nwith a difficulty, they fly from it discouraged: but they have\ncapacities, if they would employ them.\"  Shall we then judge a country\nby the majority, or by the minority?  By the minority, surely. 'Tis\npedantry to estimate nations by the census, or by square miles of land,\nor other than by their importance to the mind of the time.\nLeave this hypocritical prating about the masses. Masses are rude, lame,\nunmade, pernicious in their demands and influence, and need not to be\nflattered but to be schooled.  I wish not to concede anything to them,\nbut to tame, drill, divide, and break them up, and draw individuals out\nof them.  The worst of charity is, that the lives you are asked to\npreserve are not worth preserving.  Masses! the calamity is the masses.\nI do not wish any mass at all, but honest men only, lovely, sweet,\naccomplished women only, and no shovel-handed, narrow-brained,\ngin-drinking million stockingers or lazzaroni at all.  If government\nknew how, I should like to see it check, not multiply the population.\nWhen it reaches its true law of action, every man that is born will be\nhailed as essential. Away with this hurrah of masses, and let us have\nthe considerate vote of single men spoken on their honor and their\nconscience.  In old Egypt, it was established law, that the vote of a\nprophet be reckoned equal to a hundred hands.  I think it was much\nunder-estimated.  \"Clay and clay differ in dignity,\" as we discover by\nour preferences every day.  What a vicious practice is this of our\npoliticians at Washington pairing off! as if one man who votes wrong,\ngoing away, could excuse you, who mean to vote right, for going away;\nor, as if your presence did not tell in more ways than in your vote.\nSuppose the three hundred heroes at Thermopylae had paired off with\nthree hundred Persians: would it have been all the same to Greece, and\nto history?  Napoleon was called by his men _Cent Mille_.  Add honesty\nto him, and they might have called him Hundred Million.\nNature makes fifty poor melons for one that is good, and shakes down a\ntree full of gnarled, wormy, unripe crabs, before you can find a dozen\ndessert apples; and she scatters nations of naked Indians, and nations\nof clothed Christians, with two or three good heads among them.  Nature\nworks very hard, and only hits the white once in a million throws.  In\nmankind, she is contented if she yields one master in a century.  The\nmore difficulty there is in creating good men, the more they are used\nwhen they come.  I once counted in a little neighborhood, and found that\nevery able-bodied man had, say from twelve to fifteen persons dependent\non him for material aid,--to whom he is to be for spoon and jug, for\nbacker and sponsor, for nursery and hospital, and many functions beside:\nnor does it seem to make much difference whether he is bachelor or\npatriarch; if he do not violently decline the duties that fall to him,\nthis amount of helpfulness will in one way or another be brought home to\nhim.  This is the tax which his abilities pay.  The good men are\nemployed for private centres of use, and for larger influence.  All\nrevelations, whether of mechanical or intellectual or moral science, are\nmade not to communities, but to single persons. All the marked events of\nour day, all the cities, all the colonizations, may be traced back to\ntheir origin in a private brain.  All the feats which make our civility\nwere the thoughts of a few good heads.\nMeantime, this spawning productivity is not noxious or needless.  You\nwould say, this rabble of nations might be spared.  But no, they are all\ncounted and depended on.  Fate keeps everything alive so long as the\nsmallest thread of public necessity holds it on to the tree.  The\ncoxcomb and bully and thief class are allowed as proletaries, every one\nof their vices being the excess or acridity of a virtue.  The mass are\nanimal, in pupilage, and near chimpanzee.  But the units, whereof this\nmass is composed are neuters, every one of which may be grown to a\nqueen-bee.  The rule is, we are used as brute atoms, until we think:\nthen, we use all the rest.  Nature turns all malfaisance to good.\nNature provided for real needs.  No sane man at last distrusts himself.\nHis existence is a perfect answer to all sentimental cavils.  If he is,\nhe is wanted, and has the precise properties that are required.  That we\nare here, is proof we ought to be here.  We have as good right, and the\nsame sort of right to be here, as Cape Cod or Sandy Hook have to be\nthere.\nTo say then, the majority are wicked, means no malice, no bad heart in\nthe observer, but, simply, that the majority are unripe, and have not\nyet come to themselves, do not yet know their opinion. That, if they\nknew it, is an oracle for them and for all.  But in the passing moment,\nthe quadruped interest is very prone to prevail: and this beast-force,\nwhilst it makes the discipline of the world, the school of heroes, the\nglory of martyrs, has provoked, in every age, the satire of wits, and\nthe tears of good men.  They find the journals, the clubs, the\ngovernments, the churches, to be in the interest, and the pay of the\ndevil.  And wise men have met this obstruction in their times, like\nSocrates, with his famous irony; like Bacon, with life-long\ndissimulation; like Erasmus, with his book \"The Praise of Folly;\" like\nRabelais, with his satire rending the nations.  \"They were the fools who\ncried against me, you will say,\" wrote the Chevalier de Boufflers to\nGrimm; \"aye, but the fools have the advantage of numbers, and 'tis that\nwhich decides.  'Tis of no use for us to make war with them; we shall\nnot weaken them; they will always be the masters. There will not be a\npractice or an usage introduced, of which they are not the authors.\"\nIn front of these sinister facts, the first lesson of history is the\ngood of evil.  Good is a good doctor, but Bad is sometimes a better.\n'Tis the oppressions of William the Norman, savage forest-laws, and\ncrushing despotism, that made possible the inspirations of _Magna\nCharta_ under John.  Edward I. wanted money, armies, castles, and as\nmuch as he could get.  It was necessary to call the people together by\nshorter, swifter ways,--and the House of Commons arose.  To obtain\nsubsidies, he paid in privileges.  In the twenty-fourth year of his\nreign, he decreed, \"that no tax should be levied without consent of\nLords and Commons;\"--which is the basis of the English Constitution.\nPlutarch affirms that the cruel wars which followed the march of\nAlexander, introduced the civility, language, and arts of Greece into\nthe savage East; introduced marriage; built seventy cities; and united\nhostile nations under one government.  The barbarians who broke up the\nRoman empire did not arrive a day too soon. Schiller says, the Thirty\nYears' War made Germany a nation.  Rough, selfish despots serve men\nimmensely, as Henry VIII. in the contest with the Pope; as the\ninfatuations no less than the wisdom of Cromwell; as the ferocity of the\nRussian czars; as the fanaticism of the French regicides of 1789. The\nfrost which kills the harvest of a year, saves the harvests of a\ncentury, by destroying the weevil or the locust.  Wars, fires, plagues,\nbreak up immovable routine, clear the ground of rotten races and dens of\ndistemper, and open a fair field to new men.  There is a tendency in\nthings to right themselves, and the war or revolution or bankruptcy that\nshatters a rotten system, allows things to take a new and natural order.\nThe sharpest evils are bent into that periodicity which makes the errors\nof planets, and the fevers and distempers of men, self-limiting.  Nature\nis upheld by antagonism.  Passions, resistance, danger, are educators.\nWe acquire the strength we have overcome.  Without war, no soldier;\nwithout enemies, no hero. The sun were insipid, if the universe were not\nopaque.  And the glory of character is in affronting the horrors of\ndepravity, to draw thence new nobilities of power: as Art lives and\nthrills in new use and combining of contrasts, and mining into the dark\nevermore for blacker pits of night. What would painter do, or what would\npoet or saint, but for crucifixions and hells?  And evermore in the\nworld is this marvellous balance of beauty and disgust, magnificence and\nrats.  Not Antoninus, but a poor washer-woman said, \"The more trouble,\nthe more lion; that's my principle.\"  I do not think very respectfully\nof the designs or the doings of the people who went to California, in\n1849.  It was a rush and a scramble of needy adventurers, and, in the\nwestern country, a general jail-delivery of all the rowdies of the\nrivers.  Some of them went with honest purposes, some with very bad\nones, and all of them with the very commonplace wish to find a short way\nto wealth.  But Nature watches over all, and turns this malfaisance to\ngood.  California gets peopled and subdued,--civilized in this immoral\nway,--and, on this fiction, a real prosperity is rooted and grown.  'Tis\na decoy-duck; 'tis tubs thrown to amuse the whale: but real ducks, and\nwhales that yield oil, are caught.  And, out of Sabine rapes, and out of\nrobbers' forays, real Romes and their heroisms come in fulness of time.\nIn America, the geography is sublime, but the men are not: the\ninventions are excellent, but the inventors one is sometimes ashamed of.\nThe agencies by which events so grand as the opening of California, of\nTexas, of Oregon, and the junction of the two oceans, are effected, are\npaltry,--coarse selfishness, fraud, and conspiracy: and most of the\ngreat results of history are brought about by discreditable means.\nThe benefaction derived in Illinois, and the great West, from railroads\nis inestimable, and vastly exceeding any intentional philanthropy on\nrecord. What is the benefit done by a good King Alfred, or by a Howard,\nor Pestalozzi, or Elizabeth Fry, or Florence Nightingale, or any lover,\nless or larger, compared with the involuntary blessing wrought on\nnations by the selfish capitalists who built the Illinois, Michigan, and\nthe network of the Mississippi valley roads, which have evoked not only\nall the wealth of the soil, but the energy of millions of men.  'Tis a\nsentence of ancient wisdom, \"that God hangs the greatest weights on the\nsmallest wires.\"\nWhat happens thus to nations, befalls every day in private houses.  When\nthe friends of a gentleman brought to his notice the follies of his sons\nwith many hints of their danger, he replied, that he knew so much\nmischief when he was a boy, and had turned out on the whole so\nsuccessfully, that he was not alarmed by the dissipation of boys; 'twas\ndangerous water, but, he thought, they would soon touch bottom, and then\nswim to the top. This is bold practice, and there are many failures to a\ngood escape.  Yet one would say, that a good understanding would suffice\nas well as moral sensibility to keep one erect; the gratifications of\nthe passions are so quickly seen to be damaging, and,--what men like\nleast,--seriously lowering them in social rank.  Then all talent sinks\nwith character.\n\"_Croyez moi, l'erreur aussi a son merite_,\" said Voltaire.  We see\nthose who surmount, by dint of some egotism or infatuation, obstacles\nfrom which the prudent recoil.  The right partisan is a heady narrow\nman, who, because he does not see many things, sees some one thing with\nheat and exaggeration, and, if he falls among other narrow men, or on\nobjects which have a brief importance, as some trade or politics of the\nhour, he prefers it to the universe, and seems inspired, and a godsend\nto those who wish to magnify the matter, and carry a point.  Better,\ncertainly, if we could secure the strength and fire which rude,\npassionate men bring into society, quite clear of their vices.  But who\ndares draw out the linchpin from the wagon-wheel? 'Tis so manifest, that\nthere is no moral deformity, but is a good passion out of place; that\nthere is no man who is not indebted to his foibles; that, according to\nthe old oracle, \"the Furies are the bonds of men;\" that the poisons are\nour principal medicines, which kill the disease, and save the life.  In\nthe high prophetic phrase, _He causes the wrath of man to praise him_,\nand twists and wrenches our evil to our good. Shakspeare wrote,--\n\"'Tis said, best men are moulded of their faults;\"\nand great educators and lawgivers, and especially generals, and leaders\nof colonies, mainly rely on this stuff, and esteem men of irregular and\npassional force the best timber.  A man of sense and energy, the late\nhead of the Farm School in Boston harbor, said to me, \"I want none of\nyour good boys,--give me the bad ones.\"  And this is the reason, I\nsuppose, why, as soon as the children are good, the mothers are scared,\nand think they are going to die.  Mirabeau said, \"There are none but men\nof strong passions capable of going to greatness; none but such capable\nof meriting the public gratitude.\"  Passion, though a bad regulator, is\na powerful spring.  Any absorbing passion has the effect to deliver from\nthe little coils and cares of every day: 'tis the heat which sets our\nhuman atoms spinning, overcomes the friction of crossing thresholds, and\nfirst addresses in society, and gives us a good start and speed, easy to\ncontinue, when once it is begun.  In short, there is no man who is not\nat some time indebted to his vices, as no plant that is not fed from\nmanures.  We only insist that the man meliorate, and that the plant grow\nupward, and convert the base into the better nature.\nThe wise workman will not regret the poverty or the solitude which\nbrought out his working talents. The youth is charmed with the fine air\nand accomplishments of the children of fortune.  But all great men come\nout of the middle classes.  'Tis better for the head; 'tis better for\nthe heart.  Marcus Antoninus says, that Fronto told him, \"that the\nso-called high-born are for the most part heartless;\" whilst nothing is\nso indicative of deepest culture as a tender consideration of the\nignorant.  Charles James Fox said of England, \"The history of this\ncountry proves, that we are not to expect from men in affluent\ncircumstances the vigilance, energy, and exertion without which the\nHouse of Commons would lose its greatest force and weight.  Human nature\nis prone to indulgence, and the most meritorious public services have\nalways been performed by persons in a condition of life removed from\nopulence.\"  And yet what we ask daily, is to be conventional.  Supply,\nmost kind gods! this defect in my address, in my form, in my fortunes,\nwhich puts me a little out of the ring: supply it, and let me be like\nthe rest whom I admire, and on good terms with them.  But the wise gods\nsay, No, we have better things for thee.  By humiliations, by defeats,\nby loss of sympathy, by gulfs of disparity, learn a wider truth and\nhumanity than that of a fine gentleman.  A Fifth-Avenue landlord, a\nWest-End householder, is not the highest style of man: and, though good\nhearts and sound minds are of no condition, yet he who is to be wise for\nmany, must not be protected.  He must know the huts where poor men lie,\nand the chores which poor men do.  The first-class minds, AEsop,\nSocrates, Cervantes, Shakspeare, Franklin, had the poor man's feeling\nand mortification.  A rich man was never insulted in his life: but this\nman must be stung.  A rich man was never in danger from cold, or hunger,\nor war, or ruffians, and you can see he was not, from the moderation of\nhis ideas.  'Tis a fatal disadvantage to be cockered, and to eat too\nmuch cake.  What tests of manhood could he stand?  Take him out of his\nprotections.  He is a good book-keeper; or he is a shrewd adviser in the\ninsurance office: perhaps he could pass a college examination, and take\nhis degrees: perhaps he can give wise counsel in a court of law.  Now\nplant him down among farmers, firemen, Indians, and emigrants.  Set a\ndog on him: set a highwayman on him: try him with a course of mobs: send\nhim to Kansas, to Pike's Peak, to Oregon: and, if he have true faculty,\nthis may be the element he wants, and he will come out of it with\nbroader wisdom and manly power. AEsop, Saadi, Cervantes, Regnard, have\nbeen taken by corsairs, left for dead, sold for slaves, and know the\nrealities of human life.\nBad times have a scientific value.  These are occasions a good learner\nwould not miss.  As we go gladly to Faneuil Hall, to be played upon by\nthe stormy winds and strong fingers of enraged patriotism, so is a\nfanatical persecution, civil war, national bankruptcy, or revolution,\nmore rich in the central tones than languid years of prosperity. What\nhad been, ever since our memory, solid continent, yawns apart, and\ndiscloses its composition and genesis.  We learn geology the morning\nafter the earthquake, on ghastly diagrams of cloven mountains, upheaved\nplains, and the dry bed of the sea.\nIn our life and culture, everything is worked up, and comes in\nuse,--passion, war, revolt, bankruptcy, and not less, folly and\nblunders, insult, ennui, and bad company.  Nature is a rag-merchant, who\nworks up every shred and ort and end into new creations; like a good\nchemist, whom I found, the other day, in his laboratory, converting his\nold shirts into pure white sugar.  Life is a boundless privilege, and\nwhen you pay for your ticket, and get into the car, you have no guess\nwhat good company you shall find there.  You buy much that is not\nrendered in the bill.  Men achieve a certain greatness unawares, when\nworking to another aim.\nIf now in this connection of discourse, we should venture on laying down\nthe first obvious rules of life, I will not here repeat the first rule\nof economy, already propounded once and again, that every man shall\nmaintain himself,--but I will say, get health.  No labor, pains,\ntemperance, poverty, nor exercise, that can gain it, must be grudged.\nFor sickness is a cannibal which eats up all the life and youth it can\nlay hold of, and absorbs its own sons and daughters.  I figure it as a\npale, wailing, distracted phantom, absolutely selfish, heedless of what\nis good and great, attentive to its sensations, losing its soul, and\nafflicting other souls with meanness and mopings, and with ministration\nto its voracity of trifles.  Dr. Johnson said severely, \"Every man is a\nrascal as soon as he is sick.\"  Drop the cant, and treat it sanely.  In\ndealing with the drunken, we do not affect to be drunk. We must treat\nthe sick with the same firmness, giving them, of course, every aid,--but\nwithholding ourselves.  I once asked a clergyman in a retired town, who\nwere his companions? what men of ability he saw? he replied, that he\nspent his time with the sick and the dying.  I said, he seemed to me to\nneed quite other company, and all the more that he had this: for if\npeople were sick and dying to any purpose, we would leave all and go to\nthem, but, as far as I had observed, they were as frivolous as the rest,\nand sometimes much more frivolous.  Let us engage our companions not to\nspare us.  I knew a wise woman who said to her friends, \"When I am old,\nrule me.\"  And the best part of health is fine disposition.  It is more\nessential than talent, even in the works of talent.  Nothing will supply\nthe want of sunshine to peaches, and, to make knowledge valuable, you\nmust have the cheerfulness of wisdom.  Whenever you are sincerely\npleased, you are nourished.  The joy of the spirit indicates its\nstrength.  All healthy things are sweet-tempered.  Genius works in\nsport, and goodness smiles to the last; and, for the reason, that\nwhoever sees the law which distributes things, does not despond, but is\nanimated to great desires and endeavors.  He who desponds betrays that\nhe has not seen it.\n'Tis a Dutch proverb, that \"paint costs nothing,\" such are its\npreserving qualities in damp climates. Well, sunshine costs less, yet is\nfiner pigment.  And so of cheerfulness, or a good temper, the more it is\nspent, the more of it remains.  The latent heat of an ounce of wood or\nstone is inexhaustible.  You may rub the same chip of pine to the point\nof kindling, a hundred times; and the power of happiness of any soul is\nnot to be computed or drained.  It is observed that a depression of\nspirits develops the germs of a plague in individuals and nations.\nIt is an old commendation of right behavior, \"_Aliis loetus, sapiens\nsibi_,\" which our English proverb translates, \"Be merry _and_ wise.\"  I\nknow how easy it is to men of the world to look grave and sneer at your\nsanguine youth, and its glittering dreams.  But I find the gayest\ncastles in the air that were ever piled, far better for comfort and for\nuse, than the dungeons in the air that are daily dug and caverned out by\ngrumbling, discontented people. I know those miserable fellows, and I\nhate them, who see a black star always riding through the light and\ncolored clouds in the sky overhead: waves of light pass over and hide it\nfor a moment, but the black star keeps fast in the zenith.  But power\ndwells with cheerfulness; hope puts us in a working mood, whilst despair\nis no muse, and untunes the active powers.  A man should make life and\nNature happier to us, or he had better never been born.  When the\npolitical economist reckons up the unproductive classes, he should put\nat the head this class of pitiers of themselves, cravers of sympathy,\nbewailing imaginary disasters.  An old French verse runs, in my\ntranslation:--\nSome of your griefs you have cured,\nAnd the sharpest you still have survived;\nBut what torments of pain you endured\nFrom evils that never arrived!\nThere are three wants which never can be satisfied: that of the rich,\nwho wants something more; that of the sick, who wants something\ndifferent; and that of the traveller, who says, 'Anywhere but here.'\nThe Turkish cadi said to Layard, \"After the fashion of thy people, thou\nhast wandered from one place to another, until thou art happy and\ncontent in none.\"  My countrymen are not less infatuated with the\n_rococo_ toy of Italy.  All America seems on the point of embarking for\nEurope.  But we shall not always traverse seas and lands with light\npurposes, and for pleasure, as we say.  One day we shall cast out the\npassion for Europe, by the passion for America.  Culture will give\ngravity and domestic rest to those who now travel only as not knowing\nhow else to spend money.  Already, who provoke pity like that excellent\nfamily party just arriving in their well-appointed carriage, as far from\nhome and any honest end as ever?  Each nation has asked successively,\n'What are they here for?' until at last the party are shamefaced, and\nanticipate the question at the gates of each town.\nGenial manners are good, and power of accommodation to any circumstance,\nbut the high prize of life, the crowning fortune of a man is to be born\nwith a bias to some pursuit, which finds him in employment and\nhappiness,--whether it be to make baskets, or broadswords, or canals, or\nstatutes, or songs.  I doubt not this was the meaning of Socrates, when\nhe pronounced artists the only truly wise, as being actually, not\napparently so.\nIn childhood, we fancied ourselves walled in by the horizon, as by a\nglass bell, and doubted not, by distant travel, we should reach the\nbaths of the descending sun and stars.  On experiment, the horizon flies\nbefore us, and leaves us on an endless common, sheltered by no glass\nbell.  Yet 'tis strange how tenaciously we cling to that bell-astronomy,\nof a protecting domestic horizon.  I find the same illusion in the\nsearch after happiness, which I observe, every summer, recommenced in\nthis neighborhood, soon after the pairing of the birds.  The young\npeople do not like the town, do not like the sea-shore, they will go\ninland; find a dear cottage deep in the mountains, secret as their\nhearts.  They set forth on their travels in search of a home: they reach\nBerkshire; they reach Vermont; they look at the farms;--good farms, high\nmountain-sides: but where is the seclusion?  The farm is near this; 'tis\nnear that; they have got far from Boston, but 'tis near Albany, or near\nBurlington, or near Montreal.  They explore a farm, but the house is\nsmall, old, thin; discontented people lived there, and are\ngone:--there's too much sky, too much out-doors; too public.  The youth\naches for solitude.  When he comes to the house, he passes through the\nhouse. That does not make the deep recess he sought. 'Ah! now, I\nperceive,' he says, 'it must be deep with persons; friends only can give\ndepth.'  Yes, but there is a great dearth, this year, of friends; hard\nto find, and hard to have when found: they are just going away: they too\nare in the whirl of the flitting world, and have engagements and\nnecessities.  They are just starting for Wisconsin; have letters from\nBremen:--see you again, soon.  Slow, slow to learn the lesson, that\nthere is but one depth, but one interior, and that is--his purpose.\nWhen joy or calamity or genius shall show him it, then woods, then\nfarms, then city shopmen and cab-drivers, indifferently with prophet or\nfriend, will mirror back to him its unfathomable heaven, its populous\nsolitude.\nThe uses of travel are occasional, and short; but the best fruit it\nfinds, when it finds it, is conversation; and this is a main function of\nlife.  What a difference in the hospitality of minds!  Inestimable is he\nto whom we can say what we cannot say to ourselves.  Others are\ninvoluntarily hurtful to us, and bereave us of the power of thought,\nimpound and imprison us.  As, when there is sympathy, there needs but\none wise man in a company, and all are wise,--so, a blockhead makes a\nblockhead of his companion.  Wonderful power to benumb possesses this\nbrother.  When he comes into the office or public room, the society\ndissolves; one after another slips out, and the apartment is at his\ndisposal.  What is incurable but a frivolous habit?\nA fly is as untamable as a hyena.  Yet folly in the sense of fun,\nfooling, or dawdling can easily be borne; as Talleyrand said, \"I find\nnonsense singularly refreshing;\" but a virulent, aggressive fool taints\nthe reason of a household.  I have seen a whole family of quiet,\nsensible people unhinged and beside themselves, victims of such a rogue.\nFor the steady wrongheadedness of one perverse person irritates the\nbest: since we must withstand absurdity.  But resistance only\nexasperates the acrid fool, who believes that Nature and gravitation are\nquite wrong, and he only is right.  Hence all the dozen inmates are soon\nperverted, with whatever virtues and industries they have, into\ncontradictors, accusers, explainers, and repairers of this one\nmalefactor; like a boat about to be overset, or a carriage run away\nwith,--not only the foolish pilot or driver, but everybody on board is\nforced to assume strange and ridiculous attitudes, to balance the\nvehicle and prevent the upsetting.  For remedy, whilst the case is yet\nmild, I recommend phlegm and truth: let all the truth that is spoken or\ndone be at the zero of indifferency, or truth itself will be folly.\nBut, when the case is seated and malignant, the only safety is in\namputation; as seamen say, you shall cut and run.  How to live with\nunfit companions?--for, with such, life is for the most part spent: and\nexperience teaches little better than our earliest instinct of\nself-defence, namely, not to engage, not to mix yourself in any manner\nwith them; but let their madness spend itself unopposed;--you are you,\nand I am I.\nConversation is an art in which a man has all mankind for his\ncompetitors, for it is that which all are practising every day while\nthey live.  Our habit of thought,--take men as they rise,--is not\nsatisfying; in the common experience, I fear, it is poor and squalid.\nThe success which will content them, is, a bargain, a lucrative\nemployment, an advantage gained over a competitor, a marriage, a\npatrimony, a legacy, and the like.  With these objects, their\nconversation deals with surfaces: politics, trade, personal defects,\nexaggerated bad news, and the rain.  This is forlorn, and they feel sore\nand sensitive.  Now, if one comes who can illuminate this dark house\nwith thoughts, show them their native riches, what gifts they have, how\nindispensable each is, what magical powers over nature and men; what\naccess to poetry, religion, and the powers which constitute character;\nhe wakes in them the feeling of worth, his suggestions require new ways\nof living, new books, new men, new arts and sciences,--then we come out\nof our egg-shell existence into the great dome, and see the zenith over\nand the nadir under us.  Instead of the tanks and buckets of knowledge\nto which we are daily confined, we come down to the shore of the sea,\nand dip our hands in its miraculous waves.  'Tis wonderful the effect on\nthe company. They are not the men they were.  They have all been to\nCalifornia, and all have come back millionnaires.  There is no book and\nno pleasure in life comparable to it.  Ask what is best in our\nexperience, and we shall say, a few pieces of plain-dealing with wise\npeople.  Our conversation once and again has apprised us that we belong\nto better circles than we have yet beheld; that a mental power invites\nus, whose generalizations are more worth for joy and for effect than\nanything that is now called philosophy or literature.  In excited\nconversation, we have glimpses of the Universe, hints of power native to\nthe soul, far-darting lights and shadows of an Andes landscape, such as\nwe can hardly attain in lone meditation.  Here are oracles sometimes\nprofusely given, to which the memory goes back in barren hours.\nAdd the consent of will and temperament, and there exists the covenant\nof friendship.  Our chief want in life, is, somebody who shall make us\ndo what we can.  This is the service of a friend. With him we are easily\ngreat.  There is a sublime attraction in him to whatever virtue is in\nus.  How he flings wide the doors of existence!  What questions we ask\nof him! what an understanding we have! how few words are needed!  It is\nthe only real society.  An Eastern poet, Ali Ben Abu Taleb, writes with\nsad truth,--\n\"He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare,\nAnd he who has one enemy shall meet him everywhere.\"\nBut few writers have said anything better to this point than Hafiz, who\nindicates this relation as the test of mental health: \"Thou learnest no\nsecret until thou knowest friendship, since to the unsound no heavenly\nknowledge enters.\"  Neither is life long enough for friendship.  That is\na serious and majestic affair, like a royal presence, or a religion, and\nnot a postilion's dinner to be eaten on the run. There is a pudency\nabout friendship, as about love, and though fine souls never lose sight\nof it, yet they do not name it.  With the first class of men our\nfriendship or good understanding goes quite behind all accidents of\nestrangement, of condition, of reputation.  And yet we do not provide\nfor the greatest good of life.  We take care of our health; we lay up\nmoney; we make our roof tight, and our clothing sufficient; but who\nprovides wisely that he shall not be wanting in the best property of\nall,--friends? We know that all our training is to fit us for this, and\nwe do not take the step towards it.  How long shall we sit and wait for\nthese benefactors?\nIt makes no difference, in looking back five years, how you have been\ndieted or dressed; whether you have been lodged on the first floor or\nthe attic; whether you have had gardens and baths, good cattle and\nhorses, have been carried in a neat equipage, or in a ridiculous truck:\nthese things are forgotten so quickly, and leave no effect.  But it\ncounts much whether we have had good companions, in that time;--almost\nas much as what we have been doing.  And see the overpowering importance\nof neighborhood in all association.  As it is marriage, fit or unfit,\nthat makes our home, so it is who lives near us of equal social\ndegree,--a few people at convenient distance, no matter how bad\ncompany,--these, and these only, shall be your life's companions: and\nall those who are native, congenial, and by many an oath of the heart,\nsacramented to you, are gradually and totally lost.  You cannot deal\nsystematically with this fine element of society, and one may take a\ngood deal of pains to bring people together, and to organize clubs and\ndebating societies, and yet no result come of it. But it is certain that\nthere is a great deal of good in us that does not know itself, and that\na habit of union and competition brings people up and keeps them up to\ntheir highest point; that life would be twice or ten times life, if\nspent with wise and fruitful companions.  The obvious inference is, a\nlittle useful deliberation and preconcert, when one goes to buy house\nand land.\nBut we live with people on other platforms; we live with dependents, not\nonly with the young whom we are to teach all we know, and clothe with\nthe advantages we have earned, but also with those who serve us\ndirectly, and for money.  Yet the old rules hold good.  Let not the tie\nbe mercenary, though the service is measured by money. Make yourself\nnecessary to somebody.  Do not make life hard to any.  This point is\nacquiring new importance in American social life.  Our domestic service\nis usually a foolish fracas of unreasonable demand on one side, and\nshirking on the other.  A man of wit was asked, in the train, what was\nhis errand in the city?  He replied, \"I have been sent to procure an\nangel to do cooking.\"  A lady complained to me, that, of her two\nmaidens, one was absent-minded, and the other was absent-bodied. And the\nevil increases from the ignorance and hostility of every ship-load of\nthe immigrant population swarming into houses and farms.  Few people\ndiscern that it rests with the master or the mistress what service comes\nfrom the man or the maid; that this identical hussy was a tutelar spirit\nin one house, and a haridan in the other.  All sensible people are\nselfish, and nature is tugging at every contract to make the terms of it\nfair.  If you are proposing only your own, the other party must deal a\nlittle hardly by you.  If you deal generously, the other, though selfish\nand unjust, will make an exception in your favor, and deal truly with\nyou. When I asked an iron-master about the slag and cinder in railroad\niron,--\"O,\" he said, \"there's always good iron to be had: if there's\ncinder in the iron, 'tis because there was cinder in the pay.\"\nBut why multiply these topics, and their illustrations, which are\nendless?  Life brings to each his task, and, whatever art you select,\nalgebra, planting, architecture, poems, commerce, politics,--all are\nattainable, even to the miraculous triumphs, on the same terms, of\nselecting that for which you are apt;--begin at the beginning, proceed\nin order, step by step.  'Tis as easy to twist iron anchors, and braid\ncannons, as to braid straw, to boil granite as to boil water, if you\ntake all the steps in order. Wherever there is failure, there is some\ngiddiness, some superstition about luck, some step omitted, which Nature\nnever pardons.  The happy conditions of life may be had on the same\nterms. Their attraction for you is the pledge that they are within your\nreach.  Our prayers are prophets. There must be fidelity, and there must\nbe adherence.  How respectable the life that clings to its objects!\nYouthful aspirations are fine things, your theories and plans of life\nare fair and commendable:--but will you stick?  Not one, I fear, in that\nCommon full of people, or, in a thousand, but one: and, when you tax\nthem with treachery, and remind them of their high resolutions, they\nhave forgotten that they made a vow.  The individuals are fugitive, and\nin the act of becoming something else, and irresponsible.  The race is\ngreat, the ideal fair, but the men whiffling and unsure.  The hero is he\nwho is immovably centred.  The main difference between people seems to\nbe, that one man can come under obligations on which you can rely,--is\nobligable; and another is not.  As he has not a law within him, there's\nnothing to tie him to.\n'Tis inevitable to name particulars of virtue, and of condition, and to\nexaggerate them.  But all rests at last on that integrity which dwarfs\ntalent, and can spare it.  Sanity consists in not being subdued by your\nmeans.  Fancy prices are paid for position, and for the culture of\ntalent, but to the grand interests, superficial success is of no\naccount. The man,--it is his attitude,--not feats, but forces,--not on\nset days and public occasions, but, at all hours, and in repose alike as\nin energy, still formidable, and not to be disposed of.  The populace\nsays, with Horne Tooke, \"If you would be powerful, pretend to be\npowerful.\"  I prefer to say, with the old prophet, \"Seekest thou great\nthings? seek them not:\"--or, what was said of a Spanish prince, \"The\nmore you took from him, the greater he looked.\"  _Plus on lui ote, plus\nil est grand_.\nThe secret of culture is to learn, that a few great points steadily\nreappear, alike in the poverty of the obscurest farm, and in the\nmiscellany of metropolitan life, and that these few are alone to be\nregarded,--the escape from all false ties; courage to be what we are;\nand love of what is simple and beautiful; independence, and cheerful\nrelation, these are the essentials,--these, and the wish to serve,--to\nadd somewhat to the well-being of men.\nVIII.\nBEAUTY.\nWas never form and never face\nSo sweet to SEYD as only grace\nWhich did not slumber like a stone\nBut hovered gleaming and was gone.\nBeauty chased he everywhere,\nIn flame, in storm, in clouds of air.\nHe smote the lake to feed his eye\nWith the beryl beam of the broken wave\nHe flung in pebbles well to hear\nThe moment's music which they gave.\nOft pealed for him a lofty tone\nFrom nodding pole and belting zone.\nHe heard a voice none else could hear\nFrom centred and from errant sphere.\nThe quaking earth did quake in rhyme,\nSeas ebbed and flowed in epic chime.\nIn dens of passion, and pits of wo,\nHe saw strong Eros struggling through,\nTo sun the dark and solve the curse,\nAnd beam to the bounds of the universe.\nWhile thus to love he gave his days\nIn loyal worship, scorning praise,\nHow spread their lures for him, in vain,\nThieving Ambition and paltering Gain!\nHe thought it happier to be dead,\nTo die for Beauty, than live for bread.\nBEAUTY.\nThe spiral tendency of vegetation infects education also.  Our books\napproach very slowly the things we most wish to know.  What a parade we\nmake of our science, and how far off, and at arm's length, it is from\nits objects!  Our botany is all names, not powers: poets and romancers\ntalk of herbs of grace and healing; but what does the botanist know of\nthe virtues of his weeds?  The geologist lays bare the strata, and can\ntell them all on his fingers: but does he know what effect passes into\nthe man who builds his house in them? what effect on the race that\ninhabits a granite shelf? what on the inhabitants of marl and of\nalluvium?\nWe should go to the ornithologist with a new feeling, if he could teach\nus what the social birds say, when they sit in the autumn council,\ntalking together in the trees.  The want of sympathy makes his record a\ndull dictionary.  His result is a dead bird.  The bird is not in its\nounces and inches, but in its relations to Nature; and the skin or\nskeleton you show me, is no more a heron, than a heap of ashes or a\nbottle of gases into which his body has been reduced, is Dante or\nWashington. The naturalist is led _from_ the road by the whole distance\nof his fancied advance.  The boy had juster views when he gazed at the\nshells on the beach, or the flowers in the meadow, unable to call them\nby their names, than the man in the pride of his nomenclature.\nAstrology interested us, for it tied man to the system.  Instead of an\nisolated beggar, the farthest star felt him, and he felt the star.\nHowever rash and however falsified by pretenders and traders in it, the\nhint was true and divine, the soul's avowal of its large relations, and,\nthat climate, century, remote natures, as well as near, are part of its\nbiography.  Chemistry takes to pieces, but it does not construct.\nAlchemy which sought to transmute one element into another, to prolong\nlife, to arm with power,--that was in the right direction.  All our\nscience lacks a human side. The tenant is more than the house.  Bugs and\nstamens and spores, on which we lavish so many years, are not\nfinalities, and man, when his powers unfold in order, will take Nature\nalong with him, and emit light into all her recesses.  The human heart\nconcerns us more than the poring into microscopes, and is larger than\ncan be measured by the pompous figures of the astronomer.\nWe are just so frivolous and skeptical.  Men hold themselves cheap and\nvile: and yet a man is a fagot of thunderbolts.  All the elements pour\nthrough his system: he is the flood of the flood, and fire of the fire;\nhe feels the antipodes and the pole, as drops of his blood: they are the\nextension of his personality.  His duties are measured by that\ninstrument he is; and a right and perfect man would be felt to the\ncentre of the Copernican system.  'Tis curious that we only believe as\ndeep as we live.  We do not think heroes can exert any more awful power\nthan that surface-play which amuses us.  A deep man believes in\nmiracles, waits for them, believes in magic, believes that the orator\nwill decompose his adversary; believes that the evil eye can wither,\nthat the heart's blessing can heal; that love can exalt talent; can\novercome all odds.  From a great heart secret magnetisms flow\nincessantly to draw great events. But we prize very humble utilities, a\nprudent husband, a good son, a voter, a citizen, and deprecate any\nromance of character; and perhaps reckon only his money value,--his\nintellect, his affection, as a sort of bill of exchange, easily\nconvertible into fine chambers, pictures, music, and wine.\nThe motive of science was the extension of man, on all sides, into\nNature, till his hands should touch the stars, his eyes see through the\nearth, his ears understand the language of beast and bird, and the sense\nof the wind; and, through his sympathy, heaven and earth should talk\nwith him.  But that is not our science.  These geologies, chemistries,\nastronomies, seem to make wise, but they leave us where they found us.\nThe invention is of use to the inventor, of questionable help to any\nother. The formulas of science are like the papers in your pocket-book,\nof no value to any but the owner. Science in England, in America, is\njealous of theory, hates the name of love and moral purpose.  There's a\nrevenge for this inhumanity. What manner of man does science make?  The\nboy is not attracted.  He says, I do not wish to be such a kind of man\nas my professor is.  The collector has dried all the plants in his\nherbal, but he has lost weight and humor.  He has got all snakes and\nlizards in his phials, but science has done for him also, and has put\nthe man into a bottle.  Our reliance on the physician is a kind of\ndespair of ourselves.  The clergy have bronchitis, which does not seem a\ncertificate of spiritual health.  Macready thought it came of the\n_falsetto_ of their voicing. An Indian prince, Tisso, one day riding in\nthe forest, saw a herd of elk sporting.  \"See how happy,\" he said,\n\"these browsing elks are!  Why should not priests, lodged and fed\ncomfortably in the temples, also amuse themselves?\"  Returning home, he\nimparted this reflection to the king.  The king, on the next day,\nconferred the sovereignty on him, saying, \"Prince, administer this\nempire for seven days: at the termination of that period, I shall put\nthee to death.\"  At the end of the seventh day, the king inquired, \"From\nwhat cause hast thou become so emaciated?\"  He answered, \"From the\nhorror of death.\"  The monarch rejoined: \"Live, my child, and be wise.\nThou hast ceased to take recreation, saying to thyself, in seven days I\nshall be put to death.  These priests in the temple incessantly meditate\non death; how can they enter into healthful diversions?\"  But the men of\nscience or the doctors or the clergy are not victims of their pursuits,\nmore than others.  The miller, the lawyer, and the merchant, dedicate\nthemselves to their own details, and do not come out men of more force.\nHave they divination, grand aims, hospitality of soul, and the equality\nto any event, which we demand in man, or only the reactions of the mill,\nof the wares, of the chicane?\nNo object really interests us but man, and in man only his\nsuperiorities; and, though we are aware of a perfect law in Nature, it\nhas fascination for us only through its relation to him, or, as it is\nrooted in the mind.  At the birth of Winckelmann, more than a hundred\nyears ago, side by side with this arid, departmental, _post mortem_\nscience, rose an enthusiasm in the study of Beauty; and perhaps some\nsparks from it may yet light a conflagration in the other.  Knowledge of\nmen, knowledge of manners, the power of form, and our sensibility to\npersonal influence, never go out of fashion.  These are facts of a\nscience which we study without book, whose teachers and subjects are\nalways near us.\nSo inveterate is our habit of criticism, that much of our knowledge in\nthis direction belongs to the chapter of pathology.  The crowd in the\nstreet oftener furnishes degradations than angels or redeemers: but they\nall prove the transparency. Every spirit makes its house; and we can\ngive a shrewd guess from the house to the inhabitant. But not less does\nNature furnish us with every sign of grace and goodness.  The delicious\nfaces of children, the beauty of school-girls, \"the sweet seriousness of\nsixteen,\" the lofty air of well-born, well-bred boys, the passionate\nhistories in the looks and manners of youth and early manhood, and the\nvaried power in all that well-known company that escort us through\nlife,--we know how these forms thrill, paralyze, provoke, inspire, and\nenlarge us.\nBeauty is the form under which the intellect prefers to study the world.\nAll privilege is that of beauty; for there are many beauties; as, of\ngeneral nature, of the human face and form, of manners, of brain, or\nmethod, moral beauty, or beauty of the soul.\nThe ancients believed that a genius or demon took possession at birth of\neach mortal, to guide him; that these genii were sometimes seen as a\nflame of fire partly immersed in the bodies which they governed;--on an\nevil man, resting on his head; in a good man, mixed with his substance.\nThey thought the same genius, at the death of its ward, entered a\nnew-born child, and they pretended to guess the pilot, by the sailing of\nthe ship. We recognize obscurely the same fact, though we give it our\nown names.  We say, that every man is entitled to be valued by his best\nmoment.  We measure our friends so.  We know, they have intervals of\nfolly, whereof we take no heed, but wait the reappearings of the genius,\nwhich are sure and beautiful.  On the other side, everybody knows people\nwho appear beridden, and who, with all degrees of ability, never impress\nus with the air of free agency.  They know it too, and peep with their\neyes to see if you detect their sad plight.  We fancy, could we\npronounce the solving word, and disenchant them, the cloud would roll\nup, the little rider would be discovered and unseated, and they would\nregain their freedom.  The remedy seems never to be far off, since the\nfirst step into thought lifts this mountain of necessity. Thought is the\npent air-ball which can rive the planet, and the beauty which certain\nobjects have for him, is the friendly fire which expands the thought,\nand acquaints the prisoner that liberty and power await him.\nThe question of Beauty takes us out of surfaces, to thinking of the\nfoundations of things.  Goethe said, \"The beautiful is a manifestation\nof secret laws of Nature, which, but for this appearance, had been\nforever concealed from us.\"  And the working of this deep instinct makes\nall the excitement--much of it superficial and absurd enough--about\nworks of art, which leads armies of vain travellers every year to Italy,\nGreece, and Egypt. Every man values every acquisition he makes in the\nscience of beauty, above his possessions. The most useful man in the\nmost useful world, so long as only commodity was served, would remain\nunsatisfied.  But, as fast as he sees beauty, life acquires a very high\nvalue.\nI am warned by the ill fate of many philosophers not to attempt a\ndefinition of Beauty.  I will rather enumerate a few of its qualities.\nWe ascribe beauty to that which is simple; which has no superfluous\nparts; which exactly answers its end; which stands related to all\nthings; which is the mean of many extremes.  It is the most enduring\nquality, and the most ascending quality.  We say, love is blind, and the\nfigure of Cupid is drawn with a bandage round his eyes.  Blind:--yes,\nbecause he does not see what he does not like; but the sharpest-sighted\nhunter in the universe is Love, for finding what he seeks, and only\nthat; and the mythologists tell us, that Vulcan was painted lame, and\nCupid blind, to call attention to the fact, that one was all limbs, and\nthe other, all eyes.  In the true mythology, Love is an immortal child,\nand Beauty leads him as a guide: nor can we express a deeper sense than\nwhen we say, Beauty is the pilot of the young soul.\nBeyond their sensuous delight, the forms and colors of Nature have a new\ncharm for us in our perception, that not one ornament was added for\nornament, but is a sign of some better health, or more excellent action.\nElegance of form in bird or beast, or in the human figure, marks some\nexcellence of structure: or beauty is only an invitation from what\nbelongs to us.  'Tis a law of botany, that in plants, the same virtues\nfollow the same forms.  It is a rule of largest application, true in a\nplant, true in a loaf of bread, that in the construction of any fabric\nor organism, any real increase of fitness to its end, is an increase of\nbeauty.\nThe lesson taught by the study of Greek and of Gothic art, of antique\nand of Pre-Raphaelite painting, was worth all the research,--namely,\nthat all beauty must be organic; that outside embellishment is\ndeformity.  It is the soundness of the bones that ultimates itself in a\npeach-bloom complexion: health of constitution that makes the sparkle\nand the power of the eye.  'Tis the adjustment of the size and of the\njoining of the sockets of the skeleton, that gives grace of outline and\nthe finer grace of movement.  The cat and the deer cannot move or sit\ninelegantly.  The dancing-master can never teach a badly built man to\nwalk well.  The tint of the flower proceeds from its root, and the\nlustres of the sea-shell begin with its existence.  Hence our taste in\nbuilding rejects paint, and all shifts, and shows the original grain of\nthe wood: refuses pilasters and columns that support nothing, and allows\nthe real supporters of the house honestly to show themselves.  Every\nnecessary or organic action pleases the beholder. A man leading a horse\nto water, a farmer sowing seed, the labors of haymakers in the field,\nthe carpenter building a ship, the smith at his forge, or, whatever\nuseful labor, is becoming to the wise eye. But if it is done to be seen,\nit is mean.  How beautiful are ships on the sea! but ships in the\ntheatre,--or ships kept for picturesque effect on Virginia Water, by\nGeorge IV., and men hired to stand in fitting costumes at a penny an\nhour!--What a difference in effect between a battalion of troops\nmarching to action, and one of our independent companies on a holiday!\nIn the midst of a military show, and a festal procession gay with\nbanners, I saw a boy seize an old tin pan that lay rusting under a wall,\nand poising it on the top of a stick, he set it turning, and made it\ndescribe the most elegant imaginable curves, and drew away attention\nfrom the decorated procession by this startling beauty.\nAnother text from the mythologists.  The Greeks fabled that Venus was\nborn of the foam of the sea.  Nothing interests us which is stark or\nbounded, but only what streams with life, what is in act or endeavor to\nreach somewhat beyond.  The pleasure a palace or a temple gives the eye,\nis, that an order and method has been communicated to stones, so that\nthey speak and geometrize, become tender or sublime with expression.\nBeauty is the moment of transition, as if the form were just ready to\nflow into other forms.  Any fixedness, heaping, or concentration on one\nfeature,--a long nose, a sharp chin, a hump-back,--is the reverse of the\nflowing, and therefore deformed.  Beautiful as is the symmetry of any\nform, if the form can move, we seek a more excellent symmetry.  The\ninterruption of equilibrium stimulates the eye to desire the restoration\nof symmetry, and to watch the steps through which it is attained.  This\nis the charm of running water, sea-waves, the flight of birds, and the\nlocomotion of animals.  This is the theory of dancing, to recover\ncontinually in changes the lost equilibrium, not by abrupt and angular,\nbut by gradual and curving movements.  I have been told by persons of\nexperience in matters of taste, that the fashions follow a law of\ngradation, and are never arbitrary.  The new mode is always only a step\nonward in the same direction as the last mode; and a cultivated eye is\nprepared for and predicts the new fashion.  This fact suggests the\nreason of all mistakes and offence in our own modes.  It is necessary in\nmusic, when you strike a discord, to let down the ear by an intermediate\nnote or two to the accord again: and many a good experiment, born of\ngood sense, and destined to succeed, fails, only because it is\noffensively sudden.  I suppose, the Parisian milliner who dresses the\nworld from her imperious boudoir will know how to reconcile the Bloomer\ncostume to the eye of mankind, and make it triumphant over Punch\nhimself, by interposing the just gradations.  I need not say, how wide\nthe same law ranges; and how much it can be hoped to effect.  All that\nis a little harshly claimed by progressive parties, may easily come to\nbe conceded without question, if this rule be observed.  Thus the\ncircumstances may be easily imagined, in which woman may speak, vote,\nargue causes, legislate, and drive a coach, and all the most naturally\nin the world, if only it come by degrees.  To this streaming or flowing\nbelongs the beauty that all circular movement has; as, the circulation\nof waters, the circulation of the blood, the periodical motion of\nplanets, the annual wave of vegetation, the action and reaction of\nNature: and, if we follow it out, this demand in our thought for an\never-onward action, is the argument for the immortality.\nOne more text from the mythologists is to the same purpose,--_Beauty\nrides on a lion_.  Beauty rests on necessities.  The line of beauty is\nthe result of perfect economy.  The cell of the bee is built at that\nangle which gives the most strength with the least wax; the bone or the\nquill of the bird gives the most alar strength, with the least weight.\n\"It is the purgation of superfluities,\" said Michel Angelo.  There is\nnot a particle to spare in natural structures.  There is a compelling\nreason in the uses of the plant, for every novelty of color or form: and\nour art saves material, by more skilful arrangement, and reaches beauty\nby taking every superfluous ounce that can be spared from a wall, and\nkeeping all its strength in the poetry of columns.  In rhetoric, this\nart of omission is a chief secret of power, and, in general, it is proof\nof high culture, to say the greatest matters in the simplest way.\nVeracity first of all, and forever.  _Rien de beau que le vrai_.  In all\ndesign, art lies in making your object prominent, but there is a prior\nart in choosing objects that are prominent.  The fine arts have nothing\ncasual, but spring from the instincts of the nations that created them.\nBeauty is the quality which makes to endure. In a house that I know, I\nhave noticed a block of spermaceti lying about closets and\nmantel-pieces, for twenty years together, simply because the tallow-man\ngave it the form of a rabbit; and, I suppose, it may continue to be\nlugged about unchanged for a century.  Let an artist scrawl a few lines\nor figures on the back of a letter, and that scrap of paper is rescued\nfrom danger, is put in portfolio, is framed and glazed, and, in\nproportion to the beauty of the lines drawn, will be kept for centuries.\nBurns writes a copy of verses, and sends them to a newspaper, and the\nhuman race take charge of them that they shall not perish.\nAs the flute is heard farther than the cart, see how surely a beautiful\nform strikes the fancy of men, and is copied and reproduced without end.\nHow many copies are there of the Belvedere Apollo, the Venus, the\nPsyche, the Warwick Vase, the Parthenon, and the Temple of Vesta?  These\nare objects of tenderness to all.  In our cities, an ugly building is\nsoon removed, and is never repeated, but any beautiful building is\ncopied and improved upon, so that all masons and carpenters work to\nrepeat and preserve the agreeable forms, whilst the ugly ones die out.\nThe felicities of design in art, or in works of Nature, are shadows or\nforerunners of that beauty which reaches its perfection in the human\nform. All men are its lovers.  Wherever it goes, it creates joy and\nhilarity, and everything is permitted to it. It reaches its height in\nwoman.  \"To Eve,\" say the Mahometans, \"God gave two thirds of all\nbeauty.\"  A beautiful woman is a practical poet, taming her savage mate,\nplanting tenderness, hope, and eloquence, in all whom she approaches.\nSome favors of condition must go with it, since a certain serenity is\nessential, but we love its reproofs and superiorities.  Nature wishes\nthat woman should attract man, yet she often cunningly moulds into her\nface a little sarcasm, which seems to say, 'Yes, I am willing to\nattract, but to attract a little better kind of a man than any I yet\nbehold.'  French _memoires_ of the fifteenth century celebrate the name\nof Pauline de Viguiere, a virtuous and accomplished maiden, who so fired\nthe enthusiasm of her contemporaries, by her enchanting form, that the\ncitizens of her native city of Toulouse obtained the aid of the civil\nauthorities to compel her to appear publicly on the balcony at least\ntwice a week, and, as often as she showed herself, the crowd was\ndangerous to life.  Not less, in England, in the last century, was the\nfame of the Gunnings, of whom, Elizabeth married the Duke of Hamilton;\nand Maria, the Earl of Coventry.  Walpole says, \"the concourse was so\ngreat, when the Duchess of Hamilton was presented at court, on Friday,\nthat even the noble crowd in the drawing-room clambered on chairs and\ntables to look at her.  There are mobs at their doors to see them get\ninto their chairs, and people go early to get places at the theatres,\nwhen it is known they will be there.\"  \"Such crowds,\" he adds,\nelsewhere, \"flock to see the Duchess of Hamilton, that seven hundred\npeople sat up all night, in and about an inn, in Yorkshire, to see her\nget into her post-chaise next morning.\"\nBut why need we console ourselves with the fames of Helen of Argos, or\nCorinna, or Pauline of Toulouse, or the Duchess of Hamilton?  We all\nknow this magic very well, or can divine it.  It does not hurt weak eyes\nto look into beautiful eyes never so long.  Women stand related to\nbeautiful Nature around us, and the enamored youth mixes their form with\nmoon and stars, with woods and waters, and the pomp of summer.  They\nheal us of awkwardness by their words and looks.  We observe their\nintellectual influence on the most serious student.  They refine and\nclear his mind; teach him to put a pleasing method into what is dry and\ndifficult.  We talk to them, and wish to be listened to; we fear to\nfatigue them, and acquire a facility of expression which passes from\nconversation into habit of style.\nThat Beauty is the normal state, is shown by the perpetual effort of\nNature to attain it.  Mirabeau had an ugly face on a handsome ground;\nand we see faces every day which have a good type, but have been marred\nin the casting: a proof that we are all entitled to beauty, should have\nbeen beautiful, if our ancestors had kept the laws,--as every lily and\nevery rose is well.  But our bodies do not fit us, but caricature and\nsatirize us.  Thus, short legs, which constrain us to short, mincing\nsteps, are a kind of personal insult and contumely to the owner; and\nlong stilts, again, put him at perpetual disadvantage, and force him to\nstoop to the general level of mankind.  Martial ridicules a gentleman of\nhis day whose countenance resembled the face of a swimmer seen under\nwater.  Saadi describes a schoolmaster \"so ugly and crabbed, that a\nsight of him would derange the ecstasies of the orthodox.\"  Faces are\nrarely true to any ideal type, but are a record in sculpture of a\nthousand anecdotes of whim and folly.  Portrait painters say that most\nfaces and forms are irregular and unsymmetrical; have one eye blue, and\none gray; the nose not straight; and one shoulder higher than another;\nthe hair unequally distributed, etc.  The man is physically as well as\nmetaphysically a thing of shreds and patches, borrowed unequally from\ngood and bad ancestors, and a misfit from the start.\nA beautiful person, among the Greeks, was thought to betray by this sign\nsome secret favor of the immortal gods: and we can pardon pride, when a\nwoman possesses such a figure, that wherever she stands, or moves, or\nleaves a shadow on the wall, or sits for a portrait to the artist, she\nconfers a favor on the world.  And yet--it is not beauty that inspires\nthe deepest passion. Beauty without grace is the hook without the bait.\nBeauty, without expression, tires.  Abbe Menage said of the President Le\nBailleul, \"that he was fit for nothing but to sit for his portrait.\"  A\nGreek epigram intimates that the force of love is not shown by the\ncourting of beauty, but when the like desire is inflamed for one who is\nill-favored. And petulant old gentlemen, who have chanced to suffer some\nintolerable weariness from pretty people, or who have seen cut flowers\nto some profusion, or who see, after a world of pains have been\nsuccessfully taken for the costume, how the least mistake in sentiment\ntakes all the beauty out of your clothes,--affirm, that the secret of\nugliness consists not in irregularity, but in being uninteresting.\nWe love any forms, however ugly, from which great qualities shine.  If\ncommand, eloquence, art, or invention, exist in the most deformed\nperson, all the accidents that usually displease, please, and raise\nesteem and wonder higher.  The great orator was an emaciated,\ninsignificant person, but he was all brain.  Cardinal De Retz says of De\nBouillon, \"With the physiognomy of an ox, he had the perspicacity of an\neagle.\"  It was said of Hooke, the friend of Newton, \"he is the most,\nand promises the least, of any man in England.\"  \"Since I am so ugly,\"\nsaid Du Guesclin, \"it behooves that I be bold.\"  Sir Philip Sidney, the\ndarling of mankind, Ben Jonson tells us, \"was no pleasant man in\ncountenance, his face being spoiled with pimples, and of high blood, and\nlong.\"  Those who have ruled human destinies, like planets, for\nthousands of years, were not handsome men.  If a man can raise a small\ncity to be a great kingdom, can make bread cheap, can irrigate deserts,\ncan join oceans by canals, can subdue steam, can organize victory, can\nlead the opinions of mankind, can enlarge knowledge, 'tis no matter\nwhether his nose is parallel to his spine, as it ought to be, or whether\nhe has a nose at all: whether his legs are straight, or whether his legs\nare amputated; his deformities will come to be reckoned ornamental, and\nadvantageous on the whole.  This is the triumph of expression, degrading\nbeauty, charming us with a power so fine and friendly and intoxicating,\nthat it makes admired persons insipid, and the thought of passing our\nlives with them insupportable.  There are faces so fluid with\nexpression, so flushed and rippled by the play of thought, that we can\nhardly find what the mere features really are.  When the delicious\nbeauty of lineaments loses its power, it is because a more delicious\nbeauty has appeared; that an interior and durable form has been\ndisclosed. Still, Beauty rides on her lion, as before.  Still, \"it was\nfor beauty that the world was made.\"  The lives of the Italian artists,\nwho established a despotism of genius amidst the dukes and kings and\nmobs of their stormy epoch, prove how loyal men in all times are to a\nfiner brain, a finer method, than their own.  If a man can cut such a\nhead on his stone gate-post as shall draw and keep a crowd about it all\nday, by its beauty, good nature, and inscrutable meaning:--if a man can\nbuild a plain cottage with such symmetry, as to make all the fine\npalaces look cheap and vulgar; can take such advantage of Nature, that\nall her powers serve him; making use of geometry, instead of expense;\ntapping a mountain for his water-jet; causing the sun and moon to seem\nonly the decorations of his estate; this is still the legitimate\ndominion of beauty.\nThe radiance of the human form, though sometimes astonishing, is only a\nburst of beauty for a few years or a few months, at the perfection of\nyouth, and in most, rapidly declines.  But we remain lovers of it, only\ntransferring our interest to interior excellence.  And it is not only\nadmirable in singular and salient talents, but also in the world of\nmanners.\nBut the sovereign attribute remains to be noted. Things are pretty,\ngraceful, rich, elegant, handsome, but, until they speak to the\nimagination, not yet beautiful.  This is the reason why beauty is still\nescaping out of all analysis.  It is not yet possessed, it cannot be\nhandled.  Proclus says, \"it swims on the light of forms.\"  It is\nproperly not in the form, but in the mind.  It instantly deserts\npossession, and flies to an object in the horizon.  If I could put my\nhand on the north star, would it be as beautiful?  The sea is lovely,\nbut when we bathe in it, the beauty forsakes all the near water.  For\nthe imagination and senses cannot be gratified at the same time.\nWordsworth rightly speaks of \"a light that never was on sea or land,\"\nmeaning, that it was supplied by the observer, and the Welsh bard warns\nhis countrywomen, that\n--\"half of their charms with Cadwallon shall die.\"\nThe new virtue which constitutes a thing beautiful, is a certain\ncosmical quality, or, a power to suggest relation to the whole world,\nand so lift the object out of a pitiful individuality.  Every natural\nfeature,--sea, sky, rainbow, flowers, musical tone,--has in it somewhat\nwhich is not private, but universal, speaks of that central benefit\nwhich is the soul of Nature, and thereby is beautiful.  And, in chosen\nmen and women, I find somewhat in form, speech, and manners, which is\nnot of their person and family, but of a humane, catholic, and spiritual\ncharacter, and we love them as the sky.  They have a largeness of\nsuggestion, and their face and manners carry a certain grandeur, like\ntime and justice.\nThe feat of the imagination is in showing the convertibility of every\nthing into every other thing. Facts which had never before left their\nstark common sense, suddenly figure as Eleusinian mysteries. My boots\nand chair and candlestick are fairies in disguise, meteors and\nconstellations.  All the facts in Nature are nouns of the intellect, and\nmake the grammar of the eternal language.  Every word has a double,\ntreble, or centuple use and meaning, What! has my stove and pepper-pot a\nfalse bottom! I cry you mercy, good shoe-box!  I did not know you were a\njewel-case.  Chaff and dust begin to sparkle, and are clothed about with\nimmortality. And there is a joy in perceiving the representative or\nsymbolic character of a fact, which no bare fact or event can ever give.\nThere are no days in life so memorable as those which vibrated to some\nstroke of the imagination.\nThe poets are quite right in decking their mistresses with the spoils of\nthe landscape, flower-gardens, gems, rainbows, flushes of morning, and\nstars of night, since all beauty points at identity, and whatsoever\nthing does not express to me the sea and sky, day and night, is somewhat\nforbidden and wrong.  Into every beautiful object, there enters somewhat\nimmeasurable and divine, and just as much into form bounded by outlines,\nlike mountains on the horizon, as into tones of music, or depths of\nspace.  Polarized light showed the secret architecture of bodies; and\nwhen the _second-sight_ of the mind is opened, now one color or form or\ngesture, and now another, has a pungency, as if a more interior ray had\nbeen emitted, disclosing its deep holdings in the frame of things.\nThe laws of this translation we do not know, or why one feature or\ngesture enchants, why one word or syllable intoxicates, but the fact is\nfamiliar that the fine touch of the eye, or a grace of manners, or a\nphrase of poetry, plants wings at our shoulders; as if the Divinity, in\nhis approaches, lifts away mountains of obstruction, and deigns to draw\na truer line, which the mind knows and owns.  This is that haughty force\nof beauty, \"_vis superba formae_\" which the poets praise,--under calm\nand precise outline, the immeasurable and divine: Beauty hiding all\nwisdom and power in its calm sky.\nAll high beauty has a moral element in it, and I find the antique\nsculpture as ethical as Marcus Antoninus: and the beauty ever in\nproportion to the depth of thought.  Gross and obscure natures, however\ndecorated, seem impure shambles; but character gives splendor to youth,\nand awe to wrinkled skin and gray hairs.  An adorer of truth we cannot\nchoose but obey, and the woman who has shared with us the moral\nsentiment,--her locks must appear to us sublime.  Thus there is a\nclimbing scale of culture, from the first agreeable sensation which a\nsparkling gem or a scarlet stain affords the eye, up through fair\noutlines and details of the landscape, features of the human face and\nform, signs and tokens of thought and character in manners, up to the\nineffable mysteries of the intellect. Wherever we begin, thither our\nsteps tend: an ascent from the joy of a horse in his trappings, up to\nthe perception of Newton, that the globe on which we ride is only a\nlarger apple falling from a larger tree; up to the perception of Plato,\nthat globe and universe are rude and early expressions of an\nall-dissolving Unity,--the first stair on the scale to the temple of the\nMind.\nIX.\nILLUSIONS\nFlow, flow the waves hated,\nAccursed, adored,\nThe waves of mutation:\nNo anchorage is.\nSleep is not, death is not;\nWho seem to die live.\nHouse you were born in,\nFriends of your spring-time,\nOld man and young maid,\nDay's toil and its guerdon,\nThey are all vanishing,\nFleeing to fables,\nCannot be moored.\nSee the stars through them,\nThrough treacherous marbles.\nKnow, the stars yonder,\nThe stars everlasting,\nAre fugitive also,\nAnd emulate, vaulted,\nThe lambent heat-lightning,\nAnd fire-fly's flight.\nWhen thou dost return\nOn the wave's circulation,\nBeholding the shimmer,\nThe wild dissipation,\nAnd, out of endeavor\nTo change and to flow,\nThe gas become solid,\nAnd phantoms and nothings\nReturn to be things,\nAnd endless imbroglio\nIs law and the world,--\nThen first shalt thou know,\nThat in the wild turmoil,\nHorsed on the Proteus,\nThou ridest to power,\nAnd to endurance.\nILLUSIONS.\nSome years ago, in company with an agreeable party, I spent a long\nsummer day in exploring the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.  We traversed,\nthrough spacious galleries affording a solid masonry foundation for the\ntown and county overhead, the six or eight black miles from the mouth of\nthe cavern to the innermost recess which tourists visit,--a niche or\ngrotto made of one seamless stalactite, and called, I believe, Serena's\nBower.  I lost the light of one day.  I saw high domes, and bottomless\npits; heard the voice of unseen waterfalls; paddled three quarters of a\nmile in the deep Echo River, whose waters are peopled with the blind\nfish; crossed the streams \"Lethe\" and \"Styx;\" plied with music and guns\nthe echoes in these alarming galleries; saw every form of stalagmite and\nstalactite in the sculptured and fretted chambers,--icicle,\norange-flower, acanthus, grapes, and snowball.  We shot Bengal lights\ninto the vaults and groins of the sparry cathedrals, and examined all\nthe masterpieces which the four combined engineers, water, limestone,\ngravitation, and time, could make in the dark.\nThe mysteries and scenery of the cave had the same dignity that belongs\nto all natural objects, and which shames the fine things to which we\nfoppishly compare them.  I remarked, especially, the mimetic habit, with\nwhich Nature, on new instruments, hums her old tunes, making night to\nmimic day, and chemistry to ape vegetation.  But I then took notice, and\nstill chiefly remember, that the best thing which the cave had to offer\nwas an illusion.  On arriving at what is called the \"Star-Chamber,\" our\nlamps were taken from us by the guide, and extinguished or put aside,\nand, on looking upwards, I saw or seemed to see the night heaven thick\nwith stars glimmering more or less brightly over our heads, and even\nwhat seemed a comet flaming among them.  All the party were touched with\nastonishment and pleasure.  Our musical friends sung with much feeling a\npretty song, \"The stars are in the quiet sky,\" &c., and I sat down on\nthe rocky floor to enjoy the serene picture.  Some crystal specks in the\nblack ceiling high overhead, reflecting the light of a half-hid lamp,\nyielded this magnificent effect.\nI own, I did not like the cave so well for eking out its sublimities\nwith this theatrical trick.  But I have had many experiences like it,\nbefore and since; and we must be content to be pleased without too\ncuriously analyzing the occasions.  Our conversation with Nature is not\njust what it seems.  The cloud-rack, the sunrise and sunset glories,\nrainbows, and northern lights are not quite so spheral as our childhood\nthought them; and the part our organization plays in them is too large.\nThe senses interfere everywhere, and mix their own structure with all\nthey report of.  Once, we fancied the earth a plane, and stationary.  In\nadmiring the sunset, we do not yet deduct the rounding, coordinating,\npictorial powers of the eye.\nThe same interference from our organization creates the most of our\npleasure and pain.  Our first mistake is the belief that the\ncircumstance gives the joy which we give to the circumstance.  Life is\nan ecstasy.  Life is sweet as nitrous oxide; and the fisherman dripping\nall day over a cold pond, the switchman at the railway intersection, the\nfarmer in the field, the negro in the rice-swamp, the fop in the street,\nthe hunter in the woods, the barrister with the jury, the belle at the\nball, all ascribe a certain pleasure to their employment, which they\nthemselves give it.  Health and appetite impart the sweetness to sugar,\nbread, and meat.  We fancy that our civilization has got on far, but we\nstill come back to our primers.\nWe live by our imaginations, by our admirations, by our sentiments.  The\nchild walks amid heaps of illusions, which he does not like to have\ndisturbed. The boy, how sweet to him is his fancy! how dear the story of\nbarons and battles!  What a hero he is, whilst he feeds on his heroes!\nWhat a debt is his to imaginative books!  He has no better friend or\ninfluence, than Scott, Shakspeare, Plutarch, and Homer.  The man lives\nto other objects, but who dare affirm that they are more real?  Even the\nprose of the streets is full of refractions.  In the life of the\ndreariest alderman, fancy enters into all details, and colors them with\nrosy hue.  He imitates the air and actions of people whom he admires,\nand is raised in his own eyes.  He pays a debt quicker to a rich man\nthan to a poor man. He wishes the bow and compliment of some leader in\nthe state, or in society; weighs what he says; perhaps he never comes\nnearer to him for that, but dies at last better contented for this\namusement of his eyes and his fancy.\nThe world rolls, the din of life is never hushed. In London, in Paris,\nin Boston, in San Francisco, the carnival, the masquerade is at its\nheight. Nobody drops his domino.  The unities, the fictions of the piece\nit would be an impertinence to break. The chapter of fascinations is\nvery long.  Great is paint; nay, God is the painter; and we rightly\naccuse the critic who destroys too many illusions. Society does not love\nits unmaskers.  It was wittily, if somewhat bitterly, said by\nD'Alembert, \"_qu'un etat de vapeur etait un etat tres fachieux,\nparcequ'il nous faisait voir les choses comme elles sont._\"  I find men\nvictims of illusion in all parts of life. Children, youths, adults, and\nold men, all are led by one bawble or another.  Yoganidra, the goddess\nof illusion, Proteus, or Momus, or Gylfi's Mocking,--for the Power has\nmany names,--is stronger than the Titans, stronger than Apollo.  Few\nhave overheard the gods, or surprised their secret.  Life is a\nsuccession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.  All is\nriddle, and the key to a riddle is another riddle.  There are as many\npillows of illusion as flakes in a snow-storm.  We wake from one dream\ninto another dream.  The toys, to be sure, are various, and are\ngraduated in refinement to the quality of the dupe.  The intellectual\nman requires a fine bait; the sots are easily amused. But everybody is\ndrugged with his own frenzy, and the pageant marches at all hours, with\nmusic and banner and badge.\nAmid the joyous troop who give in to the charivari, comes now and then a\nsad-eyed boy, whose eyes lack the requisite refractions to clothe the\nshow in due glory, and who is afflicted with a tendency to trace home\nthe glittering miscellany of fruits and flowers to one root.  Science is\na search after identity, and the scientific whim is lurking in all\ncorners.  At the State Fair, a friend of mine complained that all the\nvarieties of fancy pears in our orchards seem to have been selected by\nsomebody who had a whim for a particular kind of pear, and only\ncultivated such as had that perfume; they were all alike.  And I\nremember the quarrel of another youth with the confectioners, that, when\nhe racked his wit to choose the best comfits in the shops, in all the\nendless varieties of sweetmeat he could only find three flavors, or two.\nWhat then? Pears and cakes are good for something; and because you,\nunluckily, have an eye or nose too keen, why need you spoil the comfort\nwhich the rest of us find in them?  I knew a humorist, who, in a good\ndeal of rattle, had a grain or two of sense.  He shocked the company by\nmaintaining that the attributes of God were two,--power and risibility;\nand that it was the duty of every pious man to keep up the comedy.  And\nI have known gentlemen of great stake in the community, but whose\nsympathies were cold,--presidents of colleges, and governors, and\nsenators,--who held themselves bound to sign every temperance pledge,\nand act with Bible societies, and missions, and peace-makers, and cry\n_Hist-a-boy!_ to every good dog.  We must not carry comity too far, but\nwe all have kind impulses in this direction.  When the boys come into my\nyard for leave to gather horse-chestnuts, I own I enter into Nature's\ngame, and affect to grant the permission reluctantly, fearing that any\nmoment they will find out the imposture of that showy chaff.  But this\ntenderness is quite unnecessary; the enchantments are laid on very\nthick.  Their young life is thatched with them.  Bare and grim to tears\nis the lot of the children in the hovel I saw yesterday; yet not the\nless they hung it round with frippery romance, like the children of the\nhappiest fortune, and talked of \"the dear cottage where so many joyful\nhours had flown.\"  Well, this thatching of hovels is the custom of the\ncountry.  Women, more than all, are the element and kingdom of illusion.\nBeing fascinated, they fascinate.  They see through Claude-Lorraines.\nAnd how dare any one, if he could, pluck away the _coulisses_, stage\neffects, and ceremonies, by which they live?  Too pathetic, too\npitiable, is the region of affection, and its atmosphere always liable\nto _mirage_.\nWe are not very much to blame for our bad marriages.  We live amid\nhallucinations; and this especial trap is laid to trip up our feet with,\nand all are tripped up first or last.  But the mighty Mother who had\nbeen so sly with us, as if she felt that she owed us some indemnity,\ninsinuates into the Pandora-box of marriage some deep and serious\nbenefits, and some great joys.  We find a delight in the beauty and\nhappiness of children, that makes the heart too big for the body.  In\nthe worst-assorted connections there is ever some mixture of true\nmarriage.  Teague and his jade get some just relations of mutual\nrespect, kindly observation, and fostering of each other, learn\nsomething, and would carry themselves wiselier, if they were now to\nbegin.\n'Tis fine for us to point at one or another fine madman, as if there\nwere any exempts.  The scholar in his library is none.  I, who have all\nmy life heard any number of orations and debates, read poems and\nmiscellaneous books, conversed with many geniuses, am still the victim\nof any new page; and, if Marmaduke, or Hugh, or Moosehead, or any other,\ninvent a new style or mythology, I fancy that the world will be all\nbrave and right, if dressed in these colors, which I had not thought of.\nThen at once I will daub with this new paint; but it will not stick.\n'Tis like the cement which the peddler sells at the door; he makes\nbroken crockery hold with it, but you can never buy of him a bit of the\ncement which will make it hold when he is gone.\nMen who make themselves felt in the world avail themselves of a certain\nfate in their constitution, which they know how to use.  But they never\ndeeply interest us, unless they lift a corner of the curtain, or betray\nnever so slightly their penetration of what is behind it.  'Tis the\ncharm of practical men, that outside of their practicality are a certain\npoetry and play, as if they led the good horse Power by the bridle, and\npreferred to walk, though they can ride so fiercely.  Bonaparte is\nintellectual, as well as Caesar; and the best soldiers, sea-captains,\nand railway men have a gentleness, when off duty; a good-natured\nadmission that there are illusions, and who shall say that he is not\ntheir sport?  We stigmatize the cast-iron fellows, who cannot so detach\nthemselves, as \"dragon-ridden,\" \"thunder-stricken,\" and fools of fate,\nwith whatever powers endowed.\nSince our tuition is through emblems and indirections, 'tis well to know\nthat there is method in it, a fixed scale, and rank above rank in the\nphantasms.  We begin low with coarse masks, and rise to the most subtle\nand beautiful.  The red men told Columbus, \"they had an herb which took\naway fatigue;\" but he found the illusion of \"arriving from the east at\nthe Indies\" more composing to his lofty spirit than any tobacco.  Is not\nour faith in the impenetrability of matter more sedative than narcotics?\nYou play with jackstraws, balls, bowls, horse and gun, estates and\npolitics; but there are finer games before you.  Is not time a pretty\ntoy? Life will show you masks that are worth all your carnivals.  Yonder\nmountain must migrate into your mind.  The fine star-dust and nebulous\nblur in Orion, \"the portentous year of Mizar and Alcor,\" must come down\nand be dealt with in your household thought.  What if you shall come to\ndiscern that the play and playground of all this pompous history are\nradiations from yourself, and that the sun borrows his beams?  What\nterrible questions we are learning to ask!  The former men believed in\nmagic, by which temples, cities, and men were swallowed up, and all\ntrace of them gone. We are coming on the secret of a magic which sweeps\nout of men's minds all vestige of theism and beliefs which they and\ntheir fathers held and were framed upon.\nThere are deceptions of the senses, deceptions of the passions, and the\nstructural, beneficent illusions of sentiment and of the intellect.\nThere is the illusion of love, which attributes to the beloved person\nall which that person shares with his or her family, sex, age, or\ncondition, nay, with the human mind itself.  'Tis these which the lover\nloves, and Anna Matilda gets the credit of them.  As if one shut up\nalways in a tower, with one window, through which the face of heaven and\nearth could be seen, should fancy that all the marvels he beheld\nbelonged to that window.  There is the illusion of time, which is very\ndeep; who has disposed of it? or come to the conviction that what seems\nthe succession of thought is only the distribution of wholes into causal\nseries?  The intellect sees that every atom carries the whole of Nature;\nthat the mind opens to omnipotence; that, in the endless striving and\nascents, the metamorphosis is entire, so that the soul doth not know\nitself in its own act, when that act is perfected.  There is illusion\nthat shall deceive even the elect.  There is illusion that shall deceive\neven the performer of the miracle.  Though he make his body, he denies\nthat he makes it. Though the world exist from thought, thought is\ndaunted in presence of the world.  One after the other we accept the\nmental laws, still resisting those which follow, which however must be\naccepted. But all our concessions only compel us to new profusion.  And\nwhat avails it that science has come to treat space and time as simply\nforms of thought, and the material world as hypothetical, and withal our\npretension of property and even of self-hood are fading with the rest,\nif, at last, even our thoughts are not finalities; but the incessant\nflowing and ascension reach these also, and each thought which yesterday\nwas a finality, to-day is yielding to a larger generalization?\nWith such volatile elements to work in, 'tis no wonder if our estimates\nare loose and floating.  We must work and affirm, but we have no guess\nof the value of what we say or do.  The cloud is now as big as your\nhand, and now it covers a county. That story of Thor, who was set to\ndrain the drinking-horn in Asgard, and to wrestle with the old woman,\nand to run with the runner Lok, and presently found that he had been\ndrinking up the sea, and wrestling with Time, and racing with Thought,\ndescribes us who are contending, amid these seeming trifles, with the\nsupreme energies of Nature.  We fancy we have fallen into bad company\nand squalid condition, low debts, shoe-bills, broken glass to pay for,\npots to buy, butcher's meat, sugar, milk, and coal.  'Set me some great\ntask, ye gods! and I will show my spirit.'  'Not so,' says the good\nHeaven; 'plod and plough, vamp your old coats and hats, weave a\nshoestring; great affairs and the best wine by and by.'  Well, 'tis all\nphantasm; and if we weave a yard of tape in all humility, and as well as\nwe can, long hereafter we shall see it was no cotton tape at all, but\nsome galaxy which we braided, and that the threads were Time and Nature.\nWe cannot write the order of the variable winds. How can we penetrate\nthe law of our shifting moods and susceptibility?  Yet they differ as\nall and nothing.  Instead of the firmament of yesterday, which our eyes\nrequire, it is to-day an eggshell which coops us in; we cannot even see\nwhat or where our stars of destiny are.  From day to day, the capital\nfacts of human life are hidden from our eyes. Suddenly the mist rolls\nup, and reveals them, and we think how much good time is gone, that\nmight have been saved, had any hint of these things been shown.  A\nsudden rise in the road shows us the system of mountains, and all the\nsummits, which have been just as near us all the year, but quite out of\nmind.  But these alternations are not without their order, and we are\nparties to our various fortune.  If life seem a succession of dreams,\nyet poetic justice is done in dreams also.  The visions of good men are\ngood; it is the undisciplined will that is whipped with bad thoughts and\nbad fortunes. When we break the laws, we lose our hold on the central\nreality.  Like sick men in hospitals, we change only from bed to bed,\nfrom one folly to another; and it cannot signify much what becomes of\nsuch castaways,--wailing, stupid, comatose creatures,--lifted from bed\nto bed, from the nothing of life to the nothing of death.\nIn this kingdom of illusions we grope eagerly for stays and foundations.\nThere is none but a strict and faithful dealing at home, and a severe\nbarring out of all duplicity or illusion there.  Whatever games are\nplayed with us, we must play no games with ourselves, but deal in our\nprivacy with the last honesty and truth.  I look upon the simple and\nchildish virtues of veracity and honesty as the root of all that is\nsublime in character.  Speak as you think, be what you are, pay your\ndebts of all kinds. I prefer to be owned as sound and solvent, and my\nword as good as my bond, and to be what cannot be skipped, or\ndissipated, or undermined, to all the _eclat_ in the universe.  This\nreality is the foundation of friendship, religion, poetry, and art.  At\nthe top or at the bottom of all illusions, I set the cheat which still\nleads us to work and live for appearances, in spite of our conviction,\nin all sane hours, that it is what we really are that avails with\nfriends, with strangers, and with fate or fortune.\nOne would think from the talk of men, that riches and poverty were a\ngreat matter; and our civilization mainly respects it.  But the Indians\nsay, that they do not think the white man with his brow of care, always\ntoiling, afraid of heat and cold, and keeping within doors, has any\nadvantage of them. The permanent interest of every man is, never to be\nin a false position, but to have the weight of Nature to back him in all\nthat he does.  Riches and poverty are a thick or thin costume; and our\nlife--the life of all of us--identical.  For we transcend the\ncircumstance continually, and taste the real quality of existence; as in\nour employments, which only differ in the manipulations, but express the\nsame laws; or in our thoughts, which wear no silks, and taste no\nice-creams.  We see God face to face every hour, and know the savor of\nNature.\nThe early Greek philosophers Heraclitus and Xenophanes measured their\nforce on this problem of identity.  Diogenes of Apollonia said, that\nunless the atoms were made of one stuff, they could never blend and act\nwith one another.  But the Hindoos, in their sacred writings, express\nthe liveliest feeling, both of the essential identity, and of that\nillusion which they conceive variety to be \"The notions, '_I am_,' and\n'_This is mine_,' which influence mankind, are but delusions of the\nmother of the world.  Dispel, O Lord of all creatures! the conceit of\nknowledge which proceeds from ignorance.\"  And the beatitude of man they\nhold to lie in being freed from fascination.\nThe intellect is stimulated by the statement of truth in a trope, and\nthe will by clothing the laws of life in illusions.  But the unities of\nTruth and of Right are not broken by the disguise.  There need never be\nany confusion in these.  In a crowded life of many parts and performers,\non a stage of nations, or in the obscurest hamlet in Maine or\nCalifornia, the same elements offer the same choices to each new comer,\nand, according to his election, he fixes his fortune in absolute Nature.\nIt would be hard to put more mental and moral philosophy than the\nPersians have thrown into a sentence:--\n\"Fooled thou must be, though wisest of the wise:\nThen be the fool of virtue, not of vice.\"\nThere is no chance, and no anarchy, in the universe.  All is system and\ngradation.  Every god is there sitting in his sphere.  The young mortal\nenters the hall of the firmament: there is he alone with them alone,\nthey pouring on him benedictions and gifts, and beckoning him up to\ntheir thrones. On the instant, and incessantly, fall snow-storms of\nillusions.  He fancies himself in a vast crowd which sways this way and\nthat, and whose movement and doings he must obey: he fancies himself\npoor, orphaned, insignificant.  The mad crowd drives hither and thither,\nnow furiously commanding this thing to be done, now that.  What is he\nthat he should resist their will, and think or act for himself?  Every\nmoment, new changes, and new showers of deceptions, to baffle and\ndistract him.  And when, by and by, for an instant, the air clears, and\nthe cloud lifts a little, there are the gods still sitting around him on\ntheir thrones,--they alone with him alone.\nTHE END.", "source": "conduct_of_life.txt"}
