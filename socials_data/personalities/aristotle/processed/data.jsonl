{"text": "The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle\nBy Aristotle\nBOOK I\nChapter I.\nEvery art, and every science reduced to a teachable form, and in like\nmanner every action and moral choice, aims, it is thought, at some\ngood: for which reason a common and by no means a bad description of\nthe Chief Good is, \u201cthat which all things aim at.\u201d\nNow there plainly is a difference in the Ends proposed: for in some\ncases they are acts of working, and in others certain works or tangible\nresults beyond and beside the acts of working: and where there are\ncertain Ends beyond and beside the actions, the works are in their\nnature better than the acts of working. Again, since actions and arts\nand sciences are many, the Ends likewise come to be many: of the\nhealing art, for instance, health; of the ship-building art, a vessel;\nof the military art, victory; and of domestic management, wealth; are\nrespectively the Ends.\nAnd whatever of such actions, arts, or sciences range under some one\nfaculty (as under that of horsemanship the art of making bridles, and\nall that are connected with the manufacture of horse-furniture in\ngeneral; this itself again, and every action connected with war, under\nthe military art; and in the same way others under others), in all\nsuch, the Ends of the master-arts are more choice-worthy than those\nranging under them, because it is with a view to the former that the\nlatter are pursued.\n(And in this comparison it makes no difference whether the acts of\nworking are themselves the Ends of the actions, or something further\nbeside them, as is the case in the arts and sciences we have been just\nspeaking of.)\nSince then of all things which may be done there is some one End which\nwe desire for its own sake, and with a view to which we desire\neverything else; and since we do not choose in all instances with a\nfurther End in view (for then men would go on without limit, and so the\ndesire would be unsatisfied and fruitless), this plainly must be the\nChief Good, _i.e._ the best thing of all.\nSurely then, even with reference to actual life and conduct, the\nknowledge of it must have great weight; and like archers, with a mark\nin view, we shall be more likely to hit upon what is right: and if so,\nwe ought to try to describe, in outline at least, what it is and of\nwhich of the sciences and faculties it is the End.\nNow one would naturally suppose it to be the End of that which is most\ncommanding and most inclusive: and to this description, \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74[1]\nplainly answers: for this it is that determines which of the sciences\nshould be in the communities, and which kind individuals are to learn,\nand what degree of proficiency is to be required. Again; we see also\nranging under this the most highly esteemed faculties, such as the art\nmilitary, and that of domestic management, and Rhetoric. Well then,\nsince this uses all the other practical sciences, and moreover lays\ndown rules as to what men are to do, and from what to abstain, the End\nof this must include the Ends of the rest, and so must be The Good of\nMan. And grant that this is the same to the individual and to the\ncommunity, yet surely that of the latter is plainly greater and more\nperfect to discover and preserve: for to do this even for a single\nindividual were a matter for contentment; but to do it for a whole\nnation, and for communities generally, were more noble and godlike.\nSuch then are the objects proposed by our treatise, which is of the\nnature of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74: and I conceive I shall have spoken on them\nsatisfactorily, if they be made as distinctly clear as the nature of\nthe subject-matter will admit: for exactness must not be looked for in\nall discussions alike, any more than in all works of handicraft. Now\nthe notions of nobleness and justice, with the examination of which\n\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 is concerned, admit of variation and error to such a degree,\nthat they are supposed by some to exist conventionally only, and not in\nthe nature of things: but then, again, the things which are allowed to\nbe goods admit of a similar error, because harm comes to many from\nthem: for before now some have perished through wealth, and others\nthrough valour.\nWe must be content then, in speaking of such things and from such data,\nto set forth the truth roughly and in outline; in other words, since we\nare speaking of general matter and from general data, to draw also\nconclusions merely general. And in the same spirit should each person\nreceive what we say: for the man of education will seek exactness so\nfar in each subject as the nature of the thing admits, it being plainly\nmuch the same absurdity to put up with a mathematician who tries to\npersuade instead of proving, and to demand strict demonstrative\nreasoning of a Rhetorician.\nNow each man judges well what he knows, and of these things he is a\ngood judge: on each particular matter then he is a good judge who has\nbeen instructed in _it_, and in a general way the man of general mental\ncultivation.[2]\nHence the young man is not a fit student of Moral Philosophy, for he\nhas no experience in the actions of life, while all that is said\npresupposes and is concerned with these: and in the next place, since\nhe is apt to follow the impulses of his passions, he will hear as\nthough he heard not, and to no profit, the end in view being practice\nand not mere knowledge.\nAnd I draw no distinction between young in years, and youthful in\ntemper and disposition: the defect to which I allude being no direct\nresult of the time, but of living at the beck and call of passion, and\nfollowing each object as it rises.[3] For to them that are such the\nknowledge comes to be unprofitable, as to those of imperfect\nself-control: but, to those who form their desires and act in\naccordance with reason, to have knowledge on these points must be very\nprofitable.\nLet thus much suffice by way of preface on these three points, the\nstudent, the spirit in which our observations should be received, and\nthe object which we propose.\nChapter II.\nAnd now, resuming the statement with which we commenced, since all\nknowledge and moral choice grasps at good of some kind or another, what\ngood is that which we say \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 aims at? or, in other words, what is\nthe highest of all the goods which are the objects of action?\nSo far as name goes, there is a pretty general agreement: for HAPPINESS\nboth the multitude and the refined few call it, and \u201cliving well\u201d and\n\u201cdoing well\u201d they conceive to be the same with \u201cbeing happy;\u201d but about\nthe Nature of this Happiness, men dispute, and the multitude do not in\ntheir account of it agree with the wise. For some say it is some one of\nthose things which are palpable and apparent, as pleasure or wealth or\nhonour; in fact, some one thing, some another; nay, oftentimes the same\nman gives a different account of it; for when ill, he calls it health;\nwhen poor, wealth: and conscious of their own ignorance, men admire\nthose who talk grandly and above their comprehension. Some again held\nit to be something by itself, other than and beside these many good\nthings, which is in fact to all these the cause of their being good.\nNow to sift all the opinions would be perhaps rather a fruitless task;\nso it shall suffice to sift those which are most generally current, or\nare thought to have some reason in them.\nAnd here we must not forget the difference between reasoning from\nprinciples, and reasoning to principles: for with good cause did Plato\ntoo doubt about this, and enquire whether the right road is from\nprinciples or to principles, just as in the racecourse from the judges\nto the further end, or _vice vers\u00e2_.\nOf course, we must begin with what is known; but then this is of two\nkinds, what we _do_ know, and what we _may_ know:[5] perhaps then as\nindividuals we must begin with what we _do_ know. Hence the necessity\nthat he should have been well trained in habits, who is to study, with\nany tolerable chance of profit, the principles of nobleness and justice\nand moral philosophy generally. For a principle is a matter of fact,\nand if the fact is sufficiently clear to a man there will be no need in\naddition of the reason for the fact. And he that has been thus trained\neither has principles already, or can receive them easily: as for him\nwho neither has nor can receive them, let him hear his sentence from\nHesiod:\nHe is best of all who of himself conceiveth all things;\nGood again is he too who can adopt a good suggestion;\nBut whoso neither of himself conceiveth nor hearing from another\nLayeth it to heart;\u2014he is a useless man.\nChapter III.\nBut to return from this digression.\nNow of the Chief Good (_i.e._ of Happiness) men seem to form their\nnotions from the different modes of life, as we might naturally expect:\nthe many and most low conceive it to be pleasure, and hence they are\ncontent with the life of sensual enjoyment. For there are three lines\nof life which stand out prominently to view: that just mentioned, and\nthe life in society, and, thirdly, the life of contemplation.\nNow the many are plainly quite slavish, choosing a life like that of\nbrute animals: yet they obtain some consideration, because many of the\ngreat share the tastes of Sardanapalus. The refined and active again\nconceive it to be honour: for this may be said to be the end of the\nlife in society: yet it is plainly too superficial for the object of\nour search, because it is thought to rest with those who pay rather\nthan with him who receives it, whereas the Chief Good we feel\ninstinctively must be something which is our own, and not easily to be\ntaken from us.\nAnd besides, men seem to pursue honour, that they may believe\nthemselves to be good:[6] for instance, they seek to be honoured by the\nwise, and by those among whom they are known, and for virtue: clearly\nthen, in the opinion at least of these men, virtue is higher than\nhonour. In truth, one would be much more inclined to think this to be\nthe end of the life in society; yet this itself is plainly not\nsufficiently final: for it is conceived possible, that a man possessed\nof virtue might sleep or be inactive all through his life, or, as a\nthird case, suffer the greatest evils and misfortunes: and the man who\nshould live thus no one would call happy, except for mere disputation\u2019s\nsake.[7]\nAnd for these let thus much suffice, for they have been treated of at\nsufficient length in my Encyclia.[8]\nA third line of life is that of contemplation, concerning which we\nshall make our examination in the following pages.[9]\nAs for the life of money-making, it is one of constraint, and wealth\nmanifestly is not the good we are seeking, because it is for use, that\nis, for the sake of something further: and hence one would rather\nconceive the forementioned ends to be the right ones, for men rest\ncontent with them for their own sakes. Yet, clearly, they are not the\nobjects of our search either, though many words have been wasted on\nthem.[10] So much then for these.\nAgain, the notion of one Universal Good (the same, that is, in all\nthings), it is better perhaps we should examine, and discuss the\nmeaning of it, though such an enquiry is unpleasant, because they are\nfriends of ours who have introduced these \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7.[11] Still perhaps it\nmay appear better, nay to be our duty where the safety of the truth is\nconcerned, to upset if need be even our own theories, specially as we\nare lovers of wisdom: for since both are dear to us, we are bound to\nprefer the truth. Now they who invented this doctrine of \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7, did not\napply it to those things in which they spoke of priority and\nposteriority, and so they never made any \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1 of numbers; but good is\npredicated in the categories of Substance, Quality, and Relation; now\nthat which exists of itself, i.e. Substance, is prior in the nature of\nthings to that which is relative, because this latter is an off-shoot,\nas it were, and result of that which is; on their own principle then\nthere cannot be a common \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1 in the case of these.\nIn the next place, since good is predicated in as many ways as there\nare modes of existence [for it is predicated in the category of\nSubstance, as God, Intellect\u2014and in that of Quality, as The Virtues\u2014and\nin that of Quantity, as The Mean\u2014and in that of Relation, as The\nUseful\u2014and in that of Time, as Opportunity\u2014and in that of Place, as\nAbode; and other such like things], it manifestly cannot be something\ncommon and universal and one in all: else it would not have been\npredicated in all the categories, but in one only.\nThirdly, since those things which range under one \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1 are also under\nthe cognisance of one science, there would have been, on their theory,\nonly one science taking cognisance of all goods collectively: but in\nfact there are many even for those which range under one category: for\ninstance, of Opportunity or Seasonableness (which I have before\nmentioned as being in the category of Time), the science is, in war,\ngeneralship; in disease, medical science; and of the Mean (which I\nquoted before as being in the category of Quantity), in food, the\nmedical science; and in labour or exercise, the gymnastic science. A\nperson might fairly doubt also what in the world they mean by very-this\nthat or the other, since, as they would themselves allow, the account\nof the humanity is one and the same in the very-Man, and in any\nindividual Man: for so far as the individual and the very-Man are both\nMan, they will not differ at all: and if so, then very-good and any\nparticular good will not differ, in so far as both are good. Nor will\nit do to say, that the eternity of the very-good makes it to be more\ngood; for what has lasted white ever so long, is no whiter than what\nlasts but for a day.\nNo. The Pythagoreans do seem to give a more credible account of the\nmatter, who place \u201cOne\u201d among the goods in their double list of goods\nand bads:[12] which philosophers, in fact, Speusippus[13] seems to have\nfollowed.\nBut of these matters let us speak at some other time. Now there is\nplainly a loophole to object to what has been advanced, on the plea\nthat the theory I have attacked is not by its advocates applied to all\ngood: but those goods only are spoken of as being under one \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1, which\nare pursued, and with which men rest content simply for their own\nsakes: whereas those things which have a tendency to produce or\npreserve them in any way, or to hinder their contraries, are called\ngood because of these other goods, and after another fashion. It is\nmanifest then that the goods may be so called in two senses, the one\nclass for their own sakes, the other because of these.\nVery well then, let us separate the independent goods from the\ninstrumental, and see whether they are spoken of as under one \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1.\nBut the question next arises, what kind of goods are we to call\nindependent? All such as are pursued even when separated from other\ngoods, as, for instance, being wise, seeing, and certain pleasures and\nhonours (for these, though we do pursue them with some further end in\nview, one would still place among the independent goods)? or does it\ncome in fact to this, that we can call nothing independent good except\nthe \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1, and so the concrete of it will be nought?\nIf, on the other hand, these are independent goods, then we shall\nrequire that the account of the goodness be the same clearly in all,\njust as that of the whiteness is in snow and white lead. But how stands\nthe fact? Why of honour and wisdom and pleasure the accounts are\ndistinct and different in so far as they are good. The Chief Good then\nis not something common, and after one \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1.\nBut then, how does the name come to be common (for it is not seemingly\na case of fortuitous equivocation)? Are different individual things\ncalled good by virtue of being from one source, or all conducing to one\nend, or rather by way of analogy, for that intellect is to the soul as\nsight to the body, and so on? However, perhaps we ought to leave these\nquestions now, for an accurate investigation of them is more properly\nthe business of a different philosophy. And likewise respecting the\n\u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1: for even if there is some one good predicated in common of all\nthings that are good, or separable and capable of existing\nindependently, manifestly it cannot be the object of human action or\nattainable by Man; but we are in search now of something that is\nso.[14]\nIt may readily occur to any one, that it would be better to attain a\nknowledge of it with a view to such concrete goods as are attainable\nand practical, because, with this as a kind of model in our hands, we\nshall the better know what things are good for us individually, and\nwhen we know them, we shall attain them.\nSome plausibility, it is true, this argument possesses, but it is\ncontradicted by the facts of the Arts and Sciences; for all these,\nthough aiming at some good, and seeking that which is deficient, yet\npretermit the knowledge of it: now it is not exactly probable that all\nartisans without exception should be ignorant of so great a help as\nthis would be, and not even look after it; neither is it easy to see\nwherein a weaver or a carpenter will be profited in respect of his\ncraft by knowing the very-good, or how a man will be the more apt to\neffect cures or to command an army for having seen the \u1f30\u03b4\u1f73\u03b1 itself. For\nmanifestly it is not health after this general and abstract fashion\nwhich is the subject of the physician\u2019s investigation, but the health\nof Man, or rather perhaps of this or that man; for he has to heal\nindividuals.\u2014Thus much on these points.\nChapter IV.\nAnd now let us revert to the Good of which we are in search: what can\nit be? for manifestly it is different in different actions and arts:\nfor it is different in the healing art and in the art military, and\nsimilarly in the rest. What then is the Chief Good in each? Is it not\n\u201cthat for the sake of which the other things are done?\u201d and this in the\nhealing art is health, and in the art military victory, and in that of\nhouse-building a house, and in any other thing something else; in\nshort, in every action and moral choice the End, because in all cases\nmen do everything else with a view to this. So that if there is some\none End of all things which are and may be done, this must be the Good\nproposed by doing, or if more than one, then these.\nThus our discussion after some traversing about has come to the same\npoint which we reached before. And this we must try yet more to clear\nup.\nNow since the ends are plainly many, and of these we choose some with a\nview to others (wealth, for instance, musical instruments, and, in\ngeneral, all instruments), it is clear that all are not final: but the\nChief Good is manifestly something final; and so, if there is some one\nonly which is final, this must be the object of our search: but if\nseveral, then the most final of them will be it.\nNow that which is an object of pursuit in itself we call more final\nthan that which is so with a view to something else; that again which\nis never an object of choice with a view to something else than those\nwhich are so both in themselves and with a view to this ulterior\nobject: and so by the term \u201cabsolutely final,\u201d we denote that which is\nan object of choice always in itself, and never with a view to any\nother.\nAnd of this nature Happiness is mostly thought to be, for this we\nchoose always for its own sake, and never with a view to anything\nfurther: whereas honour, pleasure, intellect, in fact every excellence\nwe choose for their own sakes, it is true (because we would choose each\nof these even if no result were to follow), but we choose them also\nwith a view to happiness, conceiving that through their instrumentality\nwe shall be happy: but no man chooses happiness with a view to them,\nnor in fact with a view to any other thing whatsoever.\nThe same result[15] is seen to follow also from the notion of\nself-sufficiency, a quality thought to belong to the final good. Now by\nsufficient for Self, we mean not for a single individual living a\nsolitary life, but for his parents also and children and wife, and, in\ngeneral, friends and countrymen; for man is by nature adapted to a\nsocial existence. But of these, of course, some limit must be fixed:\nfor if one extends it to parents and descendants and friends\u2019 friends,\nthere is no end to it. This point, however, must be left for future\ninvestigation: for the present we define that to be self-sufficient\n\u201cwhich taken alone makes life choice-worthy, and to be in want of\nnothing;\u201d now of such kind we think Happiness to be: and further, to be\nmost choice-worthy of all things; not being reckoned with any other\nthing,[16] for if it were so reckoned, it is plain we must then allow\nit, with the addition of ever so small a good, to be more choice-worthy\nthan it was before:[17] because what is put to it becomes an addition of so\nmuch more good, and of goods the greater is ever the more\nchoice-worthy.\nSo then Happiness is manifestly something final and self-sufficient,\nbeing the end of all things which are and may be done.\nChapter V.\nBut, it may be, to call Happiness the Chief Good is a mere truism, and\nwhat is wanted is some clearer account of its real nature. Now this\nobject may be easily attained, when we have discovered what is the work\nof man; for as in the case of flute-player, statuary, or artisan of any\nkind, or, more generally, all who have any work or course of action,\ntheir Chief Good and Excellence is thought to reside in their work, so\nit would seem to be with man, if there is any work belonging to him.\nAre we then to suppose, that while carpenter and cobbler have certain\nworks and courses of action, Man as Man has none, but is left by Nature\nwithout a work? or would not one rather hold, that as eye, hand, and\nfoot, and generally each of his members, has manifestly some special\nwork; so too the whole Man, as distinct from all these, has some work\nof his own?[18]\nWhat then can this be? not mere life, because that plainly is shared\nwith him even by vegetables, and we want what is peculiar to him. We\nmust separate off then the life of mere nourishment and growth, and\nnext will come the life of sensation: but this again manifestly is\ncommon to horses, oxen, and every animal. There remains then a kind of\nlife of the Rational Nature apt to act: and of this Nature there are\ntwo parts denominated Rational, the one as being obedient to Reason,\nthe other as having and exerting it. Again, as this life is also spoken\nof in two ways,[19] we must take that which is in the way of actual\nworking, because this is thought to be most properly entitled to the\nname. If then the work of Man is a working of the soul in accordance\nwith reason, or at least not independently of reason, and we say that\nthe work of any given subject, and of that subject good of its kind,\nare the same in kind (as, for instance, of a harp-player and a good\nharp-player, and so on in every case, adding to the work eminence in\nthe way of excellence; I mean, the work of a harp-player is to play the\nharp, and of a good harp-player to play it well); if, I say, this is\nso, and we assume the work of Man to be life of a certain kind, that is\nto say a working of the soul, and actions with reason, and of a good\nman to do these things well and nobly, and in fact everything is\nfinished off well in the way of the excellence which peculiarly belongs\nto it: if all this is so, then the Good of Man comes to be \u201ca working\nof the Soul in the way of Excellence,\u201d or, if Excellence admits of\ndegrees, in the way of the best and most perfect Excellence.\nAnd we must add, \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u1f77\u1ff3 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u1f77\u1ff3;[20] for as it is not one swallow or one\nfine day that makes a spring, so it is not one day or a short time that\nmakes a man blessed and happy.\nLet this then be taken for a rough sketch of the Chief Good: since it\nis probably the right way to give first the outline, and fill it in\nafterwards. And it would seem that any man may improve and connect what\nis good in the sketch, and that time is a good discoverer and\nco-operator in such matters: it is thus in fact that all improvements\nin the various arts have been brought about, for any man may fill up a\ndeficiency.\nYou must remember also what has been already stated, and not seek for\nexactness in all matters alike, but in each according to the\nsubject-matter, and so far as properly belongs to the system. The\ncarpenter and geometrician, for instance, enquire into the right line\nin different fashion: the former so far as he wants it for his work,\nthe latter enquires into its nature and properties, because he is\nconcerned with the truth.\nSo then should one do in other matters, that the incidental matters may\nnot exceed the direct ones.\nAnd again, you must not demand the reason either in all things\nalike,[21] because in some it is sufficient that the fact has been well\ndemonstrated, which is the case with first principles; and the fact is\nthe first step, _i.e._ starting-point or principle.\nAnd of these first principles some are obtained by induction, some by\nperception,[22] some by a course of habituation, others in other\ndifferent ways. And we must try to trace up each in their own nature,\nand take pains to secure their being well defined, because they have\ngreat influence on what follows: it is thought, I mean, that the\nstarting-point or principle is more than half the whole matter, and\nthat many of the points of enquiry come simultaneously into view\nthereby.\nChapter VI.\nWe must now enquire concerning Happiness, not only from our conclusion\nand the data on which our reasoning proceeds, but likewise from what is\ncommonly said about it: because with what is true all things which\nreally are are in harmony, but with that which is false the true very\nsoon jars.\nNow there is a common division of goods into three classes; one being\ncalled external, the other two those of the soul and body respectively,\nand those belonging to the soul we call most properly and specially\ngood. Well, in our definition we assume that the actions and workings\nof the soul constitute Happiness, and these of course belong to the\nsoul. And so our account is a good one, at least according to this\nopinion, which is of ancient date, and accepted by those who profess\nphilosophy. Rightly too are certain actions and workings said to be the\nend, for thus it is brought into the number of the goods of the soul\ninstead of the external. Agreeing also with our definition is the\ncommon notion, that the happy man lives well and does well, for it has\nbeen stated by us to be pretty much a kind of living well and doing\nwell.\nAnd further, the points required in Happiness are found in combination\nin our account of it.\nFor some think it is virtue, others practical wisdom, others a kind of\nscientific philosophy; others that it is these, or else some one of\nthem, in combination with pleasure, or at least not independently of\nit; while others again take in external prosperity.\nOf these opinions, some rest on the authority of numbers or antiquity,\nothers on that of few, and those men of note: and it is not likely that\neither of these classes should be wrong in all points, but be right at\nleast in some one, or even in most.\nNow with those who assert it to be Virtue (Excellence), or some kind of\nVirtue, our account agrees: for working in the way of Excellence surely\nbelongs to Excellence.\nAnd there is perhaps no unimportant difference between conceiving of\nthe Chief Good as in possession or as in use, in other words, as a mere\nstate or as a working. For the state or habit[23] may possibly exist in\na subject without effecting any good, as, for instance, in him who is\nasleep, or in any other way inactive; but the working cannot so, for it\nwill of necessity act, and act well. And as at the Olympic games it is\nnot the finest and strongest men who are crowned, but they who enter\nthe lists, for out of these the prize-men are selected; so too in life,\nof the honourable and the good, it is they who act who rightly win the\nprizes.[24]\nTheir life too is in itself pleasant: for the feeling of pleasure is a\nmental sensation, and that is to each pleasant of which he is said to\nbe fond: a horse, for instance, to him who is fond of horses, and a\nsight to him who is fond of sights: and so in like manner just acts to\nhim who is fond of justice, and more generally the things in accordance\nwith virtue to him who is fond of virtue. Now in the case of the\nmultitude of men the things which they individually esteem pleasant\nclash, because they are not such by nature, whereas to the lovers of\nnobleness those things are pleasant which are such by nature: but the\nactions in accordance with virtue are of this kind, so that they are\npleasant both to the individuals and also in themselves.\nSo then their life has no need of pleasure as a kind of additional\nappendage, but involves pleasure in itself. For, besides what I have\njust mentioned, a man is not a good man at all who feels no pleasure in\nnoble actions,[25] just as no one would call that man just who does not\nfeel pleasure in acting justly, or liberal who does not in liberal\nactions, and similarly in the case of the other virtues which might be\nenumerated: and if this be so, then the actions in accordance with\nvirtue must be in themselves pleasurable. Then again they are certainly\ngood and noble, and each of these in the highest degree; if we are to\ntake as right the judgment of the good man, for he judges as we have\nsaid.\nThus then Happiness is most excellent, most noble, and most pleasant,\nand these attributes are not separated as in the well-known Delian\ninscription\u2014\n\u201cMost noble is that which is most just, but best is health;\nAnd naturally most pleasant is the obtaining one\u2019s desires.\u201d\nFor all these co-exist in the best acts of working: and we say that\nHappiness is these, or one, that is, the best of them.\nStill[26] it is quite plain that it does require the addition of\nexternal goods, as we have said: because without appliances it is\nimpossible, or at all events not easy, to do noble actions: for\nfriends, money, and political influence are in a manner instruments\nwhereby many things are done: some things there are again a deficiency\nin which mars blessedness; good birth, for instance, or fine offspring,\nor even personal beauty: for he is not at all capable of Happiness who\nis very ugly, or is ill-born, or solitary and childless; and still less\nperhaps supposing him to have very bad children or friends, or to have\nlost good ones by death. As we have said already, the addition of\nprosperity of this kind does seem necessary to complete the idea of\nHappiness; hence some rank good fortune, and others virtue, with\nHappiness.\nChapter VII.\nAnd hence too a question is raised, whether it is a thing that can be\nlearned, or acquired by habituation or discipline of some other kind,\nor whether it comes in the way of divine dispensation, or even in the\nway of chance.\nNow to be sure, if anything else is a gift of the Gods to men, it is\nprobable that Happiness is a gift of theirs too, and specially because\nof all human goods it is the highest. But this, it may be, is a\nquestion belonging more properly to an investigation different from\nours:[27] and it is quite clear, that on the supposition of its not\nbeing sent from the Gods direct, but coming to us by reason of virtue\nand learning of a certain kind, or discipline, it is yet one of the\nmost Godlike things; because the prize and End of virtue is manifestly\nsomewhat most excellent, nay divine and blessed.\nIt will also on this supposition be widely participated, for it may\nthrough learning and diligence of a certain kind exist in all who have\nnot been maimed[28] for virtue.\nAnd if it is better we should be happy thus than as a result of chance,\nthis is in itself an argument that the case is so; because those things\nwhich are in the way of nature, and in like manner of art, and of every\ncause, and specially the best cause, are by nature in the best way\npossible: to leave them to chance what is greatest and most noble would\nbe very much out of harmony with all these facts.[29]\nThe question may be determined also by a reference to our definition of\nHappiness, that it is a working of the soul in the way of excellence or\nvirtue of a certain kind: and of the other goods, some we must have to\nbegin with, and those which are co-operative and useful are given by\nnature as instruments.[30]\nThese considerations will harmonise also with what we said at the\ncommencement: for we assumed the End of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 to be most excellent:\nnow this bestows most care on making the members of the community of a\ncertain character; good that is and apt to do what is honourable.\nWith good reason then neither ox nor horse nor any other brute animal\ndo we call happy, for none of them can partake in such working: and for\nthis same reason a child is not happy either, because by reason of his\ntender age he cannot yet perform such actions: if the term is applied,\nit is by way of anticipation.\nFor to constitute Happiness, there must be, as we have said, complete\nvirtue and a complete life: for many changes and chances of all kinds\narise during a life, and he who is most prosperous may become involved\nin great misfortunes in his old age, as in the heroic poems the tale is\ntold of Priam: but the man who has experienced such fortune and died in\nwretchedness, no man calls happy.\nChapter VIII.\nAre we then to call no man happy while he lives, and, as Solon would\nhave us, look to the end? And again, if we are to maintain this\nposition, is a man then happy when he is dead? or is not this a\ncomplete absurdity, specially in us who say Happiness is a working of a\ncertain kind?\nIf on the other hand we do not assert that the dead man is happy, and\nSolon does not mean this, but only that one would then be safe in\npronouncing a man happy, as being thenceforward out of the reach of\nevils and misfortunes, this too admits of some dispute, since it is\nthought that the dead has somewhat both of good and evil (if, as we\nmust allow, a man may have when alive but not aware of the\ncircumstances), as honour and dishonour, and good and bad fortune of\nchildren and descendants generally.\nNor is this view again without its difficulties: for, after a man has\nlived in blessedness to old age and died accordingly, many changes may\nbefall him in right of his descendants; some of them may be good and\nobtain positions in life accordant to their merits, others again quite\nthe contrary: it is plain too that the descendants may at different\nintervals or grades stand in all manner of relations to the\nancestors.[31] Absurd indeed would be the position that even the dead\nman is to change about with them and become at one time happy and at\nanother miserable. Absurd however it is on the other hand that the\naffairs of the descendants should in no degree and during no time\naffect the ancestors.\nBut we must revert to the point first raised,[32] since the present\nquestion will be easily determined from that.\nIf then we are to look to the end and then pronounce the man blessed,\nnot as being so but as having been so at some previous time, surely it\nis absurd that when he _is_ happy the truth is not to be asserted of\nhim, because we are unwilling to pronounce the living happy by reason\nof their liability to changes, and because, whereas we have conceived\nof happiness as something stable and no way easily changeable, the fact\nis that good and bad fortune are constantly circling about the same\npeople: for it is quite plain, that if we are to depend upon the\nfortunes of men, we shall often have to call the same man happy, and a\nlittle while after miserable, thus representing our happy man,\n\u201cChameleon-like, and based on rottenness.\u201d\nIs not this the solution? that to make our sentence dependent on the\nchanges of fortune, is no way right: for not in them stands the well,\nor the ill, but though human life needs these as accessories (which we\nhave allowed already), the workings in the way of virtue are what\ndetermine Happiness, and the contrary the contrary.\nAnd, by the way, the question which has been here discussed, testifies\nincidentally to the truth of our account of Happiness.[33] For to\nnothing does a stability of human results attach so much as it does to\nthe workings in the way of virtue, since these are held to be more\nabiding even than the sciences: and of these last again[34] the most\nprecious are the most abiding, because the blessed live in them most\nand most continuously, which seems to be the reason why they are not\nforgotten. So then this stability which is sought will be in the happy\nman, and he will be such through life, since always, or most of all, he\nwill be doing and contemplating the things which are in the way of\nvirtue: and the various chances of life he will bear most nobly, and at\nall times and in all ways harmoniously, since he is the truly good man,\nor in the terms of our proverb \u201ca faultless cube.\u201d\nAnd whereas the incidents of chance are many, and differ in greatness\nand smallness, the small pieces of good or ill fortune evidently do not\naffect the balance of life, but the great and numerous, if happening\nfor good, will make life more blessed (for it is their nature to\ncontribute to ornament, and the using of them comes to be noble and\nexcellent), but if for ill, they bruise as it were and maim the\nblessedness: for they bring in positive pain, and hinder many acts of\nworking. But still, even in these, nobleness shines through when a man\nbears contentedly many and great mischances not from insensibility to\npain but because he is noble and high-spirited.\nAnd if, as we have said, the acts of working are what determine the\ncharacter of the life, no one of the blessed can ever become wretched,\nbecause he will never do those things which are hateful and mean. For\nthe man who is truly good and sensible bears all fortunes, we presume,\nbecomingly, and always does what is noblest under the circumstances,\njust as a good general employs to the best advantage the force he has\nwith him; or a good shoemaker makes the handsomest shoe he can out of\nthe leather which has been given him; and all other good artisans\nlikewise. And if this be so, wretched never can the happy man come to\nbe: I do not mean to say he will be blessed should he fall into\nfortunes like those of Priam.\nNor, in truth, is he shifting and easily changeable, for on the one\nhand from his happiness he will not be shaken easily nor by ordinary\nmischances, but, if at all, by those which are great and numerous; and,\non the other, after such mischances he cannot regain his happiness in a\nlittle time; but, if at all, in a long and complete period, during\nwhich he has made himself master of great and noble things.\nWhy then should we not call happy the man who works in the way of\nperfect virtue, and is furnished with external goods sufficient for\nacting his part in the drama of life:[35] and this during no ordinary\nperiod but such as constitutes a complete life as we have been\ndescribing it.\nOr we must add, that not only is he to live so, but his death must be\nin keeping with such life, since the future is dark to us, and\nHappiness we assume to be in every way an end and complete. And, if\nthis be so, we shall call them among the living blessed who have and\nwill have the things specified, but blessed _as Men_.[36]\nOn these points then let it suffice to have denned thus much.\nChapter IX.\nNow that the fortunes of their descendants, and friends generally,\ncontribute nothing towards forming the condition of the dead, is\nplainly a very heartless notion, and contrary to the current opinions.\nBut since things which befall are many, and differ in all kinds of\nways, and some touch more nearly, others less, to go into minute\nparticular distinctions would evidently be a long and endless task: and\nso it may suffice to speak generally and in outline.\nIf then, as of the misfortunes which happen to one\u2019s self, some have a\ncertain weight and turn the balance of life, while others are, so to\nspeak, lighter; so it is likewise with those which befall all our\nfriends alike; if further, whether they whom each suffering befalls be\nalive or dead makes much more difference than in a tragedy the\npresupposing or actual perpetration of the various crimes and horrors,\nwe must take into our account this difference also, and still more\nperhaps the doubt concerning the dead whether they really partake of\nany good or evil; it seems to result from all these considerations,\nthat if anything does pierce the veil and reach them, be the same good\nor bad, it must be something trivial and small, either in itself or to\nthem; or at least of such a magnitude or such a kind as neither to make\nhappy them that are not so otherwise, nor to deprive of their\nblessedness them that are.[37]\nIt is plain then that the good or ill fortunes of their friends do\naffect the dead somewhat: but in such kind and degree as neither to\nmake the happy unhappy nor produce any other such effect.\nChapter X.\nHaving determined these points, let us examine with respect to\nHappiness, whether it belongs to the class of things praiseworthy or\nthings precious; for to that of faculties[38] it evidently does not.\nNow it is plain that everything which is a subject of praise is praised\nfor being of a certain kind and bearing a certain relation to something\nelse: for instance, the just, and the valiant, and generally the good\nman, and virtue itself, we praise because of the actions and the\nresults: and the strong man, and the quick runner, and so forth, we\npraise for being of a certain nature and bearing a certain relation to\nsomething good and excellent (and this is illustrated by attempts to\npraise the gods; for they are presented in a ludicrous aspect[39] by\nbeing referred to our standard, and this results from the fact, that\nall praise does, as we have said, imply reference to a standard). Now\nif it is to such objects that praise belongs, it is evident that what\nis applicable to the best objects is not praise, but something higher\nand better: which is plain matter of fact, for not only do we call the\ngods blessed and happy, but of men also we pronounce those blessed who\nmost nearly resemble the gods. And in like manner in respect of goods;\nno man thinks of praising Happiness as he does the principle of\njustice, but calls it blessed, as being somewhat more godlike and more\nexcellent.\nEudoxus[40] too is thought to have advanced a sound argument in support\nof the claim of pleasure to the highest prize: for the fact that,\nthough it is one of the good things, it is not praised, he took for an\nindication of its superiority to those which are subjects of praise: a\nsuperiority he attributed also to a god and the Chief Good, on the\nground that they form the standard to which everything besides is\nreferred. For praise applies to virtue, because it makes men apt to do\nwhat is noble; but encomia to definite works of body or mind.[41]\nHowever, it is perhaps more suitable to a regular treatise on encomia\nto pursue this topic with exactness: it is enough for our purpose that\nfrom what has been said it is evident that Happiness belongs to the\nclass of things precious and final. And it seems to be so also because\nof its being a starting-point; which it is, in that with a view to it\nwe all do everything else that is done; now the starting-point and\ncause of good things we assume to be something precious and divine.\nChapter XI.\nMoreover, since Happiness is a kind of working of the soul in the way\nof perfect Excellence, we must enquire concerning Excellence: for so\nprobably shall we have a clearer view concerning Happiness; and again,\nhe who is really a statesman is generally thought to have spent most\npains on this, for he wishes to make the citizens good and obedient to\nthe laws. (For examples of this class we have the lawgivers of the\nCretans and Laced\u00e6monians and whatever other such there have been.)\nBut if this investigation belongs properly to \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74, then clearly\nthe enquiry will be in accordance with our original design.\nWell, we are to enquire concerning Excellence, _i.e._ Human Excellence\nof course, because it was the Chief Good of Man and the Happiness of\nMan that we were enquiring of just now.\nAnd by Human Excellence we mean not that of man\u2019s body but that of his\nsoul; for we call Happiness a working of the Soul.\nAnd if this is so, it is plain that some knowledge of the nature of the\nSoul is necessary for the statesman, just as for the oculist a\nknowledge of the whole body, and the more so in proportion as \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\nis more precious and higher than the healing art: and in fact\nphysicians of the higher class do busy themselves much with the\nknowledge of the body.\nSo then the statesman is to consider the nature of the Soul: but he\nmust do so with these objects in view, and so far only as may suffice\nfor the objects of his special enquiry: for to carry his speculations\nto a greater exactness is perhaps a task more laborious than falls\nwithin his province.\nIn fact, the few statements made on the subject in my popular treatises\nare quite enough, and accordingly we will adopt them here: as, that the\nSoul consists of two parts, the Irrational and the Rational (as to\nwhether these are actually divided, as are the parts of the body, and\neverything that is capable of division; or are only metaphysically\nspeaking two, being by nature inseparable, as are convex and concave\ncircumferences, matters not in respect of our present purpose). And of\nthe Irrational, the one part seems common to other objects, and in fact\nvegetative; I mean the cause of nourishment and growth (for such a\nfaculty of the Soul one would assume to exist in all things that\nreceive nourishment, even in embryos, and this the same as in the\nperfect creatures; for this is more likely than that it should be a\ndifferent one).\nNow the Excellence of this manifestly is not peculiar to the human\nspecies but common to others: for this part and this faculty is thought\nto work most in time of sleep, and the good and bad man are least\ndistinguishable while asleep; whence it is a common saying that during\none half of life there is no difference between the happy and the\nwretched; and this accords with our anticipations, for sleep is an\ninactivity of the soul, in so far as it is denominated good or bad,\nexcept that in some wise some of its movements find their way through\nthe veil and so the good come to have better dreams than ordinary men.\nBut enough of this: we must forego any further mention of the nutritive\npart, since it is not naturally capable of the Excellence which is\npeculiarly human.\nAnd there seems to be another Irrational Nature of the Soul, which yet\nin a way partakes of Reason. For in the man who controls his appetites,\nand in him who resolves to do so and fails, we praise the Reason or\nRational part of the Soul, because it exhorts aright and to the best\ncourse: but clearly there is in them, beside the Reason, some other\nnatural principle which fights with and strains against the Reason.\n(For in plain terms, just as paralysed limbs of the body when their\nowners would move them to the right are borne aside in a contrary\ndirection to the left, so is it in the case of the Soul, for the\nimpulses of men who cannot control their appetites are to contrary\npoints: the difference is that in the case of the body we do see what\nis borne aside but in the case of the soul we do not. But, it may be,\nnot the less[42] on that account are we to suppose that there is in the\nSoul also somewhat besides the Reason, which is opposed to this and\ngoes against it; as to _how_ it is different, that is irrelevant.)\nBut of Reason this too does evidently partake, as we have said: for\ninstance, in the man of self-control it obeys Reason: and perhaps in\nthe man of perfected self-mastery,[43] or the brave man, it is yet\nmore obedient; in them it agrees entirely with the Reason.\nSo then the Irrational is plainly twofold: the one part, the merely\nvegetative, has no share of Reason, but that of desire, or appetition\ngenerally, does partake of it in a sense, in so far as it is obedient\nto it and capable of submitting to its rule. (So too in common phrase\nwe say we have \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 of our father or friends, and this in a different\nsense from that in which we say we have \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 of mathematics.)[44]\nNow that the Irrational is in some way persuaded by the Reason,\nadmonition, and every act of rebuke and exhortation indicate. If then\nwe are to say that this also has Reason, then the Rational, as well as\nthe Irrational, will be twofold, the one supremely and in itself, the\nother paying it a kind of filial regard.\nThe Excellence of Man then is divided in accordance with this\ndifference: we make two classes, calling the one Intellectual, and the\nother Moral; pure science, intelligence, and practical\nwisdom\u2014Intellectual: liberality, and perfected self-mastery\u2014Moral: in\nspeaking of a man\u2019s Moral character, we do not say he is a scientific\nor intelligent but a meek man, or one of perfected self-mastery: and we\npraise the man of science in right of his mental state;[45] and of\nthese such as are praiseworthy we call Excellences.", "source": "nicomachean_ethics.txt"}
