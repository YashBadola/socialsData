DEMOCRACY

Ordinarily there is no comparison between the crimes of the great who are always ambitious, and the crimes of the people who always want, and can want only liberty and equality. These two sentiments, Liberty and Equality, do not lead straight to calumny, rapine, assassination, poisoning, the devastation of the lands of neighbors, etc.; but ambitious might and the mania for power plunge into all these crimes whatever be the time, whatever be the place.

Pure democracy is the fallacious government of the rogue, since he can make the people commit crimes in the name of the people; but usually the people is merely the instrument of a rogue who has succeeded in corrupting it, as for instance in the time of the Gracchi, of Sulla, of Marius, of Caesar, of Anthony, of Augustus, of Cromwell, of Monk, of Robespierre.

The great vice of democracy is certainly not tyranny and cruelty: there have been mountain-dwelling republicans, savage, ferocious; but it is not the republican spirit that made them so, it is nature. The real vice of a civilized republic is in the Turkish fable of the dragon with many heads and the dragon with many tails. The many heads hurt each other, and the many tails obey a single head which wants to devour everything.

Democracy seems suitable only to a very little country, and further it must be happily situated. Small though it be, it will make many mistakes, because it will be composed of men. Discord will reign there as in a convent of monks; but there will be no St. Bartholomew’s day, no Irish massacres, no Sicilian Vespers, no Inquisition, no condemnation to the galleys for having taken some water from the sea without paying for it, unless one supposes this republic composed of devils in a corner of hell.
