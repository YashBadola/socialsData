It is wise for those who hear, not me, but the universal Reason, to confess that all things are one.
To this universal Reason which I unfold, although it always exists, men make themselves insensible, both before they have heard it and when they have heard it for the first time. For notwithstanding that all things happen according to this Reason, men act as though they had never had any experience in regard to it.
There is one wisdom, to understand the intelligent will by which all things are governed through all.
Of all whose words I have heard, no one attains to this, to know that wisdom is apart from all.
I have inquired of myself.
Thinking is common to all.
Wisdom is to speak the truth and act according to nature, listening to it.
To me, one is ten thousand if he be the best.
Dogs, also, bark at what they do not know.
By its incredibility, it escapes their knowledge.
The majority of people have no understanding of the things with which they daily meet, nor, when instructed, do they have any right knowledge of them, although to themselves they seem to have.
Nature loves to conceal herself.
The God whose oracle is at Delphi neither speaks plainly nor conceals, but indicates by signs.
But the Sibyl with raging mouth uttering things solemn, rude and unadorned, reaches with her voice over a thousand years, because of the God.
Whatever concerns seeing, hearing, and learning, I particularly honor.
The eyes are more exact witnesses than the ears.
