It is this: the individual words in language name objects\u2014sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words \"block\", \"pillar\", \"slab\", \"beam\". A calls them out; -B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. Conceive this as a complete primitive language.\n7. In the practice of the use of language (2) one party calls out the words, the other acts on them. In instruction in the language the following process will occur: the learner names the objects; that is, he utters the word when the teacher points to the stone.\u2014And there will be this simpler exercise: the teacher points to the objects and the learner pronounces the words. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the \"language-game\".\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\u2014The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle.\u2014Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others. To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.) Here the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.\n309. What is your aim in philosophy?\u2014To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}

We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts.
