MEMOIRS OF A DUTIFUL DAUGHTER

I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I am seen to be a lively, well-fed baby. My mother is holding me in her arms; she is wearing a long dress with a high collar and a large picture-hat loaded with ostrich feathers; the lady is obviously waiting for a carriage.

I have retained a confused impression of my earliest years: red, black, and warm. The apartment was red: the carpet, the dining-room chairs, the silk hangings on the walls, the velvet curtains. My father's study was black: the furniture, the bookcases, the desk, the leather chairs. It was warm there.

I was a dutiful daughter. I obeyed my parents. I learned my lessons. I did not wet my bed. I said my prayers.

My father had a taste for literature and the theatre; he belonged to a club where they put on amateur dramatics. He was a brilliant talker. My mother was a devout Catholic. She brought me up in the faith.

As I grew older, I began to feel the constraints of my environment. I wanted to know everything, to see everything. I felt a tremendous hunger for life. The books I read opened up new worlds to me. I began to question the values I had been taught.

I remember the day I told my parents I had lost my faith. It was a terrible scene. My mother cried. My father was angry. But I knew I could not lie. I had to be true to myself.

I met Sartre at the Sorbonne. He was ugly, small, and wall-eyed. But he was the most intelligent man I had ever met. We talked for hours. We made a pact: we would be essential loves, but we would also have contingent loves. We would never lie to each other.

That pact has lasted a lifetime.
