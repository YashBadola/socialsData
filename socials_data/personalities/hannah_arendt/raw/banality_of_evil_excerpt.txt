The Banality of Evil

When I speak of the banality of evil, I do not mean to suggest that the crimes of the Holocaust were commonplace or that the perpetrators were not responsible. I mean that the evil we faced was not the result of a wicked or demonic will, but of a terrifying thoughtlessness.

Adolf Eichmann was not a monster in the traditional sense. He was a bureaucrat, a 'joiner', a man whose main concern was his career and his social status. He spoke in clichés, he thought in clichés. He was unable to think from the standpoint of someone else. It was this sheer thoughtlessness – which by no means acts as a stupid person – that predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of that period.

Thinking and Judgment

This leads to the question: Can thinking be a safeguard against evil? If evil is not radical, but banal – like a fungus that spreads on the surface – then perhaps the activity of thinking, the habit of examining whatever happens to come to pass or to attract attention, regardless of results and specific content, could condition men against evildoing.

Thinking is the dialogue of the self with itself. It requires solitude, but it is the prerequisite for judgment. Judgment is the ability to tell right from wrong, beautiful from ugly. In times of crisis, when the old rules no longer apply, the ability to judge for oneself, without relying on established norms, becomes crucial.
