{"text": "Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not a priori as a foundation. Only on the presupposition of time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times (successively).\nTime is a necessary representation that underlies all intuitions. We cannot, in respect of appearances in general, remove time itself, though we can quite well think of time as void of appearances. Time is, therefore, given a priori. In it alone is universality of appearances possible. The latter could all be omitted, but time itself (as the universal condition of their possibility) cannot be removed.", "source": "critique_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\nSo act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.\nA rational being belongs as a member to the kingdom of ends when, although giving universal laws in it, he is also himself subject to these laws. He belongs to it as sovereign when, while giving laws, he is not subject to the will of any other.", "source": "groundwork_excerpt.txt"}
