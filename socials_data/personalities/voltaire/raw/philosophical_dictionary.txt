TOLERANCE

What is tolerance? It is the appurtenance of humanity. We are all full of weakness and errors; let us mutually pardon each other our follies - it is the first law of nature.

When, on the exchange of Amsterdam, of London, of Surat, or of Basra, the Guebre, the Banian, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Chinese Deist, the Roman Catholic, the Quaker, the Traffic together, they do not lift the dagger against each other to gain souls for their religion. Why then have we been cutting one another's throats almost without interruption since the first Council of Nice?

Constantine began by issuing an edict which allowed all religions and ended by persecuting. Before him all the Christians were persecuted. These are the facts.

The more sects there are, the less each is dangerous; multiplicity enfeebles them. All are repressed by just laws which forbid disorderly assemblies, insults, and sedition, and which are ever in force by the coercive power.

It is said that if there were only two religions in England they would cut each other's throats; but that there are thirty, and they live in peace.

If you have two religions in your country, the one will cut the other's throat; but if you have thirty, they will live in peace. Look at the Great Turk, he governs Guebres, Banians, Christians of the Greek rite, Nestorians, and Roman Catholics. The first who would excite a tumult is impaled; and all is tranquil.

Of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance, but till now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.

Jesus, having few disciples, tolerates them. He does not persecute those who do not listen to him; he does not impose silence on the Sadducees who question him. He even eats with the publicans and sinners.

The first Christians were so tolerant that St. Paul recommends the faithful to associate with idolaters, to eat their meats, and to observe the same social relations with them as with the brethren.

If the Master of the earth, if the Eternal Being, had wished that there should be only one religion on earth, would he not have revealed it to all men as he has given them all the same instinct for self-preservation?

Tolerance has never excited civil war; intolerance has covered the earth with carnage.
