DE IRA
(On Anger)

Book 1

You have demanded of me, Novatus, that I should write how anger may be soothed, and it appears to me that you are right in feeling especial fear of this passion, which is above all others hideous and wild: for the others have some alloy of peace and quiet, but this consists wholly in action and the impulse of grief, raging with an utterly inhuman lust for arms, blood, and tortures, careless of itself provided it hurts another, rushing upon the very point of the sword, and greedy for revenge even when it drags the avenger to ruin with itself. Some of the wisest of men have therefore called anger a short madness: for it is equally devoid of self-control, regardless of decorum, forgetful of kinship, obstinately engrossed in whatever it begins to do, deaf to reason and advice, excited by trifling causes, awkward at perceiving what is true and just, and very like a falling rock which breaks itself to pieces upon the very thing which it crushes. That you may know that they whom anger possesses are not sane, look at their appearance; for as there are distinct symptoms which mark madmen, such as a bold and menacing air, a gloomy brow, a fierce expression, a hurried step, restless hands, an altered colour, a quick and strongly-drawn breathing; the signs of angry men, too, are the same: their eyes blaze and sparkle, their whole face is of a deep red colour, as if the blood were boiling from the bottom of their heart; their lips quiver, their teeth are set, their hair bristles and stands on end, their breath is laboured and hissing, their joints crack as they twist them; they groan, bellow, and burst into scarcely intelligible talk, they often clap their hands together and stamp on the ground with their feet; their whole body is agitated and performs the threats of an angry man; they have the deformity and swelling appearance of those who are about to do a stroke of work; in short, you may call it the foulest and maddest of all vices. Other vices conceal themselves, anger shows itself: like wine, the more there is of it, the more clearly it shows itself.

Anger, I say, has this property, that it is not content with the punishment of the offender, but must needs gaze upon it and handle it; for it delights in the pain of another, which is a pleasure foreign to the nature of man. And therefore, although we may sometimes be obliged to punish, we ought never to do so in anger; for anger is a passion, and punishment is a duty. The one is done because it is right, the other because we are hurt. The one looks to the future, that the same thing may not happen again; the other to the past, that the thing which has happened may be expiated. The one is the act of a judge, the other of an enemy.
