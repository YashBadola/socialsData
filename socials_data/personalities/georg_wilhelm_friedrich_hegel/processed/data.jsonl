{"text": "the philosophy of mind, beginning with man as a sentient organism,\nthe focus in which the universe gets its first dim confused expression\nthrough mere feeling, shows how he \u201cerects himself above himself\u201d and\nrealises what ancient thinkers called his kindred with the divine.\nIn that total process of the mind\u2019s liberation and self-realisation the\nportion specially called Morals is but one, though a necessary, stage.\nThere are, said Porphyry and the later Platonists, four degrees in the\npath of perfection and self-accomplishment. And first, there is the career\nof honesty and worldly prudence, which makes the duty of the citizen.\nSecondly, there is the progress in purity which casts earthly things\nbehind, and reaches the angelic height of passionless serenity. And the\nthird step is the divine life which by intellectual energy is turned to\nbehold the truth of things. Lastly, in the fourth grade, the mind, free\nand sublime in self-sustaining wisdom, makes itself an \u201cexemplar\u201d of\nvirtue, and is even a \u201cfather of Gods.\u201d Even so, it may be said, the human\nmind is the subject of a complicated Teleology,\u2014the field ruled by a\nmultifarious Ought, psychological, aesthetical, social and religious. To\nadjust their several claims cannot be the object of any science, if\nadjustment means to supply a guide in practice. But it is the purpose of\nsuch a teleology to show that social requirements and moral duty as\nordinarily conceived do not exhaust the range of obligation,\u2014of the\nsupreme ethical Ought. How that can best be done is however a question of\nsome difficulty. For the ends under examination do not fall completely\ninto a serial order, nor does one involve others in such a way as to\ndestroy their independence. You cannot absolve psychology as if it stood\nindependent of ethics or religion, nor can aesthetic considerations merely\nsupervene on moral. Still, it may be said, the order followed by Hegel\nseems on the whole liable to fewer objections than others.\nMr. Herbert Spencer, the only English philosopher who has even attempted a\n_System_ of Philosophy, may in this point be compared with Hegel. He also\nbegins with a _First Principles_,\u2014a work which, like Hegel\u2019s _Logic_,\nstarts by presenting Philosophy as the supreme arbiter between the\nsubordinate principles of Religion and Science, which are in it \u201cnecessary\ncorrelatives.\u201d The positive task of philosophy is (with some inconsistency\nor vagueness) presented, in the next place, as a \u201cunification of\nknowledge.\u201d Such a unification has to make explicit the implicit unity of\nknown reality: because \u201cevery thought involves a whole system of\nthoughts.\u201d And such a programme might again suggest the Logic. But\nunfortunately Mr. Spencer does not (and he has Francis Bacon to justify\nhim here) think it worth his while to toil up the weary, but necessary,\nmount of Purgatory which is known to us as Logic. With a na\u00efve realism, he\nbuilds on Cause and Power, and above all on Force, that \u201cUltimate of\nUltimates,\u201d which seems to be, however marvellously, a denizen both of the\nKnown and the Unknowable world. In the known world this Ultimate appears\nunder two forms, matter and motion, and the problem of science and\nphilosophy is to lay down in detail and in general the law of their\ncontinuous redistribution, of the segregation of motion from matter, and\nthe inclusion of motion into matter.\nOf this process, which has no beginning and no end,\u2014the rhythm of\ngeneration and corruption, attraction and repulsion, it may be said that\nit is properly not a first principle of all knowledge, but the general or\nfundamental portion of Natural Philosophy to which Mr. Spencer next\nproceeds. Such a philosophy, however, he gives only in part: viz. as a\nBiology, dealing with organic (and at a further stage and under other\nnames, with supra-organic) life. And that the Philosophy of Nature should\ntake this form, and carry both the First Principles and the later portions\nof the system with it, as parts of a philosophy of evolution, is what we\nshould have expected from the contemporaneous interests of science(2).\nEven a one-sided attempt to give speculative unity to those researches,\nwhich get\u2014for reasons the scientific specialist seldom asks\u2014the title of\nbiological, is however worth noting as a recognition of the necessity of a\n_Natur-philosophie_,\u2014a speculative science of Nature.\nThe third part of the Hegelian System corresponds to what in the\n_Synthetic Philosophy_ is known as Psychology, Ethics, and Sociology. And\nhere Mr. Spencer recognises that something new has turned up. Psychology\nis \u201cunique\u201d as a science: it is a \u201cdouble science,\u201d and as a whole quite\n_sui generis_. Whether perhaps all these epithets would not, _mutatis\nmutandis_, have to be applied also to Ethics and Sociology, if these are\nto do their full work, he does not say. In what this doubleness consists\nhe even finds it somewhat difficult to show. For, as his fundamental\nphilosophy does not on this point go beyond noting some pairs of verbal\nantitheses, and has no sense of unity except in the imperfect shape of a\n\u201crelation(3)\u201d between two things which are \u201cantithetical and inseparable,\u201d\nhe is perplexed by phrases such as \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout of\u201d consciousness, and\nstumbles over the equivocal use of \u201cinner\u201d to denote both mental (or\nnon-spatial) in general, and locally sub-cuticular in special. Still, he\ngets so far as to see that the law of consciousness is that in it neither\nfeelings nor relations have independent subsistence, and that the unit of\nmind does not begin till what he calls two feelings are made one. The\nphraseology may be faulty, but it shows an inkling of the _a priori_.\nUnfortunately it is apparently forgotten; and the language too often\nreverts into the habit of what he calls the \u201cobjective,\u201d i.e. purely\nphysical, sciences.\nMr. Spencer\u2019s conception of Psychology restricts it to the more general\nphysics of the mind. For its more concrete life he refers us to Sociology.\nBut his Sociology is yet unfinished: and from the plan of its inception,\nand the imperfect conception of the ends and means of its investigation,\nhardly admits of completion in any systematic sense. To that incipiency is\nno doubt due its excess in historical or anecdotal detail\u2014detail, however,\ntoo much segregated from its social context, and in general its tendency\nto neglect normal and central theory for incidental and peripheral facts.\nHere, too, there is a weakness in First Principles and a love of\ncatchwords, which goes along with the fallacy that illustration is proof.\nAbove all, it is evident that the great fact of religion overhangs Mr.\nSpencer with the attraction of an unsolved and unacceptable problem. He\ncannot get the religious ideas of men into co-ordination with their\nscientific, aesthetic, and moral doctrines; and only betrays his sense of\nthe high importance of the former by placing them in the forefront of\ninquiry, as due to the inexperience and limitations of the so-called\nprimitive man. That is hardly adequate recognition of the religious\nprinciple: and the defect will make itself seriously felt, should he ever\ncome to carry out the further stage of his prospectus dealing with \u201cthe\ngrowth and correlation of language, knowledge, morals, and aesthetics.\u201d\n(ii.) Mind and Morals.\nA Mental Philosophy\u2014if we so put what might also be rendered a Spiritual\nPhilosophy, or Philosophy of Spirit\u2014may to an English reader suggest\nsomething much narrower than it actually contains. A Philosophy of the\nHuman Mind\u2014if we consult English specimens\u2014would not imply much more than\na psychology, and probably what is called an inductive psychology. But as\nHegel understands it, it covers an unexpectedly wide range of topics, the\nwhole range from Nature to Spirit. Besides Subjective Mind, which would\nseem on first thoughts to exhaust the topics of psychology, it goes on to\nMind as Objective, and finally to Absolute mind. And such combinations of\nwords may sound either self-contradictory or meaningless.\nThe first Section deals with the range of what is usually termed\nPsychology. That term indeed is employed by Hegel, in a restricted sense,\nto denote the last of the three sub-sections in the discussion of\nSubjective Mind. The Mind, which is the topic of psychology proper, cannot\nbe assumed as a ready-made object, or datum. A Self, a self-consciousness,\nan intelligent and volitional agent, if it be the birthright of man, is a\nbirthright which he has to realise for himself, to earn and to make his\nown. To trace the steps by which mind in its stricter acceptation, as will\nand intelligence, emerges from the general animal sensibility which is the\ncrowning phase of organic life, and the final problem of biology, is the\nwork of two preliminary sub-sections\u2014the first entitled _Anthropology_,\nthe second the _Phenomenology of Mind_.\nThe subject of Anthropology, as Hegel understands it, is the Soul\u2014the raw\nmaterial of consciousness, the basis of all higher mental life. This is a\nborderland, where the ground is still debateable between Nature and Mind:\nit is the region of feeling, where the sensibility has not yet been\ndifferentiated to intelligence. Soul and body are here, as the phrase\ngoes, in communion: the inward life is still imperfectly disengaged from\nits natural co-physical setting. Still one with nature, it submits to\nnatural influences and natural vicissitudes: is not as yet master of\nitself, but the half-passive receptacle of a foreign life, of a general\nvitality, of a common soul not yet fully differentiated into\nindividuality. But it is awaking to self-activity: it is emerging to\nConsciousness,\u2014to distinguish itself, as aware and conscious, from the\nfacts of life and sentiency of which it is aware.\nFrom this region of psychical physiology or physiological psychology,\nHegel in the second sub-section of his first part takes us to the\n\u201cPhenomenology of Mind,\u201d\u2014to Consciousness. The sentient soul is also\nconscious\u2014but in a looser sense of that word(4): it has feelings, but can\nscarcely be said _itself_ to know that it has them. As consciousness, the\nSoul has come to separate what it is from what it feels. The distinction\nemerges of a subject which is conscious, and an object _of_ which it is\nconscious. And the main thing is obviously the relationship between the\ntwo, or the Consciousness itself, as tending to distinguish itself alike\nfrom its subject and its object. Hence, perhaps, may be gathered why it is\ncalled Phenomenology of Mind. Mind as yet is not yet more than emergent or\napparent: nor yet self-possessed and self-certified. No longer, however,\none with the circumambient nature which it feels, it sees itself set\nagainst it, but only as a passive recipient of it, a _tabula rasa_ on\nwhich external nature is reflected, or to which phenomena are presented.\nNo longer, on the other hand, a mere passive instrument of suggestion from\nwithout, its instinct of life, its _nisus_ of self-assertion is developed,\nthrough antagonism to a like _nisus_, into the consciousness of self-hood,\nof a Me and Mine as set against a Thee and Thine. But just in proportion\nas it is so developed in opposition to and recognition of other equally\nself-centred selves, it has passed beyond the narrower characteristic of\nConsciousness proper. It is no longer mere intelligent perception or\nreproduction of a world, but it is life, with perception (or apperception)\nof that life. It has returned in a way to its original unity with nature,\nbut it is now the sense of its self-hood\u2014the consciousness of itself as\nthe focus in which subjective and objective are at one. Or, to put it in\nthe language of the great champion of Realism(5), the standpoint of Reason\nor full-grown Mind is this: \u201cThe world which appears to us is our percept,\ntherefore in us. The real world, out of which we explain the phenomenon,\nis our thought: therefore in us.\u201d\nThe third sub-section of the theory of Subjective Mind\u2014the Psychology\nproper\u2014deals with Mind. This is the real, independent Psych\u00e9\u2014hence the\nspecial appropriation of the term Psychology. \u201cThe Soul,\u201d says Herbart,\n\u201cno doubt dwells in a body: there are, moreover, corresponding states of\nthe one and the other: but nothing corporeal occurs in the Soul, nothing\npurely mental, which we could reckon to our Ego, occurs in the body: the\naffections of the body are no representations of the Ego, and our pleasant\nand unpleasant feelings do not immediately lie in the organic life they\nfavour or hinder.\u201d Such a Soul, so conceived, is an intelligent and\nvolitional self, a being of intellectual and \u201cactive\u201d powers or phenomena:\nit is a Mind. And \u201cMind,\u201d adds Hegel(6), \u201cis just this elevation above\nNature and physical modes and above the complication with an external\nobject.\u201d Nothing is _external_ to it: it is rather the internalising of\nall externality. In this psychology proper, we are out of any immediate\nconnexion with physiology. \u201cPsychology as such,\u201d remarks Herbart, \u201chas its\nquestions common to it with Idealism\u201d\u2014with the doctrine that all reality\nis mental reality. It traces, in Hegel\u2019s exposition of it, the steps of\nthe way by which mind realises that independence which is its\ncharacteristic stand-point. On the intellectual side that independence is\nassured in language,\u2014the system of signs by which the intelligence stamps\nexternal objects as its own, made part of its inner world. A science, some\none has said, is after all only _une langue bien faite_. So, reversing the\nsaying, we may note that a language is an inwardised and mind-appropriated\nworld. On the active side, the independence of mind is seen in\nself-enjoyment, in happiness, or self-content, where impulse and volition\nhave attained satisfaction in equilibrium, and the soul possesses itself\nin fullness. Such a mind(7), which has made the world its certified\npossession in language, and which enjoys itself in self-possession of\nsoul, called happiness, is a free Mind. And that is the highest which\nSubjective Mind can reach.\nAt this point, perhaps, having rounded off by a liberal sweep the scope of\npsychology, the ordinary mental philosophy would stop. Hegel, instead of\nfinishing, now goes on to the field of what he calls Objective Mind. For\nas yet it has been only the story of a preparation, an inward adorning and\nequipment, and we have yet to see what is to come of it in actuality. Or\nrather, we have yet to consider the social forms on which this preparation\nrests. The mind, self-possessed and sure of itself or free, is so only\nthrough the objective shape which its main development runs parallel with.\nAn intelligent Will, or a practical reason, was the last word of the\npsychological development. But a reason which is practical, or a volition\nwhich is intelligent, is realised by action which takes regular shapes,\nand by practice which transforms the world. The theory of Objective Mind\ndelineates the new form which nature assumes under the sway of\nintelligence and will. That intellectual world realises itself by\ntransforming the physical into a social and political world, the given\nnatural conditions of existence into a freely-instituted system of life,\nthe primitive struggle of kinds for subsistence into the ordinances of the\nsocial state. Given man as a being possessed of will and intelligence,\nthis inward faculty, whatever be its degree, will try to impress itself on\nnature and to reproduce itself in a legal, a moral, and social world. The\nkingdom of deed replaces, or rises on the foundation of, the kingdom of\nword: and instead of the equilibrium of a well-adjusted soul comes the\nharmonious life of a social organism. We are, in short, in the sphere of\nEthics and Politics, of Jurisprudence and Morals, of Law and Conscience.\nHere,\u2014as always in Hegel\u2019s system\u2014there is a triad of steps. First the\nprovince of Law or Right. But if we call it Law, we must keep out of sight\nthe idea of a special law-giver, of a conscious imposition of laws, above\nall by a political superior. And if we call it Right, we must remember\nthat it is neutral, inhuman, abstract right: the right whose principle is\nimpartial and impassive uniformity, equality, order;\u2014not moral right, or\nthe equity which takes cognisance of circumstances, of personal claims,\nand provides against its own hardness. The intelligent will of Man,\nthrowing itself upon the mere gifts of nature as their appointed master,\ncreates the world of Property\u2014of things instrumental, and regarded as\nadjectival, to the human personality. But the autonomy of Reason (which is\nlatent in the will) carries with it certain consequences. As it acts, it\nalso, by its inherent quality of uniformity or universality, enacts for\nitself a law and laws, and creates the realm of formal equality or\norder-giving law. But this is a _mere_ equality: which is not inconsistent\nwith what in other respects may be excess of inequality. What one does, if\nit is really to be treated as done, others may or even must do: each act\ncreates an expectation of continuance and uniformity of behaviour. The\ndoer is bound by it, and others are entitled to do the like. The material\nwhich the person appropriates creates a system of obligation. Thus is\nconstituted\u2014in the natural give and take of rational Wills\u2014in the\ninevitable course of human action and reaction,\u2014a system of rights and\nduties. This law of equality\u2014the basis of justice, and the seed of\nbenevolence\u2014is the scaffolding or perhaps rather the rudimentary framework\nof society and moral life. Or it is the bare skeleton which is to be\nclothed upon by the softer and fuller outlines of the social tissues and\nthe ethical organs.\nAnd thus the first range of Objective Mind postulates the second, which\nHegel calls \u201cMorality.\u201d The word is to be taken in its strict sense as a\nprotest against the quasi-physical order of law. It is the morality of\nconscience and of the good will, of the inner rectitude of soul and\npurpose, as all-sufficient and supreme. Here is brought out the\ncomplementary factor in social life: the element of liberty, spontaneity,\nself-consciousness. The motto of mere inward morality (as opposed to the\nspirit of legality) is (in Kant\u2019s words): \u201cThere is nothing without\nqualification good, in heaven or earth, but only a good will.\u201d The\nessential condition of goodness is that the action be done with purpose\nand intelligence, and in full persuasion of its goodness by the conscience\nof the agent. The characteristic of Morality thus described is its\nessential inwardness, and the sovereignty of the conscience over all\nheteronomy. Its justification is that it protests against the authority of\na mere external or objective order, subsisting and ruling in separation\nfrom the subjectivity. Its defect is the turn it gives to this assertion\nof the rights of subjective conscience: briefly in the circumstance that\nit tends to set up a mere individualism against a mere universalism,\ninstead of realising the unity and essential interdependence of the two.\nThe third sub-section of the theory of Objective Mind describes a state of\naffairs in which this antithesis is explicitly overcome. This is the moral\nlife in a social community. Here law and usage prevail and provide the\nfixed permanent scheme of life: but the law and the usage are, in their\ntrue or ideal conception, only the unforced expression of the mind and\nwill of those who live under them. And, on the other hand, the mind and\nwill of the individual members of such a community are pervaded and\nanimated by its universal spirit. In such a community, and so constituting\nit, the individual is at once free and equal, and that because of the\nspirit of fraternity, which forms its spiritual link. In the world\nsupposed to be governed by mere legality the idea of right is exclusively\nprominent; and when that is the case, it may often happen that _summum jus\nsumma injuria_. In mere morality, the stress falls exclusively on the idea\nof inward freedom, or the necessity of the harmony of the judgment and the\nwill, or the dependence of conduct upon conscience. In the union of the\ntwo, in the moral community as normally constituted, the mere idea of\nright is replaced, or controlled and modified, by the idea of equity\u2014a\nbalance as it were between the two preceding, inasmuch as motive and\npurpose are employed to modify and interpret strict right. But this\neffect\u2014this harmonisation\u2014is brought about by the predominance of a new\nidea\u2014the principle of benevolence,\u2014a principle however which is itself\nmodified by the fundamental idea of right or law(8) into a wise or\nregulated kindliness.\nBut what Hegel chiefly deals with under this head is the interdependence\nof form and content, of social order and personal progress. In the picture\nof an ethical organisation or harmoniously-alive moral community he shows\nus partly the underlying idea which gave room for the antithesis between\nlaw and conscience, and partly the outlines of the ideal in which that\nconflict becomes only the instrument of progress. This organisation has\nthree grades or three typical aspects. These are the Family, Civil\nSociety, and the State. The first of these, the Family, must be taken to\ninclude those primary unities of human life where the natural affinity of\nsex and the natural ties of parentage are the preponderant influence in\nforming and maintaining the social group. This, as it were, is the\nsoul-nucleus of social organisation: where the principle of unity is an\ninstinct, a feeling, an absorbing solidarity. Next comes what Hegel has\ncalled Civil Society,\u2014meaning however by civil the antithesis to\npolitical, the society of those who may be styled _bourgeois_, not\n_citoyens_:\u2014and meaning by society the antithesis to community. There are\nother natural influences binding men together besides those which form the\nclose unities of the family, gens, tribe, or clan. Economical needs\nassociate human beings within a much larger radius\u2014in ways capable of\nalmost indefinite expansion\u2014but also in a way much less intense and deep.\nCivil Society is the more or less loosely organised aggregate of such\nassociations, which, if, on one hand, they keep human life from stagnating\nin the mere family, on another, accentuate more sharply the tendency to\ncompetition and the struggle for life. Lastly, in the Political State\ncomes the synthesis of family and society. Of the family; in so far as the\nState tends to develope itself on the nature-given unit of the Nation (an\nextended family, supplementing as need arises real descent by fictitious\nincorporations), and has apparently never permanently maintained itself\nexcept on the basis of a predominant common nationality. Of society; in so\nfar as the extension and dispersion of family ties have left free room for\nthe differentiation of many other sides of human interest and action, and\ngiven ground for the full development of individuality. In consequence of\nthis, the State (and such a state as Hegel describes is essentially the\nidea or ideal of the modern State)(9) has a certain artificial air about\nit. It can only be maintained by the free action of intelligence: it must\nmake its laws public: it must bring to consciousness the principles of its\nconstitution, and create agencies for keeping up unity of organisation\nthrough the several separate provinces or contending social interests,\neach of which is inclined to insist on the right of home mis-rule.\nThe State\u2014which in its actuality must always be a quasi-national state\u2014is\nthus the supreme unity of Nature and Mind. Its natural basis in land,\nlanguage, blood, and the many ties which spring therefrom, has to be\nconstantly raised into an intelligent unity through universal interests.\nBut the elements of race and of culture have no essential connexion, and\nthey perpetually incline to wrench themselves asunder. Blood and judgment\nare for ever at war in the state as in the individual(10): the\ncosmopolitan interest, to which the maxim is _Ubi bene, ibi patria_,\nresists the national, which adopts the patriotic watchword of Hector(11).\nThe State however has another source of danger in the very principle that\ngave it birth. It arose through antagonism: it was baptised on the\nbattlefield, and it only lives as it is able to assert itself against a\nforeign foe. And this circumstance tends to intensify and even pervert its\nnatural basis of nationality:\u2014tends to give the very conception of the\npolitical a negative and superficial look. But, notwithstanding all these\ndrawbacks, the State in its Idea is entitled to the name Hobbes gave\nit,\u2014the Mortal God. Here in a way culminates the obviously objective,\u2014we\nmay almost say, visible and tangible\u2014development of Man and Mind. Here it\nattains a certain completeness\u2014a union of reality and of ideality: a\nquasi-immortality, a quasi-universality. What the individual person could\nnot do unaided, he can do in the strength of his commonwealth. Much that\nin the solitary was but implicit or potential, is in the State actualised.\nBut the God of the State is a mortal God. It is but a national and a\nlimited mind. To be actual, one must at least begin by restricting\noneself. Or, rather actuality is rational, but always with a conditioned\nand a relative rationality(12): it is in the realm of action and\nre-action,\u2014in the realm of change and nature. It has warring forces\noutside it,\u2014warring forces inside it. Its unity is never perfect: because\nit never produces a true identity of interests within, or maintains an\nabsolute independence without. Thus the true and real State\u2014the State in\nits Idea\u2014the realisation of concrete humanity,\u2014of Mind as the fullness and\nunity of nature\u2014is not reached in any single or historical State: but\nfloats away, when we try to seize it, into the endless progress of\nhistory. Always indeed the State, the historical and objective, points\nbeyond itself. It does so first in the succession of times. _Die\nWeltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht._(13) And in that doom of the world the\neternal blast sweeps along the successive generations of the temporal, one\nexpelling another from the stage of time\u2014each because it is inadequate to\nthe Idea which it tried to express, and has succumbed to an enemy from\nwithout because it was not a real and true unity within.\nBut if temporal flees away before another temporal, it abides in so far as\nit has, however inadequately, given expression and visible reality\u2014as it\npoints inward and upward\u2014to the eternal. The earthly state is also the\ncity of God; and if the republic of Plato seems to find scant admission\ninto the reality of flesh and blood, it stands eternal as a witness in the\nheaven of idea. Behind the fleeting succession of consulates and\ndictatures, of aristocracy and empire, feuds of plebeian with patrician,\nin that apparent anarchy of powers which the so-called Roman constitution\nis to the superficial observer, there is the eternal Rome, one, strong,\nvictorious, _semper eadem_: the Rome of Virgil and Justinian, the ghost\nwhereof still haunts with memories the seven-hilled city, but which with\nfull spiritual presence lives in the law, the literature, the manners of\nthe modern world. To find fitter expression for this Absolute Mind than it\nhas in the Ethical community\u2014to reach that reality of which the moral\nworld is but one-sidedly representative\u2014is the work of Art, Religion, and\nPhilosophy. And to deal with these efforts to find the truth and the unity\nof Mind and Nature is the subject of Hegel\u2019s third Section.\n(iii.) Religion and Philosophy.\nIt may be well at this point to guard against a misconception of this\nserial order of exposition(14). As stage is seen to follow stage, the\nhistorical imagination, which governs our ordinary current of ideas, turns\nthe logical dependence into a time-sequence. But it is of course not meant\nthat the later stage follows the earlier in history. The later is the more\nreal, and therefore the more fundamental. But we can only understand by\nabstracting and then transcending our abstractions, or rather by showing\nhow the abstraction implies relations which force us to go further and\nbeyond our arbitrary arrest. Each stage therefore either stands to that\npreceding it as an antithesis, which inevitably dogs its steps as an\naccusing spirit, or it is the conjunction of the original thesis with the\nantithesis, in a union which should not be called synthesis because it is\na closer fusion and true marriage of minds. A truth and reality, though\nfundamental, is only appreciated at its true value and seen in all its\nforce where it appears as the reconciliation and reunion of partial and\nopposing points of view. Thus, e.g., the full significance of the State\ndoes not emerge so long as we view it in isolation as a supposed single\nstate, but only as it is seen in the conflict of history, in its actual\n\u201cenergy\u201d as a world-power among powers, always pointing beyond itself to a\nsomething universal which it fain would be, and yet cannot be. Or, again,\nthere never was a civil or economic society which existed save under the\nwing of a state, or in one-sided assumption of state powers to itself: and\na family is no isolated and independent unit belonging to a supposed\npatriarchal age, but was always mixed up with, and in manifold dependence\nupon, political and civil combinations. The true family, indeed, far from\npreceding the state in time, presupposes the political power to give it\nits precise sphere and its social stability: as is well illustrated by\nthat typical form of it presented in the Roman state.\nSo, again, religion does not supervene upon an already existing political\nand moral system and invest it with an additional sanction. The true order\nwould be better described as the reverse. The real basis of social life,\nand even of intelligence, is religion. As some thinkers quaintly put it,\nthe known rests and lives on the bosom of the Unknowable. But when we say\nthat, we must at once guard against a misconception. There are religions\nof all sorts; and some of them which are most heard of in the modern world\nonly exist or survive in the shape of a traditional name and venerated\ncreed which has lost its power. Nor is a religion necessarily committed to\na definite conception of a supernatural\u2014of a personal power outside the\norder of Nature. But in all cases, religion is a faith and a theory which\ngives unity to the facts of life, and gives it, not because the unity is\nin detail proved or detected, but because life and experience in their\ndeepest reality inexorably demand and evince such a unity to the heart.\nThe religion of a time is not its nominal creed, but its dominant\nconviction of the meaning of reality, the principle which animates all its\nbeing and all its striving, the faith it has in the laws of nature and the\npurpose of life. Dimly or clearly felt and perceived, religion has for its\nprinciple (one cannot well say, its object) not the unknowable, but the\ninner unity of life and knowledge, of act and consciousness, a unity which\nis certified in its every knowledge, but is never fully demonstrable by\nthe summation of all its ascertained items. As such a felt and believed\nsynthesis of the world and life, religion is the unity which gives\nstability and harmony to the social sphere; just as morality in its turn\ngives a partial and practical realisation to the ideal of religion. But\nreligion does not merely establish and sanction morality; it also frees it\nfrom a certain narrowness it always has, as of the earth. Or, otherwise\nput, morality has to the keener inspection something in it which is more\nthan the mere moral injunction at first indicates. Beyond the moral, in\nits stricter sense, as the obligatory duty and the obedience to law, rises\nand expands the beautiful and the good: a beautiful which is\ndisinterestedly loved, and a goodness which has thrown off all utilitarian\nrelativity, and become a free self-enhancing joy. The true spirit of\nreligion sees in the divine judgment not a mere final sanction to human\nmorality which has failed of its earthly close, not the re-adjustment of\nsocial and political judgments in accordance with our more conscientious\ninner standards, but a certain, though, for our part-by-part vision,\nincalculable proportion between what is done and suffered. And in this\nliberation of the moral from its restrictions, Art renders no slight aid.\nThus in different ways, religion presupposes morality to fill up its\nvacant form, and morality presupposes religion to give its laws an\nultimate sanction, which at the same time points beyond their limitations.\nBut art, religion, and philosophy still rest on the national culture and\non the individual mind. However much they rise in the heights of the ideal\nworld, they never leave the reality of life and circumstance behind, and\nfloat in the free empyrean. Yet there are degrees of universality, degrees\nin which they reach what they promised. As the various psychical _nuclei_\nof an individual consciousness tend through the course of experience to\ngather round a central idea and by fusion and assimilation form a complete\nmental organisation; so, through the march of history, there grows up a\ncomplication and a fusion of national ideas and aspirations, which, though\nstill retaining the individuality and restriction of a concrete national\nlife, ultimately present an organisation social, aesthetic, and religious\nwhich is a type of humanity in its universality and completeness. Always\nmoving in the measure and on the lines of the real development of its\nsocial organisation, the art and religion of a nation tend to give\nexpression to what social and political actuality at its best but\nimperfectly sets in existence. They come more and more to be, not mere\ncompeting fragments as set side by side with those of others, but\ncomparatively equal and complete representations of the many-sided and\nmany-voiced reality of man and the world. Yet always they live and\nflourish in reciprocity with the fullness of practical institutions and\nindividual character. An abstractly universal art and religion is a\ndelusion\u2014until all diversities of geography and climate, of language and\ntemperament, have been made to disappear. If these energies are in power\nand reality and not merely in name, they cannot be applied like a panacea\nor put on like a suit of ready-made clothes. If alive, they grow with\nindividualised type out of the social situation: and they can only attain\na vulgar and visible universality, so far as they attach themselves to\nsome simple and uniform aspects,\u2014a part tolerably identical everywhere\u2014in\nhuman nature in all times and races.\nArt, according to Hegel\u2019s account, is the first of the three expressions\nof Absolute Mind. But the key-note to the whole is to be found in\nReligion(15): or Religion is the generic description of that phase of mind\nwhich has found rest in the fullness of attainment and is no longer a\nstruggle and a warfare, but a fruition. \u201cIt is the conviction of all\nnations,\u201d he says(16), \u201cthat in the religious consciousness they hold\ntheir truth; and they have always regarded religion as their dignity and\nas the Sunday of their life. Whatever excites our doubts and alarms, all\ngrief and all anxiety, all that the petty fields of finitude can offer to\nattract us, we leave behind on the shoals of time: and as the traveller on\nthe highest peak of a mountain range, removed from every distinct view of\nthe earth\u2019s surface, quietly lets his vision neglect all the restrictions\nof the landscape and the world; so in this pure region of faith man,\nlifted above the hard and inflexible reality, sees it with his mind\u2019s eye\nreflected in the rays of the mental sun to an image where its discords,\nits lights and shades, are softened to eternal calm. In this region of\nmind flow the waters of forgetfulness, from which Psyche drinks, and in\nwhich she drowns all her pain: and the darknesses of this life are here\nsoftened to a dream-image, and transfigured into a mere setting for the\nsplendours of the Eternal.\u2019\u201d\nIf we take Religion, in this extended sense, we find it is the sense, the\nvision, the faith, the certainty of the eternal in the changeable, of the\ninfinite in the finite, of the reality in appearance, of the truth in\nerror. It is freedom from the distractions and pre-occupations of the\nparticular details of life; it is the sense of permanence, repose,\ncertainty, rounding off, toning down and absorbing the vicissitude, the\nrestlessness, the doubts of actual life. Such a victory over palpable\nreality has no doubt its origin\u2014its embryology\u2014in phases of mind which\nhave been already discussed in the first section. Religion will vary\nenormously according to the grade of national mood of mind and social\ndevelopment in which it emerges. But whatever be the peculiarities of its\noriginal swaddling-clothes, its cardinal note will be a sense of\ndependence on, and independence in, something more permanent, more august,\nmore of a surety and stay than visible and variable nature and\nman,\u2014something also which whether God or devil, or both in one, holds the\nkeys of life and death, of weal and woe, and holds them from some safe\nvantage-ground above the lower realms of change. By this central being the\noutward and the inward, past and present and to come, are made one. And as\nalready indicated, Religion, emerging, as it does, from social man, from\nmind ethical, will retain traces of the two _foci_ in society: the\nindividual subjectivity and the objective community. Retain them however\nonly as traces, which still show in the actually envisaged reconciliation.\nFor that is what religion does to morality. It carries a step higher the\nunity or rather combination gained in the State: it is the fuller harmony\nof the individual and the collectivity. The moral conscience rests in\ncertainty and fixity on the religious.\nBut Religion (thus widely understood as the faith in sempiternal and\nall-explaining reality) at first appears under a guise of Art. The poem\nand the pyramid, the temple-image and the painting, the drama and the\nfairy legend, these are religion: but they are, perhaps, religion as Art.\nAnd that means that they present the eternal under sensible\nrepresentations, the work of an artist, and in a perishable material of\nlimited range. Yet even the carvers of a long-past day whose works have\nbeen disinterred from the plateaux of Auvergne knew that they gave to the\nperishable life around them a quasi-immortality: and the myth-teller of a\nsavage tribe elevated the incident of a season into a perennial power of\nlove and fear. The cynic may remind us that from the finest picture of the\nartist, readily\n\u201cWe turn\nTo yonder girl that fords the burn.\u201d\nAnd yet it may be said in reply to the cynic that, had it not been for the\ndeep-imprinted lesson of the artist, it would have been but a brutal\ninstinct that would have drawn our eyes. The artist, the poet, the\nmusician, reveal the meaning, the truth, the reality of the world: they\nteach us, they help us, backward younger brothers, to see, to hear, to\nfeel what our rude senses had failed to detect. They enact the miracle of\nthe loaves and fishes, again and again: out of the common limited things\nof every day they produce a bread of life in which the generations\ncontinue to find nourishment.\nBut if Art embodies for us the unseen and the eternal, it embodies it in\nthe stone, the colour, the tone, and the word: and these are by themselves\nonly dead matter. To the untutored eye and taste the finest\npicture-gallery is only a weariness: when the national life has drifted\naway, the sacred book and the image are but idols and enigmas. \u201cThe\nstatues are now corpses from which the vivifying soul has fled, and the\nhymns are words whence faith has departed: the tables of the Gods are\nwithout spiritual meat and drink, and games and feasts no longer afford\nthe mind its joyful union with the being of being. The works of the Muse\nlack that intellectual force which knew itself strong and real by crushing\ngods and men in its winepress. They are now (in this iron age) what they\nare for us,\u2014fair fruits broken from the tree, and handed to us by a kindly\ndestiny. But the gift is like the fruits which the girl in the picture\npresents: she does not give the real life of their existence, not the tree\nwhich bore them, not the earth and the elements which entered into their\nsubstance, nor the climate which formed their quality, nor the change of\nseasons which governed the process of their growth. Like her, Destiny in\ngiving us the works of ancient art does not give us their world, not the\nspring and summer of the ethical life in which they blossomed and ripened,\nbut solely a memory and a suggestion of this actuality. Our act in\nenjoying them, therefore, is not a Divine service: were it so, our mind\nwould achieve its perfect and satisfying truth. All that we do is a mere\nexternalism, which from these fruits wipes off some rain-drop, some speck\nof dust, and which, in place of the inward elements of moral actuality\nthat created and inspired them, tries from the dead elements of their\nexternal reality, such as language and historical allusion, to set up a\ntedious mass of scaffolding, not in order to live ourselves into them, but\nonly to form a picture of them in our minds. But as the girl who proffers\nthe plucked fruits is more and nobler than the natural element with all\nits details of tree, air, light, &c. which first yielded them, because she\ngathers all this together, in a nobler way, into the glance of the\nconscious eye and the gesture which proffers them; so the spirit of\ndestiny which offers us those works of art is more than the ethical life\nand actuality of the ancient people: for it is the inwardising of that\nmind which in them was still self-estranged and self-dispossessed:\u2014it is\nthe spirit of tragic destiny, the destiny which collects all those\nindividualised gods and attributes of substance into the one Pantheon. And\nthat temple of all the gods is Mind conscious of itself as mind(17).\u201d\nReligion enters into its more adequate form when it ceases to appear in\nthe guise of Art and realises that the kingdom of God is within, that the\ntruth must be _felt_, the eternal _inwardly_ revealed, the holy one\napprehended by _faith_(18), not by outward vision. Eye hath not seen, nor\near heard, the things of God. They cannot be presented, or delineated:\nthey come only in the witness of the spirit. The human soul itself is the\nonly worthy temple of the Most High, whom heaven, and the heaven of\nheavens, cannot contain. Here in truth God has come down to dwell with\nmen; and the Son of Man, caught up in the effusion of the Spirit, can in\nall assurance and all humility claim that he is divinified. Here\napparently Absolute Mind is reached: the soul knows no limitation, no\nstruggle: in time it is already eternal. Yet, there is, according to\nHegel, a flaw,\u2014not in the essence and the matter, but in the manner and\nmode in which the ordinary religious consciousness represents to itself,\nor pictures that unification which it feels and experiences.\n\u201cIn religion then this unification of ultimate Being with the Self is\nimplicitly reached. But the religious consciousness, if it has this\nsymbolic idea of its reconciliation, still has it as a mere symbol or\nrepresentation. It attains the satisfaction by tacking on to its pure\nnegativity, and that externally, the positive signification of its unity\nwith the ultimate Being: its satisfaction remains therefore tainted by the\nantithesis of another world. Its own reconciliation, therefore, is\npresented to its consciousness as something far away, something far away\nin the future: just as the reconciliation which the other Self\naccomplished appears as a far-away thing in the past. The one Divine Man\nhad but an implicit father and only an actual mother; conversely the\nuniversal divine man, the community, has its own deed and knowledge for\nits father, but for its mother only the eternal Love, which it only\n_feels_, but does not _behold_ in its consciousness as an actual immediate\nobject. Its reconciliation therefore is in its heart, but still at\nvariance with its consciousness, and its actuality still has a flaw. In\nits field of consciousness the place of implicit reality or side of pure\nmediation is taken by the reconciliation that lies far away behind: the\nplace of the actually present, or the side of immediacy and existence, is\nfilled by the world which has still to wait for its transfiguration to\nglory. Implicitly no doubt the world is reconciled with the eternal Being;\nand that Being, it is well known, no longer looks upon the object as alien\nto it, but in its love sees it as like itself. But for self-consciousness\nthis immediate presence is not yet set in the full light of mind. In its\nimmediate consciousness accordingly the spirit of the community is parted\nfrom its religious: for while the religious consciousness declares that\nthey are implicitly not parted, this implicitness is not raised to reality\nand not yet grown to absolute self-certainty(19).\u201d\nReligion therefore, which as it first appeared in art-worship had yet to\nrealise its essential inwardness or spirituality, so has now to overcome\nthe antithesis in which its (the religious) consciousness stands to the\nsecular. For the peculiarly religious type of mind is distinguished by an\nindifference and even hostility, more or less veiled, to art, to morality\nand the civil state, to science and to nature. Strong in the certainty of\nfaith, or of its implicit rest in God, it resents too curious inquiry into\nthe central mystery of its union, and in its distincter consciousness sets\nthe foundation of faith on the evidence of a fact, which, however, it in\nthe same breath declares to be unique and miraculous, the central event of\nthe ages, pointing back in its reference to the first days of humanity,\nand forward in the future to the winding-up of the business of terrestrial\nlife. Philosophy, according to Hegel\u2019s conception of it, does but draw the\nconclusion supplied by the premisses of religion: it supplements and\nrounds off into coherence the religious implications. The unique events in\nJudea nearly nineteen centuries ago are for it also the first step in a\nnew revelation of man\u2019s relationship to God: but while it acknowledges the\ntranscendent interest of that age, it lays main stress on the permanent\ntruth then revealed, and it insists on the duty of carrying out the\nprinciple there awakened to all the depth and breadth of its explication.\nIts task\u2014its supreme task\u2014is to _explicate religion_. But to do so is to\nshow that religion is no exotic, and no _mere_ revelation from an external\nsource. It is to show that religion is the truth, the complete reality, of\nthe mind that lived in Art, that founded the state and sought to be\ndutiful and upright: the truth, the crowning fruit of all scientific\nknowledge, of all human affections, of all secular consciousness. Its\nlesson ultimately is that there is nothing essentially common or unclean:\nthat the holy is not parted off from the true and the good and the\nbeautiful.\nReligion thus expanded descends from its abstract or \u201cintelligible\u201d world,\nto which it had retired from art and science, and the affairs of ordinary\nlife. Its God\u2014as a true God\u2014is not of the dead alone, but also of the\nliving: not a far-off supreme and ultimate Being, but also a man among\nmen. Philosophy thus has to break down the middle partition-wall of life,\nthe fence between secular and sacred. It is but religion come to its\nmaturity, made at home in the world, and no longer a stranger and a\nwonder. Religion has pronounced in its inmost heart and faith of faith,\nthat the earth is the Lord\u2019s, and that day unto day shows forth the divine\nhandiwork. But the heart of unbelief, of little faith, has hardly uttered\nthe word, than it forgets its assurance and leans to the conviction that\nthe prince of this world is the Spirit of Evil. The mood of Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e is\nalso\u2014but with a difference\u2014the mood of philosophy. It asserts the ways of\nProvidence: but its providence is not the God of the Moralist, or the\nideal of the Artist, or rather is not these only, but also the Law of\nNature, and more than that. Its aim is the Unity of History. The words\nhave sometimes been lightly used to mean that events run on in one\ncontinuous flow, and that there are no abrupt, no ultimate beginnings,\nparting age from age. But the Unity of History in its full sense is beyond\nhistory: it is history \u201creduced\u201d from the expanses of time to the eternal\npresent: its thousand years made one day,\u2014made even the glance of a\nmoment. The theme of the Unity of History\u2014in the full depth of unity and\nthe full expanse of history\u2014is the theme of Hegelian philosophy. It traces\nthe process in which Mind has to be all-inclusive, self-upholding, one\nwith the Eternal reality.\n\u201cThat process of the mind\u2019s self-realisation\u201d says Hegel in the close of\nhis _Phenomenology_, \u201cexhibits a lingering movement and succession of\nminds, a gallery of images, each of which, equipped with the complete\nwealth of mind, only seems to linger because the Self has to penetrate and\nto digest this wealth of its Substance. As its perfection consists in\ncoming completely to _know_ what it _is_ (its substance), this knowledge\nis its self-involution in which it deserts its outward existence and\nsurrenders its shape to recollection. Thus self-involved, it is sunk in\nthe night of its self-consciousness: but in that night its vanished being\nis preserved, and that being, thus in idea preserved,\u2014old, but now\nnew-born of the spirit,\u2014is the new sphere of being, a new world, a new\nphase of mind. In this new phase it has again to begin afresh and from the\nbeginning, and again nurture itself to maturity from its own resources, as\nif for it all that preceded were lost, and it had learned nothing from the\nexperience of the earlier minds. Yet is that recollection a preservation\nof experience: it is the quintessence, and in fact a higher form, of the\nsubstance. If therefore this new mind appears only to count on its own\nresources, and to start quite fresh and blank, it is at the same time on a\nhigher grade that it starts. The intellectual and spiritual realm, which\nis thus constructed in actuality, forms a succession in time, where one\nmind relieved another of its watch, and each took over the kingdom of the\nworld from the preceding. The purpose of that succession is to reveal the\ndepth, and that depth is the absolute comprehension of mind: this\nrevelation is therefore to uplift its depth, to spread it out in breadth,\nso negativing this self-involved Ego, wherein it is self-dispossessed or\nreduced to substance. But it is also its time: the course of time shows\nthis dispossession itself dispossessed, and thus in its extension it is no\nless in its depth, the self. The way to that goal,\u2014absolute\nself-certainty\u2014or the mind knowing itself as mind\u2014is the inwardising of\nthe minds, as they severally are in themselves, and as they accomplish the\norganisation of their realm. Their conservation,\u2014regarded on the side of\nits free and apparently contingent succession of fact\u2014is history: on the\nside of their comprehended organisation, again, it is the science of\nmental phenomenology: the two together, comprehended history, form at once\nthe recollection and the grave-yard of the absolute Mind, the actuality,\ntruth, and certitude of his throne, apart from which he were lifeless and\nalone.\u201d\nSuch in brief outline\u2014lingering most on the points where Hegel has here\nbeen briefest\u2014is the range of the Philosophy of Mind. Its aim is to\ncomprehend, not to explain: to put together in intelligent unity, not to\nanalyse into a series of elements. For it psychology is not an analysis or\ndescription of mental phenomena, of laws of association, of the growth of\ncertain powers and ideas, but a \u201ccomprehended history\u201d of the formation of\nsubjective mind, of the intelligent, feeling, willing self or ego. For it\nEthics is part and only part of the great scheme or system of\nself-development; but continuing into greater concreteness the normal\nendowment of the individual mind, and but preparing the ground on which\nreligion may be most effectively cultivated. And finally Religion itself,\nreleased from its isolation and other-world sacrosanctity, is shown to be\nonly the crown of life, the ripest growth of actuality, and shown to be so\nby philosophy, whilst it is made clear that religion is the basis of\nphilosophy, or that a philosophy can only go as far as the religious\nstand-point allows. The hierarchy, if so it be called, of the spiritual\nforces is one where none can stand alone, or claim an abstract and\nindependent supremacy. The truth of egoism is the truth of altruism: the\ntruly moral is the truly religious: and each is not what it professes to\nbe unless it anticipate the later, or include the earlier.\n(iv.) Mind or Spirit.\nIt may be said, however, that for such a range of subjects the term Mind\nis wretchedly inadequate and common-place, and that the better rendering\nof the title would be Philosophy of Spirit. It may be admitted that Mind\nis not all that could be wished. But neither is Spirit blameless. And, it\nmay be added, Hegel\u2019s own term _Geist_ has to be unduly strained to cover\nso wide a region. It serves\u2014and was no doubt meant to serve\u2014as a sign of\nthe conformity of his system with the religion which sees in God no\nother-world being, but our very self and mind, and which worships him in\nspirit and in truth. And if the use of a word like this could allay the\n\u201cancient variance\u201d between the religious and the philosophic mood, it\nwould be but churlish perhaps to refuse the sign of compliance and\ncompromise. But whatever may be the case in German,\u2014and even there the new\nwine was dangerous to the old wine-skin\u2014it is certain that to average\nEnglish ears the word Spiritual would carry us over the medium line into\nthe proper land of religiosity. And to do that, as we have seen, is to sin\nagainst the central idea: the idea that religion is of one blood with the\nwhole mental family, though the most graciously complete of all the\nsisters. Yet, however the word may be chosen, the philosophy of Hegel,\nlike the august lady who appeared in vision to the emprisoned Bo\u00ebthius,\nhas on her garment a sign which \u201csignifies the life which is on earth,\u201d as\nalso a sign which signifies the \u201cright law of heaven\u201d; if her right-hand\nholds the \u201cbook of the justice of the King omnipotent,\u201d the sceptre in her\nleft is \u201ccorporal judgment against sin(20).\u201d\nThere is indeed no sufficient reason for contemning the term Mind. If\nInductive Philosophy of the Human Mind has\u2014perhaps to a dainty taste\u2014made\nthe word unsavoury, that is no reason for refusing to give it all the\nwealth of soul and heart, of intellect and will. The _mens aeterna_ which,\nif we hear Tacitus, expressed the Hebrew conception of the spirituality of\nGod, and the \u039d\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 which Aristotelianism set supreme in the Soul, are not\nthe mere or abstract intelligence, which late-acquired habits of\nabstraction have made out of them. If the reader will adopt the term (in\nwant of a better) in its widest scope, we may shelter ourselves under the\nexample of Wordsworth. His theme is\u2014as he describes it in the\n_Recluse_\u2014\u201cthe Mind and Man\u201d: his\n\u201cvoice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted;\u2014and how exquisitely too\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish.\u201d\nThe verse which expounds that \u201chigh argument\u201d speaks\n\u201cOf Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love and Hope\nAnd melancholy Fear subdued by Faith.\u201d\nAnd the poet adds:\n\u201cAs we look\nInto our Minds, into the Mind of Man\u2014\nMy haunt, and the main region of my song;\nBeauty\u2014a living Presence of the earth\nSurpassing the most fair ideal forms\n... waits upon my steps.\u201d\nThe reality duly seen in the spiritual vision\n\u201cThat inspires\nThe human Soul of universal earth\nDreaming of things to come\u201d\nwill be a greater glory than the ideals of imaginative fiction ever\nfancied:\n\u201cFor the discerning intellect of Man,\nWhen wedded to this goodly universe\nIn love and holy passion, shall find these\nA simple produce of the common day.\u201d\nIf Wordsworth, thus, as it were, echoing the great conception of Francis\nBacon,\n\u201cWould chant, in lonely peace, the spousal verse\nOf this great consummation,\u201d\nperhaps the poet and the essayist may help us with Hegel to rate the\nMind\u2014the Mind of Man\u2014at its highest value.\nEssay II. Aims And Methods Of Psychology.\nIt is not going too far to say that in common estimation psychology has as\nyet hardly reached what Kant has called the steady walk of science\u2014_der\nsichere Gang der Wissenschaft_. To assert this is not, of course, to throw\nany doubts on the importance of the problems, or on the intrinsic value of\nthe results, in the studies which have been prosecuted under that name. It\nis only to note the obvious fact that a number of inquiries of somewhat\ndiscrepant tone, method, and tendency have all at different times covered\nthemselves under the common title of psychological, and that the work of\norientation is as yet incomplete. Such a destiny seems inevitable, when a\nname is coined rather as the title of an unexplored territory, than fixed\non to describe an accomplished fact.\n(i.) Psychology as a Science and as a Part of Philosophy.\nThe _De Anima_ of Aristotle, gathering up into one the work of Plato and\nhis predecessors, may be said to lay the foundation of psychology. But\neven in it, we can already see that there are two elements or aspects\nstruggling for mastery: two elements not unrelated or independent, but\nhard to keep fairly and fully in unity. On one hand there is the\nconception of Soul as a part of Nature, as a grade of existence in the\nphysical or natural universe,\u2014in the universe of things which suffer\ngrowth and change, which are never entirely \u201cwithout matter,\u201d and are\nalways attached to or present in body. From this point of view Aristotle\nurged that a sound and realistic psychology must, e.g. in its definition\nof a passion, give the prominent place to its physical (or material)\nexpression, and not to its mental form or significance. It must remember,\nhe said, that the phenomena or \u201caccidents\u201d are what really throw light on\nthe nature or the \u201csubstance\u201d of the Soul. On the other hand, there are\ntwo points to be considered. There is, first of all, the counterpoising\nremark that the conception of Soul as such, as a unity and common\ncharacteristic, will be determinative of the phenomena or\n\u201caccidents,\u201d\u2014will settle, as it were, what we are to observe and look for,\nand how we are to describe our observations. And by the _conception_ of\nSoul, is meant not _a_ soul, as a thing or agent (subject) which has\nproperties attaching to it; but soul, as the generic feature, the\nuniversal, which is set as a stamp on everything that claims to be\npsychical. In other words, Soul is one, not as a single thing contrasted\nwith its attributes, activities, or exercises of force (such single thing\nwill be shown by logic to be a metaphysical fiction); but as the unity of\nform and character, the comprehensive and identical feature, which is\npresent in all its manifestations and exercises. But there is a second\nconsideration. The question is asked by Aristotle whether it is completely\nand strictly accurate to put Soul under the category of natural objects.\nThere is in it, or of it, perhaps, something, and something essential to\nit, which belongs to the order of the eternal and self-active: something\nwhich is \u201cform\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d quite unaffected by and separate from\n\u201cmatter.\u201d How this is related to the realm of the perishable and\nchangeable is a problem on which Aristotle has been often (and with some\nreason) believed to be obscure, if not even inconsistent(21).\nIn these divergent elements which come to the fore in Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatment we have the appearance of a radical difference of conception and\npurpose as to psychology. He himself does a good deal to keep them both in\nview. But it is evident that here already we have the contrast between a\npurely physical or (in the narrower sense) \u201cscientific\u201d psychology,\nempirical and realistic in treatment, and a more philosophical\u2014what in\ncertain quarters would be called a speculative or metaphysical\u2014conception\nof the problem. There is also in Aristotle the antithesis of a popular or\nsuperficial, and an accurate or analytic, psychology. The former is of a\ncertain use in dealing, say, with questions of practical ethics and\neducation: the latter is of more strictly scientific interest. Both of\nthese distinctions\u2014that between a speculative and an empirical, and that\nbetween a scientific and a popular treatment\u2014affect the subsequent history\nof the study. Psychology is sometimes understood to mean the results of\ncasual observation of our own minds by what is termed introspection, and\nby the interpretation of what we may observe in others. Such observations\nare in the first place carried on under the guidance of distinctions or\npoints of view supplied by the names in common use. We interrogate our own\nconsciousness as to what facts or relations of facts correspond to the\nterms of our national language. Or we attempt\u2014what is really an\ninexhaustible quest\u2014to get definite divisions between them, and clear-cut\ndefinitions. Inquiries like these which start from popular distinctions\nfall a long way short of science: and the inquirer will find that\naccidental and essential properties are given in the same handful of\nconclusions. Yet there is always much value in these attempts to get our\nminds cleared: and it is indispensable for all inquiries that all alleged\nor reported facts of mind should be realised and reproduced in our own\nmental experience. And this is especially the case in psychology, just\nbecause here we cannot get the object outside us, we cannot get or make a\ndiagram, and unless we give it reality by re-constructing it,\u2014by\nre-interrogating our own experience, our knowledge of it will be but\nwooden and mechanical. And the term introspection need not be too\nseriously taken: it means much more than watching passively an internal\ndrama; and is quite as well describable as mental projection, setting out\nwhat was within, and so as it were hidden and involved, before ourselves\nin the field of mental vision. Here, as always, the essential point is to\nget ourselves well out of the way of the object observed, and to stand,\nfiguratively speaking, quite on one side.\nBut even at the best, such a popular or empirical psychology has no\nspecial claim to be ranked as science. It may no doubt be said that at\nleast it collects, describes, or notes down facts. But even this is not so\ncertain as it seems. Its so-called facts are very largely fictions, or so\nlargely interpolated with error, that they cannot be safely used for\nconstruction. If psychology is to accomplish anything valuable, it must go\nmore radically to work. It must\u2014at least in a measure\u2014discard from its\npreliminary view the data of common and current distinctions, and try to\nget at something more primary or ultimate as its starting-point. And this\nit may do in two ways. It may, in the one case, follow the example of the\nphysical sciences. In these it is the universal practice to assume that\nthe explanation of complex and concrete facts is to be attained by (_a_)\npostulating certain simple elements (which we may call atoms, molecules,\nand perhaps units or monads), which are supposed to be clearly conceivable\nand to justify themselves by intrinsic intelligibility, and by (_b_)\nassuming that these elements are compounded and combined according to laws\nwhich again are in the last resort self-evident, or such that they seem to\nhave an obvious and palpable lucidity. Further, such laws being always\naxioms or plain postulates of mechanics (for these alone possess this\nfeature of self-evident intelligibility), they are subject to and invite\nall the aids and refinements of the higher mathematical calculus. What the\nprimary and self-explicative bits of psychical reality may be, is a\nfurther question on which there may be some dispute. They may be, so to\nsay, taken in a more physical or in a more metaphysical way: i.e. more as\nunits of nerve-function or more as elements of ideative-function. And\nthere may be differences as to how far and in what provinces the\nmathematical calculus may be applicable. But, in any case, there will be a\nstrong tendency in psychology, worked on this plan, to follow, _mutatis\nmutandis_, and at some distance perhaps, the analogy of material physics.\nIn both the justification of the postulated units and laws will be their\nability to describe and systematise the observed phenomena in a uniform\nand consistent way.\nThe other way in which psychology gets a foundation and ulterior certainty\nis different, and goes deeper. After all, the \u201cscientific\u201d method is only\na way in which the facts of a given sphere are presented in thoroughgoing\ninterconnexion, each reduced to an exact multiple or fraction of some\nother, by an inimitably continued subtraction and addition of an assumed\nhomogeneous element, found or assumed to be perfectly imaginable\n(conceivable). But we may also consider the province in relation to the\nwhole sphere of reality, may ask what is its place and meaning in the\nwhole, what reality is in the end driving at or coming to be, and how far\nthis special province contributes to that end. If we do this, we attach\npsychology to philosophy, or, if we prefer so to call it, to metaphysics,\nas in the former way we established it on the principles generally\nreceived as governing the method of the physical sciences.\nThis\u2014the relation of psychology to fundamental philosophy\u2014is a question\nwhich also turns up in dealing with Ethics. There is on the part of those\nengaged in either of these inquiries a certain impatience against the\nintermeddling (which is held to be only muddling) of metaphysics with\nthem. It is clear that in a very decided way both psychology and ethics\ncan, up to some extent at least, be treated as what is called empirical\n(or, to use the more English phrase, inductive) sciences. On many hands\nthey are actually so treated: and not without result. Considering the\ntendency of metaphysical inquiries, it may be urged that it is well to\navoid preliminary criticism of the current conceptions and beliefs about\nreality which these sciences imply. Yet such beliefs are undoubtedly\npresent and effective. Schopenhauer has popularised the principle that the\npure empiricist is a fiction, that man is a radically metaphysical animal,\nand that he inevitably turns what he receives into a part of a dogmatic\ncreed\u2014a conviction how things ought to be. Almost without effort there\ngrows up in him, or flows in upon him, a belief and a system of beliefs as\nto the order and values of things. Every judgment, even in logic, rests on\nsuch an order of truth. He need not be able to formulate his creed: it\nwill influence him none the less: nay, his faith will probably seem more a\npart of the solid earth and common reality, the less it has been reduced\nto a determinate creed or to a code of principles. For such formulation\npresupposes doubt and scepticism, which it beats back by mere assertion.\nEach human being has such a background of convictions which govern his\nactions and conceptions, and of which it so startles him to suggest the\npossibility of a doubt, that he turns away in dogmatic horror. Such ruling\nideas vary, from man to man, and from man to woman\u2014if we consider them in\nall their minuteness. But above all they constitute themselves in a\ndifferently organised system or aggregate according to the social and\neducational stratum to which an individual belongs. Each group, engaged in\na common task, it may be in the study of a part of nature, is ideally\nbound and obliged by a common language, and special standards of truth and\nreality for its own. Such a group of ideas is what Bacon would have called\na scientific fetich or _idolum theatri_. A scientific _idolum_ is a\ntraditional belief or dogma as to principles, values, and methods, which\nhas so thoroughly pervaded the minds of those engaged in a branch of\ninquiry, that they no longer recognise its hypothetical character,\u2014its\nrelation of means to the main end of their function.\nSuch a collected and united theory of reality (it is what Hegel has\ndesignated the Idea) is what is understood by a natural metaphysic. It has\nnothing necessarily to do with a supersensible or a supernatural, if these\nwords mean a ghostly, materialised, but super-finely-materialised nature,\nabove and beyond the present. But that there is a persistent tendency to\nconceive the unity and coherence, the theoretic idea of reality, in this\npseudo-sensuous (i.e. super-sensuous) form, is of course a well-known\nfact. For the present, however, this aberration\u2014this idol of the tribe\u2014may\nbe left out of sight. By a metaphysic or fundamental philosophy, is, in\nthe present instance, meant a system of first principles\u2014a secular and\ncosmic creed: a belief in ends and values, a belief in truth\u2014again\npremising that the system in question is, for most, a rudely organised and\nalmost inarticulate mass of belief and hope, conviction and impression. It\nis, in short, a _natural_ metaphysic: a metaphysic, that is, which has but\nan imperfect coherence, which imperfectly realises both its nature and its\nlimits.\nIn certain parts, however, it is more and better than this crude\nbackground of belief. Each science\u2014or at least every group of sciences\u2014has\na more definite system or aggregate of first principles, axioms, and\nconceptions belonging to it. It has, that is,\u2014and here in a much\ndistincter way\u2014its special standard of reality, its peculiar forms of\nconceiving things, its distinctions between the actual and the apparent,\n&c. Here again it will probably be found that the scientific specialist is\nhardly conscious that these are principles and concepts: on the contrary,\nthey will be supposed self-evident and ultimate facts, foundations of\nbeing. Instead of being treated as modes of conception, more or less\njustified by their use and their results, these categories will be\nregarded as fundamental facts, essential conditions of all reality. Like\npopular thought in its ingrained categories, the specialist cannot\nunderstand the possibility of any limitation to his radical ideas of\nreality. To him they are not hypotheses, but principles. The scientific\nspecialist may be as convinced of the universal application of his\npeculiar categories, as the Chinese or the Eskimo that his standards are\nnatural and final.\nUnder such metaphysical or extra-empirical presuppositions all\ninvestigation, whether it be crudely empirical or (in the physical sense)\nscientific, is carried on. And when so carried on, it is said to be\nprosecuted apart from any interference from metaphysic. Such a na\u00efve or\nnatural metaphysic, not raised to explicit consciousness, not followed as\nan imposed rule, but governing with the strength of an immanent faith,\ndoes not count for those who live under it as a metaphysic at all. M.\nJourdain was amazed suddenly to learn he had been speaking prose for forty\nyears without knowing it. But in the present case there is something worse\nthan amazement sure to be excited by the news. For the critic who thus\nreveals the secrets of the scientist\u2019s heart is pretty sure to go on to\nsay that a good deal of this na\u00efve unconscious metaphysic is incoherent,\ncontradictory, even bad: that it requires correction, revision, and\nreadjustment, and has by criticism to be made one and harmonious. That\nreadjustment or criticism which shall eliminate contradiction and produce\nunity, is the aim of the _science_ of metaphysic\u2014the science of the\nmeta-physical element in physical knowledge: what Hegel has chosen to call\nthe Science of Logic (in the wide sense of the term). This higher Logic,\nthis _science_ of metaphysic, is the process to revise and harmonise in\nsystematic completeness the imperfect or misleading and partial estimates\nof reality which are to be found in popular and scientific thought.\nIn the case of the run of physical sciences this revision is less\nnecessary; and for no very recondite reason. Every science by its very\nnature deals with a special, a limited topic. It is confined to a part or\naspect of reality. Its propositions are not complete truths; they apply to\nan artificial world, to a part expressly cut off from the concrete\nreality. Its principles are generally cut according to their\ncloth,\u2014according to the range in which they apply. The only danger that\ncan well arise is if these categories are transplanted without due\nreservations, and made of universal application, i.e. if the scientist\nelects on his speciality to pronounce _de omnibus rebus_. But in the case\nof psychology and ethics the harmlessness of natural metaphysics will be\nless certain. Here a general human or universal interest is almost an\ninevitable coefficient: especially if they really rise to the full sweep\nof the subject. For as such they both seem to deal not with a part of\nreality, but with the very centre and purpose of all reality. In them we\nare not dealing with topics of secondary interest, but with the very heart\nof the human problem. Here the questions of reality and ideals, of unity\nand diversity, and of the evaluation of existence, come distinctly to the\nfore. If psychology is to answer the question, What am I? and ethics the\nquestion, What ought I to do? they can hardly work without some formulated\ncreed of metaphysical character, without some preliminary criticisms of\ncurrent first principles.\n(ii.) Herbart.\nThe German thinker, who has given perhaps the most fruitful stimulus to\nthe scientific study of psychology in modern times\u2014Johann Friedrich\nHerbart\u2014is after all essentially a philosopher, and not a mere scientist,\neven in his psychology. His psychological inquiry, that is, stands in\nintimate connexion with the last questions of all intelligence, with\nmetaphysics and ethics. The business of philosophy, says Herbart, is to\ntouch up and finish off conceptions (_Bearbeitung der Begriffe_)(22). It\nfinds, as it supervenes upon the unphilosophical world, that mere and pure\nfacts (if there ever are or were such purisms) have been enveloped in a\ncloud of theory, have been construed into some form of unity, but have\nbeen imperfectly, inadequately construed: and that the existing concepts\nin current use need to be corrected, supplemented and readjusted. It has,\naccordingly, for its work to \u201creconcile experience with itself(23),\u201d and\nto elicit \u201cthe hidden pre-suppositions without which the fact of\nexperience is unthinkable.\u201d Psychology, then, as a branch of this\nphilosophic enterprise, has to readjust the facts discovered in inner\nexperience. For mere uncritical experience or merely empirical knowledge\nonly offers _problems_; it suggests gaps, which indeed further reflection\nserves at first only to deepen into contradictions. Such a psychology is\n\u201cspeculative\u201d: i.e. it is not content to accept the mere given, but goes\nforward and backward to find something that will make the fact\nintelligible. It employs totally different methods from the\n\u201cclassification, induction, analogy\u201d familiar to the logic of the\nempirical sciences. Its \u201cprinciples,\u201d therefore, are not given facts: but\nfacts which have been manipulated and adjusted so as to lose their\nself-contradictory quality: they are facts \u201creduced,\u201d by introducing the\nomitted relationships which they postulate if they are to be true and\nself-consistent(24). While it is far from rejecting or ignoring\nexperience, therefore, psychology cannot strictly be said to build upon it\nalone. It uses experimental fact as an unfinished datum,\u2014or it sees in\nexperience a torso which betrays its imperfection, and suggests\ncompleting.\nThe starting-point, it may be said, of Herbart\u2019s psychology is a question\nwhich to the ordinary psychologist (and to the so-called scientific\npsychologist) has a secondary, if it have any interest. It was, he says,\nthe problem of Personality, the problem of the Self or Ego, which first\nled to his characteristic conception of psychological method. \u201cMy first\ndiscovery,\u201d he tells us(25), \u201cwas that the Self was neither primitive nor\nindependent, but must be the most dependent and most conditioned thing one\ncan imagine. The second was that the elementary ideas of an intelligent\nbeing, if they were ever to reach the pitch of self-consciousness, must be\neither all, or at least in part, opposed to each other, and that they must\ncheck or block one another in consequence of this opposition. Though held\nin check, however, these ideas were not to be supposed lost: they subsist\nas endeavours or tendencies to return into the position of actual idea, as\nsoon as the check became, for any reason, either in whole or in part\ninoperative. This check could and must be calculated, and thus it was\nclear that psychology required a mathematical as well as a metaphysical\nfoundation.\u201d\nThe place of the conception of the Ego in Kant\u2019s and Fichte\u2019s theory of\nknowledge is well known. Equally well known is Kant\u2019s treatment of the\nsoul-reality or soul-substance in his examination of Rational Psychology.\nWhereas the (logical) unity of consciousness, or \u201csynthetic unity of\napperception,\u201d is assumed as a fundamental starting-point in explanation\nof our objective judgments, or of our knowledge of objective existence,\nits real (as opposed to its formal) foundation in a \u201csubstantial\u201d soul is\nset aside as an illegitimate interpretation of, or inference from, the\nfacts of inner experience. The belief in the separate unity and\npersistence of the soul, said Kant, is not a scientifically-warranted\nconclusion. Its true place is as an ineffaceable postulate of the faith\nwhich inspires human life and action. Herbart did not rest content with\neither of these\u2014as he believed\u2014dogmatic assumptions of his master. He did\nnot fall in cheerfully with the idealism which seemed ready to dispense\nwith a soul, or which justified its acceptance of empirical reality by\nreferring to the fundamental unity of the function of judgment. With a\nstrong bent towards fully-differentiated and individualised experience\nHerbart conjoined a conviction of the need of logical analysis to prevent\nus being carried away by the first-come and inadequate generalities. The\nEgo which, in its extremest abstraction, he found defined as the unity of\nsubject and object, did not seem to him to offer the proper guarantees of\nreality: it was itself a problem, full of contradictions, waiting for\nsolution. On the other hand, the real Ego, or self of concrete experience,\nis very much more than this logical abstract, and differs widely from\nindividual to individual, and apparently from time to time even in the\nsame individual. Our self, of which we talk so fluently, as one and the\nself-same\u2014how far does it really possess the continuity and identity with\nwhich we credit it? Does it not rather seem to be an ideal which we\ngradually form and set before ourselves as the standard for measuring our\nattainments of the moment,\u2014the perfect fulfilment of that oneness of being\nand purpose and knowledge which we never reach? Sometimes even it seems no\nbetter than a name which we move along the varying phenomena of our inner\nlife, at one time identifying it with the power which has gained the\nvictory in a moral struggle, at another with that which has been\ndefeated(26), according as the attitude of the moment makes us throw now\none, now another, aspect of mental activity in the foreground.\nThe other\u2014or logical Ego\u2014the mere identity of subject and object,\u2014when\ntaken in its utter abstractness and simplicity, shrivels up to something\nvery small indeed\u2014to a something which is little better than nothing. The\nmere _I_ which is not contra-distinguished by a _Thou_ and a _He_\u2014which is\nwithout all definiteness of predication (the I=I of Fichte and\nSchelling)\u2014is only as it were a point of being cut off from all its\nconnexions in reality, and treated as if it were or could be entirely\nindependent. It is an identity in which subject and object have not yet\nappeared: it is not a real I, though we may still retain the name. It\nis\u2014as Hegel\u2019s _Logic_ will tell us\u2014exactly definable as Being, which is as\nyet Nothing: the impossible edge of abstraction on which we try\u2014and in\nvain\u2014to steady ourselves at the initial point of thought. And to reach or\nstand at that intangible, ungraspable point, which slips away as we\napproach, and transmutes itself as we hold it, is not the natural\nbeginning, but the result of introspection and reflection on the concrete\nself. But with this aspect of the question we are not now concerned.\nThat the unity of the Self as an intelligent and moral being, that the Ego\nof self-consciousness was an ideal and a product of development, was what\nHerbart soon became convinced of. The unity of Self is even as given in\nmature experience an imperfect fact. It is a fact, that is, which does not\ncome up to what it promised, and which requires to be supplemented, or\nphilosophically justified. Here and everywhere the custom of life carries\nus over gaps which yawn deep to the eye of philosophic reflection: even\nthough accident and illness force them not unfrequently even upon the\nblindest. To trace the process of unification towards this unity\u2014to trace,\nif you like, even the formation of the concept of such unity, as a\ngoverning and guiding principle in life and conduct, comes to be the\nproblem of the psychologist, in the largest sense of that problem. From\nSoul (_Seele_) to Mind or Spirit (_Geist_) is for Herbart, as for Hegel,\nthe course of psychology(27). The growth and development of mind, the\nformation of a self, the realisation of a personality, is for both the\ntheme which psychology has to expound. And Herbart, not less than Hegel,\nhad to bear the censure that such a conception of mental reality as a\ngrowth would destroy personality(28).\nBut with so much common in the general plan, the two thinkers differ\nprofoundly in their special mode of carrying out the task. Or, rather,\nthey turn their strength on different departments of the whole. Herbart\u2019s\ngreat practical interest had been the theory of education: \u201cpaedagogic\u201d is\nthe subject of his first important writings. The inner history of\nideas\u2014the processes which are based on the interaction of elements in the\nindividual soul\u2014are what he specially traces. Hegel\u2019s interests, on the\ncontrary, are more towards the greater process, the unities of historical\nlife, and the correlations of the powers of art, religion, and philosophy\nthat work therein. He turns to the macrocosm, almost as naturally as\nHerbart does to the microcosm. Thus, even in Ethics, while Herbart gives a\ndelicate analysis of the distinct aspects or elements in the Ethical\nidea,\u2014the diverse headings under which the disinterested spectator within\nthe breast measures with purely aesthetic eye his approach to unity and\nstrength of purpose, Hegel seems to hurry away from the field of moral\nsense or conscience to throw himself on the social and political\norganisation of the moral life. The General Paedagogic of Herbart has its\npendant in Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Law and of History.\nAt an early period Herbart had become impressed with the necessity of\napplying mathematics to psychology(29). To the usual objection, that\npsychical facts do not admit of measurement, he had a ready reply. We can\ncalculate even on hypothetical assumptions: indeed, could we measure, we\nshould scarcely take the trouble to calculate(30). To calculate (i.e. to\ndeduce mathematically) is to perform a general experiment, and to perform\nit in the medium where there is least likelihood of error or disturbance.\nThere may be anomalies enough apparent in the mental life: there may be\nthe great anomalies of Genius and of Freedom of Will; but the Newton and\nthe Kepler of psychology will show by calculation on assumed conditions of\npsychic nature that these aberrations can be explained by mechanical laws.\n\u201cThe human Soul is no puppet-theatre: our wishes and resolutions are no\nmarionettes: no juggler stands behind; but our true and proper life lies\nin our volition, and this life has its rule not outside, but in itself: it\nhas its own purely mental rule, by no means borrowed from the material\nworld. But this rule is in it sure and fixed; and on account of this its\nfixed quality it has more similarity to (what is otherwise heterogeneous)\nthe laws of impact and pressure than to the marvels of an alleged\ninexplicable freedom(31).\u201d\nPsychology then deals with a real, which exhibits phenomena analogous in\nseveral respects to those discussed by statics and mechanics. Its\nfoundation is a statics and mechanics of the Soul,\u2014as this real is called.\nWe begin by presupposing as the ultimate reality, underlying the\nfactitious and generally imperfect unity of self-consciousness and mind,\nan essential and primary unity\u2014the unity of an absolutely simple or\nindividual point of being\u2014a real point which amongst other points asserts\nitself, maintains itself. It has a character of its own, but that\ncharacter it only shows in and through a development conditioned by\nexternal influences. The specific nature of the soul-reality is to be\nrepresentative, to produce, or manifest itself in, ideas\n(_Vorstellungen_). But the character only emerges into actuality in the\nconflict of the soul-atom with other ultimate realities in the\ncongregation of things. A soul _per se_ or isolated is not possessed of\nideas. It is merely blank, undeveloped, formal unity, of which nothing can\nbe said. But like other realities it defines and characterises itself by\nantithesis, by resistance: it shows what it is by its behaviour in the\nstruggle for existence. It acts in self-defence: and its peculiar style or\nweapon of self-defence is an idea or representation. The way the Soul\nmaintains itself is by turning the assailant into an idea(32): and each\nidea is therefore a _Selbsterhaltung_ of the Soul. The Soul is thus\nenriched\u2014to appearance or incidentally: and the assailant is annexed. In\nthis way the one Soul may develop or evolve or express an innumerable\nvariety of ideas: for in response to whatever it meets, the living and\nactive Soul ideates, or gives rise to a representation. Thus, while the\nsoul is one, its ideas or representations are many. Taken separately, they\neach express the psychic self-conservation. But brought in relation with\neach other, as so many acts or self-affirmations of the one soul, they\nbehave as forces, and tend to thwart or check each other. It is as forces,\nas reciprocally arresting or fostering each other, that ideas are objects\nof science. When a representation is thus held in check, it is reduced to\na mere endeavour or active tendency to represent. Thus there arises a\ndistinction between representations proper, and those imperfect states or\nacts which are partly or wholly held in abeyance. But the latent phase of\nan idea is as essential to a thorough understanding of it as what appears.\nIt is the great blunder of empirical psychology to ignore what is sunk\nbelow the surface of consciousness. And to Herbart consciousness is not\nthe condition but rather the product of ideas, which are primarily forces.\nBut representations are not merely in opposition,\u2014impinging and resisting.\nThe same reason which makes them resist, viz. that they are or would fain\nbe acts of the one soul, but are more or less incompatible, leads them in\nother circumstances to form combinations with each other. These\ncombinations are of two sorts. They are, first, complications, or\n\u201ccomplexions\u201d: a number of ideas combine by quasi-addition and\njuxtaposition to form a total. Second, there is fusion: ideas presenting\ncertain degrees of contrast enter into a union where the parts are no\nlonger separately perceptible. It is easy to see how the problems of\npsychology now assume the form of a statics and mechanics of the mind.\nQuantitative data are to be sought in the strength of each separate single\nidea, and the degree in which two or more ideas block each other: in the\ndegree of combination between ideas, and the number of ideas in a\ncombination: and in the terms of relation between the members of a series\nof ideas. A statical theory has to show the conditions required for what\nwe may call the ideal state of equilibrium of the \u201cidea-forces\u201d: to\ndetermine, that is, the ultimate degree of obscuration suffered by any two\nideas of different strength, and the conditions of their permanent\ncombination or fusion. A mechanics of the mind will, on the contrary, deal\nwith the rate at which these processes are brought about, the velocity\nwith which in the movement of mind ideas are obscured or reawakened, &c.\nIt is fortunately unnecessary, here, to go further into details. What\nHerbart proposes is not a method for the mathematical measurement of\npsychic facts: it is a theory of mechanics and statics specially adapted\nto the peculiarities of psychical phenomena, where the forces are given\nwith no sine or cosine, where instead of gravitation we have the constant\neffort (as it were elasticity) of each idea to revert to its unchecked\nstate. He claims\u2014in short\u2014practically to be a Kepler and Newton of the\nmind, and in so doing to justify the vague professions of more than one\nwriter on mind\u2014above all, perhaps of David Hume, who goes beyond mere\nprofessions\u2014to make mental science follow the example of physics. And a\nmain argument in favour of his enterprise is the declaration of Kant that\nno body of knowledge can claim to be a science except in such proportion\nas it is mathematical. And the peculiarity of this enterprise is that\nself-consciousness, the Ego, is not allowed to interfere with the free\nplay of psychic forces. The Ego is\u2014psychologically\u2014the result, the\nproduct, and the varying product of that play. The play of forces is no\ndoubt a unity: but its unity lies not in the synthesis of consciousness,\nbut in the essential unity of Soul. And Soul is in its essence neither\nconsciousness, nor self-consciousness, nor mind: but something on the\nbasis of whose unity these are built up and developed(33). The mere\n\u201crepresentation\u201d does not include the further supervenience of\nconsciousness: it represents, but it is not as yet necessary that we\nshould also be conscious that there is representation. It is, in the\nphrase of Leibniz, perception: but not apperception. It is mere\nstraight-out, not as yet reflected, representation. Gradually there\nemerges through the operation of mechanical psychics a nucleus, a floating\nunity, a fixed or definite central aggregate.\nThe suggestion of mathematical method has been taken up by subsequent\ninquirers (as it was pursued even before Herbart\u2019s time), but not in the\nsense he meant. Experimentation has now taken a prominent place in\npsychology. But in proportion as it has done so, psychology has lost its\nnative character, and thrown itself into the arms of physiology. What\nHerbart calculated were actions and reactions of idea-forces: what the\nmodern experimental school proposes to measure are to a large extent the\nvelocities of certain physiological processes, the numerical specification\nof certain facts. Such ascertainments are unquestionably useful; as\nnumerical precision is in other departments. But, taken in themselves,\nthey do not carry us one bit further on the way to science. As\nexperiments, further,\u2014to note a point discussed elsewhere(34)\u2014their value\ndepends on the point of view, on the theory which has led to them, on the\nvalue of the general scheme for which they are intended to provide a\nspecial new determination. In many cases they serve to give a vivid\nreality to what was veiled under a general phrase. The truth looks so much\nmore real when it is put in figures: as the size of a huge tree when set\nagainst a rock; or as when Milton bodies out his fallen angel by setting\nforth the ratio between his spear and the tallest Norway pine. But until\nthe general relationship between soul and body is more clearly formulated,\nsuch statistics will have but a value of curiosity.\n(iii.) The Faculty-Psychology and its Critics.\nWhat Herbart (as well as Hegel) finds perpetual ground for objecting to is\nthe talk about mental faculties. This objection is part of a general\ncharacteristic of all the higher philosophy; and the recurrence of it\ngives an illustration of how hard it is for any class of men to see\nthemselves as others see them. If there be anything the vulgar believe to\nbe true of philosophy, it is that it deals in distant and abstruse\ngeneralities, that it neglects the shades of individuality and reality,\nand launches out into unsubstantial general ideas. But it would be easy to\ngather from the great thinkers an anthology of passages in which they hold\nit forth as the great work of philosophy to rescue our conceptions from\nthe indefiniteness and generality of popular conception, and to give them\nreal, as opposed to a merely nominal, individuality.\nThe Wolffian school, which Herbart (not less than Kant) found in\npossession of the field, and which in Germany may be taken to represent\nonly a slight variant of the half-and-half attitude of vulgar thought, was\nentrenched in the psychology of faculties. Empirical psychology, said\nWolff(35), tells the number and character of the soul\u2019s faculties:\nrational psychology will tell what they \u201cproperly\u201d are, and how they\nsubsist in soul. It is assumed that there are general receptacles or\ntendencies of mental operation which in course of time get filled or\nqualified in a certain way: and that when this question is disposed of, it\nstill remains to fix on the metaphysical bases of these facts.\nThat a doctrine of faculties should fix itself in psychology is not so\nwonderful. In the non-psychical world objects are easily discriminated in\nspace, and the individual thing lasts through a time. But a phase of mind\nis as such fleeting and indeterminate: its individual features which come\nfrom its \u201cobject\u201d tend soon to vanish in memory: all freshness of definite\ncharacters wears off, and there is left behind only a vague \u201crecept\u201d of\nthe one and same in many, a sort of hypostatised representative, faint but\npersistent, of what in experience was an ever-varying succession. We\ngeneralise here as elsewhere: but elsewhere the many singulars remain to\nconfront us more effectually. But in Mind the immense variety of real\nimagination, memory, judgment is forgotten, and the name in each case\nreduced to a meagre abstract. Thus the identity in character and\noperation, having been cut off from the changing elements in its real\naction, is transmuted into a substantial somewhat, a subsistent faculty.\nThe relationship of one to another of the powers thus by abstraction and\nfancy created becomes a problem of considerable moment, their causal\nrelations in particular: till in the end they stand outside and\nindependent of each other, engaged, as Herbart says, in a veritable\n_bellum omnium contra omnes_.\nBut this hypostatising of faculties becomes a source of still further\ndifficulties when it is taken in connexion with the hypostasis of the Soul\nor Self or Ego. To Aristotle the Soul in its general aspect is Energy or\nEssence; and its individual phases are energies. But in the hands of the\nuntrained these conceptions came to be considerably displaced. Essence or\nSubstance came to be understood (as may be seen in Locke, and still more\nin loose talk) as a something,\u2014a substratum,\u2014or peculiar nature\u2014(of which\n_in itself_ nothing further could be said(36) but which notwithstanding\nwas permanent and perhaps imperishable): this something subsistent\nexhibited certain properties or activities. There thus arose, on one hand,\nthe Soul-thing,\u2014a substance misunderstood and sensualised with a\nsupernatural sensuousness,\u2014a denizen of the transcendental or even of the\ntranscendent world: and, on the other hand, stood the actual\nmanifestations, the several exhibitions of this force, the assignable and\ndescribable psychic facts. We are accordingly brought before the problem\nof how this one substance or essence stands to the several entities or\nhypostases known as faculties. And we still have in the rear the further\nproblem of how these abstract entities stand to the real and concrete\nsingle acts and states of soul and mind.\nThis hypostatising of faculties, and this distinction of the \u201cSubstantial\u201d\nsoul from its \u201caccidentia\u201d or phenomena, had grown\u2014through the\nmaterialistic proclivities of popular conception\u2014from the indications\nfound in Aristotle. It attained its climax, perhaps in the Wolffian school\nin Germany, but it has been the resort of superficial psychology in all\nages. For while it, on one hand, seemed to save the substantial Soul on\nwhose incorruptibility great issues were believed to hinge, it held out,\non the other, an open hand to the experimental inquirer, whom it bade\nfreely to search amongst the phenomena. But if it was the refuge of\npusillanimity, it was also the perpetual object of censure from all the\ngreater and bolder spirits. Thus, the psychology of Hobbes may be hasty\nand crude, but it is at least animated by a belief that the mental life is\ncontinuous, and not cut off by abrupt divisions severing the mental\nfaculties. The \u201cimage\u201d (according to his materialistically coloured\npsychology) which, when it is a strong motion, is called sense, passes, as\nit becomes weaker or decays, into imagination, and gives rise, by its\nvarious complications and associations with others, to reminiscence,\nexperience, expectation. Similarly, the voluntary motion which is an\neffect or a phase of imagination, beginning at first in small\nmotions\u2014called by themselves \u201cendeavours,\u201d and in relation to their cause\n\u201cappetites\u201d or \u201cdesires(37)\u201d\u2014leads on cumulatively to Will, which is the\n\u201clast appetite in deliberating.\u201d Spinoza, his contemporary, speaks in the\nsame strain(38). \u201cFaculties of intellect, desire, love, &c., are either\nutterly fictitious, or nothing but metaphysical entities, or universals\nwhich we are in the habit of forming from particulars. Will and intellect\nare thus supposed to stand to this or that idea, this or that volition, in\nthe same way as stoniness to this or that stone, or as man to Peter or\nPaul.\u201d They are supposed to be a general something which gets defined and\ndetached. But, in the mind, or in the cogitant soul, there are no such\nthings. There are only ideas: and by an \u201cidea\u201d we are to understand not an\nimage on the retina or in the brain, not a \u201cdumb something, like a\npainting on a panel(39),\u201d but a mode of thinking, or even the act of\nintellection itself. The ideas _are_ the mind: mind does not _have_ ideas.\nFurther, every \u201cidea,\u201d as such, \u201cinvolves affirmation or negation,\u201d\u2014is not\nan image, but an act of judgment\u2014contains, as we should say, an implicit\nreference to actuality,\u2014a reference which in volition is made explicit.\nThus (concludes the corollary of Eth. ii. 49) \u201cWill and Intellect are one\nand the same.\u201d But in any case the \u201cfaculties\u201d as such are no better than\n_entia rationis_ (i.e. auxiliary modes of representing facts).\nLeibniz speaks no less distinctly and sanely in this direction. \u201cTrue\npowers are never mere possibilities: they are always tendency and action.\u201d\nThe \u201cMonad\u201d\u2014that is the quasi-intelligent unit of existence,\u2014is\nessentially activity, and its actions are perceptions and appetitions,\ni.e. tendencies to pass from one perceptive state or act to another. It is\nout of the variety, the complication, and relations of these miniature or\nlittle perceptions and appetitions, that the conspicuous phenomena of\nconsciousness are to be explained, and not by supposing them due to one or\nother faculty. The soul is a unity, a self-developing unity, a unity which\nat each stage of its existence shows itself in a perception or idea,\u2014each\nsuch perception however being, to repeat the oft quoted phrase, _plein de\nl\u2019avenir et charg\u00e9 du pass\u00e9_:\u2014each, in other words, is not stationary, but\nactive and urgent, a progressive force, as well as a representative\nelement. Above all, Leibniz has the view that the soul gives rise to all\nits ideas from itself: that its life is its own production, not a mere\ninheritance of ideas which it has from birth and nature, nor a mere\nimportation into an empty room from without, but a necessary result of its\nown constitution acting in necessary (predetermined) reciprocity and\nharmony with the rest of the universe.\nBut Hobbes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, were most attentively heard in the\npassages where they favoured or combatted the dominant social and\ntheological prepossessions. Their glimpses of truer insight and even their\npalpable contributions in the line of a true psychology were ignored or\nforgotten. More attention, perhaps, was attracted by an attempt of a very\ndifferent style. This was the system of Condillac, who, as Hegel says (p.\n61), made an unmistakable attempt to show the necessary interconnexion of\nthe several modes of mental activity. In his _Trait\u00e9 des Sensations_\n(1754), following on his _Essai sur l\u2019origine des connaissances humaines_\n(1746), he tried to carry out systematically the deduction or derivation\nof all our ideas from sense, or to trace the filiation of all our\nfaculties from sensation. Given a mind with no other power than\nsensibility, the problem is to show how it acquires all its other\nfaculties. Let us then suppose a sentient animal to which is offered a\nsingle sensation, or one sensation standing out above the others. In such\ncircumstances the sensation \u201cbecomes\u201d (_devient_) attention: or a\nsensation \u201cis\u201d (_est_) attention, either because it is alone, or because\nit is more lively than all the rest. Again: before such a being, let us\nset two sensations: to perceive or feel (_apercevoir ou sentir_) the two\nsensations is the same thing (_c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose_). If one of the\nsensations is not present, but a sensation made already, then to perceive\nit is memory. Memory, then, is only \u201ctransformed sensation\u201d (_sensation\ntransform\u00e9e_). Further, suppose we attend to both ideas, this is \u201cthe same\nthing\u201d as to compare them. And to compare them we must see difference or\nresemblance. This is judgment. \u201cThus sensation becomes successively\nattention, comparison, judgment.\u201d And\u2014by further steps of the equating\nprocess\u2014it appears that sensation again \u201cbecomes\u201d an act of reflection.\nAnd the same may be said of imagination and reasoning: all are transformed\nsensations.\nIf this is so with the intelligence, it is equally the case with the Will.\nTo feel and not feel well or ill is impossible. Coupling then this feeling\nof pleasure or pain with the sensation and its transformations, we get the\nseries of phases ranging from desire, to passion, hope, will. \u201cDesire is\nonly the action of the same faculties as are attributed to the\nunderstanding.\u201d A lively desire is a passion: a desire, accompanied with a\nbelief that nothing stands in its way, is a volition. But combine these\naffective with the intellectual processes already noticed, and you have\nthinking (_penser_)(40). Thus thought in its entirety is, only and always,\ntransformed sensation.\nSomething not unlike this, though scarcely so simply and directly\ndoctrinaire, is familiar to us in some English psychology, notably James\nMill\u2019s(41). Taken in their literal baldness, these identifications may\nsound strained,\u2014or trifling. But if we look beyond the words, we can\ndetect a genuine instinct for maintaining and displaying the unity and\ncontinuity of mental life through all its modifications,\u2014coupled\nunfortunately with a bias sometimes in favour of reducing higher or more\ncomplex states of mind to a mere prolongation of lower and beggarly\nrudiments. But otherwise such analyses are useful as aids against the\ntendency of inert thought to take every name in this department as a\ndistinguishable reality: the tendency to part will from thought\u2014ideas from\nemotion\u2014and even imagination from reason, as if either could be what it\nprofessed without the other.\n(iv.) Methods and Problems of Psychology.\nThe difficulties of modern psychology perhaps lie in other directions, but\nthey are not less worth guarding against. They proceed mainly from failure\nor inability to grasp the central problem of psychology, and a disposition\nto let the pen (if it be a book on the subject) wander freely through the\nalmost illimitable range of instance, illustration, and application.\nThough it is true that the proper study of mankind is man, it is hardly\npossible to say what might not be brought under this head. _Homo sum,\nnihil a me alienum puto_, it might be urged. Placed in a sort of middle\nground between physiology (summing up all the results of physical science)\nand general history (including the contributions of all the branches of\nsociology), the psychologist need not want for material. He can wander\ninto ethics, aesthetic, and logic, into epistemology and metaphysics. And\nit cannot be said with any conviction that he is actually trespassing, so\nlong as the ground remains so ill-fenced and vaguely enclosed. A desultory\ncollection of observations on traits of character, anecdotes of mental\nevents, mixed up with hypothetical descriptions of how a normal human\nbeing may be supposed to develop his so-called faculties, and including\nsome dictionary-like verbal distinctions, may make a not uninteresting and\npossibly bulky work entitled Psychology.\nIt is partly a desire of keeping up to date which is responsible for the\ncopious extracts or abstracts from treatises on the anatomy and functions\nof the nerve-system, which, accompanied perhaps by a diagram of the brain,\noften form the opening chapter of a work on psychology. Even if these\nresearches had achieved a larger number of authenticated results than they\nas yet have, they would only form an appendix and an illustration to the\nproper subject(42). As they stand, and so long as they remain largely\nhypothetical, the use of them in psychology only fosters the common\ndelusion that, when we can picture out in material outlines a theory\notherwise unsupported, it has gained some further witness in its favour.\nIt is quite arguable indeed that it may be useful to cut out a section\nfrom general human biology which should include the parts of it that were\nspecially interesting in connexion with the expression or generation of\nthought, emotion, and desire. But in that case, there is a blunder in\nsingling out the brain alone, and especially the organs of sense and\nvoluntary motion,\u2014except for the reason that this province of\npsycho-physics alone has been fairly mapped out. The preponderant half of\nthe soul\u2019s life is linked to other parts of the physical system. Emotion\nand volition, and the general tone of the train of ideas, if they are to\nbe connected with their expression and physical accompaniment (or aspect),\nwould require a sketch of the heart and lungs, as well as the digestive\nsystem in general. Nor these alone. Nerve analysis (especially confined to\nthe larger system), though most modern, is not alone important, as Plato\nand Aristotle well saw. So that if biology is to be adapted for\npsychological use (and if psychology deals with more than cognitive\nprocesses), a liberal amount of physiological information seems required.\nExperimental psychology is a term used with a considerable laxity of\ncontent; and so too is that of physiological psychology, or\npsycho-physics. And the laxity mainly arises because there is an\nuncertainty as to what is principal and what secondary in the inquiry.\nExperiment is obviously a help to observation: and so far as the latter is\npracticable, the former would seem to have a chance of introduction. But\nin any case, experiment is only a means to an end and only practicable\nunder the guidance of hypothesis and theory. Its main value would be in\ncase the sphere of psychology were completely paralleled with one province\nof physiology. It was long ago maintained by Spinoza and (in a way by)\nLeibniz, that there is no mental phenomenon without its bodily equivalent,\npendant, or correspondent. The _ordo rerum_ (the molecular system of\nmovements) is, he held, the same as the order of ideas. But it is only at\nintervals, under special conditions, or when they reach a certain\nmagnitude, that ideas emerge into full consciousness. As consciousness\npresents them, they are often discontinuous, and abrupt: and they do not\nalways carry with them their own explanation. Hence if we are confined to\nthe larger phenomena of consciousness alone, our science is imperfect:\nmany things seem anomalous; above all, perhaps, will, attention, and the\nlike. We have seen how Herbart (partly following the hints of Leibniz),\nattempted to get over this difficulty by the hypothesis of idea-forces\nwhich generate the forms and matter of consciousness by their mutual\nimpact and resistance. Physiological psychology substitutes for Herbart\u2019s\nreals and his idea-forces a more materialistic sort of reality; perhaps\nfunctions of nerve-cells, or other analogous entities. There, it hopes one\nday to discover the underlying continuity of event which in the upper\nrange of consciousness is often obscured, and then the process would be,\nas the phrase goes, explained: we should be able to picture it out without\na gap.\nThese large hopes may have a certain fulfilment. They may lead to the\nwithdrawal of some of the fictitious mental processes which are still\ndescribed in works of psychology. But on the whole they can only have a\nnegative and auxiliary value. The value, that is, of helping to confute\nfeigned connexions and to suggest truer. They will be valid against the\nmode of thought which, when Psych\u00e9 fails us for an explanation, turns to\nbody, and interpolates soul between the states of body: the mode which, in\nan older phraseology, jumps from final causes to physical, and from\nphysical (or efficient) to final. Here, as elsewhere, the physical has its\nplace: and here, more than in many places, the physical has been unfairly\ntreated. But the whole subject requires a discussion of the so-called\n\u201crelations\u201d of soul and body: a subject on which popular conceptions and\nso-called science are radically obscure.\n\u201cBut the danger which threatens experimental psychology,\u201d says\nM\u00fcnsterberg, \u201cis that, in investigating details, the connexion with\nquestions of principle may be so lost sight of that the investigation\nfinally lands at objects scientifically quite worthless(43). Psychology\nforgets only too easily that all those numerical statistics which\nexperiment allows us to form are only means for psychological analysis and\ninterpretation, not ends in themselves. It piles up numbers and numbers,\nand fails to ask whether the results so formed have any theoretical value\nwhatever: it seeks answers before a question has been clearly and\ndistinctly framed; whereas the value of experimental answers always\ndepends on the exactitude with which the question is put. Let me remind\nthe reader, how one inquirer after another made many thousand experiments\non the estimation of small intervals of time, without a single one of them\nraising the question what the precise point was which these experiments\nsought to measure, what was the psychological occurrence in the case, or\nwhat psychological phenomena were employed as the standard of\ntime-intervals. And so each had his own arbitrary standard of measurement,\neach of them piled up mountains of numbers, each demonstrated that his\npredecessor was wrong; but neither Estel nor Mehner have carried the\nproblem of the time-sense a single step further.\n\u201cThis must be all changed, if we are not to drift into the barrenest\nscholastic.... Everywhere out of the correct perception that problems of\nprinciple demand the investigation of detailed phenomena, and that the\nlatter investigation must proceed in comparative independence of the\nquestion of principles, there has grown the false belief that the\ndescription of detail phenomena is the ultimate aim of science. And so,\nside by side with details which are of importance to principles, we have\nothers, utterly indifferent and theoretically worthless, treated with the\nsame zeal. To the solution of their barren problems the old Schoolmen\napplied a certain acuteness; but in order to turn out masses of numbers\nfrom barren experiments, all that is needed is a certain insensibility to\nfits of ennui. Let numbers be less collected for their own sake: and\ninstead, let the problems be so brought to a point that the answers may\npossess the character of principles. Let each experiment be founded on far\nmore theoretical considerations, then the number of the experiments may be\nlargely diminished(44).\u201d\nWhat is thus said of a special group of inquiries by one of the foremost\nof the younger psychologists, is not without its bearings on all the\ndepartments in which psychology can learn. For physiological, or what is\ntechnically called psychological, experiment, is co-ordinate with many\nother sources of information. Much, for instance, is to be learnt by a\ncareful study of language by those who combine sound linguistic knowledge\nwith psychological training. It is in language, spoken and written, that\nwe find at once the great instrument and the great document of the\ndistinctively human progress from a mere _Psyche_ to a mature _Nous_, from\nSoul to Mind. Whether we look at the varieties of its structure under\ndifferent ethnological influences, or at the stages of its growth in a\nnation and an individual, we get light from language on the\ndifferentiation and consolidation of ideas. But here again it is easy to\nlose oneself in the world of etymology, or to be carried away into the\nenticing questions of real and ideal philology.\n\u201cThe human being of the psychologist,\u201d says Herbart(45), \u201cis the social\nand civilised human being who stands on the apex of the whole history\nthrough which his race has passed. In him is found visibly together all\nthe multiplicity of elements, which, under the name of mental faculties,\nare regarded as a universal inheritance of humanity. Whether they are\noriginally in conjunction, whether they are originally a multiplicity, is\na point on which the facts are silent. The savage and the new-born child\ngive us far less occasion to admire the range of their mind than do the\nnobler animals. But the psychologists get out of this difficulty by the\nunwarranted assumption that all the higher mental activities exist\npotentially in children and savages\u2014though not in the animals\u2014as a\nrudimentary predisposition or psychical endowment. Of such a nascent\nintellect, a nascent reason, and nascent moral sense, they find\nrecognisable traces in the scanty similarities which the behaviour of\nchild or savage offers to those of civilised man. We cannot fail to note\nthat in their descriptions they have before them a special state of man,\nand one which, far from accurately defined, merely follows the general\nimpression made upon us by those beings we name civilised. An extremely\nfluctuating character inevitably marks this total impression. For there\nare no general facts:\u2014the genuine psychological documents lie in the\nmomentary states of individuals: and there is an immeasurably long way\nfrom these to the height of the universal concept of man in general.\u201d\nAnd yet Man in general,\u2014Man as man and therefore as mind\u2014the concept of\nMan\u2014normal and ideal man\u2014the complete and adequate Idea of man\u2014is the true\nterminus of the psychological process; and whatever be the difficulties in\nthe way, it is the only proper goal of the science. Only it has to be\nbuilt up, constructed, evolved, developed,\u2014and not assumed as a datum of\npopular imagination. We want a concept, concrete and real, of Man and of\nMind, which shall give its proper place to each of the elements that, in\nthe several examples open to detailed observation, are presented with\nunfair or exaggerated prominence. The savage and the child are not to be\nleft out as free from contributing to form the ideal: virtues here are not\nmore important than vices, and are certainly not likely to be so\ninforming: even the insane and the idiot show us what human intelligence\nis and requires: and the animals are also within the sweep of psychology.\nMan is not its theatre to the exclusion of woman; if it records the\nresults of introspection of the Me, it will find vast and copious quarries\nin the various modes in which an individual identifies himself with others\nas We. And even the social and civilised man gets his designation, as\nusual, _a potiori_. He is more civilised and social than others: perhaps\nrather more civilised than not. But always, in some measure, he is at the\nsame time unsocial or anti-social, and uncivilised. Each unit in the\nsociety of civilisation has to the outside observer\u2014and sometimes even to\nhis own self-detached and impartial survey\u2014a certain oddity or fixity, a\ngleam of irrationality, which shows him to fall short of complete sanity\nor limpid and mobile intelligence. He has not wholly put off the\nsavage,\u2014least of all, says the cynic, in his relations with the other sex.\nHe carries with him even to the grave some grains of the recklessness and\npetulance of childhood. And rarely, if ever, can it be said of him that he\nhas completely let the ape and tiger die.\nBut that is only one way of looking at the matter\u2014and one which, perhaps,\nis more becoming to the pathologist and the cynic, than to the\npsychologist. Each of these stages of psychical development, even if that\ndevelopment be obviously describable as degeneration, has something which,\nduly adjusted, has its place and function in the theory of the\nnormally-complete human mind. The animal, the savage, and the child,\u2014each\nhas its part there. It is a mutilated, one-sided and superficial advance\nin socialisation which cuts off the civilised creature from the natural\nstem of his ancestry, from the large freedom, the immense _insouciance_,\nthe childlikeness of his first estate. There is something, again, wanting\nin the man who utterly lacks the individualising realism and tenderness of\nthe woman, as in the woman who can show no comprehension of view or\nbravery of enterprise. Even pathological states of mind are not mere\nanomalies and mere degenerations. Nature perhaps knows no proper\ndegenerations, but only by-ways and intricacies in the course of\ndevelopment. Still less is the vast enormity or irregularity of genius to\nbe ignored. It is all\u2014to the philosophic mind\u2014a question of degree and\nproportion,\u2014though often the proportion seems to exceed the scale of our\ncustomary denominators. If an element is latent or quiescent (in arrest),\nthat is no index to its absolute amount: \u201cwe know not what\u2019s resisted.\u201d\nLet us by all means keep proudly to our happy mediocrity of faculty, and\nstep clear of insanity or idiotcy on one hand, and from genius or heroism\non the other. But the careful observer will notwithstanding note how\ndelicately graded and how intricately combined are the steps which connect\nextremes so terribly disparate. It is only vulgar ignorance which turns\naway in hostility or contempt from the imbecile and the deranged, and only\na worse than vulgar sciolism which sees in genius and the hero nothing but\nan aberration from its much-prized average. Criminalistic anthropology, or\nthe psychology of the criminal, may have indulged in much frantic\nexaggeration as to the doom which nature and heredity have pronounced over\nthe fruit of the womb even before it entered the shores of light: yet they\nhave at least served to discredit the free and easy assumption of the\nabstract averagist, and shown how little the penalties of an unbending law\nmeet the requirements of social well-being.\nYet, if psychology be willing to learn in all these and other provinces of\nthe estate of man, it must remember that, once it goes beyond the narrow\nrange in which the interpretations of symbol and expression have become\nfamiliar, it is constantly liable to blunder in the inevitable effort to\ntranslate observation into theory. The happy mean between making too much\nof palpable differences and hurrying on to a similar rendering of similar\nsigns is the rarest of gifts. Or, perhaps, it were truer to say it is the\nlatest and most hardly won of acquirements. To learn to observe\u2014observe\nwith mind\u2014is not a small thing. There are rules for it\u2014both rules of\ngeneral scope and, above all, rules in each special department. But like\nall \u201cmajor premisses\u201d in practice, everything depends on the power of\njudgment, the tact, the skill, the \u201cgift\u201d of applying them. They work not\nas mere rules to be conned by rote, but as principles assimilated into\nconstituents of the mental life-blood: rules which serve only as condensed\nreminders and hints of habits of thought and methods of research which\nhave grown up in action and reflection. To observe we must comprehend: yet\nwe can only comprehend by observing. We all know how unintelligible\u2014save\nfor epochs of ampler reciprocity, and it may be even of acquired unity of\ninterest\u2014the two sexes are for each other. Parents can remember how\nmysteriously minded they found their own elders; and in most cases they\nhave to experience the depth of the gulf which in certain directions parts\nthem from their children\u2019s hearts. Even in civilised Europe, the ordinary\nmember of each nation has an underlying conviction (which at moments of\npassion or surprise will rise and find harsh utterance) that the foreigner\nis queer, irrational, and absurd. If the foreigner, further, be so far\nremoved as a Chinaman (or an Australian \u201cblack\u201d), there is hardly anything\ntoo vile, meaningless, or inhuman which the European will not readily\nbelieve in the case of one who, it may be, in turn describes him as a\n\u201cforeign devil.\u201d It can only be in a fit of noble chivalry that the\nBritish rank and file can so far temporise with its insular prejudice as\nto admit of \u201cFuzzy-wuzzy\u201d that\n\u201cHe\u2019s a poor benighted \u2019eathen\u2014but a first-class fightin\u2019 man.\u201d\nNot every one is an observer who chooses to dub himself so, nor is it in a\nshort lapse of time and with condescension for foreign habits, that any\nobserver whatever can become a trustworthy reporter of the ideas some\nbarbarian tribe holds concerning the things of earth and air, and the\nhidden things of spirits and gods. The \u201cinterviewer\u201d no doubt is a useful\nbeing when it is necessary to find \u201ccopy,\u201d or when sharp-drawn characters\nand picturesque incidents are needed to stimulate an inert public, ever\nopen to be interested in some new thing. But he is a poor contributor to\nthe stored materials of science.\nIt is of other stuff that true science is made. And if even years of\nnominal intercourse and spatial juxtaposition sometimes leave human\nbeings, as regards their inner selves, in the position of strangers still,\nwhat shall be said of the attempt to discern the psychic life of animals?\nWill the touch of curiosity which prompts us to watch the proceedings of\nthe strange creatures,\u2014will a course of experimentation on their behaviour\nunder artificial conditions,\u2014justify us in drawing liberal conclusions as\nto why they so behaved, and what they thought and felt about it? It is\nnecessary in the first place to know what to observe, and how, and above\nall what for. But that presumed, we must further live with the animals not\nonly as their masters and their examiners, but as their friends and\nfellow-creatures; we must be able\u2014and so lightly that no effort is\ndiscernable\u2014to lay aside the burden and garb of civilisation; we must\npossess that stamp of sympathy and similarity which invites confidence,\nand breaks down the reserve which our poor relations, whether human or\nothers, offer to the first approaches of a strange superior. It is\nprobable that in that case we should have less occasion to wonder at their\noddities or to admire their sagacity. But a higher and more philosophical\nwonder might, as in other cases when we get inside the heart of our\nsubject, take the place of the cheap and childish love of marvels, or of\nthe vulgar straining after comic traits.\nOf all this mass of materials the psychologist proper can directly make\nonly a sparing use. Even as illustrations, his data must not be presented\ntoo often in all their crude and undigested individuality, or he runs the\nrisk of leaving one-sided impressions. Every single instance,\nindividualised and historical,\u2014unless it be exhibited by that true art of\ngenius which we cannot expect in the average psychologist\u2014narrows, even\nthough it be but slightly, the complete and all-sided truth. Anecdotes are\ngood, and to the wise they convey a world of meaning, but to lesser minds\nthey sometimes suggest anything but the points they should accentuate.\nWithout the detail of individual realistic study there is no psychology\nworth the name. History, story, we must have: but at the same time, with\nthe philosopher, we must say, I don\u2019t give much weight to stories. And\nthis is what will always\u2014except in rare instances where something like\ngenius is conjoined with it\u2014make esoteric science hard and unpopular. It\ndare not\u2014if it is true to its idea\u2014rest on any amount of mere instances,\nas isolated, unreduced facts. Yet it can only have real power so far as it\nconcentrates into itself the life-blood of many instances, and indeed\nextracts the pith and unity of all instances.\nNor, on the other hand, can it turn itself too directly and intently\ntowards practical applications. All this theory of mental progress from\nthe animate soul to the fullness of religion and science deals solely with\nthe universal process of education: \u201cthe education of humanity\u201d we may\ncall it: the way in which mind is made true and real(46). It is therefore\na question of intricacy and of time how to carry over this general theory\ninto the arena of education as artificially directed and planned. To try\nto do so at a single step would be to repeat the mistake of Plato, if\nPlato may be taken to suppose (which seems incredible) that a theoretical\nstudy of the dialectics of truth and goodness would enable his rulers,\nwithout the training of special experience, to undertake the supreme tasks\nof legislation or administration. All politics, like all education, rests\non these principles of the means and conditions of mental growth: but the\nschooling of concrete life, though it may not develop the faculty of\nformulating general laws, will often train better for the management of\nthe relative than a mere logical Scholastic in first or absolute\nprinciples.\nIn conclusion, there are one or two points which seem of cardinal\nimportance for the progress of psychology. (1) Its difference from the\nphysical sciences has to be set out: in other words, the peculiarity of\npsychical fact. It will not do merely to say that experience marks out\nthese boundaries with sufficient clearness. On the contrary, the terms\nconsciousness, feeling, mind, &c., are evidently to many psychologists\nmere names. In particular, the habits of physical research when introduced\ninto mental study lead to a good deal of what can only be called\nmythology. (2) There should be a clearer recognition of the problem of the\nrelations of mental unity to mental elements. But to get that, a more\nthorough logical and metaphysical preparation is needed than is usually\nsupposed necessary. The doctrine of identity and necessity, of universal\nand individual, has to be faced, however tedious. (3) The distinction\nbetween first-grade and second-grade elements and factors in the mental\nlife has to be realised. The mere idea as presentative or immediate has to\nbe kept clear of the more logico-reflective, or normative ideas, which\nbelong to judgment and reasoning. And the number of these grades in mental\ndevelopment seems endless. (4) But, also, a separation is required\u2014were it\nbut temporary\u2014between what may be called principles, and what is detail.\nAt present, in psychology, \u201cprinciples\u201d is a word almost without meaning.\nA complete all-explaining system is of course impossible at present and\nmay always be so. Yet if an effort of thought could be concentrated on\ncardinal issues, and less padding of conventional and traditional detail\nwere foisted in, much might thereby be done to make detailed research\nfruitful. (5) And finally, perhaps, if psychology be a philosophical\nstudy, some hint as to its purpose and problem would be desirable. If it\nis only an abstract branch of science, of course, no such hint is in\nplace.\nEssay III. On Some Psychological Aspects Of Ethics.\nAllusion has already been made to the question of the boundaries between\nlogic and psychology, between logic and ethics, ethics and psychology, and\npsychology and epistemology. Each of these occasionally comes to cover\nground that seems more appropriate to the others. Logic is sometimes\nrestricted to denote the study of the conditions of derivative knowledge,\nof the canons of inference and the modes of proof. If taken more widely as\nthe science of thought-form, it is supposed to imply a world of fixed or\nstereotyped relations between ideas, a system of stable thoughts governed\nby inflexible laws in an absolute order of immemorial or eternal truth. As\nagainst such fixity, psychology is supposed to deal with these same ideas\nas products\u2014as growing out of a living process of thought\u2014having a history\nbehind them and perhaps a prospect of further change. The genesis so given\nmay be either a mere chronicle-history, or it may be a philosophical\ndevelopment. In the former case, it would note the occasions of incident\nand circumstance, the reactions of mind and environment, under which the\nideas were formed. Such a psychological genesis of several ideas is found\nin the Second Book of Locke\u2019s Essay. In the latter case, the account would\nbe more concerned with the inner movement, the action and reaction in\nideas themselves, considered not as due to casual occurrences, but as\nself-developing by an organic growth. But in either case, ideas would be\nshown not to be ready-made and independently existing kinds in a world of\nidea-things, and not to form an unchanging diagram or framework, but to be\na growth, to have a history, and a development. Psychology in this sense\nwould be a dynamical, as opposed to the supposed statical, treatment of\nideas and concepts in logic. But it may be doubted how far it is well to\ncall this psychology: unless psychology deals with the contents of the\nmental life, in their meaning and purpose, instead of, as seems proper,\nmerely in their character of psychic events. Such psychology is rather an\nevolutionist logic,\u2014a dialectic process more than an analytic of a datum.\nIn the same way, ethics may be brought into one kind of contact with\npsychology. Ethics, like logic, may be supposed to presuppose and to deal\nwith a certain inflexible scheme of requirements, a world of moral order\ngoverned by invariable or universal law; an eternal kingdom of right,\nexisting independently of human wills, but to be learned and followed out\nin uncompromising obedience. As against this supposed absolute order,\npsychology may be said to show the genesis of the idea of obligation and\nduty, the growth of the authority of conscience, the formation of ideals,\nthe relativity of moral ideas. Here also it may reach this conclusion, by\na more external or a more internal mode of argument. It may try to show,\nin other words, that circumstances give rise to these forms of estimating\nconduct, or it may argue that they are a necessary development in the\nhuman being, constituted as he is. It may again be doubted whether this is\nproperly called psychology. Yet its purport seems ultimately to be that\nthe objective order is misconceived when it is regarded as an external or\nquasi-physical order: as a law written up and sanctioned with an external\nauthority\u2014as, in Kant\u2019s words, a heteronomy. If that order is objective,\nit is so because it is also in a sense subjective: if it is above the mere\nindividuality of the individual, it is still in a way identical with his\ntrue or universal self-hood. Thus \u201cpsychological\u201d here means the\nrecognition that the logical and the moral law is an autonomy: that it is\nnot given, but though necessary, necessary by the inward movement of the\nmind. The metaphor of law is, in brief, misleading. For, according to a\ncommon, though probably an erroneous, analysis of that term, the essence\nof a law in the political sphere is to be a species of command. And that\nis rather a one-sidedly practical or aesthetic way of looking at it. The\nessence of law in general, and the precondition of every law in special,\nis rather uniformity and universality, self-consistency and absence of\ncontradiction: or, in other words, rationality. Its essential opposite\u2014or\nits contradiction in essence\u2014is a privilege, an attempt at isolating a\ncase from others. It need not indeed always require bare\nuniformity\u2014require i.e. the same act to be done by different people: but\nit must always require that every thing within its operation shall be\ntreated on principles of utter and thorough harmony and consistency. It\nrequires each thing to be treated on public principles and with publicity:\nnothing apart and mere singular, as a mere incident or as a world by\nitself. Differently it may be treated, but always on grounds of common\nwell-being, as part of an embracing system.\nThere is probably another sense, however, in which psychology comes into\nclose relation with ethics. If we look on man as a microcosm, his inner\nsystem will more or less reproduce the system of the larger world. The\nolder psychology used to distinguish an upper or superior order of\nfaculties from a lower or inferior. Thus in the intellectual sphere, the\nintellect, judgment, and reason were set above the senses, imagination,\nand memory. Among the active powers, reasonable will, practical reason and\nconscience were ranked as paramount over the appetites and desires and\nemotions. And this use of the word \u201cfaculty\u201d is as old as Plato, who\nregards science as a superior faculty to opinion or imagination. But this\napplication\u2014which seems a perfectly legitimate one\u2014does not, in the first\ninstance, belong to psychology at all. No doubt it is psychically\npresented: but it has an other source. It springs from an appreciation, a\njudgment of the comparative truth or reality of what the so-called\npsychical act means or expresses. Such faculties are powers in a hierarchy\nof means and ends and presuppose a normative or critical function which\nhas classified reality. Psychically, the elements which enter into\nknowledge are not other than those which belong to opinion: but they are\nnearer an adequate rendering of reality, they are truer, or nearer the\nIdea. And in the main we may say, that is truer or more real which\nsucceeds in more completely organising and unifying elements\u2014which rises\nmore and more above the selfish or isolated part into the thorough unity\nof all parts.\nThe superior faculty is therefore the more thorough organisation of that\nwhich is elsewhere less harmoniously systematised. Opinion is fragmentary\nand partial: it begins abruptly and casually from the unknown, and runs\noff no less abruptly into the unknown. Knowledge, on the contrary, is\nunified: and its unity gives it its strength and superiority. The powers\nwhich thus exist are the subjective counterparts of objectively valuable\nproducts. Thus, reason is the subjective counterpart of a world in which\nall the constituents are harmonised and fall into due relationship. It is\na product or result, which is not psychologically, but logically or\nmorally important. It is a faculty, because it means that actually its\npossessor has ordered and systematised his life or his ideas of things.\nPsychologically, it, like unreason, is a compound of elements: but in the\ncase of reason the composition is unendingly and infinitely consistent; it\nis knowledge completely unified. The distinction then is not in the\nstrictest sense psychological: for it has an aesthetic or normative\ncharacter; it is logical or ethical: it denotes that the idea or the act\nis an approach to truth or goodness. And so, when Butler or Plato\ndistinguishes reason or reflection from appetites and affections, and even\nfrom self-love or from the heart which loves and hates, this is not\nexactly a psychological division in the narrower sense. That is to say:\nthese are, in Plato\u2019s words, not merely \u201cparts,\u201d but quite as much \u201ckinds\u201d\nand \u201cforms\u201d of soul. They denote degrees in that harmonisation of mind and\nsoul which reproduces the permanent and complete truth of things. For\nexample, self-love, as Butler describes it, has but a partial and narrowed\nview of the worth of acts: it is engrossing and self-involved: it cannot\ntake in the full dependence of the narrower interest on the larger and\neternal self. So, in Plato, the man of heart is but a nature which by fits\nand starts, or with steady but limited vision, realises the larger life.\nThese parts or kinds are not separate and co-existent faculties: but\ngrades in the co-ordination and unification of the same one human nature.\n(i.) Psychology and Epistemology.\nPsychology however in the strict sense is extremely difficult to define.\nThose who describe it as the \u201cscience of mind,\u201d the \u201cphenomenology of\nconsciousness,\u201d seem to give it a wider scope than they really mean. The\npsychologist of the straiter sect tends, on the other hand, to carry us\nbeyond mind and consciousness altogether. His, it has been said, is a\npsychology without a Psych\u00e9. For him Mind, Soul, and Consciousness are\nonly current and convenient names to designate the field, the ground on\nwhich the phenomena he observes are supposed to transact themselves. But\nthey must not on any account interfere with the operations; any more than\nNature in general may interfere with strictly physical inquiries, or Life\nand vital force with the theories of biology. The so-called Mind is only\nto be regarded as a stage on which certain events represent themselves. In\nthis field, or on this stage, there are certain relatively ultimate\nelements, variously called ideas, presentations, feelings, or states of\nconsciousness. But these elements, though called ideas, must not be\nsupposed more than mechanical or dynamical elements; consciousness is\nrather their product, a product which presupposes certain operations and\nrelations between them. If we are to be strictly scientific, we must, it\nis urged, treat the factors of consciousness as not themselves conscious:\nwe must regard them as quasi-objective, or in abstraction from the\nconsciousness which surveys them. The Ego must sink into a mere receptacle\nor arena of psychic event; its independent meaning or purport is to be\nignored, as beside the question.\nWhen this line is once fixed upon, it seems inevitable to go farther.\nComte was inclined to treat psychology as falling between two stools: it\nmust, he thought, draw all its content either from physiology on the one\nhand, or from social factors on the other. The dominant or experimental\npsychology of the present day seems inclined, without however formulating\nany very definite statement, to pronounce for the former alternative. It\ndoes not indeed adopt the materialistic view that mind is only a function\nof matter. Its standpoint rather is that the psychical presents itself\neven to unskilled observation as dependent on (i.e. not independent of) or\nas concomitant with certain physical or corporeal facts. It adds that the\nmore accurately trained the observer becomes, the more he comes to\ndiscover a corporeal aspect even where originally he had not surmised its\nexistence, and to conclude that the two cycles of psychical and physical\nevent never interfere with each other: that soul does not intervene in\nbodily process, nor body take up and carry on psychical. If it is said\nthat the will moves the limbs, he replies that the will which moves is\nreally certain formerly unnoticed movements of nerve and muscle which are\nfelt or interpreted as a discharge of power. If the ocular impression is\nsaid to cause an impression on the mind, he replies that any fact hidden\nunder that phrase refers to a change in the molecules of the brain. He\nwill therefore conclude that for the study of psychical phenomena the\nphysical basis, as it may be called, is all important. Only so can\nobservation really deal with fact capable of description and measurement.\nThus psychology, it may be said, tends to become a department of\nphysiology. From another standpoint, biology may be said to receive its\ncompletion in psychology. How much either phrase means, however, will\ndepend on the estimate we form of biology. If biology is only the study of\nmechanical and chemical phenomena on the peculiar field known as an\norganism, and if that organism is only treated as an environment which may\nbe ignored, then psychology, put on the same level, is not the full\nscience of mind, any more than the other is the full study of life. They\nboth have narrowed their subject to suit the abstract scheme of the\nlaboratory, where the victim of experiment is either altered by mutilation\nand artificial restrictions, or is dead. If, on the contrary, biology has\na substantial unity of its own to which mechanical and chemical\nconsiderations are subordinate and instrumental, psychology may even take\npart with physiology without losing its essential rank. But in that case,\nwe must, as Spinoza said(47), think less mechanically of the animal frame,\nand recognise (after the example of Schelling) something truly inward\n(i.e. not merely locally inside the skin) as the supreme phase or\ncharacteristic of life. We must, in short, recognise sensibility as the\nculmination of the physiological and the beginning of the psychological.\nTo the strictly scientific psychologist, as has been noted\u2014or to the\npsychology which imitates optical and electrical science\u2014ideas are only\npsychical events: they are not ideas _of_ anything, relative, i.e. to\nsomething else; they have no meaning, and no reference to a reality beyond\nthemselves. They are presentations;\u2014not representations of something\noutside consciousness. They are appearances: but not appearances of\nsomething: they do not reveal anything beyond themselves. They are, we may\nalmost say, a unique kind of physical phenomena. If we say they are\npresentations of something, we only mean that in the presented something,\nin the felt something, the wished something, we separate the quality or\nform or aspect of presentativeness, of feltness, of wishedness, and\nconsider this aspect by itself. There are grades, relations,\ncomplications, of such presentations or in such presentedness: and with\nthe description and explanation of these, psychology is concerned. They\nare fainter or stronger, more or less correlated and antithetical.\nPresentation (or ideation), in short, is the name of a train of event,\nwhich has its peculiarities, its laws, its systems, its history.\nAll reality, it may be said, subsists in such presentation; it is for a\nconsciousness, or in a consciousness. All _esse_, in its widest sense, is\n_percipi_. And yet, it seems but the commonest of experiences to say that\nall that is presented is not reality. It _is_, it has a sort of being,\u2014is\nsomehow presumed to exist: but it is not reality. And this reference and\nantithesis to _what_ is presented is implied in all such terms as \u201cideas,\u201d\n\u201cfeelings,\u201d \u201cstates of consciousness\u201d: they are distinguished from and\nrelated to objects of sense or external facts, to something, as it is\ncalled, outside consciousness. Thoughts and ideas are set against things\nand realities. In their primitive stage both the child and the savage seem\nto recognise no such difference. What they imagine is, as we might say, on\nthe same plane with what they touch and feel. They do not, as we\nreproachfully remark, recognise the difference between fact and fiction.\nAll of us indeed are liable to lapses into the same condition. A strong\npassion, a keen hope or fear, as we say, invests its objects with reality:\neven a sanguine moment presents as fact what calmer reflection disallows\nas fancy. With natural and sane intelligences, however, the recrudescence\nof barbarous imagination is soon dispelled, and the difference between\nhallucinations and realities is established. With the utterly wrecked in\nmind, the reality of hallucinations becomes a permanent or habitual state.\nWith the child and the untrained it is a recurrent and a disturbing\ninfluence: and it need hardly be added that the circle of these _decepti\ndeceptores_\u2014people with the \u201clie in the Soul\u201d\u2014is a large one. There thus\nemerges a distinction of vast importance, that of truth and falsehood, of\nreality and unreality, or between representation and reality. There arise\ntwo worlds, the world of ideas, and the world of reality which it is\nsupposed to represent, and, in many cases, to represent badly.\nWith this distinction we are brought across the problem sometimes called\nEpistemological. Strictly speaking, it is really part of a larger problem:\nthe problem of what\u2014if Greek compounds must be used\u2014may be styled\nAletheiology\u2014the theory of truth and reality: what Hegel called Logic, and\nwhat many others have called Metaphysics. As it is ordinarily taken up,\n\u201cideas\u201d are believed to be something _in us_ which is representative or\nsymbolical of something truly real _outside us_. This inward something is\nsaid to be the first and immediate object of knowledge(48), and gives\nus\u2014in a mysterious way we need not here discuss\u2014the mediate knowledge of\nthe reality, which is sometimes said to cause it. Ideas in the Mind, or in\nthe Subject, or in us, bear witness to something outside the\nmind,\u2014trans-subjective\u2014beyond us. The Mind, Subject, or Ego, in this\nparallelism is evidently in some way identified with our corporeal\norganism: perhaps even located, and provided with a \u201cseat,\u201d in some\ndefined space of that organism. It is, however, the starting-point of the\nwhole distinction that ideas _do not_, no less than they do, conform or\ncorrespond to this supra-conscious or extra-conscious world of real\nthings. Truth or falsehood arises, according to these assumptions,\naccording as psychical image or idea corresponds or not to physical fact.\nBut how, unless by some miraculous second-sight, where the supreme\nconsciousness, directly contemplating by intuition the true and\nindependent reality, turns to compare with this immediate vision the\nresults of the mediate processes conducted along the organs of sense,\u2014how\nthis agreement or disagreement of copy and original, of idea and reality,\ncan be detected, it is impossible to say.\nAs has been already noted, the mischief lies in the hypostatisation of\nideas as something existing in abstraction from things\u2014and, of things, in\nabstraction from ideas. They are two abstractions, the first by the\nrealist, the second by the idealist called subjective and psychological.\nTo the realist, things exist by themselves, and they manage to produce a\ncopy of themselves (more or less exact, or symbolical) in _our_ mind, i.e.\nin a materialistically-spiritual or a spiritualistically-material locus\nwhich holds \u201cimages\u201d and ideas. To the psychological idealist, ideas have\na substantive and primary right to existence, them alone do we really\nknow, and from them we more or less legitimately are said (but probably no\none takes this seriously) to infer or postulate a world of permanent\nthings. Now ideas have no substantive existence as a sort of things, or\neven images of things anywhere. All this is pure mythology. It is said by\ncomparative mythologists that in some cases the epithet or quality of some\ndeity has been substantialised (hypostatised) into a separate god, who,\nhowever (so still to keep up the unity), is regarded as a relative, a son,\nor daughter, of the original. So the phrase \u201cideas of things\u201d has been\ntaken literally as if it was double. But to have an idea of a thing merely\nmeans that we know it, or think it. An idea is not given: it is a thing\nwhich is given in the idea. An idea is not an additional and intervening\nobject of our knowledge or supposed knowledge. That a thing is our object\nof thought is another word for its being our idea, and that means we know\nit.\nThe distinction between truth and falsehood, between reality and\nappearance, is not arrived at by comparing what we have before us in our\nmind with some inaccessible reality beyond. It is a distinction that grows\nup with the growth and organisation of our presentations\u2014with their\ngradual systematisation and unification in one consciousness. But this\nconsciousness which thinks, i.e. judges and reasons, is something superior\nto the contrast of physical and psychical: superior, i.e. in so far as it\nincludes and surveys the antithesis, without superseding it. It is the\n\u201ctranscendental unity of consciousness\u201d of Kant\u2014his synthetic unity of\napperception. It means that all ideas ultimately derive their reality from\ntheir coherence with each other in an all-embracing or infinite idea. Real\nin a sense ideas always are, but with an imperfect reality. Thus the\neducation to truth is not\u2014such a thing would be meaningless\u2014ended by a\nrough and ready recommendation to compare our ideas with facts: it must\nteach the art which discovers facts. And the teaching may have to go\nthrough many grades or provinces: in each of which it is possible to\nacquire a certain virtuosoship without being necessarily an adept in\nanother. It is through what is called the development of intellect,\njudgment, and reasoning that the faculty of truth-detecting or\ntruth-selecting comes. And the common feature of all of these is, so to\nsay, their superiority to the psychological mechanism, not in the sense of\nworking without it and directly, but of being the organising unity or\nunifier and controller and judge of that mechanism. The certainty and\nnecessity of truth and knowledge do not come from a constraint from the\nexternal thing which forces the inner idea into submission; they come from\nthe inner necessity of conformity and coherence in the organism of\nexperience. We in fact had better speak of ideas as experience\u2014as felt\nreality: a reality however which has its degrees and perhaps even its\nprovinces. All truth comes with the reasoned judgment, i.e. the\nsyllogism\u2014i.e. with the institution or discovery of relations of fact or\nelement to fact or element, immediate or derivative, partial and less\npartial, up to its ideal coherence in one Idea. It is because this\ncoherence is so imperfectly established in many human beings that their\nknowledge is so indistinguishable from opinion, and that they separate so\nloosely truth from error. They have not worked their way into a definitely\narticulated system, where there are no gaps, no abrupt transitions: their\nmental order is so loosely put together that divergences and\ncontradictions which vex another drop off ineffectual from them.\n(ii.) Kant, Fichte, and Hegel.\nThis was the idealism which Kant taught and Fichte promoted. Of the other\nidealism there are no doubt abundant traces in the language of Kant: and\nthey were greedily fastened on by Schopenhauer. To him the doctrine, that\nthe world is my idea, is adequately represented when it is translated into\nthe phrase that the world is a phantasmagoria of my brain; and escape from\nthe subjective idealism thus initiated is found by him only through a\nsupposed revelation of immediate being communicated in the experience of\nwill. But according to the more consistently interpreted Kant, the problem\nof philosophy consists in laying bare the supreme law or conditions of\nconsciousness on which depend the validity of our knowledge, our estimates\nof conduct, and our aesthetic standards. And these roots of reality are\nfor Kant in the mind\u2014or, should we rather say\u2014in mind\u2014in \u201cConsciousness in\nGeneral.\u201d In the _Criticism of Pure Reason_ the general drift of his\nexamination is to show that the great things or final realities which are\npopularly supposed to stand in self-subsistent being, as ultimate and\nall-comprehensive objects set up for knowledge, are not \u201cthings\u201d as\npopularly supposed, but imperative and inevitable ideas. They are not\nobjects to be known\u2014(these are always finite): but rather the unification,\nthe basis, or condition, and the completion of all knowledge. To know\nthem\u2014in the ordinary petty sense of knowledge\u2014is as absurd and impossible\nas it would be, in the Platonic scheme of reality, to know the idea of\ngood which is \u201con the further side of knowledge and being.\u201d God and the\nSoul\u2014and the same would be true of the World (though modern speculators\nsometimes talk as if they had it at least within their grasp)\u2014are not mere\n_objects_ of knowledge. It would be truer to say they are that by which we\nknow, and they are what in us knows: they make knowledge possible, and\nactual. Kant has sometimes spoken of them as the objects of a faith of\nreason. What he means is that reason only issues in knowledge because of\nand through this inevitable law of reason bidding us go on for ever in our\nsearch, because there can be nothing isolated and nowhere any _ne plus\nultra_ in science, which is infinite and yet only justified as it\npostulates or commands unity.\nKant\u2019s central idea is that truth, beauty, goodness, are not dependent on\nsome qualities of the object, but on the universal nature or law of\nconsciousness. Beauty is not an attribute of things in their abstractness:\nbut of things as ideas of a subject, and depends on the proportion and\nsymmetry in the play of human faculty. Goodness is not conformity to an\noutward law, but is obligatory on us through that higher nature which is\nour truer being. Truth is not conformity of ideas with supposed\ntrans-subjective things, but coherence and stability in the system of\nideas. The really infinite world is not out there, but in here\u2014in\nconsciousness in general, which is the denial of all limitation, of all\nfinality, of all isolation. God is the essential and inherent unity and\nunifier of spirit and nature\u2014the surety that the world in all its\ndifferentiations is one. The Soul is not an essential entity, but the\ninfinite fruitfulness and freshness of mental life, which forbids us\nstopping at anything short of complete continuity and unity. The Kingdom\nof God\u2014the Soul\u2014the moral law\u2014is within us: within us, as supreme,\nsupra-personal and infinite intelligences, even amid all our littleness\nand finitude. Even happiness which we stretch our arms after is not really\nbeyond us, but is the essential self which indeed we can only reach in\ndetail. It is so both in knowledge and in action. Each knowledge and\nenjoyment in reality is limited and partial, but it is made stable, and it\ngets a touch of infinitude, by the larger idea which it helps to realise.\nOnly indeed in that antithesis between the finite and the infinite does\nthe real live. Every piece of knowledge is real, only because it assumes\n_pro tempore_ certain premisses which are given: every actual beauty is\nset in some defect of aesthetic completeness: every actually good deed has\nto get its foil in surrounding badness. The real is always partial and\nincomplete. But it has the basis or condition of its reality in an idea\u2014in\na transcendental unity of consciousness, which is so to say a law, or a\nsystem and an order, which imposes upon it the condition of conformity and\ncoherence; but a conformity which is essential and implicit in it.\nFichte has called his system a _Wissenschaftslehre_\u2014a theory of knowledge.\nModern German used the word _Wissenschaft_, as modern English uses the\nword Science, to denote the certified knowledge of piecemeal fact, the\npartial unification of elements still kept asunder. But by _Wissen_, as\nopposed to _Erkennen_, is meant the I know, am aware and sure, am in\ncontact with reality, as opposed to the derivative and conditional\nreference of something to something else which explains it. The former is\na wider term: it denotes all consciousness of objective truth, the\ncertainty which claims to be necessary and universal, which pledges its\nwhole self for its assertion. Fichte thus unifies and accentuates the\ncommon element in the Kantian criticisms. In the first of these Kant had\nbegun by explaining the nature and limitation of empirical science. It was\nessentially conditioned by the given sensation\u2014dependent i.e. on an\nunexplained and preliminary element. This is what makes it science in the\nstrict or narrow sense of the term: its being set, as it were, in the\nunknown, the felt, the sense-datum. The side of reality is thus the side\nof limitation and of presupposition. But what makes it truth and knowledge\nin general, on the other hand,\u2014as distinct from _a_ truth (i.e. partial\ntruth) and a knowledge,\u2014is the ideal element\u2014the mathematical, the\nlogical, the rational law,\u2014or in one word, the universal and formal\ncharacter. So too every real action is on one hand the product of an\nimpulse, a dark, merely given, immediate tendency to be, and without that\nwould be nothing: but on the other hand it is only an intelligent and\nmoral action in so far as it has its constitution from an intelligence, a\nformal system, which determine its place and function.\nIt is on the latter or ideal element that Kant makes the emphasis\nincreasingly turn. Not truths, duties, beauties, but truth, duty, beauty,\nform his theme. The formal element\u2014the logical or epistemological\ncondition of knowledge and morality and of beauty\u2014is what he (and still\nmore Fichte) considers the prime question of fundamental philosophy. His\nphilosophy is an attempt to get at the organism of our fundamental\nbelief\u2014the construction, from the very base, of our conception of reality,\nof our primary certainty. In technical language, he describes our\nessential nature as a Subject-object. It is the unity of an I am which is\nalso I know that I am: an I will which is also I am conscious of my\nwill(49). Here there is a radical disunion and a supersession of that\ndisunion. Action and contemplation are continually outrunning each other.\nThe I will rests upon one I know, and works up to another: the I know\nreflects upon an I will, and includes it as an element in its idea.\nKant had brought into use the term Deduction, and Fichte follows him. The\nterm leads to some confusion: for in English, by its modern antithesis to\ninduction, it suggests _a priori_ methods in all their iniquity. It means\na kind of jugglery which brings an endless series out of one small term.\nKant has explained that he uses it in the lawyer\u2019s sense in which a claim\nis justified by being traced step by step back to some acknowledged and\naccepted right(50). It is a regressive method which shows us that if the\noriginal datum is to be accepted it carries along with it the legitimation\nof the consequence. This method Fichte applies to psychology. Begin, he\nsays like Condillac, with the barest nucleus of soul-life; the mere\nsentiency, or feeling: the contact, as it were, with being, at a single\npoint. But such a mere point is unthinkable. You find, as Mr. Spencer\nsays, that \u201cThought\u201d (or Consciousness) \u201ccannot be framed out of one term\nonly.\u201d \u201cEvery sensation to be known as one must be perceived.\u201d Such is the\nnature of the Ego\u2014a subject which insists on each part being qualified by\nthe whole and so transformed. As Mr. Spencer, again, puts it, the mind not\nmerely tends to revive, to associate, to assimilate, to represent its own\npresentations, but it carries on this process infinitely and in ever\nhigher multiples. Ideas as it were are growing in complexity by\nre-presenting: i.e. by embracing and enveloping elements which cannot be\nfound existing in separation. In the mind there is no mere presentation,\nno bare sensation. Such a unit is a fiction or hypothesis we employ, like\nthe atom, for purposes of explanation. The pure sensation therefore\u2014which\nyou admit because you must have something to begin with, not a mere\nnothing, but something so simple that it seems to stand out clear and\nindisputable\u2014this pure sensation, when you think of it, forces you to go a\ngood deal further. Even to be itself, it must be more than itself. It is\nlike the pure or mere being of the logicians. Admit the simple\nsensation\u2014and you have admitted everything which is required to make\nsensation a possible reality. But you do not\u2014in the sense of vulgar\nlogic\u2014deduce what follows out of the beginning. From that, taken by\nitself, you will get only itself: mere being will give you only nothing,\nto the end of the chapter. But, as the phrase is, sensation is an element\nin a consciousness: it is, when you think of it, always more than you\ncalled it: there is a curious \u201ccontinuity\u201d about the phenomena, which\nmakes real isolation impossible.\nOf course this \u201cdeduction\u201d is not history: it is logic. It says, if you\nposit sensation, then in doing so, you posit a good deal more. You have\nimagination, reason, and many more, all involved in your original\nassumption. And there is a further point to be noted. You cannot really\nstop even at reason, at intelligence and will, if you take these in the\nfull sense. You must realise that these only exist as part and parcel of a\nreasonable world. An individual intelligence presupposes a society of\nintelligences. The successive steps in this argument are presented by\nFichte in the chief works of his earlier period (1794-98). The works of\nthat period form a kind of trilogy of philosophy, by which the faint\noutlines of the absolute selfhood is shown acquiring definite consistency\nin the moral organisation of society. First comes the \u201cFoundation for the\ncollective philosophy.\u201d It shows how our conception of reality and our\npsychical organisation are inevitably presupposed in the barest function\nof intelligence, in the abstractest forms of logical law. Begin where you\nlike, with the most abstract and formal point of consciousness, you are\nforced, as you dwell upon it (you identifying yourself with the thought\nyou realise), to go step by step on till you accept as a self-consistent\nand self-explanatory unity all that your cognitive and volitional nature\nclaims to own as its birthright. Only in such an intelligent will is\nperception and sensation possible. Next came the \u201cFoundation of Natural\nLaw, on the principles of the general theory.\u201d Here the process of\ndeduction is carried a step further. If man is to realise himself as an\nintelligence with an inherent bent to action, then he must be conceived as\na person among persons, as possessed of rights, as incapable of acting\nwithout at the same moment claiming for his acts recognition, generality,\nand logical consecution. The reference, which in the conception of a\npractical intelligence was implicit,\u2014the reference to fellow-agents, to a\nworld in which law rules\u2014is thus, by the explicit recognition of these\nreferences, made a fact patent and positive\u2014_gesetzt_,\u2014expressly\ninstituted in the way that the nature and condition of things postulates.\nBut this is not all: we step from the formal and absolute into the\nmaterial and relative. If man is to be a real intelligence, he must be an\nintelligence served by organs. \u201cThe rational being cannot realise its\nefficient individuality, unless it ascribes to itself a material body\u201d: a\nbody, moreover, in which Fichte believes he can show that the details of\nstructure and organs are equally with the general corporeity predetermined\nby reason(51). In the same way it is shown that the social and political\norganisation is required for the realisation\u2014the making positive and yet\ncoherent\u2014of the rights of all individuals. You deduce society by showing\nit is required to make a genuine individual man. Thirdly came the \u201cSystem\nof Ethics.\u201d Here it is further argued that, at least in a certain\nrespect(52), in spite of my absolute reason and my absolute freedom, I can\nonly be fully real as a part of Nature: that my reason is realised in a\ncreature of appetite and impulse. From first to last this deduction is one\nprocess which may be said to have for its object to determine \u201cthe\nconditions of self-hood or egoity.\u201d It is the deduction of the concrete\nand empirical moral agent\u2014the actual ego of actual life\u2014from the abstract,\nunconditioned ego, which in order to be actual must condescend to be at\nonce determining and determined.\nIn all of this Fichte makes\u2014especially formally\u2014a decided advance upon\nKant. In Ethics Kant in particular, (\u2014especially for readers who never got\nbeyond the beginning of his moral treatise and were overpowered by the\ncategorical imperative of duty) had found the moral initiative or dynamic\napparently in the other world. The voice of duty seemed to speak from a\nregion outside and beyond the individual conscience. In a sense it must do\nso: but it comes from a consciousness which is, and yet is more than, the\nindividual. It is indeed true that appearances here are deceptive: and\nthat the idea of autonomy, the self-legislation of reason, is trying to\nbecome the central conception of Kant\u2019s Ethics. Still it is Fichte\u2019s merit\nto have seen this clearly, to have held it in view unfalteringly, and to\nhave carried it out in undeviating system or deduction. Man, intelligent,\nsocial, ethical, is a being all of one piece and to be explained entirely\nimmanently, or from himself. Law and ethics are no accident either to\nsense or to intelligence\u2014nothing imposed by mere external or supernal\nauthority(53). Society is not a brand-new order of things supervening upon\nand superseding a state of nature, where the individual was entirely\nself-supporting. Morals, law, society, are all necessary steps (necessary\ni.e. in logic, and hence in the long run also inevitable in course of\ntime) to complete the full evolution or realisation of a human being. The\nsame conditions as make man intelligent make him social and moral. He does\nnot proceed so far as to become intelligent and practical, under terms of\nnatural and logical development, then to fall into the hands of a foreign\ninfluence, an accident _ab extra_, which causes him to become social and\nmoral. Rather he is intelligent, because he is a social agent.\nHence, in Fichte, the absence of the ascetic element so often stamping its\ncharacter on ethics, and representing the moral life as the enemy of the\nnatural, or as mainly a struggle to subdue the sensibility and the flesh.\nWith Kant,\u2014as becomes his position of mere inquirer\u2014the sensibility has\nthe place of a predominant and permanent foreground. Reason, to his way of\ntalking, is always something of an intruder, a stranger from a far-off\nworld, to be feared even when obeyed: sublime, rather than beautiful. From\nthe land of sense which we habitually occupy, the land of reason is a\ncountry we can only behold from afar: or if we can be said to have a\nstandpoint in it, that is only a figurative way of saying that though it\nis really over the border, we can act\u2014it would sometimes seem by a sort of\nmake-believe\u2014as if we were already there. But these moments of high\nenthusiasm are rare; and Kant commends sobriety and warns against\nhigh-minded _Schw\u00e4rmerei_, or over-strained Mysticism. For us it is\nreserved to struggle with a recalcitrant selfhood, a grovelling\nsensibility: it were only fantastic extravagance, fit for \u201cfair souls\u201d who\nunfortunately often lapse into \u201cfair sinners,\u201d should we fancy ourselves\nalready anchored in the haven of untempted rest and peace.\nWhen we come to Fichte, we find another spirit breathing. We have passed\nfrom the age of Frederick the Great to the age of the French Revolution;\nand the breeze that burst in the War of Liberation is already beginning to\nfreshen the air. Boldly he pronounces the primacy of that faith of reason\nwhereby not merely the just but all shall live. Your will shall show you\nwhat you really are. You are essentially a rational will, or a\nwill-reason. Your sensuous nature, of impulse and appetite, far from being\nthe given and found obstacle to the realisation of reason,\u2014which Kant\nstrictly interpreted might sometimes seem to imply\u2014(and in this point\nSchopenhauer carries out the implications of Kant)\u2014is really the condition\nor mode of being which reason assumes, or rises up to, in order to be a\npractical or moral being. Far from the body and the sensible needs being a\nstumbling-block to hamper the free fullness of rationality and morality,\nthe truth rather is that it is only by body and sense, by flesh and blood,\nthat the full moral and rational life can be realised(54). Or, to put it\notherwise, if human reason (intelligence and will) is to be more than a\nmere and empty inner possibility, if man is to be a real and concrete\ncognitive and volitional being, he must be a member of an ethical and\nactual society, which lives by bread, and which marries and has children.\n(iii.) Psychology in Ethics.\nIn this way, for Fichte, and through Fichte still more decidedly for\nHegel, both psychology and ethics breathe an opener and ampler air than\nthey often enjoy. Psychology ceases to be a mere description of psychic\nevents, and becomes the history of the self-organising process of human\nreason. Ethics loses its cloistered, negative, unnatural aspect, and\nbecomes a name for some further conditions of the same development,\nessentially postulated to complete or supplement its shortcomings.\nPsychology\u2014taken in this high philosophical acceptation\u2014thus leads on to\nEthics; and Ethics is parted by no impassable line from Psychology. That,\nat least, is what must happen if they are still to retain a place in\nphilosophy: for, as Kant says(55), \u201cunder the government of reason our\ncognitions cannot form a rhapsody, but must constitute a system, in which\nalone can they support and further its essential aims.\u201d As parts of such a\nsystem, they carry out their special work in subordination to, and in the\nrealisation of, a single Idea\u2014and therefore in essential interconnexion.\nFrom that interconnecting band we may however in detail-enquiry dispense\nourselves; and then we have the empirical or inductive sciences of\npsychology and ethics. But even with these, the necessity of the situation\nis such that it is only a question of degree how far we lose sight of the\nphilosophical horizon, and entrench ourselves in special enquiry.\nSomething of the philosophic largeness must always guide us; even when, to\nfurther the interests of the whole, it is necessary for the special\nenquirer to bury himself entirely in his part. So long as each part is\nsincerely and thoroughly pursued, and no part is neglected, there is an\nindwelling reason in the parts which will in the long run tend to\nconstitute the total.\nA philosophical psychology will show us how the sane intelligence and the\nrational will are, at least approximately, built up out of elements, and\nthrough stages and processes, which modify and complement, as they may\nalso arrest and perplex, each other. The unity, coherence, and\ncompleteness of the intelligent self is not, as vulgar irreflectiveness\nsupposes and somewhat angrily maintains, a full-grown thing or agent, of\nwhose actions and modes of behaviour the psychologist has to narrate the\nhistory,\u2014a history which is too apt to degenerate into the anecdotal and\nthe merely interesting. This unity of self has to be \u201cdeduced,\u201d as Fichte\nwould say: it has to be shown as the necessary result which certain\nelements in a certain order will lead to(56). A normal mind,\nself-possessed, developed and articulated, yet thoroughly one, a real\nmicrocosm, or true and full monad, which under the mode of its\nindividuality still represents the universe: that is, what psychology has\nto show as the product of factors and processes. And it is clearly\nsomething great and good, something valuable, and already possessing, by\nimplication we may say, an ethical character.\nIn philosophy, at least, it is difficult, or rather impossible to draw a\nhard and fast line which shall demarcate ethical from non-ethical\ncharacters,\u2014to separate them from other intellectual and reasonable\nmotives. Kant, as we know, attempted to do so: but with the result that he\nwas forced to add a doubt whether a purely moral act could ever be said to\nexist(57); or rather to express the certainty that if it did it was for\never inaccessible to observation. All such designations of the several\n\u201cfactors\u201d or \u201cmoments\u201d in reality, as has been hinted, are only _a\npotiori_. But they are misused when it is supposed that they connote\nabrupt and total discontinuity. And Kant, after all, only repeated in his\nown terminology an old and inveterate habit of thought:\u2014the habit which in\nStoicism seemed to see sage and foolish utterly separated, and which in\nthe straiter sects of Christendom fenced off saint absolutely from sinner.\nIt is a habit to which Hegel, and even his immediate predecessors, are\nradically opposed. With Herder, he might say, \u201cEthics is only a higher\nphysics of the mind(58).\u201d This\u2014the truth in Spinozism\u2014no doubt demands\nsome emphasis on the word \u201chigher\u201d: and it requires us to read ethics (or\nsomething like it) into physics; but it is a step on the right road,\u2014the\nstep which Utilitarianism and Evolutionism had (however awkwardly) got\ntheir foot upon, and which \u201ctranscendent\u201d ethics seems unduly afraid of\ncommitting itself to. Let us say, if we like, that the mind is more than\nmere nature, and that it is no proper object of a merely natural science.\nBut let us remember that a merely natural science is only a fragment of\nscience: let us add that the _merely_ natural is an abstraction which in\npart denaturalises and mutilates the larger nature\u2014a nature which includes\nthe natural mind, and cannot altogether exclude the ethical.\nWhat have been called \u201cformal duties(59)\u201d seem to fall under this\nrange\u2014the province of a philosophical psychology which unveils the\nconditions of personality. Under that heading may be put self-control,\nconsistency, resolution, energy, forethought, prudence, and the like. The\ndue proportion of faculty, the correspondence of head and heart, the\nvivacity and quickness of sympathy, the ease and simplicity of mental\ntone, the due vigour of memory and the grace of imagination, sweetness of\ntemper, and the like, are parts of the same group(60). They are lovely,\nand of good report: they are praise and virtue. If it be urged that they\nare only natural gifts and graces, that objection cuts two ways. The\nobjector may of course be reminded that religion tones down the\nself-complacency of morality. Yet, first, even apart from that, it may be\nsaid that of virtues, which stand independent of natural conditions\u2014of\nexternal supply of means (as Aristotle would say)\u2014nothing can be known and\nnothing need be said. And secondly, none of these qualities are mere\ngifts;\u2014all require exercise, habituation, energising, to get and keep\nthem. How much and how little in each case is nature\u2019s and how much ours\nis a problem which has some personal interest\u2014due perhaps to a rather\nselfish and envious curiosity. But on the broad field of experience and\nhistory we may perhaps accept the\u2014apparently one-sided\u2014proverb that \u201cEach\nman is the architect of his own fortune.\u201d Be this as it may, it will not\ndo to deny the ethical character of these \u201cformal duties\u201d on the ground\ne.g. that self-control, prudence, and even sweetness of temper may be used\nfor evil ends,\u2014that one may smile and smile, and yet be a villain.\nThat\u2014let us reply,\u2014on one hand, is a fault (if fault it be) incidental to\nall virtues in detail (for every single quality has its defect): nay it\nmay be a limitation attaching to the whole ethical sphere: and, secondly,\nits inevitable limitation does not render the virtue in any case one whit\nless genuine so far as it goes. And yet of such virtues it may be said, as\nHume(61) would say (who calls them \u201cnatural,\u201d as opposed to the more\nartificial merits of justice and its kin), that they please in themselves,\nor in the mere contemplation, and without any regard to their social\neffects. But they please as entering into our idea of complete human\nnature, of mind and spirit as will and intellect.\nThe moralists of last century sometimes divided the field of ethics by\nassigning to man three grades or kinds of duty: duties to himself, duties\nto society, and duties to God. For the distinction there is a good deal to\nbe said: there are also faults to be found with it. It may be said,\namongst other things, that to speak of duties to self is a metaphorical\nway of talking, and that God lies out of the range of human duty\naltogether, except in so far as religious service forms a part of social\nobligation. It may be urged that man is essentially a social being, and\nthat it is only in his relations to other such beings that his morality\ncan find a sphere. The sphere of morality, according to Dr. Bain, embraces\nwhatever \u201csociety has seen fit to enforce with all the rigour of positive\ninflictions. Positive good deeds and self-sacrifice ... transcend the\nregion of morality proper and occupy a sphere of their own(62).\u201d And there\nis little doubt that this restriction is in accordance with a main current\nof usage. It may even be said that there are tendencies towards a narrower\nusage still, which would restrict the term to questions affecting the\nrelations of the sexes. But, without going so far, we may accept the\nstandpoint which finds in the phrase \u201cpopular or social\u201d sanction, as\nequivalent to the moral sanction, a description of the average level of\ncommon opinion on the topic. The morality of an age or country thus\ndenotes, first, the average requirement in act and behaviour imposed by\ngeneral consent on the members of a community, and secondly, the average\nperformance of the members in response to these requirements. Generally\nspeaking the two will be pretty much the same. If the society is in a\nstate of equilibrium, there will be a palpable agreement between what all\nseverally expect and what all severally perform. On the other hand, as no\nsociety is ever in complete equilibrium, this harmony will never be\nperfect and may often be widely departed from. In what is called a single\ncommunity, if it reach a considerable bulk, there are (in other words)\noften a number of minor societies, more or less thwarting and modifying\neach other; and different observers, who belong in the main to one or\nother of these subordinate groups, may elicit from the facts before them a\nsomewhat different social code, and a different grade of social\nobservance. Still, with whatever diversity of detail, the important\nfeature of such social ethics is that the stress is laid on the\nperformance of certain acts, in accordance with the organisation of\nsociety. So long as the required compliance is given, public opinion is\nsatisfied, and morality has got its due.\nBut in two directions this conception of morality needs to be\nsupplementing. There is, on one hand, what is called duty to God. The\nphrase is not altogether appropriate: for it follows too closely the\nanalogy of social requirement, and treats Deity as an additional and\nsocial authority,\u2014a lord paramount over merely human sovereigns. But\nthough there may be some use in the analogy, to press the conception is\nseriously to narrow the divine character and the scope of religion. As in\nsimilar cases, we cannot change one term without altering its correlative.\nAnd therefore to describe our relation to God under the name of duty is to\nnarrow and falsify that relation. The word is no longer applicable in this\nconnexion without a strain, and where it exists it indicates the survival\nof a conception of theocracy: of God regarded as a glorification of the\nmagistrate, as king of kings and lord of lords. It is the social world\u2014and\nindeed we may say the outside of the social world\u2014that is the sphere of\nduties. Duty is still with these reductions a great august name: but in\nliteral strictness it only rules over the medial sphere of life, the\nsphere which lies between the individual as such and his universal\nhumanity(63). Beyond duty, lies the sphere of conscience and of religion.\nAnd that is not the mere insistence by the individual to have a voice and\na vote in determining the social order. It is the sense that the social\norder, however omnipotent it may seem, is limited and finite, and that man\nhas in him a kindred with the Eternal.\nIt is not very satisfactory, either, as Aristotle and others have pointed\nout, to speak of man\u2019s duties to himself. The phrase is analogical, like\nthe other. But it has the merit, like that of duty to God, of reminding us\nthat the ordinary latitude occupied by morality is not all that comes\nunder the larger scope of ethics. The \u201cethics of individual life\u201d is a\nsubject which Mr. Spencer has touched upon: and by this title, he means\nthat, besides his general relationship to others, a human being has to\nmind his own health, food, and amusement, and has duties as husband and\nparent. But, after all, these are not matters of peculiarly individual\ninterest. They rather refer to points which society at certain epochs\nleaves to the common sense of the agent,\u2014apparently on an assumption that\nhe is the person chiefly interested. And these points\u2014as the Greeks taught\nlong ago\u2014are of fundamental importance: they are the very bases of life.\nYet the comparative neglect in which so-called civilised societies(64)\nhold the precepts of wisdom in relation to bodily health and vigour, in\nregard to marriage and progeny, serve to illustrate the doctrine of the\nancient Stoics that \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2, or the modern idealist utterance that\nthe World is my idea. More and more as civilisation succeeds in its\ndisruption of man from nature, it shows him governed not by bare facts and\nisolated experiences, but by the systematic idea under which all things\nare subsumed. He loses the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the natural man, which takes each\nfact as it came, all alike good: he becomes sentimental, and artificial,\nsees things under a conventional point of view, and would rather die than\nnot be in the fashion. And this tendency is apparently irresistible. Yet\nthe mistake lies in the one-sidedness of sentiment and convention. Not the\ndomination of the idea is evil; but the domination of a partial and\nfragmentary idea: and this is what constitutes the evil of artificiality.\nAnd the correction must lie not in a return to nature, but in the\nreconstruction of a wider and more comprehensive idea: an idea which shall\nbe the unity and system of all nature; not a fantastic idealism, but an\nattempt to do justice to the more realist as well as the idealist sides of\nlife.\nThere is however another side of individualist ethics which needs even\nmore especial enforcement. It is the formation of\n\u201cThe reason firm, the temperate will,\nEndurance, foresight, strength and skill:\u201d\nthe healthy mind in a healthy body. Ethics is only too apt to suppose that\nwill and intelligence are assumptions which need no special justification.\nBut the truth is that they vary from individual to individual in degree\nand structure. It is the business of ethical psychology to give to these\nvague attributions the definiteness of a normal standard: to show what\nproportions are required to justify the proper title of reason and will\u2014to\nshow what reason and will really are if they do what they are encouraged\nor expected to do. It talks of the diseases of will and personality: it\nmust also set forth their educational ideal. The first problem of Ethics,\nit may be said, is the question of the will and its freedom. But to say\nthis is of course not to say that, unless freedom of will be understood in\nsome special sense, ethics becomes impossible. If the moral law is the\n_ratio cognoscendi_ of freedom, then must our conception of morality and\nof freedom hang together. And it will clearly be indispensable to begin by\nsome attempt to discover in what sense man may be in the most general way\ndescribed as a moral agent\u2014as an intelligent will, or (more briefly, yet\nsynonymously) as a will. \u201cThe soil of law and morality,\u201d says Hegel(65),\n\u201cis the intelligent life: and its more precise place and starting-point\nthe will, which is free, in the sense that freedom is its substance and\ncharacteristic, and the system of law the realm of freedom realised, the\nworld of intelligence produced out of itself as a second nature.\u201d Such a\nfreedom is a freedom made and acquired, the work of the mind\u2019s\nself-realisation, not to be taken as a given fact of consciousness which\nmust be believed(66). To have a will\u2014in other words, to have freedom, is\nthe consummation\u2014and let us add, only the formal or ideal consummation\u2014of\na process by which man raises himself out of his absorption in sensation\nand impulse, establishes within himself a mental realm, an organism of\nideas, a self-consciousness, and a self.\nThe vulgar apprehension of these things seems to assume that we have by\nnature, or are born with, a general faculty or set of general faculties,\nwhich we subsequently fill up and embody by the aid of experience. We\npossess\u2014they seem to imply\u2014so many \u201cforms\u201d and \u201ccategories\u201d latent in our\nminds ready to hold and contain the raw materials supplied from without.\nAccording to this view we have all a will and an intelligence: the\ndifference only is that some put more into them, and some put less. But\nsuch a separation of the general form from its contents is a piece of pure\nmythology. It is perhaps true and safe to say that the human being is of\nsuch a character that will and intelligence are in the ordinary course\ninevitably produced. But the forms which grow up are the more and more\ndefinite and systematic organisation of a graded experience, of series of\nideas, working themselves up again and again in representative and\nre-representative degree, till they constitute a mental or inner world of\ntheir own. The will is thus the title appropriate to the final stage of a\nprocess, by which sensation and impulse have polished and perfected\nthemselves by union and opposition, by differentiation and accompanying\nredintegration, till they assume characters quite unsurmised in their\nearliest aspects, and yet only the consolidation or self-realisation of\nimplications. Thus the mental faculties are essentially acquired\npowers,\u2014acquired not from without, but by action which generates the\nfaculties it seems to imply. The process of mind is a process which\ncreates individual centres, raises them to completer independence;\u2014which\nproduces an inner life more and more self-centered and also more and more\nequal to the universe which it has embodied. And will and intelligence are\nan important stage in that process.\nHerbart (as was briefly hinted at in the first essay) has analysed ethical\nappreciation (which may or may not be accompanied by approbation) into\nfive distinct standard ideas. These are the ideas of inward liberty, of\nperfection, of right, benevolence, and equity. Like Hume, he regards the\nmoral judgment as in its purity a kind of aesthetic pronouncement on the\nagreement or proportion of certain activities in relations to each other.\nTwo of these standard ideas,\u2014that of inward liberty and of perfection\u2014seem\nto belong to the sphere at present under review. They emerge as conditions\ndetermining the normal development of human nature to an intelligent and\nmatured personality. By inward freedom Herbart means the harmony between\nthe will and the intellect: what Aristotle has named \u201cpractical truth or\nreality,\u201d and what he describes in his conception of wisdom or moral\nintelligence,\u2014the power of discerning the right path and of pursuing it\nwith will and temper: the unity, clear but indissoluble, of will and\ndiscernment. By the idea of perfection Herbart means the sense of\nproportion and of propriety which is awakened by comparing a progress in\ndevelopment or an increase in strength with its earlier stages of promise\nand imperfection. The pleasure such perception affords works in two ways:\nit is a satisfaction in achievement past, and a stimulus to achievement\nyet to come.\nSuch ideas of inward liberty and of growth in ability or in performance\ngovern (at least in part) our judgment of the individual, and have an\nethical significance. Indeed, if the cardinal feature of the ethical\nsentiment be the inwardness and independence of its approbation and\nobligation, these ideas lie at the root of all true morality. Inward\nharmony and inward progress, lucidity of conscience and the resolution\nwhich knows no finality of effort, are the very essence of moral life.\nYet, if ethics is to include in the first instance social relationships\nand external utilities and sanctions, these conditions of true life must\nrather be described as pre-ethical. The truth seems to be that here we get\nto a range of ethics which is far wider than what is ordinarily called\npractice and conduct. At this stage logic, aesthetic, and ethic, are yet\none: the true, the good, and the beautiful are still held in their\nfundamental unity. An ethics of wide principle precedes its narrower\nsocial application; and whereas in ordinary usage the social provinciality\nis allowed to prevail, here the higher ethics emerge clear and imperial\nabove the limitations of local and temporal duty.\nAnd though it is easy to step into exaggeration, it is still well to\nemphasise this larger conception of ethics. The moral principle of the\n\u201cmaximising of life,\u201d as it has been called(67), may be open to\nmisconception (\u2014so, unfortunately are all moral principles when stated in\nthe effrontery of isolation): but it has its truth in the conviction that\nall moral evil is marked by a tendency to lower or lessen the total\nvitality. So too Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s maxim, _Sei vornehm_(68), ensue\ndistinction, and above all things be not common or vulgar (_gemein_), will\neasily lend itself to distortion. But it is good advice for all that, even\nthough it may be difficult to define in a general formula wherein\ndistinction consists, to mark the boundary between self-respect and vanity\nor obstinacy, or to say wherein lies the beauty and dignity of human\nnature. Kant has laid it down as the principle of duty to ask ourselves if\nin our act we are prepared to universalise the maxim implied by our\nconduct. And that this\u2014which essentially bids us look at an act in the\nwhole of its relations and context\u2014is a safeguard against some forms of\nmoral evil, is certain. But there is an opposite\u2014or rather an apparently\nopposite\u2014principle which bids us be individual, be true to our own selves,\nand never allow ourselves to be dismayed from our own unique\nresponsibility. Perhaps the two principles are not so far apart as they\nseem. In any case true individuality is the last word and the first word\nin ethics; though, it may be added, there is a good deal to be said\nbetween the two termini.\n(iv.) An Excursus on Greek Ethics.\nIt is in these regions that Greek ethics loves to linger; on the duty of\nthe individual to himself, to be perfectly lucid and true, and to rise to\never higher heights of achievement. _Ceteris paribus_, there is felt to be\nsomething meritorious in superiority, something good:\u2014even were it that\nyou are master, and another is slave. Thus na\u00efvely speaks Aristotle(69).\nTo a modern, set amid so many conflicting ideals, perhaps, the immense\npossibilities of yet further growth might suggest themselves with\noverpowering force. To him the idea of perfection takes the form of an\nidea of perfectibility: and sometimes it smites down his conceit in what\nhe has actually done, and impresses a sense of humility in comparison with\nwhat yet remains unaccomplished. An ancient Greek apparently was little\nhaunted by these vistas of possibilities of progress through worlds beyond\nworlds. A comparatively simple environment, a fixed and definite mental\nhorizon, had its plain and definite standards, or at least seemed to have\nsuch. There were fewer cases of the man, unattached or faintly attached to\nany definite profession\u2014moving about in worlds half realised\u2014who has grown\nso common in a more developed civilisation. The ideals of the Greek were\nclearly descried: each man had his definite function or work to perform:\nand to do it better than the average, or than he himself habitually had\ndone, that was perfection, excellence, virtue. For virtue to the Greek is\nessentially ability and respectability: promise of excellent performance:\ncapacity to do better than others. Virtue is praiseworthy or meritorious\ncharacter and quality: it is achievement at a higher rate, as set against\none\u2019s past and against others\u2019 average.\nThe Greek moralists sometimes distinguish and sometimes combine moral\nvirtue and wisdom, \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae and \u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2: capacity to perform, and wisdom to\nguide that capacity. To the ordinary Greek perhaps the emphasis fell on\nthe former, on the attainment of all recognised good quality which became\na man, all that was beautiful and honourable, all that was appropriate,\nglorious, and fame-giving; and that not for any special reference to its\nutilitarian qualities. Useful, of course, such qualities were: but that\nwas not in question at the time. In the more liberal commonwealths of\nancient Greece there was little or no anxious care to control the\neducation of its citizens, so as to get direct service, overt contribution\nto the public good. A suspicious Spartan legislation might claim to do\nthat. But in the free air of Athens all that was required was loyalty,\ngood-will\u2014\u03b5\u1f54\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u2014to the common weal; it might be even a sentiment of human\nkindliness, of fraternity of spirit and purpose. Everything beyond and\nupon that basis was left to free development. Let each carry out to the\nfull the development of his powers in the line which national estimation\npoints out. He is\u2014nature and history alike emphasise that fact beyond the\nreach of doubt, for all except the outlaw and the casual stranger\u2014a member\nof a community, and as such has a governing instinct and ideal which\nanimates him. But he is also a self-centered individual, with special\nendowments of nature, in his own person and in the material objects which\nare his. A purely individualist or selfish use of them is not\u2014to the\nnormal Greek\u2014even dreamed of. He is too deeply rooted in the substance of\nhis community for that: or it is on the ground and in the atmosphere of an\nassured community that his individuality is to be made to flourish. Nature\nhas secured that his individuality shall rest securely in the\npresupposition of his citizenship. It seems, therefore, as if he were left\nfree and independent in his personal search for perfection, for\ndistinction. His place is fixed for him: _Spartam nactus es; hanc orna_:\nhis duty is his virtue. That duty, as Plato expresses it, is to do his own\ndeeds\u2014and not meddle with others. Nature and history have arranged that\nothers, in other posts, shall do theirs: that all severally shall energise\ntheir function. The very word \u201cduty\u201d seems out of place; if, at least,\nduty suggests external obligation, an order imposed and a debt to be\ndischarged. If there be a task-master and a creditor, it is the inflexible\norder of nature and history:\u2014or, to be more accurate, of nature, the\nindwelling and permanent reality of things. But the obligation to follow\nnature is scarcely felt as a yoke of constraint. A man\u2019s virtue is to\nperform his work and to perform it well: to do what he is specially\ncapable of doing, and therefore specially charged to do.\nNowhere has this character of Greek ethics received more classical\nexpression than in the Republic of Plato. In the prelude to his\nsubject\u2014which is the nature of Right and Morality\u2014Plato has touched\nbriefly on certain popular and inadequate views. There is the view that\nRight has its province in performance of certain single and external\nacts\u2014in business honesty and commercial straightforwardness. There is the\nview that it is rendering to each what is due to him; that it consists in\nthe proper reciprocity of services, in the balance of social give and\ntake. There is the critical or hyper-critical view which, from seeing so\nmuch that is called justice to be in harmony with the interest of the\npredominant social order, bluntly identifies mere force or strength as the\nground of right. And there are views which regard it as due to social\nconventions and artifices, to the influence of education, to political\narrangements and the operation of irrational prejudices. To all these\nviews Plato objects: not because they are false\u2014for they are all in part,\noften in large part, true\u2014but because they are inadequate and do not go to\nthe root of the matter. The foundations of right lie, he says, not in\nexternal act, but in the inner man: not in convention, but in nature: not\nin relation to others, but in the constitution of the soul itself. That\nethical idea\u2014the idea of right\u2014which seems most obviously to have its\ncentre outside the individual, to live and grow only in the relations\nbetween individuals, Plato selects in order to show the independent\nroyalty of the single human soul. The world, as Hume afterwards, called\njustice artificial: Plato will prove it natural. In a way he joins company\nwith those who bid us drive out the spectre of duty, of obligation coming\nupon the soul from social authority, from traditional idea, from religious\nsanctions. He preaches\u2014or he is about to preach\u2014the autonomy of the will.\nThe four cardinal virtues of Plato\u2019s list are the qualities which go to\nmake a healthy, normal, natural human soul, fit for all activity, equipped\nwith all arms for the battle of life. They tell us what such a soul is,\nnot what it does. They are the qualities which unless a soul has, and has\nthem each perfect, yet all co-operant, its mere outward and single acts\nhave no virtue or merit, but are only lucky accidents at the best. On the\nother hand, if a man has these constitutive qualities, he will act in the\nsocial world, and act well. Plato has said scornful things of mere outward\nand verbal truthfulness, and has set at the very lowest pitch of\ndegradation the \u201clie in the soul.\u201d His \u201ctemperance\u201d or \u201cself-restraint,\u201d\nif it be far from breathing any suggestion of self-suppression or\nself-assertion, is still farther from any suspicion of asceticism, or war\nagainst the flesh. It is the noble harmony of the ruling and the ruled,\nwhich makes the latter a partner of the sovereign, and takes from the\ndictates of the ruler any touch of coercion. It is literally sanity of\nsoul, integrity and purity of spirit; it is what has been sometimes called\nthe beautiful soul\u2014the indiscerptible unity of reason and impulse. Plato\u2019s\nbravery, again, is fortitude and consistency of soul, the full-blooded\nheart which is fixed in reason, the zeal which is according to knowledge,\nunflinching loyalty to the idea, the spirit which burns in the martyrs to\ntruth and humanity: yet withal with gentleness and courtesy and noble\nurbanity in its immediate train. And his truthfulness is that inner\nlucidity which cannot be self-deceived, the spirit which is a safeguard\nagainst fanaticism and hypocrisy, the sunlike warmth of intelligence\nwithout which the heart is a darkness full of unclean things.\nThe full development and crowning grace of such a manly nature Aristotle\nhas tried to present in the character of the Great-souled man\u2014him whom\nPlato has called the true king by divine right, or the autocrat by the\npatent of nature. Like all such attempts to delineate a type in the terms\nnecessarily single and successive of abstract analysis, it tends\noccasionally to run into caricature, and to give partial aspects an absurd\nprominency. Only the greatest of artists could cope with such a task,\nthough that artist may be found perhaps classed among the historians. Yet\nit is possible to form some conception of the ideal which Aristotle would\nset before us. The Great-souled man _is_ great, and he dare not deny the\nwitness of his spirit. He is one who does not quail before the anger and\nseek the applause of popular opinion: he holds his head as his own, and as\nhigh as his undimmed self-consciousness shows it is worth. There has been\nsaid to him by the reason within him the word that Virgil erewhile\naddressed to Dante:\n\u201cLibero, dritto, e sano \u00e8 il tuo arbitrio\nE fallo fora non fare a suo cenno;\nPer ch\u2019 io te sopra te corono e mitrio.\u201d\nHe is his own Emperor and his own Pope. He is the perfected man, in whom\nis no darkness, whose soul is utter clearness, and complete harmony. Calm\nin self-possessed majesty, he stands, if need be, _contra mundum_: but\nrather, with the world beneath his feet. The chatter of personality has no\ninterest for him. Bent upon the best, lesser competitions for distinction\nhave no attraction for him. To the vulgar he will seem cold,\nself-confined: in his apartness and distinction they will see the signs of\na \u201cprig.\u201d His look will be that of one who pities men\u2014rather than loves\nthem: and should he speak ill of a foe, it is rather out of pride of heart\nand unbroken spirit than because these things touch him. Such an one, in\nmany ways, was the Florentine poet himself.\nIf the Greek world in general thus conceived \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae as the full bloom of\nmanly excellence (we all know how slightly\u2014witness the remarks in the\nPericlean oration\u2014Greeks, in their public and official utterances, rated\nwomanliness), the philosophers had a further point to emphasise. That was\nwhat they variously called knowledge, prudence, reason, insight,\nintelligence, wisdom, truth. From Socrates to Aristotle, from Aristotle to\nthe Stoics and Epicureans, and from the Stoics to the Neo-Platonists, this\nis the common theme: the supremacy of knowledge, its central and essential\nrelation to virtue. They may differ\u2014perhaps not so widely as current\nprejudice would suppose\u2014as to how this knowledge is to be defined, what\nkind of knowledge it is, how acquired and maintained, and so on. But in\nessentials they are at one. None of them, of course, mean that in order to\nright conduct nothing more is needed than to learn and remember what is\nright, the precepts and commandments of ordinary morality. Memory is not\nknowledge, especially when it is out of mind. Even an ancient philosopher\nwas not wholly devoid of common sense. They held\u2014what they supposed was a\nfact of observation and reflection\u2014that all action was prompted by\nfeelings of the values of things, by a desire of something good or\npleasing to self, and aimed at self-satisfaction and self-realisation, but\nthat there was great mistake in what thus afforded satisfaction. People\nchose to act wrongly or erroneously, because they were, first, mistaken\nabout themselves and what they wanted, and, secondly, mistaken in the\nmeans which would give them satisfaction. But this second point was\nsecondary. The main thing was to know yourself, what you really were; in\nPlato\u2019s words, to \u201csee the soul as it is, and know whether it have one\nform only or many, or what its nature is; to look upon it with the eye of\nreason in its original purity.\u201d Self-deception, confusion, that worst\nignorance which is unaware of itself, false estimation\u2014these are the\nradical evils of the natural man. To these critics the testimony of\nconsciousness was worthless, unless corroborated. To cure this mental\nconfusion, this blindness of will and judgment, is the task set for\nphilosophy: to give inward light, to teach true self-measurement. In one\npassage, much misunderstood, Plato has called this philosophic art the due\nmeasurement of pleasures and pains. It should scarcely have been possible\nto mistake the meaning. But, with the catchwords of Utilitarianism ringing\nin their ears, the commentators ran straight contrary to the true teaching\nof the _Protagoras_, consentient as it is with that of the _Phaedo_ and\nthe _Philebus_. To measure, one must have a standard: and if Plato has one\nlesson always for us, it is that a sure standard the multitude have not,\nbut only confusion. The so-called pleasures and pains of the world\u2019s\nexperiences are so entitled for different reasons, for contrary aims, and\nwith no unity or harmony of judgment. They are\u2014not a fact to be accepted,\nbut\u2014a problem for investigation: their reality is in question, their\ngenuineness, solidity and purity: and till you have settled that, you\ncannot measure, for you may be measuring vacuity under the idea that there\nis substance. You have still to get at the unit\u2014i.e. the reality of\npleasure. It was not Plato\u2019s view that pleasure was a separate and\nindependent entity: that it was exactly as it was felt. Each pleasure is\ndependent for its pleasurable quality on the consciousness it belongs to,\nand has only a relative truth and reality. Bentham has written about\ncomputing the value of a \u201clot\u201d of pleasures and pains. But Plato had his\nmind on an earlier and more fundamental problem, what is the truth and\nreality of pleasure; and his fullest but not his only essay towards\ndetermining the value or estimating the meaning of pleasure in the scale\nof being is that given in the _Philebus_.\nThis then is the knowledge which Greek philosophy meant: not mere\nintellect\u2014though, of course, there is always a danger of theoretical\ninquiry degenerating into abstract and formal dogma. But of the meaning\nthere can be no serious doubt. It is a knowledge, says Plato, to which the\nmethod of mathematical science\u2014the most perfect he can find\nacknowledged\u2014is only an _ouverture_, or perhaps, only the preliminary\ntuning of the strings. It is a knowledge not eternally hypothetical\u2014a\nsystem of sequences which have no sure foundation. It is a knowledge which\nrests upon the conviction and belief of the \u201cidea of good\u201d: a kind of\nknowledge which does not come by direct teaching, which is not mere\ntheory, but implies a lively conviction, a personal apprehension, a crisis\nwhich is a kind of \u201cconversion,\u201d or \u201cinspiration.\u201d It is as it were the\nprize of a great contest, in which the sword that conquers is the sword of\ndialectic: a sword whereof the property is, like that of Ithuriel\u2019s spear,\nto lay bare all deceptions and illusions of life. Or, to vary the\nmetaphor: the son of man is like the prince in the fairy tale who goes\nforth to win the true queen; but there are many false pretenders decked\nout to deceive his unwary eyes and foolish heart. Yet in himself there is\na power of discernment: there is something kindred with the truth:\u2014the\nwitness of the Spirit\u2014and all that education and discipline can do is to\nremove obstacles, especially the obstacles within the self which perturb\nthe sight and mislead the judgment. Were not the soul originally possessed\nof and dominated by the idea of good, it could never discern it elsewhere.\nOn this original kindred depends all the process of education; the\ninfluence of which therefore is primarily negative or auxiliary. Thus the\nprocess of history and experience,\u2014which the work of education only\nreproduces in an accelerated _tempo_\u2014serves but to bring out the implicit\nreason within into explicit conformity with the rationality of the world.\nKnowledge, then, in this ethical sphere means the harmony of will,\nemotion, intellect: it means the clear light which has no illusions and no\ndeceptions. And to those who feel that much of their life and of the\ncommon life is founded on prejudice and illusion, such white light will\noccasionally seem hard and steely. At its approach they fear the loss of\nthe charm of that twilight hour ere the day has yet begun, or before the\ndarkness has fully settled down. Thus the heart and feelings look upon the\nintellect as an enemy of sentiment. And Plato himself is not without\nanticipations of such an issue. Yet perhaps we may add that the danger is\nin part an imaginary one, and only arises because intelligence takes its\ntask too lightly, and encroaches beyond its proper ground. Philosophy, in\nother words, mistakes its place when it sets itself up as a dogmatic\nsystem of life. Its function is to comprehend, and from comprehension to\ncriticise, and through criticising to unify. It has no positive and\nadditional teaching of its own: no addition to the burden of life and\nexperience. And experience it must respect. Its work is to maintain the\norganic or super-organic interconnexion between all the spheres of life\nand all the forms of reality. It has to prevent stagnation and absorption\nof departments\u2014to keep each in its proper place, but not more than its\nplace, and yet to show how each is not independent of the others. And this\nis what the philosopher or ancient sage would be. If he is passionless, it\nis not that he has no passions, but that they no longer perturb and\nmislead. If his controlling spirit be reason, it is not the reason of the\nso-called \u201crationalist,\u201d but the reason which seeks in patience to\ncomprehend, and to be at home in, a world it at first finds strange. And\nif he is critical of others, he is still more critical of himself:\ncritical however not for criticism\u2019s sake (which is but a poor thing), but\nbecause through criticism the faith of reason may be more fully justified.\nTo the last, if he is true to his mission and faithful to his loyalty to\nreality, he will have the simplicity of the child.\nWhether therefore we agree or not with Plato\u2019s reduction of Right and Duty\nto self-actualisation, we may at least admit that in the idea of\nperfection or excellence, combined with the idea of knowledge or inward\nlucidity, he has got the fundamental ideas on which further ethical\ndevelopment must build. Self-control, self-knowledge, internal harmony,\nare good: and so are the development of our several faculties and of the\ntotality of them to the fullest pitch of excellence. But their value does\nnot lie entirely in themselves, or rather there is implicit in them a\nreference to something beyond themselves. They take for granted something\nwhich, because it is so taken, may also be ignored and neglected, just\nbecause it seems so obvious. And that implication is the social humanity\nin which they are the spirits of light and leading.\nTo lay the stress on \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae or excellence tends to leave out of sight the\nforce of duty; and to emphasise knowledge is allowed to disparage the\nheart and feelings. The mind\u2014even of a philosopher\u2014finds a difficulty in\nholding very different points of view in one, and where it is forced from\none to another, tends to forget the earlier altogether. Thus when the\nethical philosopher, presupposing as an absolute or unquestionable fact\nthat man the individual was rooted in the community, proceeded to discuss\nthe problem of the best and completest individual estate, he was easily\nled to lose sight of the fundamental and governing condition altogether.\nFrom the moment that Aristotle lays down the thesis that man is naturally\nsocial, to the moment when he asks how the bare ideal of excellence in\ncharacter and life can become an actuality, the community in which man\nlives has retired out of sight away into the background. And it only comes\nin, as it first appears, as the paedagogue to bring us to morality. And\nPlato, though professedly he is speaking of the community, and is well\naware that the individual can only be saved by the salvation of the\ncommunity, is constantly falling back into another problem\u2014the development\nof an individual soul. He feels the strength of the egoistic effort after\nperfection, and his essay in the end tends to lose sight altogether of its\nsecond theme. Instead of a man he gives us a mere philosopher, a man, that\nis, not living with his country\u2019s life, instinct with the heart and\nfeeling of humanity, inspired by art and religion, but a being set apart\nand exalted above his fellows,\u2014charged no doubt in theory with the duty of\nsaving them, of acting vicariously as the mediator between them and the\nabsolute truth\u2014but really tending more and more to seclude himself on the\n_edita templa_ of the world, on the high-towers of speculation.\nAnd what Plato and Aristotle did, so to speak, against their express\npurpose and effort, yet did, because the force of contemporary tendency\nwas irresistible\u2014that the Stoa and Epicurus did more openly and\nprofessedly. With a difference in theory, it is true, owing to the\ndifference in the surroundings. Virtue in the older day of the free and\nglorious commonwealth had meant physical and intellectual achievement,\nacts done in the public eye, and of course for the public good\u2014a good with\nwhich the agent was identified at least in heart and soul, if not in his\nexplicit consciousness. In later and worse days, when the political world,\nwith the world divine, had withdrawn from actual identity with the central\nheart of the individual, and stood over-against him as a strange power and\nlittle better than a nuisance, virtue came to be counted as endurance,\nindifference, negative independence against a cold and a perplexing world.\nBut even still, virtue is excellence: it is to rise above the ignoble\nlevel: to assert self-liberty against accident and circumstance\u2014to attain\nself-controlled, self-satisfying independence\u2014and to become God-like in\nits seclusion. Yet in two directions even it had to acknowledge something\nbeyond the individual. The Epicurean\u2014following out a suggestion of\nAristotle\u2014recognised the help which the free society of friends gave to\nthe full development of the single seeker after a self-satisfying and\ncomplete life. The Stoic, not altogether refusing such help, tended rather\nto rest his single self on a fellowship of ideal sort, on the great city\nof gods and men, the _civitas Dei_. Thus, in separate halves, the two\nschools, into which Greek ethics was divided, gave expression to the sense\nthat a new and higher community was needed\u2014to the sense that the visible\nactual community no longer realised its latent idea. The Stoic emphasised\nthe all-embracing necessity, the absolute comprehensiveness of the moral\nkingdom. The Epicurean saw more clearly that, if the everlasting city came\nfrom heaven, it could only visibly arise by initiation upon the earth.\nChristianity\u2014in its best work\u2014was a conjunction of the liberty with the\nnecessity, of the human with the divine.\nMore interesting, perhaps, it is to note the misconception of reason and\nknowledge which grew up. Knowledge came more and more to be identified\nwith the reflective and critical consciousness, which is outside reality\nand life, and judges it from a standpoint of its own. It came to be\nesteemed only in its formal and abstract shape, and at the expense of the\nheart and feelings. The antithesis of philosophy (or knowledge strictly so\ncalled) according to Plato was mere opinion, accidental and imperfect\nknowledge. The knowledge which is truly valuable is a knowledge which\npresupposes the full reality of life, and is the more and more completely\narticulated theory of it as a whole. It is\u2014abstractly taken\u2014a mere form of\nunity which has no value except in uniting: it is\u2014taken concretely\u2014the\nmatter, we may say, in complete unity. It is ideal and perfect harmony of\nthought, appetite, and emotion: or putting it otherwise, the philosopher\nis one who is not merely a creature of appetite and production, not merely\na creature of feeling and practical energy, but a creature, who to both of\nthese superadds an intelligence which sets eyes in the blind forehead of\nthese other powers, and thus, far from superseding them altogether, only\nraises them into completeness, and realises all that is worthy in their\nimplicit natures. Always these two impulsive tendencies of our nature are\nguided by some sort of ideas and intelligence, by beliefs and opinions.\nBut they, like their guides, are sporadically emergent, unconnected, and\ntherefore apt to be contradictory. It is to such erratic and occasional\nideas, half-truths and deceptions, that philosophy is opposed.\nUnfortunately for all parties, the antithesis is carried farther.\nPhilosophy and the philosopher are further set in opposition to the faith\nof the heart, the intimacy and intensity of feeling, the depth of love and\ntrust, which in practice often go along with imperfect ideas. The\nphilosopher is made one who has emancipated himself from the heart and\nfeelings,\u2014a pure intelligence, who is set above all creeds, contemplating\nall, and holding none. Consistency and clearness become his idol, to be\nworshipped at any cost, save one sacrifice: and that one sacrifice is the\nsacrifice of his own self-conceit. For consistency generally means that\nall is made to harmonise with one assumed standpoint, and that whatever\npresents discrepancies with this alleged standard is ruthlessly thrown\naway. Such a philosophy mistakes its function, which is not, as Heine\nscoffs, to make an intelligible system by rejecting the discordant\nfragments of life, but to follow reverently, if slowly, in the wake of\nexperience. Such a \u201cperfect sage,\u201d with his parade of reasonableness, may\noften assume the post of a dictator.\nAnd, above all, intelligence is only half itself when it is not also will.\nAnd both are more than mere consciousness. Plato\u2014whom we refer to, because\nhe is the coryphaeus of all the diverse host of Greek philosophy\u2014seems to\noverestimate or rather to misconceive the place of knowledge. That it is\nthe supreme and crowning grace of the soul, he sees. But he tends to\nidentify it with the supreme or higher soul:\u2014as Aristotle did after him,\nto be followed by the Stoics and Neo-Platonists. For them the supreme, or\nalmost supreme reality is the intelligence or reason: the soul is only on\na second grade of reality, on the borders of the natural or physical\nworld. When Plato takes that line, he turns towards the path of\nasceticism, and treats the philosophic life as a preparation for that\ntruer life when intelligence shall be all in all, for that better land\nwhere \u201cdivine dialogues\u201d shall form the staple and substance of spiritual\nexistence. Aristotle,\u2014who less often treads these solitudes,\u2014still extols\nthe theoretic life, when the body and its needs trouble no more, when the\nactivity of reason\u2014the theory of theory\u2014is attained at least as entirely\nas mortal conditions allow man to be deified. Of the \u201capathy\u201d and the\nreasonable conformity of the Stoics, or of the purely negative character\nof Epicurean happiness (the excision of all that pained) we need not here\nspeak. And in Plotinus and Proclus the deification of mere reason is at\nany rate the dominant note; whatever protests the larger Greek nature in\nthe former may from time to time offer. The truth which philosophy should\nhave taught was that Mind or intelligence was the element where the inner\nlife culminated and expanded and flourished: the error which it often\ntended to spread was that intelligence was the higher life of which all\nother was a degenerate shortcoming, and something valuable on its own\naccount.\nIt may be that thus to interpret Plato is to do him an injustice. It has\nbeen sometimes said that his division of parts or kinds of soul\u2014or his\ndistinction between its fighting horses\u2014tends to destroy the unity of\nmental life. But perhaps this was exactly what he wanted to convey. There\nare\u2014we may paraphrase his meaning\u2014three kinds of human being, three types\nof human life. There is the man or the life of appetite and the flesh:\nthere is the man of noble emotion and energetic depth of soul: there is\nthe life of reasonable pursuits and organised principle. Or, we may take\nhis meaning to be that there are three elements or provinces of mental\nlife, which in all except a few are but imperfectly coherent and do not\nreach a true or complete unity. Some unity there always is: but in the\nlife of mere appetite and impulse, even when these impulses are our nobler\nsentiments of love and hatred, the unity falls very far short. Or, as he\nputs the theme elsewhere, the soul has a passion for self-completion, a\nlove of beauty, which in most is but a misleading lust. It is the business\nof the philosophic life to re-create or to foster this unity: or\nphilosophy is the persistent search of the soul for its lost unity, the\nsearch to see that unity which is always its animating principle, its\ninner faith. When the soul has reached this ideal\u2014if it can be supposed to\nattain it (and of this the strong-souled ancient philosophers feel no\ndoubt),\u2014then a change must take place. The love of beauty is not\nsuppressed; it is only made self-assured and its object freed from all\nimperfection. It is not that passion has ceased; but its nature is so\ntransfigured, that it seems worthy of a nobler name, which yet we cannot\ngive. To such a life, where battle and conflict are as such unknown, we\ncannot longer give the title of life: and we say that philosophy is in\nlife a rehearsal of death(70). And yet if there be no battle, there is not\nfor that reason mere inaction. Hence, as the Republic concludes, the true\nphilosopher is the complete man. He is the truth and reality which the\nappetitive and emotional man were seeking after and failed to realise. It\nis true they at first will not see this. But the whole long process of\nphilosophy is the means to induce this conviction. And for Plato it\nremains clear that through experience, through wisdom, and through\nabstract deduction, the philosopher will justify his claim to him who hath\nears to hear and heart to understand. If that be so, the asceticism of\nPlato is not a mere war upon flesh and sense as such, but upon flesh and\nsense as imperfect truth, fragmentary reality, which suppose themselves\ncomplete, though they are again and again confuted by experience, by\nwisdom, and by mere calculation,\u2014a war against their blindness and\nshortsightedness.\nEssay IV. Psycho-Genesis.\n\u201cThe key,\u201d says Carus, \u201cfor the ascertainment of the nature of the\nconscious psychical life lies in the region of the unconscious(71).\u201d The\nview which these words take is at least as old as the days of Leibniz. It\nmeans that the mental world does not abruptly emerge a full-grown\nintelligence, but has a genesis, and follows a law of development: that\nits life may be described as the differentiation (with integration) of a\nsimple or indifferentiated mass. The terms conscious and unconscious,\nindeed, with their lax popular uses, leave the door wide open for\nmisconception. But they may serve to mark that the mind is to be\nunderstood only in a certain relation (partly of antithesis) to nature,\nand the soul only in reference to the body. The so-called \u201csuperior\nfaculties\u201d\u2014specially characteristic of humanity\u2014are founded upon, and do\nnot abruptly supersede, the lower powers which are supposed to be\nspecially obvious in the animals(72). The individual and specific\nphenomena of consciousness, which the psychologist is generally supposed\nto study, rest upon a deeper, less explicated, more indefinite, life of\nsensibility, which in its turn fades away by immeasurable gradations into\nsomething irresponsive to the ordinary tests for sensation and life.\nAnd yet the moment we attempt to leave the daylight of consciousness for\nthe darker sides of sub-conscious life, the risks of misinterpretation\nmultiply. The problem is to some extent the same as confronts the student\nof the ideas and principles of primitive races. There, the temptation of\nseeing things through the \u201cspectacles of civilisation\u201d is almost\nirresistible. So in psychology we are apt to import into the life of\nsensation and feeling the distinctions and relations of subsequent\nintellection. Nor is the difficulty lessened by Hegel\u2019s method which deals\nwith soul, sentiency, and consciousness as grades or general\ncharacteristics in a developmental advance. He borrows his illustrations\nfrom many quarters, from morbid and anomalous states of\nconsciousness,\u2014less from the cases of savages, children and animals. These\nillustrations may be called a loose induction. But it requires a much more\npowerful instrument than mere induction to build up a scientific system; a\nframework of general principle or theory is the only basis on which to\nbuild theory by the allegation of facts, however numerous. Yet in\nphilosophic science, which is systematised knowledge, all facts strictly\nso described will find their place and be estimated at their proper value.\n(i.) Primitive Sensibility.\nPsychology (with Hegel) takes up the work of science from biology. The\nmind comes before it as the supreme product of the natural world, the\nfinest flower of organic life, the \u201ctruth\u201d of the physical process. As\nsuch it is called by the time-honoured name of Soul. If we further go on\nto say that the soul is the principle of life, we must not understand this\nvital principle to be something over and above the life of which it is the\nprinciple. Such a locally-separable principle is an addition which is due\nto the analogy of mechanical movement, where a detached agent sets in\nmotion and directs the machinery. But in the organism the principle is not\nthus detachable as a thing or agent. By calling Soul the principle of life\nwe rather mean that in the vital organism, so far as it _lives_, all the\nreal variety, separation, and discontinuity of parts must be reduced to\nunity and identity, or as Hegel would say, to _ideality_. To live is thus\nto keep all differences fluid and permeable in the fire of the\nlife-process. Or to use a familiar term of logic, the Soul is the concept\nor intelligible unity of the organic body. But to call it a concept might\nsuggest that it is only the conception through which _we_ represent to\nourselves the variety in unity of the organism. The soul, however, is more\nthan a mere concept: and life is more than a mere mode of description for\na group of movements forming an objective unity. It is a unity, subjective\nand objective. The organism is one life, controlling difference: and it is\nalso one by our effort to comprehend it. The Soul therefore is in Hegelian\nlanguage described as the Idea rather than the concept of the organic\nbody. Life is the generic title for this subject-object: but the life may\nbe merely physical, or it may be intellectual and practical, or it may be\nabsolute, i.e. will and know all that it is, and be all that it knows and\nwills.\nUp to this point the world is what is called an external, which is here\ntaken to mean (not a world external to the individual, but) a\nself-externalised world. That is to say, it is the observer who has\nhitherto by his interpretation of his perceptions supplied the \u201cSpirit in\nNature.\u201d In itself the external world has no inside, no centre: it is we\nwho read into it the conception of a life-history. We are led to believe\nthat a principle of unity is always at work throughout the physical\nworld\u2014even in the mathematical laws of natural operation. It is only\nintelligible and credible to us as a system, a continuous and regular\ndevelopment. But that system is only a hypothetical idea, though it is\nheld to be a conclusion to which all the evidence seems unequivocally to\npoint. And, even in organic life, the unity, though more perfect and\npalpable than in the mechanical and inorganic world, is only a perception,\na vision,\u2014a necessary mode of realising the unity of the facts. The\nphenomenon of life reveals as in a picture and an ocular demonstration the\nconformity of inward and outward, the identity of whole and parts, of\npower and utterance. But it is still outside the observer. In the function\nof sensibility and sentiency, however, we stand as it were on the\nborder-line between biology and psychology. At one step we have been\nbrought within the harmony, and are no longer mere observers and\nreflecters. The sentient not merely is, but is aware that it is. Hitherto\nas life, it only is the unity in diversity, and diversity in unity, for\nthe outsider, i.e. only implicitly: now it is so for itself, or\nconsciously. And in the first stage it does not know, but feels or is\nsentient. Here, for the first time, is created the distinction of inward\nand outward. Loosely indeed we may, like Mr. Spencer, speak of outward and\ninward in physiology: but strictly speaking, what Goethe says is true,\n_Natur hat weder Kern noch Schaale_(73). Nature in the narrower sense\nknows no distinction of the inward and outward in its phenomena: it is a\npurely superficial order and succession of appearance and event. The Idea\nwhich has been visible to an intelligent percipient in the types and laws\nof the natural world, now _is_, actually is\u2014is in and for itself\u2014but at\nfirst in a minimum of content, a mere point of light, or rather the dawn\nwhich has yet to expand into the full day.\nSpinoza has asserted that \u201call individual bodies are animate, though in\ndifferent degrees(74).\u201d Now it is to a great extent this diversity of\ndegree on which the main interest turns. Yet it is well to remember that\nthe abrupt and trenchant separations which popular practice loves are\noverridden to a deeper view by an essential unity of idea, reducing them\nto indifference. If, that is, we take seriously the Spinozist unity of\nSubstance, and the continual correlation (to call it no more) of extension\nand consciousness therein, we cannot avoid the conclusion which even Bacon\nwould admit of something describable as attraction and perception,\nsomething subduing diversity to unity. But whether it be well to name this\nsoul or life is a different matter. It may indeed only be taken to mean\nthat all true being must be looked on as a real unity and individuality,\nmust, that is, be conceived as manifesting itself in organisation, must be\nreferred to a self-centred and self-developing activity. But this\u2014which is\nthe fundamental thesis of idealism\u2014is hardly all that is meant. Rather\nSpinoza would imply that all things which form a real unity must have\nlife\u2014must have inner principle and unifying reality: and what he teaches\nis closely akin to the Leibnitian doctrine that every substantial\nexistence reposes upon a monad, a unity which is at once both a force and\na cognition, a \u201crepresentation\u201d and an appetite or _nisus_ to act. When\nFechner in a series of works(75) expounds and defends the hypothesis that\nplants and planets are not destitute of soul, any more than man and\nanimals, he only gives a more pronounced expression to this idealisation\nor spiritualisation of the natural world. But for the moment the point to\nbe noted is that all of this idealistic doctrine is an inference, or a\ndevelopment which finds its _point d\u2019appui_ in the fact of sensation. And\nthe problem of the Philosophy of Mind is just to trace the process whereby\na mere shock of sensation has grown into a conception and a faith in the\ngoodness, beauty and intelligence of the world.\nSchopenhauer has put the point with his usual picturesqueness. Outward\nnature presents nothing but a play of forces. At first, however, this\nforce shows merely the mechanical phenomena of pressure and impact, and\nits theory is sufficiently described by mathematical physics. But in the\nprocess of nature force assumes higher types, types where it loses a\ncertain amount of its externality(76), till in the organic world it\nacquires a peculiar phase which Schopenhauer calls _Will_, meaning by\nthat, however, an organising and controlling power, a tendency or _nisus_\nto be and live, which is persistent and potent, but without consciousness.\nThis blind force, which however has a certain coherence and purposiveness,\nis in the animal organism endowed with a new character, in consequence of\nthe emergence of a new organ. This organ, the brain and nervous system,\ncauses the evolution into clear day of an element which has been growing\nmore and more urgent. The gathering tendency of force to return into\nitself is now complete: the cycle of operation is formed: and the junction\nof the two currents issues in the spark of sensation. The blind force now\nbecomes seeing.\nBut at first\u2014and this is the point we have to emphasise\u2014its powers of\nvision are limited. Sensibility is either a local and restricted\nphenomenon: or, in so far as it is not local, it is vague and indefinite,\nand hardly entitled to the name of sensibility. Either it is a dim, but\nfar-reaching, sympathy with environing existence, and in that case only\nso-called blind will or feeling: or if it is clear, is locally confined,\nand at first within very narrow limits. Neither of these points must be\nlost sight of. On the one hand feeling has to be regarded as the dull and\nconfused stirring of an almost infinite sympathy with the world\u2014a pulse\nwhich has come from the far-distant movements of the universe, and bears\nwith it, if but as a possibility, the wealth of an infinite message. On\nthe other hand, feeling at first only becomes real, in this boundless\nideality to which its possibilities extend, by restricting itself to one\nlittle point and from several points organising itself to a unity of\nbodily feeling, till it can go on from thence to embrace the universe in\ndistinct and articulate comprehension.\nSoul, says Hegel, is not a separate and additional something over and\nabove the rest of nature: it is rather nature\u2019s \u201c\u2019universal immaterialism,\nand simple ideal life(77).\u201d There were ancient philosophers who spoke of\nthe soul as a self-adjusting number,\u2014as a harmony, or equilibrium(78)\u2014and\nthe moderns have added considerably to the list of these analogical\ndefinitions. As definitions they obviously fall short. Yet these things\ngive, as it were, by anticipation, an image of soul, as the \u201cideality,\u201d\nwhich reduces the manifold to unity. The adhesions and cohesions of\nmatter, its gravitating attractions, its chemical affinities and\nelectrical polarities, the intricate out-and-in of organic structure, are\nall preludes to the true incorporating unity which is the ever-immanent\nsupersession of the endless self-externalism and successionalism of\nphysical reality. But in sentiency, feeling, or sensibility, the unity\nwhich all of these imply without reaching, is explicitly present. It is\nimplicitly an all-embracing unity: an infinite,\u2014which has no doors and no\nwindows, for the good reason that it needs none, because it has nothing\noutside it, because it \u201cexpresses\u201d and \u201cenvelopes\u201d (however confusedly at\nfirst) the whole universe. Thus, even if, with localising phraseology, we\nmay describe mind, where it _appears_ emerging in the natural world, as a\nmere feeble and incidental outburst,\u2014a rebellion breaking out as in some\npetty province or isolated region against the great law of the physical\nrealm\u2014we are in so speaking taking only an external standpoint. But with\nthe rise of mind in nature the bond of externalism is implicitly overcome.\nTo it, and where it really is, there is nothing outside, nothing\ntranscendent. Everything which is said to be outside mind is only outside\na localised and limited mind\u2014outside a mind which is imperfectly and\nabstractly realised\u2014not outside mind absolutely. Mind is the absolute\nnegation of externality: not a mere relative negative, as the organism may\nbe biologically described as inner in respect of the environment. To\naccomplish this negation in actuality, to bring the multiplicity and\nexternality of things into the unity and identity of one Idea, is the\nprocess of development of mind from animal sensibility to philosophic\nknowledge, from appetite to art,\u2014the process of culture through the social\nstate under the influence of religion.\nSentiency or psychic matter (mind-stuff), to begin with, is in some\nrespects like the _tabula rasa_ of the empiricists. It is the\npossibility\u2014but the real possibility\u2014of intelligence rather than\nintelligence itself. It is the monotonous undifferentiated inwardness\u2014a\nfaint self-awareness and self-realisation of the material world, but at\nfirst a mere vague _psychical protoplasm_ and without defined nucleus,\nwithout perceptible organisation or separation of structures. If there is\nself-awareness, it is not yet discriminated into a distinct and unified\nself, not yet differentiated and integrated,\u2014soul in the condition of a\nmere \u201cIs,\u201d which, however, is nothing determinate. It is very much in the\nsituation of Condillac\u2019s statue-man\u2014_une statue organis\u00e9e int\u00e9rieurement\ncomme nous, et anim\u00e9e d\u2019un esprit priv\u00e9 de toute esp\u00e8ce d\u2019id\u00e9es_: alike at\nleast so far that the rigid uniformity of the latter\u2019s envelope prevents\nall articulated organisation of its faculties. The foundation under all\nthe diversity and individuality in the concrete intelligent and volitional\nlife is a common feeling,\u2014a _sensus communis_\u2014a general and indeterminate\nsusceptibility to influence, a sympathy responsive, but responsive vaguely\nand equivocally, to all the stimuli of the physical environment. There was\nonce a time, according to primitive legend, when man understood the\nlanguage of beast and bird, and even surprised the secret converse of\ntrees and flowers. Such fancies are but the exaggeration of a solidarity\nof conscious life which seems to spread far in the sub-conscious realm,\nand to narrow the individual\u2019s soul into limited channels as it rises into\nclear self-perception,\n\u201cAs thro\u2019 the frame that binds him in\nHis isolation grows defined.\u201d\nIt may be a mere dream that, as Goethe feigns of Makaria in his\nromance(79), there are men and women in sympathy with the vicissitudes of\nthe starry regions: and hypotheses of lunar influence, or dogmas of\nastrological destiny, may count to the present guardians of the sciences\nas visionary superstitions. Yet science in these regions has no reason to\nbe dogmatic; her function hitherto can only be critical; and even for\nthat, her data are scanty and her principles extremely general. The\ninfluences on the mental mood and faculty, produced by climate and\nseasons, by local environment and national type, by individual\npeculiarities, by the differences of age and sex, and by the alternation\nof night and day, of sleep and waking, are less questionable. It is easy\nno doubt to ignore or forget them: easy to remark how indefinable and\nincalculable they are. But that does not lessen their radical and\ninevitable impress in the determination of the whole character. \u201cThe sum\nof our existence, divided by reason, never comes out exact, but always\nleaves a marvellous remainder(80).\u201d Irrational this residue is, in the\nsense that it is inexplicable, and incommensurable with the well-known\nquantities of conscious and voluntarily organised life. But a scientific\npsychology, which is adequate to the real and concrete mind, should never\nlose sight of the fact that every one of its propositions in regard to the\nmore advanced phases of intellectual development is thoroughly and in\nindefinable ways modified by these preconditions. When that is remembered,\nit will be obvious how complicated is the problem of adapting psychology\nfor the application to education, and how dependent the solution of that\nproblem is upon an experiential familiarity with the data of individual\nand national temperament and character.\nThe first stage in mental development is the establishment of regular and\nuniform relations between soul and body: it is the differentiation of\norgans and the integration of function: the balance between sensation and\nmovement, between the afferent and efferent processes of sensitivity.\nGiven a potential soul, the problem is to make it actual in an individual\nbody. It is the business of a physical psychology to describe in detail\nthe steps by which the body we are attached to is made inward as our idea\nthrough the several organs and their nervous appurtenances: whereas a\npsychical physiology would conversely explain the corresponding processes\nfor the expression of the emotions and for the objectification of the\nvolitions. Thus soul inwardises (_erinnert_) or envelops body: which body\n\u201cexpresses\u201d or develops soul. The actual soul is the unity of both, is the\npercipient individual. The solidarity or \u201ccommunion\u201d of body and soul is\nhere the dominant fact: the soul sentient of changes in its peripheral\norgans, and transmitting emotion and volition into physical effect. It is\non this psychical unity,\u2014the unity which is the soul of the diversity of\nbody\u2014that all the subsequent developments of mind rest. Sensation is thus\nthe _prius_\u2014or basis\u2014of all mental life: the organisation of soul in body\nand of body in soul. It is the process which historically has been\nprepared in the evolution of animal life from those undifferentiated forms\nwhere specialised organs are yet unknown, and which each individual has\nfurther to realise and complete for himself, by learning to see and hear,\nand use his limbs. At first, moreover, it begins from many separate\ncentres and only through much collision and mutual compliance arrives at\ncomparative uniformity and centralisation. The common basis of united\nsensibility supplied by the one organism has to be made real and\neffective, and it is so at first by sporadic and comparatively independent\ndevelopments. If self-hood means reference to self of what is prima facie\nnot self, and projection of self therein, there is in primitive\nsensibility only the germ or possibility of self-hood. In the early phases\nof psychic development the centre is fluctuating and ill-defined, and it\ntakes time and trouble to co-ordinate or unify the various starting-points\nof sensibility(81).\nThis consolidation of inward life may be looked at either formally or\nconcretely. Under the first head, it means the growth of a central unity\nof apperception. In the second case, it means a peculiar aggregate of\nideas and sentiments. There is growing up within him what we may call the\nindividuality of the individual,\u2014an irrational, i.e. not consciously\nintelligent, nether-self or inner soul, a firm aggregation of hopes and\nwishes, of views and feelings, or rather of tendencies and temperament, of\ncharacter hereditary and acquired. It is the law of the natural will or\ncharacter which from an inaccessible background dominates our\naction,\u2014which, because it is not realised and formulated in consciousness,\nbehaves like a guardian spirit, or genius, or destiny within us. This\ngenius is the sub-conscious unity of the sensitive life\u2014the manner of man\nwhich unknown to ourselves we are,\u2014and which influences us against our\nnominal or formal purposes. So far as this predominates, our ends, rough\nhew them how we will, are given by a force which is not really, i.e. with\nfull consciousness, ours: by a mass of ingrained prejudice and unreasoned\nsympathies, of instincts and passions, of fancies and feelings, which have\ncondensed and organised themselves into a natural power. As the child in\nthe mother\u2019s womb is responsive to her psychic influences, so the\ndevelopment of a man\u2019s psychic life is guided by feelings centred in\nobjects and agents external to him, who form the genius presiding over his\ndevelopment. His soul, to that extent, is really in another: he himself is\nselfless, and when his stay is removed the principle of his life is\ngone(82). He is but a bundle of impressions, held together by influences\nand ties which in years before consciousness proper began made him what he\nis. Such is the involuntary adaptation to example and environment, which\nestablishes in the depths below personality a self which becomes hereafter\nthe determinant of action. Early years, in which the human being is\nnaturally susceptible, build up by imitation, by pliant obedience, an\nimage, a system, reproducing the immediate surroundings. The soul, as yet\nselfless, and ready to accept any imprint, readily moulds itself into the\nlikeness of an authoritative influence.\nThe step by which the universality or unity of the self is realised in the\nvariety of its sensation is Habit. Habit gives us a definite\nstanding-ground in the flux of single impressions: it is the\nidentification of ourselves with what is most customary and familiar: an\nidentification which takes place by practice and repetition. If it\ncircumscribes us to one little province of being, it on the other frees us\nfrom the vague indeterminateness where we are at the mercy of every\npassing mood. It makes thus much of our potential selves our very own, our\nacquisition and permanent possession. It, above all, makes us free and at\none with our bodily part, so that henceforth we start as a subjective unit\nof body and soul. We have now as the result of the anthropological process\na self or ego, an individual consciousness able to reflect and compare,\nsetting itself on one side (a soul in bodily organisation), and on the\nother setting an object of consciousness, or external world, a world of\nother things. All this presupposes that the soul has actualised itself by\nappropriating and acquiring as its expression and organ the physical\nsensibility which is its body. By restricting and establishing itself, it\nhas gained a fixed standpoint. No doubt it has localised and confined\nitself, but it is no longer at the disposal of externals and accident: it\nhas laid the foundation for higher developments.\n(ii.) Anomalies of Psychical Life.\nPsychology, as we have seen, goes for information regarding the earlier\nstages of mental growth to the child and the animal,\u2014perhaps also to the\nsavage. So too sociology founds certain conclusions upon the observations\nof savage customs and institutions, or on the earlier records of the race.\nIn both cases with a limitation caused by the externality and\nfragmentariness of the facts and the need of interpreting them through our\nown conscious experiences. There is however another direction in which\ncorresponding inquiries may be pursued; and where the danger of the\nconclusions arrived at, though not perhaps less real, is certainly of a\ndifferent kind. In sociology we can observe\u2014and almost experiment upon\u2014the\nphenomena of the lapsed, degenerate and criminal classes. The advantage of\nsuch observation is that the object of study can be made to throw greater\nlight on his own inner states. He is a little of the child and a little of\nthe savage, but these aspects co-exist with other features which put him\nmore on a level with the intelligent observer. Similar pathological\nregions are open to us in the case of psychology. There the anomalous and\nmorbid conditions of mind co-exist with a certain amount of mature\nconsciousness. So presented, they are thrown out into relief. They form\nthe negative instances which serve to corroborate our positive inductions.\nThe regularly concatenated and solid structure of normal mind is under\nabnormal and deranged conditions thrown into disorder, and its\nconstituents are presented in their several isolation. Such phenomena are\nrelapses into more rudimentary grades: but with the difference that they\nare set in the midst of a more advanced phase of intellectual life.\nEven amongst candid and honest-minded students of psychology there is a\ncertain reluctance to dabble in researches into the night-side of the\nmental range. Herbart is an instance of this shrinking. The region of the\nUnconscious seemed\u2014and to many still seems\u2014a region in which the charlatan\nand the dupe can and must play into each other\u2019s hands. Once in the whirl\nof spiritualist and crypto-psychical inquiry you could not tell how far\nyou might be carried. The facts moreover were of a peculiar type.\nDependent as they seemed to be on the frame of mind of observers and\nobserved, they defied the ordinary criteria of detached and abstract\nobservation. You can only observe them, it is urged, when you believe;\nscepticism destroys them. Now there is a widespread natural impatience\nagainst what Bacon has called \u201cmonodical\u201d phenomena, phenomena i.e. which\nclaim to come under a special law of their own, or to have a private and\nprivileged sphere. And this impatience cuts the Gordian knot by a\ndetermination to treat all instances which oppose its hitherto ascertained\nlaws as due to deception and fraud, or, at the best, to incompetent\nobservation, confusions of memory, and superstitions of ignorance. Above\nall, great interests of religion and personality seemed to connect\nthemselves with these revelations\u2014interests, at any rate, to which our\ncommon humanity thrills; it seemed as if, in this region beyond the\ncustomary range of the conscious and the seen, one might learn something\nof the deeper realities which lie in the unseen. But to feel that so much\nwas at stake was naturally unfavourable to purely dispassionate\nobservation.\nThe philosophers were found\u2014as might have been expected\u2014amongst those most\nstrongly attracted by these problems. Even Kant had been fascinated by the\nspiritualism of Swedenborg, though he finally turned away sceptical. At\nleast as early as 1806 Schelling had been interested by Ritter\u2019s\nresearches into the question of telepathy, or the power of the human will\nto produce without mechanical means of conveyance an effect at a distance.\nHe was looking forward to the rise of a _Physica coelestis_, or New\nCelestial Physics, which should justify the old magic. About the same date\nhis brother Karl published an essay on Animal Magnetism. The novel\nphenomena of galvanism and its congeners suggested vast possibilities in\nthe range of the physical powers, especially of the physical powers of the\nhuman psyche as a natural agent. The divining-rod was revived.\nClairvoyance and somnambulism were carefully studied, and the curative\npowers of animal magnetism found many advocates(83).\nInterest in these questions went naturally with the new conception of the\nplace of Man in Nature, and of Nature as the matrix of mind(84). But it\nhad been acutely stimulated by the performances and professions of Mesmer\nat Vienna and Paris in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.\nThese\u2014though by no means really novel\u2014had forced the artificial world of\nscience and fashion to discuss the claim advanced for a new force which,\namongst other things, could cure ailments that baffled the ordinary\npractitioner. This new force\u2014mainly because of the recent interest in the\nremarkable advances of magnetic and electrical research\u2014was conceived as a\nfluid, and called Animal Magnetism. At one time indeed Mesmer actually\nemployed a magnet in the manipulation by which he induced the peculiar\ncondition in his patients. The accompaniments of his procedure were in\nmany respects those of the quack-doctor; and with the quack indeed he was\noften classed. A French commission of inquiry appointed to examine into\nhis performances reported in 1784 that, while there was no doubt as to the\nreality of many of the phenomena, and even of the cures, there was no\nevidence for the alleged new physical force, and declared the effects to\nbe mainly attributable to the influence of imagination. And with the\nmention of this familiar phrase, further explanation was supposed to be\nrendered superfluous.\nIn France political excitement allowed the mesmeric theory and practice to\ndrop out of notice till the fall of the first Empire. But in Germany there\nwas a considerable amount of investigations and hypotheses into these\nmystical phenomena, though rarely by the ordinary routine workers in the\nscientific field. The phenomena where they were discussed were studied and\ninterpreted in two directions. Some theorists, like Jung-Stilling,\nEschenmayer, Schubert, and Kerner, took the more metaphysicist and\nspiritualistic view: they saw in them the witness to a higher truth, to\nthe presence and operation in this lower world of a higher and spiritual\nmatter, a so-called ether. Thus Animal Magnetism supplied a sort of\nphysical theory of the other world and the other life. Jung-Stilling, e.g.\nin his \u201cTheory of Spirit-lore.\u201d (1808), regarded the spiritualistic\nphenomena as a justification of\u2014what he believed to be\u2014the Kantian\ndoctrine that in the truly real and persistent world space and time are no\nmore. The other direction of inquiry kept more to the physical field.\nRitter (whose researches interested both Schelling and Hegel) supposed he\nhad detected the new force underlying mesmerism and the like, and gave to\nit the name of Siderism (1808); while Amoretti of Milan named the object\nof his experiments Animal Electrometry (1816). Kieser(85), again (1826)\nspoke of Tellurism, and connected animal magnetism with the play of\ngeneral terrestrial forces in the human being.\nAt a later date (1857) Schindler, in his \u201cMagical Spirit-life,\u201d expounded\na theory of mental polarity. The psychical life has two poles or\ncentres,\u2014its day-pole, around which revolves our ordinary and superficial\ncurrent of ideas, and its night-pole, round which gathers the\nsub-conscious and deeper group of beliefs and sentiments. Either life has\na memory, a consciousness, a world of its own: and they flourish to a\nlarge extent inversely to each other. The day-world has for its organs of\nreceiving information the ordinary senses. But the magical or night-world\nof the soul has its feelers also, which set men directly in telepathic\nrapport with influences, however distant, exerted by the whole world: and\nthrough this \u201cinner sense\u201d which serves to concentrate in itself all the\ntelluric forces (\u2014a sense which in its various aspects we name instinct,\npresentiment, conscience) is constructed the fabric of our sub-conscious\nsystem. Through it man is a sort of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of all the cosmic life, in\nsecret affinity and sympathy with all natural processes; and by the will\nwhich stands in response therewith he can exercise a directly creative\naction on external nature. In normal and healthy conditions the two\ncurrents of psychic life run on harmonious but independent. But in the\nphenomena of somnambulism, clairvoyance, and delirium, the magic region\nbecomes preponderant, and comes into collision with the other. The\ndark-world emerges into the realm of day as a portentous power: and there\nis the feeling of a double personality, or of an indwelling genius,\nfamiliar spirit, or demon.\nTo the ordinary physicist the so-called _Actio in distans_ was a hopeless\nstumbling-block. If he did not comprehend the transmission (as it is\ncalled) of force where there was immediate contact, he was at least\nperfectly familiar with the outer aspect of it as a condition of his\nlimited experience. It needed one beyond the mere hodman of science to say\nwith Laplace: \u201cWe are so far from knowing all the agents of nature, that\nit would be very unphilosophical to deny the existence of phenomena solely\nbecause they are inexplicable in the present state of our knowledge.\u201d\nAccordingly mesmerism and its allied manifestations were generally\nabandoned to the bohemians of science, and to investigators with dogmatic\nbias. It was still employed as a treatment for certain ailments: and\nphilosophers, as different as Fichte and Schopenhauer(86), watched its\nfate with attention. But the herd of professional scientists fought shy of\nit. The experiments of Braid at Manchester in 1841 gradually helped to\ngive research into the subject a new character. Under the name of\nHypnotism (or, rather at first Neuro-hypnotism) he described the phenomena\nof the magnetic sleep (induced through prolonged staring at a bright\nobject), such as abnormal rigidity of body, perverted sensibility, and the\nremarkable obedience of the subject to the command or suggestions of the\noperator. Thirty years afterwards, the matter became an object of\nconsiderable experimental and theoretic work in France, at the rival\nschools of Paris and Nancy; and the question, mainly under the title of\nhypnotism, though the older name is still occasionally heard, has been for\nseveral years brought prominently under public notice.\nIt cannot be said that the net results of these observations and\nhypotheses are of a very definitive character. While a large amount of\ncontroversy has been waged on the comparative importance of the several\nmethods and instruments by which the hypnotic or mesmeric trance may be\ninduced, and a scarcely less wide range of divergence prevails with regard\nto the physiological and pathological conditions in connexion with which\nit has been most conspicuously manifested, there has been less anxiety\nshown to determine its precise psychical nature, or its significance in\nmental development. And yet the better understanding of these aspects may\nthrow light on several points connected with primitive religion and the\nhistory of early civilisation, indeed over the whole range of what is\ncalled _V\u00f6lkerpsychologie_. Indeed this is one of the points which may be\nsaid to emerge out of the confusion of dispute. Phenomena at least\nanalogous to those styled hypnotic have a wide range in the\nanthropological sphere(87): and the proper characters which belong to them\nwill only be caught by an observer who examines them in the widest variety\nof examples. Another feature which has been put in prominence is what has\nbeen called \u201cpsychological automatism.\u201d And in this name two points seem\nto deserve note. The first is the spontaneous and as it were mechanical\nconsecution of mental states in the soul whence the interfering effect of\nvoluntary consciousness has been removed. And the second is the unfailing\nor accurate regularity, so contrary to the hesitating and uncertain\nprocedure of our conscious and reasoned action, which so often is seen in\nthe unreflecting and unreasoned movements. To this invariable sequence of\npsychical movement the superior control and direction by the intelligent\nself has to adapt itself, just as it respects the order of physical laws.\nBut, perhaps, the chief conclusion to be derived from hypnotic experience\nis the value of suggestion or suggestibility. Even cool thinkers like Kant\nhave recognised how much mere mental control has to do with bodily\nstate,\u2014how each of us, in this way, is often for good or for ill his own\nphysician. An idea is a force, and is only inactive in so far as it is\nheld in check by other ideas. \u201cThere is no such thing as hypnotism,\u201d says\none: \u201cthere are only different degrees of suggestibility.\u201d This may be to\nexaggerate: yet it serves to impress the comparatively secondary character\nof many of the circumstances on which the specially mesmeric or hypnotic\nexperimentalist is apt to lay exclusive stress. The methods may probably\nvary according to circumstances. But the essence of them all is to get the\npatient out of the general frame and system of ideas and perceptions in\nwhich his ordinary individuality is encased. Considering how for all of us\nthe reality of concrete life is bound up with our visual perceptions, how\nlargely our sanity depends upon the spatial idea, and how that depends on\nfree ocular range, we can understand that darkness and temporary loss of\nvision are powerful auxiliaries in the hypnotic process, as in magical and\nsuperstitious rites. But a great deal short of this may serve to establish\ninfluence. The mind of the majority of human beings, but especially of the\nyoung, may be compared to a vacant seat waiting for some one to fill it.\nIn Hegel\u2019s view hypnotic phenomena produce a kind of temporary and\nartificial atavism. Mechanical or chemical means, or morbid conditions of\nbody, may cause even for the intelligent adult a relapse into states of\nmind closely resembling those exhibited by the primitive or the infantile\nsensibility. The intelligent personality, where powers are bound up with\nlimitations and operate through a chain of means and ends, is reduced to\nits primitively undifferentiated condition. Not that it is restored to its\ninfantile simplicity; but that all subsequent acquirements operate only as\na concentrated individuality, or mass of will and character, released from\nthe control of the self-possessed mind, and invested (by the latter\u2019s\nwithdrawal) with a new quasi-personality of their own. With the loss of\nthe world of outward things, there may go, it is supposed, a clearer\nperception of the inward and particularly of the organic life. The Soul\ncontains the form of unity which other experiences had impressed upon it:\nbut this form avails in its subterranean existence where it creates a sort\nof inner self. And this inner self is no longer, like the embodied self of\nordinary consciousness, an intelligence served by organs, and proceeding\nby induction and inference. Its knowledge is not mediated or carried along\nspecific channels: it does not build up, piecemeal, by successive steps of\nsynthesis and analysis, by gradual idealisation, the organised totality of\nits intellectual world. The somnambulist and the clairvoyant see without\neyes, and carry their vision directly into regions where the waking\nconsciousness of orderly intelligence cannot enter. But that region is not\nthe world of our higher ideas,\u2014of art, religion, and philosophy. It is\nstill the sensitivity\u2014that realm of sensitivity which is ordinarily\ncovered by unconsciousness. Such sensitive clairvoyants may, as it were,\nhear themselves growing; they may discern the hidden quivers and pulses of\nblood and tissue, the seats of secret pain and all the unrevealed workings\nin the dark chambers of the flesh. But always their vision seems confined\nto that region, and will fall short of the world of light and ideal truth.\nIt is towards the nature-bond of sensitive solidarity with earth, and\nflowers, and trees, the life that \u201crolls through all things,\u201d not towards\nthe spiritual unity which broods over the world and \u201cimpels all thinking\nthings,\u201d that these immersions in the selfless universe lead us.\nWhat Hegel chiefly sees in these phenomena is their indication, even on\nthe natural side of man, of that ideality of the material, which it is the\nwork of intelligence to produce in the more spiritual life, in the\nfully-developed mind. The latter is the supreme over-soul, that Absolute\nMind which in our highest moods, aesthetic and religious, we approximate\nto. But mind, as it tends towards the higher end to \u201cmerge itself in\nlight,\u201d to identify itself yet not wholly lost, but retained, in the\nfullness of undivided intellectual being, so at the lower end it springs\nfrom a natural and underlying unity, the immense solidarity of\nnether-soul, the great Soul of Nature\u2014the \u201cSubstance\u201d which is to be\nraised into the \u201cSubject\u201d which is true divinity. Between these two\nunities, the nature-given nether-soul and the spirit-won over-soul, lies\nthe conscious life of man: a process of differentiation which narrows and\nof redintegration which enlarges,\u2014which alternately builds up an isolated\npersonality and dissolves it in a common intelligence and sympathy. It is\nbecause mental or tacit \u201csuggestion\u201d(88) (i.e. will-influence exercised\nwithout word or sign, or other sensible mode of connexion),\nthought-transference, or thought-reading (which is more than dexterous\napprehension of delicate muscular signs), exteriorisation or transposition\nof sensibility into objects primarily non-sensitive, clairvoyance (i.e.\nthe power of describing, as if from direct perception, objects or events\nremoved in space beyond the recognised limits of sensation), and\nsomnambulism, so far as it implies lucid vision with sealed eyes,\u2014it is\nbecause these things seem to show the essential ideality of matter, that\nHegel is interested in them. The ordinary conditions of consciousness and\neven of practical life in society are a derivative and secondary state; a\nproduct of processes of individualism, which however are never completed,\nand leave a large margin for idealising intelligence to fulfil. From a\nstate which is not yet personality to a state which is more than can be\ndescribed as personality\u2014lies the mental movement. So Fichte, too, had\nregarded the power of the somnambulist as laying open a world underlying\nthe development of egoity and self-consciousness(89): \u201cthe merely sensuous\nman is still in somnambulism,\u201d only a somnambulism of waking hours: \u201cthe\ntrue waking is the life in God, to be free in him, all else is sleep and\ndream.\u201d \u201cEgoity,\u201d he adds, \u201cis a merely _formal_ principle, utterly, and\nnever qualitative (i.e. the essence and universal force).\u201d For\nSchopenhauer, too, the experiences of animal magnetism had seemed to prove\nthe absolute supernatural power of the radical will in its superiority to\nthe intellectual categories of space, time, and causal sequence: to prove\nthe reality of the metaphysical which is at the basis of all conscious\ndivisions.\n(iii.) The Development of Inner Freedom.\nThe result of the first range in the process of psycho-genesis was to make\nthe body a sign and utterance of the Soul, with a fixed and determinate\ntype. The \u201canthropological process\u201d has defined and settled the mere\ngeneral sentiency of soul into an individualised shape, a localised and\nlimited self, a bundle of habits. It has made the soul an Ego or self: a\npower which looks out upon the world as a spectator, lifted above\nimmanence in the general tide of being, but only so lifted because it has\nmade itself one in the world of objects, a thing among things. The Mind\nhas reached the point of view of reflection. Instead of a general\nidentifiability with all nature, it has encased itself in a limited range,\nfrom which it looks forth on what is now other than itself. If previously\nit was mere inward sensibility, it is now sense, perceptive of an object\nhere and now, of an external world. The step has involved some price: and\nthat price is, that it has attained independence and self-hood at the cost\nof surrendering the content it had hitherto held in one with itself. It is\nnow a blank receptivity, open to the impressions of an outside world: and\nthe changes which take place in its process of apprehension seem to it to\nbe given from outside. The world it perceives is a world of isolated and\nindependent objects: and it takes them as they are given. But a closer\ninsistance on the perception develops the implicit intelligence, which\nmakes it possible. The percipient mind is no mere recipiency or\nsusceptibility with its forms of time and space: it is spontaneously\nactive, it is the source of categories, or is an apperceptive power,\u2014an\nunderstanding. Consciousness, thus discovered to be a creative or\nconstructive faculty, is strictly speaking self-consciousness(90).\nSelf-consciousness appears at first in the selfish or narrowly egoistic\nform of appetite and impulse. The intelligence which claims to mould and\nconstrue the world of objects\u2014which, in Kant\u2019s phrase, professes to give\nus nature\u2014is implicitly the lord of that world. And that supremacy it\ncarries out as appetite\u2014as destruction. The self is but a bundle of\nwants\u2014its supremacy over things is really subjection to them: the\nsatisfaction of appetite is baffled by a new desire which leaves it as it\nwas before. The development of self-consciousness to a more adequate shape\nis represented by Hegel as taking place through the social struggle for\nexistence. Human beings, too, are in the first instance to the\nuninstructed appetite or the primitive self-consciousness (which is simply\na succession of individual desires for satisfaction of natural want) only\nthings,\u2014adjectival to that self\u2019s individual existence. To them, too, his\nprimary relation is to appropriate and master them. Might precedes right.\nBut the social struggle for existence forces him to recognise something\nother which is kindred to himself,\u2014a limiting principle, another self\nwhich has to form an element in his calculations, not to be neglected. And\ngradually, we may suppose, the result is the division of humanity into two\nlevels, a ruling lordly class, and a class of slaves,\u2014a state of\ninequality in which each knows that his appetite is in some measure\nchecked by a more or less permanent other. Lastly, perhaps soonest in the\ninferior order, there is fashioned the perception that its self-seeking in\nits isolated appetites is subject to an abiding authority, a continuing\nconsciousness. There grows up a social self\u2014a sense of general humanity\nand solidarity with other beings\u2014a larger self with which each identifies\nhimself, a common ground. Understanding was selfish intelligence:\npractical in the egoistic sense. In the altruistic or universal sense\npractical, a principle social and unifying character, intelligence is\nReason.\nThus, Man, beginning as a percipient consciousness, apprehending single\nobjects in space and time, and as an appetitive self bent upon single\ngratifications, has ended as a rational being,\u2014a consciousness purged of\nits selfishness and isolation, looking forward openly and impartially on\nthe universe of things and beings. He has ceased to be a mere animal,\nswallowed up in the moment and the individual, using his intelligence only\nin selfish satisfactions. He is no longer bound down by the struggle for\nexistence, looking on everything as a mere thing, a mere means. He has\nerected himself above himself and above his environment, but that because\nhe occupies a point of view at which he and his environment are no longer\npurely antithetical and exclusive(91). He has reached what is really the\nmoral standpoint: the point i.e. at which he is inspired by a universal\nself-consciousness, and lives in that peaceful world where the antitheses\nof individualities and of outward and inward have ceased to trouble. \u201cThe\nnatural man,\u201d says Hegel(92), \u201csees in the woman flesh of his flesh: the\nmoral and spiritual man sees spirit of his spirit in the moral and\nspiritual being and by its means.\u201d Hitherto we have been dealing with\nsomething falling below the full truth of mind: the region of immediate\nsensibility with its thorough immersion of mind in body, first of all, and\nsecondly its gradual progress to a general standpoint. It is only in the\nthird part of Subjective mind that we are dealing with the psychology of a\nbeing who in the human sense knows and wills, i.e. apprehends general\ntruth, and carries out ideal purposes.\nThus, for the third time, but now on a higher plane, that of intelligence\nand rationality, is traced the process of development or realisation by\nwhich reason becomes reasoned knowledge and rational will, a free or\nautonomous intelligence. And, as before, the starting-point, alike in\ntheoretical and practical mind, is feeling\u2014or immediate knowledge and\nimmediate sense of Ought. The basis of thought is an immediate\nperception\u2014a sensuous affection or given something, and the basis of the\nidea of a general satisfaction is the natural claim to determine the\noutward existence conformably to individual feeling. In intelligent\nperception or intuition the important factor is attention, which raises it\nabove mere passive acceptance and awareness of a given fact. Attention\nthus involves on one hand the externality of its object, and on the other\naffirms its dependence on the act of the subject: it sets the objects\nbefore and out of itself, in space and time, but yet in so doing it shows\nitself master of the objects. If perception presuppose attention, in\nshort, they cease to be wholly outward: we make them ours, and the space\nand time they fill are projected by us. So attended to, they are\nappropriated, inwardised and recollected: they take their place in a\nmental place and mental time: they receive a general or de-individualised\ncharacter in the memory-image. These are retained as mental property, but\nretained actually only in so far they are revivable and revived. Such\nrevival is the work of imagination working by the so-called laws of\nassociation. But the possession of its ideas thus inwardised and\nrecollected by the mind is largely a matter of chance. The mind is not\nreally fully master of them until it has been able to give them a certain\nobjectivity, by replacing the mental image by a vocal, i.e. a sensible\nsign. By means of words, intelligence turns its ideas or representations\ninto quasi-realities: it creates a sort of superior sense-world, the world\nof language, where ideas live a potential, which is also an actual, life.\nWords are sensibles, but they are sensibles which completely lose\nthemselves in their meaning. As sensibles, they render possible that\nverbal memory which is the handmaid of thought: but which also as merely\nmechanical can leave thought altogether out of account. It is through\nwords that thought is made possible: for it alone permits the movement\nthrough ideas without being distracted through a multitude of\nassociations. In them thought has an instrument completely at its own\nlevel, but still only a machine, and in memory the working of that\nmachine. We think in names, not in general images, but in terms which only\nserve as vehicles for mental synthesis and analysis.\nIt is as such a thinking being\u2014a being who can use language, and\nmanipulate general concepts or take comprehensive views, that man is a\nrational will. A concept of something to be done\u2014a feeling even of some\nend more or less comprehensive in its quality, is the implication of what\ncan be called will. At first indeed its material may be found as\nimmediately given and all its volitionality may lie in the circumstance\nthat the intelligent being sets this forward as a governing and\ncontrolling Ought. Its vehicle, in short, may be mere impulse, or\ninclination, and even passion: but it is the choice and the purposive\nadoption of means to the given end. Gradually it attains to the idea of a\ngeneral satisfaction, or of happiness. And this end seems positive and\ndefinite. It soon turns out however to be little but a prudent and\nself-denying superiority to particular passions and inclinations in the\ninterest of a comprehensive ideal. The free will or intelligence has so\nfar only a negative and formal value: it is the perfection of an\nautonomous and freely self-developing mind. Such a mind, which in language\nhas acquired the means of realising an intellectual system of things\nsuperior to the restrictions of sense, and which has emancipated reason\nfrom the position of slave to inclination, is endued with the formal\nconditions of moral conduct. Such a mind will transform its own primarily\nphysical dependence into an image of the law of reason and create the\nethical life: and in the strength of that establishment will go forth to\nconquer the world into a more and more adequate realisation of the eternal\nIdea.\nEssay V. Ethics And Politics.\n\u201cIn dealing,\u201d says Hegel, \u201cwith the Idea of the State, we must not have\nbefore our eyes a particular state, or a particular institution: we must\nrather study the Idea, this actual God, on his own account. Every State,\nhowever bad we may find it according to our principles, however defective\nwe may discover this or that feature to be, still contains, particularly\nif it belongs to the mature states of our time, all the essential factors\nof its existence. But as it is easier to discover faults than to\ncomprehend the affirmative, people easily fall into the mistake of letting\nindividual aspects obscure the intrinsic organism of the State itself. The\nState is no ideal work of art: it stands in the everyday world, in the\nsphere, that is, of arbitrary act, accident, and error, and a variety of\nfaults may mar the regularity of its traits. But the ugliest man, the\ncriminal, a sick man and a cripple, is after all a living man; the\naffirmative, Life, subsists in spite of the defect: and this affirmative\nis here the theme(93).\u201d \u201cIt is the theme of philosophy,\u201d he adds, \u201cto\nascertain the substance which is immanent in the show of the temporal and\ntransient, and the eternal which is present.\u201d\n(i.) Hegel as a Political Critic.\nBut if this is true, it is also to be remembered that the philosopher is,\nlike other men, the son of his age, and estimates the value of reality\nfrom preconceptions and aspirations due to his generation. The historical\ncircumstances of his nation as well as the personal experiences of his\nlife help to determine his horizon, even in the effort to discover the\nhidden pulse and movement of the social organism. This is specially\nobvious in political philosophy. The conception of ethics and politics\nwhich is presented in the _Encyclopaedia_ was in 1820 produced with more\ndetail as the _Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts_. Appearing, as it\ndid, two years after his appointment to a professorship at Berlin, and in\nthe midst of a political struggle between the various revolutionary and\nconservative powers and parties of Germany, the book became, and long\nremained, a target for embittered criticism. The so-called War of\nLiberation or national movement to shake off the French yoke was due to a\ncoalition of parties, and had naturally been in part supported by\ntendencies and aims which went far beyond the ostensive purpose either of\nleaders or of combatants. Aspirations after a freer state were entwined\nwith radical and socialistic designs to reform the political hierarchy of\nthe Fatherland: high ideals and low vulgarities were closely intermixed:\nand the noble enthusiasm of youth was occasionally played on by criminal\nand anarchic intriguers. In a strong and wise and united Germany some of\nthese schemes might have been tolerated. But strength, wisdom, and unity\nwere absent. In the existing tension between Austria and Prussia for the\nleadership, in the ill-adapted and effete constitutions of the several\nprincipalities which were yet expected to realise the advance which had\ntaken place in society and ideas during the last thirty years, the outlook\non every hand seemed darker and more threatening than it might have\notherwise done. Governments, which had lost touch with their peoples,\nsuspected conspiracy and treason: and a party in the nation credited their\nrulers with gratuitous designs against private liberty and rights. There\nwas a vast but ill-defined enthusiasm in the breasts of the younger world,\nand it was shared by many of their teachers. It seemed to their immense\naspirations that the war of liberation had failed of its true object and\nleft things much as they were. The volunteers had not fought for the\npolitical systems of Austria or Prussia, or for the three-and-thirty\nprinces of Germany: but for ideas, vague, beautiful, stimulating. To such\na mood the continuance of the old system was felt as a cruel deception and\na reaction. The governments on their part had not realised the full\nimportance of the spirit that had been aroused, and could not at a\nmoment\u2019s notice set their house in order, even had there been a clearer\noutlook for reform than was offered. They too had suffered, and had\nrealised their insecurity: and were hardly in a mood to open their gates\nto the enemy.\nComing on such a situation of affairs, Hegel\u2019s book would have been likely\nin any case to provoke criticism. For it took up a line of political\ntheory which was little in accord with the temper of the age. The\nconception of the state which it expounded is not far removed in\nessentials from the conception which now dominates the political life of\nthe chief European nations. But in his own time it came upon ears which\nwere naturally disposed to misconceive it. It was unacceptable to the\nadherents of the _ancien r\u00e9gime_, as much as to the liberals. It was\ndeclared by one party to be a glorification of the Prussian state: by\nanother to rationalise the sanctities of authority. It was pointed out\nthat the new professor was a favourite of the leading minister, that his\ninfluence was dominant in scholastic appointments, and that occasional\ngratuities from the crown proved his acceptability. A contemporary\nprofessor, Fries, remarked that Hegel\u2019s theory of the state had grown \u201cnot\nin the gardens of science but on the dung-hill of servility.\u201d Hegel\nhimself was aware that he had planted a blow in the face of a \u201cshallow and\npretentious sect,\u201d and that his book had \u201cgiven great offence to the\ndemagogic folk.\u201d Alike in religious and political life he was impatient of\nsentimentalism, of rhetorical feeling, of wordy enthusiasm. A positive\nstorm of scorn burst from him at much-promising and little-containing\ndeclamation that appealed to the pathos of ideas, without sense of the\ncomplex work of construction and the system of principles which were\nneeded to give them reality. His impatience of demagogic gush led him (in\nthe preface) into a tactless attack on Fries, who was at the moment in\ndisgrace for his participation in the demonstration at the Wartburg. It\nled him to an attack on the bumptiousness of those who held that\nconscientious conviction was ample justification for any proceeding:\u2014an\nattack which opponents were not unwilling to represent as directed against\nthe principle of conscience itself.\nYet Hegel\u2019s views on the nature of political unity were not new. Their\nnucleus had been formed nearly twenty years before. In the years that\nimmediately followed the French revolution he had gone through the usual\nanarchic stage of intelligent youth. He had wondered whether humanity\nmight not have had a nobler destiny, had fate given supremacy to some\nheresy rather than the orthodox creed of Christendom. He had seen religion\nin the past \u201cteaching what despotism wished,\u2014contempt of the human race,\nits incapacity for anything good(94).\u201d But his earliest reflections on\npolitical power belong to a later date, and are inspired, not so much by\nthe vague ideals of humanitarianism, as by the spirit of national\npatriotism. They are found in a \u201cCriticism of the German Constitution\u201d\napparently dating from the year 1802(95). It is written after the peace of\nLun\u00e9ville had sealed for Germany the loss of her provinces west of the\nRhine, and subsequent to the disasters of the German arms at Hohenlinden\nand Marengo. It is almost contemporaneous with the measures of 1803 and\n1804, which affirmed the dissolution of the \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d of German\nname. The writer of this unpublished pamphlet sees his country in a\nsituation almost identical with that which Macchiavelli saw around him in\nItaly. It is abused by petty despots, distracted by mean particularist\nambitions, at the mercy of every foreign power. It was such a scene which,\nas Hegel recalls, had prompted and justified the drastic measures proposed\nin the _Prince_,\u2014measures which have been ill-judged by the closet\nmoralist, but evince the high statesmanship of the Florentine. In the\n_Prince_, an intelligent reader can see \u201cthe enthusiasm of patriotism\nunderlying the cold and dispassionate doctrines.\u201d Macchiavelli dared to\ndeclare that Italy must become a state, and to assert that \u201cthere is no\nhigher duty for a state than to maintain itself, and to punish\nrelentlessly every author of anarchy,\u2014the supreme, and perhaps sole\npolitical crime.\u201d And like teaching, Hegel adds, is needed for Germany.\nOnly, he concludes, no mere demonstration of the insanity of utter\nseparation of the particular from his kin will ever succeed in converting\nthe particularists from their conviction of the absoluteness of personal\nand private rights. \u201cInsight and intelligence always excite so much\ndistrust that force alone avails to justify them; then man yields them\nobedience(96).\u201d\n\u201cThe German political edifice,\u201d says the writer, \u201cis nothing else but the\nsum of the rights which the single parts have withdrawn from the whole;\nand this justice, which is ever on the watch to prevent the state having\nany power left, is the essence of the constitution.\u201d The Peace of\nWestphalia had but served to constitute or stereotype anarchy: the German\nempire had by that instrument divested itself of all rights of political\nunity, and thrown itself on the goodwill of its members. What then, it may\nbe asked, is, in Hegel\u2019s view, the indispensable minimum essential to a\nstate? And the answer will be, organised strength,\u2014a central and united\nforce. \u201cThe strength of a country lies neither in the multitude of its\ninhabitants and fighting men, nor in its fertility, nor in its size, but\nsolely in the way its parts are by reasonable combination made a single\npolitical force enabling everything to be used for the common defence.\u201d\nHegel speaks scornfully of \u201cthe philanthropists and moralists who decry\npolitics as an endeavour and an art to seek private utility at the cost of\nright\u201d: he tells them that \u201cit is foolish to oppose the interest or (as it\nis expressed by the more morally-obnoxious word) the utility of the state\nto its right\u201d: that the \u201crights of a state are the utility of the state as\nestablished and recognised by compacts\u201d: and that \u201cwar\u201d (which they would\nfain abolish or moralise) \u201chas to decide not which of the rights asserted\nby either party is the true right (\u2014for both parties have a true right),\nbut which right has to give way to the other.\u201d\nIt is evident from these propositions that Hegel takes that view of\npolitical supremacy which has been associated with the name of Hobbes. But\nhis views also reproduce the Platonic king of men, \u201cwho can rule and dare\nnot lie.\u201d \u201cAll states,\u201d he declares, \u201care founded by the sublime force of\ngreat men, not by physical strength. The great man has something in his\nfeatures which others would gladly call their lord. They obey him against\ntheir will. Their immediate will is his will, but their conscious will is\notherwise.... This is the prerogative of the great man to ascertain and to\nexpress the absolute will. All gather round his banner. He is their God.\u201d\n\u201cThe state,\u201d he says again, \u201cis the self-certain absolute mind which\nrecognises no definite authority but its own: which acknowledges no\nabstract rules of good and bad, shameful and mean, craft and deception.\u201d\nSo also Hobbes describes the prerogatives of the sovereign Leviathan. But\nthe Hegelian God immanent in the state is a higher power than Hobbes\nknows: he is no mortal, but in his truth an immortal God. He speaks by\n(what in this early essay is called) the Absolute Government(97): the\ngovernment of the Law\u2014the true impersonal sovereign,\u2014distinct alike from\nthe single ruler and the multitude of the ruled. \u201cIt is absolutely only\nuniversality as against particular. As this absolute, ideal, universal,\ncompared to which everything else is a particular, it is the phenomenon of\nGod. Its words are his decision, and it can appear and exist under no\nother form.... The Absolute government is divine, self-sanctioned and not\nmade(98).\u201d The real strength\u2014the real connecting-mean which gives life to\nsovereign and to subject\u2014is intelligence free and entire, independent both\nof what individuals feel and believe and of the quality of the ruler. \u201cThe\nspiritual bond,\u201d he says in a lower form of speech, \u201cis public opinion: it\nis the true legislative body, national assembly, declaration of the\nuniversal will which lives in the execution of all commands.\u201d This still\nsmall voice of public opinion is the true and real parliament: not\nliterally making laws, but revealing them. If we ask, where does this\npublic opinion appear and how does it disengage itself from the masses of\npartisan judgment? Hegel answers,\u2014and to the surprise of those who have\nnot entered into the spirit of his age(99)\u2014it is embodied in the Aged and\nthe Priests. Both of these have ceased to live in the real world: they are\nby nature and function disengaged from the struggles of particular\nexistence, have risen above the divergencies of social classes. They\nbreathe the ether of pure contemplation. \u201cThe sunset of life gives them\nmystical lore,\u201d or at least removes from old age the distraction of\nselfishness: while the priest is by function set apart from the divisions\nof human interest. Understood in a large sense, Hegel\u2019s view is that the\nreal voice of experience is elicited through those who have attained\nindifference to the distorting influence of human parties, and who see\nlife steadily and whole.\nIf this utterance shows the little belief Hegel had in the ordinary\nmethods of legislation through \u201crepresentative\u201d bodies, and hints that the\nreal _substance_ of political life is deeper than the overt machinery of\npolitical operation, it is evident that this theory of \u201cdivine right\u201d is\nof a different stamp from what used to go under that name. And, again,\nthough the power of the central state is indispensable, he is far from\nagreeing with the so-called bureaucratic view that \u201ca state is a machine\nwith a single spring which sets in motion all the rest of the machinery.\u201d\n\u201cEverything,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is not directly required to organise and\nmaintain the force for giving security without and within must be left by\nthe central government to the freedom of the citizens. Nothing ought to be\nso sacred in the eyes of a government as to leave alone and to protect,\nwithout regard to utilities, the free action of the citizens in such\nmatters as do not affect its fundamental aim: for this freedom is itself\nsacred(100).\u201d He is no friend of paternal bureaucracy. \u201cThe pedantic\ncraving to settle every detail, the mean jealousy against estates and\ncorporations administrating and directing their own affairs, the base\nfault-finding with all independent action on the part of the citizens,\neven when it has no immediate bearing on the main political interest, has\nbeen decked out with reasons to show that no penny of public expenditure,\nmade for a country of twenty or thirty millions\u2019 population, can be laid\nout, without first being, not permitted, but commanded, controlled and\nrevised by the supreme government.\u201d You can see, he remarks, in the first\nvillage after you enter Prussian territory the lifeless and wooden routine\nwhich prevails. The whole country suffers also from the way religion has\nbeen mixed up with political rights, and a particular creed pronounced by\nlaw indispensable both for sovereign and full-privileged subject. In a\nword, the unity and vigour of the state is quite compatible with\nconsiderable latitude and divergence in laws and judicature, in the\nimposition and levying of taxes, in language, manners, civilisation and\nreligion. Equality in all these points is desirable for social unity: but\nit is not indispensable for political strength.\nThis decided preference for the unity of the state against the system of\nchecks and counterchecks, which sometimes goes by the name of a\nconstitution, came out clearly in Hegel\u2019s attitude in discussing the\ndispute between the W\u00fcrtembergers and their sovereign in 1815-16.\nW\u00fcrtemberg, with its complicated aggregation of local laws, had always\nbeen a paradise of lawyers, and the feudal rights or privileges of the\nlocal oligarchies\u2014the so-called \u201cgood old law\u201d\u2014were the boast of the\ncountry. All this had however been aggravated by the increase of territory\nreceived in 1805: and the king, following the examples set by France and\neven by Bavaria, promulgated of his own grace a \u201cconstitution\u201d remodelling\nthe electoral system of the country. Immediately an outcry burst out\nagainst the attempt to destroy the ancient liberties. Uhland tuned his\nlyre to the popular cry: R\u00fcckert sang on the king\u2019s side. To Hegel the\ncontest presented itself as a struggle between the attachment to\ntraditional rights, merely because they are old, and the resolution to\ncarry out reasonable reform whether it be agreeable to the reformed or\nnot: or rather he saw in it resistance of particularism, of separation,\nclinging to use and wont, and basing itself on formal pettifogging\nobjections, against the spirit of organisation. Anything more he declined\nto see. And probably he was right in ascribing a large part of the\nopposition to inertia, to vanity and self-interest, combined with the want\nof political perception of the needs of W\u00fcrtemberg and Germany. But on the\nother hand, he failed to remember the insecurity and danger of such \u201cgifts\nof the Danai\u201d: he forgot the sense of free-born men that a constitution is\nnot something to be granted (_octroy\u00e9_) as a grace, but something that\nmust come by the spontaneous act of the innermost self of the community.\nHe dealt rather with the formal arguments which were used to refuse\nprogress, than with the underlying spirit which prompted the\nopposition(101).\nThe philosopher lives (as Plato has well reminded us) too exclusively\nwithin the ideal. Bent on the essential nucleus of institutions, he\nattaches but slight importance to the variety of externals, and fails to\nrealise the practice of the law-courts. He forgets that what weighs\nlightly in logic, may turn the scale in real life and experience. For\nfeeling and sentiment he has but scant respect: he is brusque and\nuncompromising: and cannot realise all the difficulties and dangers that\nbeset the Idea in the mazes of the world, and may ultimately quite alter a\nplan which at first seemed independent of petty details. Better than other\nmen perhaps he recognises in theory how the mere universal only exists\ncomplete in an individual shape: but more than other men he forgets these\ntruths of insight, when the business of life calls for action or for\njudgment. He cannot at a moment\u2019s notice remember that he is, if not, as\nCicero says, _in faece Romuli_, the member of a degenerate commonwealth,\nat least living in a world where good and evil are not, as logic\npresupposes, sharply divided but intricately intertwined.\n(ii.) The Ethics and Religion of the State.\nThis idealism of political theory is illustrated by the sketch of the\nEthical Life which he drew up about 1802. Under the name of \u201cEthical\nSystem\u201d it presents in concentrated or undeveloped shape the doctrine\nwhich subsequently swelled into the \u201cPhilosophy of Mind.\u201d At a later date\nhe worked out more carefully as introduction the psychological genesis of\nmoral and intelligent man, and he separated out more distinctly as a\nsequel the universal powers which give to social life its higher\ncharacters. In the earlier sketch the Ethical Part stands by itself, with\nthe consequence that Ethics bears a meaning far exceeding all that had\nbeen lately called moral. The word \u201cmoral\u201d itself he avoids(102). It\nsavours of excessive subjectivity, of struggle, of duty and conscience. It\nhas an ascetic ring about it\u2014an aspect of negation, which seeks for\nabstract holiness, and turns its back on human nature. Kant\u2019s words\nopposing duty to inclination, and implying that moral goodness involves a\nstruggle, an antagonism, a victory, seem to him (and to his time)\none-sided. That aspect of negation accordingly which Kant certainly began\nwith, and which Schopenhauer magnified until it became the all-in-all of\nEthics, Hegel entirely subordinates. Equally little does he like the\nemphasis on the supremacy of insight, intention, conscience: they lead, he\nthinks, to a view which holds the mere fact of conviction to be\nall-important, as if it mattered not what we thought and believed and did,\nso long as we were sincere in our belief. All this emphasis on the\ngood-will, on the imperative of duty, on the rights of conscience, has, he\nadmits, its justification in certain circumstances, as against mere\nlegality, or mere natural instinctive goodness; but it has been overdone.\nAbove all, it errs by an excess of individualism. It springs from an\nattitude of reflection,\u2014in which the individual, isolated in his conscious\nand superficial individuality, yet tries\u2014but probably tries in vain\u2014to get\nsomewhat in touch with a universal which he has allowed to slip outside\nhim, forgetting that it is the heart and substance of his life. Kant,\nindeed, hardly falls under this condemnation. For he aims at showing that\nthe rational will inevitably creates as rational a law or universal; that\nthe individual act becomes self-regulative, and takes its part in\nconstituting a system or realm of duty.\nStill, on the whole, \u201cmorality\u201d in this narrower sense belongs to an age\nof reflection, and is formal or nominal goodness rather than the genuine\nand full reality. It is the protest against mere instinctive or customary\nvirtue, which is but compliance with traditional authority, and compliance\nwith it as if it were a sort of quasi-natural law. Moralising reflection\nis the awakening of subjectivity and of a deeper personality. The age\nwhich thus precedes morality is not an age in which kindness, or love, or\ngenerosity is unknown. And if Hegel says that \u201cMorality,\u201d strictly so\ncalled, began with Socrates, he does not thereby accuse the pre-Socratic\nGreeks of inhumanity. But what he does say is that such ethical life as\nexisted was in the main a thing of custom and law: of law, moreover, which\nwas not set objectively forward, but left still in the stage of\nuncontradicted usage, a custom which was a second nature, part of the\nessential and quasi-physical ordinance of life. The individual had not yet\nlearned to set his self-consciousness against these usages and ask for\ntheir justification. These are like the so-called law of the Medes and\nPersians which alters not: customs of immemorial antiquity and\nunquestionable sway. They are part of a system of things with which for\ngood or evil the individual is utterly identified, bound as it were hand\nand foot. These are, as a traveller says(103), \u201coral and unwritten\ntraditions which teach that certain rules of conduct are to be observed\nunder certain penalties; and without the aid of fixed records, or the\nintervention of a succession of authorised depositaries and expounders,\nthese laws have been transmitted to father and son, through unknown\ngenerations, and are fixed in the minds of the people as sacred and\nunalterable.\u201d\nThe antithesis then in Hegel, as in Kant, is between Law and Morality, or\nrather Legality and Morality,\u2014two abstractions to which human development\nis alternately prone to attach supreme importance. The first stage in the\nobjectivation of intelligence or in the evolution of personality is the\nconstitution of mere, abstract, or strict right. It is the creation of\ninstitutions and uniformities, i.e. of laws, or rights, which express\ndefinite and stereotyped modes of behaviour. Or, if we look at it from the\nindividual\u2019s standpoint, we may say his consciousness awakes to find the\nworld parcelled out under certain rules and divisions, which have\nobjective validity, and govern him with the same absolute authority as do\nthe circumstances of physical nature. Under their influence every rank and\nindividual is alike forced to bow: to each his place and function is\nassigned by an order or system which claims an inviolable and eternal\nsupremacy. It is not the same place and function for each: but for each\nthe position and duties are predetermined in this metaphysically-physical\norder. The situation and its duties have been created by super-human and\nnatural ordinance. As the Platonic myth puts it, each order in the social\nhierarchy has been framed underground by powers that turned out men of\ngold, and silver, and baser metal: or as the Norse legend tells, they are\nthe successive offspring of the white God, Heimdal, in his dealings with\nwomankind.\nThe central idea of the earlier social world is the supremacy of\nrights\u2014but not of right. The sum (for it cannot be properly called a\nsystem) of rights is a self-subsistent world, to which man is but a\nservant; and a second peculiarity of it is its inequality. If all are\nequal before the laws, this only means here that the laws, with their\nabsolute and thorough inequality, are indifferent to the real and personal\ndiversities of individuals. Even the so-called equality of primitive law\nis of the \u201cEye-for-eye, Tooth-for-tooth\u201d kind; it takes no note of special\ncircumstances; it looks abstractly and rudely at facts, and maintains a\nhard and fast uniformity, which seems the height of unfairness. Rule\nstands by rule, usage beside usage,\u2014a mere aggregate or multitude of petty\ntyrants, reduced to no unity or system, and each pressing with all the\nweight of an absolute mandate. The pettiest bit of ceremonial law is here\nof equal dignity with the most far-reaching principle of political\nobligation.\nIn the essay already referred to, Hegel has designated something analogous\nto this as Natural or Physical Ethics, or as Ethics in its relative or\ncomparative stage. Here Man first shows his superiority to nature, or\nenters on his properly ethical function, by transforming the physical\nworld into his possession. He makes himself the lord of natural\nobjects\u2014stamping them as his, and not their own, making them his permanent\nproperty, his tools, his instruments of exchange and production. The\nfundamental ethical act is appropriation by labour, and the first ethical\nworld is the creation of an economic system, the institution of property.\nFor property, or at least possession and appropriation, is the dominant\nidea, with its collateral and sequent principles. And at first, even human\nbeings are treated on the same method as other things: as objects in a\nworld of objects or aggregate of things: as things to be used and\nacquired, as means and instruments,\u2014not in any sense as ends in\nthemselves. It is a world in which the relation of master and slave is\ndominant,\u2014where owner and employer is set in antithesis against his tools\nand chattels. But the Nemesis of his act issues in making the individual\nthe servant of his so-called property. He has become an objective power by\nsubmitting himself to objectivity: he has literally put himself into the\nobject he has wrought, and is now a thing among things: for what he owns,\nwhat he has appropriated, determines what he is. The real powers in the\nworld thus established are the laws of possession-holding: the laws\ndominate man: and he is only freed from dependence on casual externals, by\nmaking himself thoroughly the servant of his possessions.\nThe only salvation, and it is but imperfect, that can be reached on this\nstage is by the family union. The sexual tie, is at first entirely on a\nlevel with the other arrangements of the sphere. The man or woman is but a\nchattel and a tool; a casual appropriation which gradually is transformed\ninto a permanent possession and a permanent bond(104). But, as the family\nconstituted itself, it helped to afford a promise of better things. An\nideal interest\u2014the religion of the household\u2014extending beyond the\nindividual, and beyond the moment,\u2014binding past and present, and parents\nto offspring, gave a new character to the relation of property. Parents\nand children form a unity, which overrides and essentially permeates their\n\u201cdifference\u201d from each other: there is no exchange, no contract, nor, in\nthe stricter sense, property between the members. In the property-idea\nthey are lifted out of their isolation, and in the continuity of family\nlife there is a certain analogue of immortality. But, says Hegel, \u201cthough\nthe family be the highest totality of which Nature is capable, the\nabsolute identity is in it still inward, and is not instituted in absolute\nform; and hence, too, the reproduction of the totality is an appearance,\nthe appearance of the children(105).\u201d \u201cThe power and the intelligence, the\n\u2018difference\u2019 of the parents, stands in inverse proportion to the youth and\nvigour of the child: and these two sides of life flee from and are sequent\non each other, and are reciprocally external(106).\u201d Or, as we may put it,\nthe god of the family is a departed ancestor, a ghost in the land of the\ndead: it has not really a continuous and unified life. In such a state of\nsociety\u2014a state of nature\u2014and in its supreme form, the family, there is no\nadequate principle which though real shall still give ideality and unity\nto the self-isolating aspects of life. There is wanted something which\nshall give expression to its \u201cindifference,\u201d which shall control the\ntendency of this partial moralisation to sink at every moment into\nindividuality, and lift it from its immersion in nature. Family life and\neconomic groups (\u2014for these two, which Hegel subsequently separates, are\nhere kept close together) need an ampler and wider life to keep them from\nstagnating in their several selfishnesses.\nThis freshening and corrective influence they get in the first instance\nfrom deeds of violence and crime. Here is the \u201cnegative unsettling\u201d of the\nnarrow fixities, of the determinate conditions or relationships into which\nthe preceding processes of labour and acquisition have tended to\nstereotype life. The harsh restriction brings about its own undoing. Man\nmay subject natural objects to his formative power, but the wild rage of\nsenseless devastation again and again bursts forth to restore the original\nformlessness. He may build up his own pile of wealth, store up his private\ngoods, but the thief and the robber with the instincts of barbarian\nsocialism tread on his steps: and every stage of appropriation has for its\nsequel a crop of acts of dispossession. He may secure by accumulation his\nfuture life; but the murderer for gain\u2019s sake cuts it short. And out of\nall this as a necessary consequence stands avenging justice. And in the\nnatural world of ethics\u2014where true moral life has not yet arisen\u2014this is\nmere retaliation or the _lex talionis_;\u2014the beginning of an endless series\nof vengeance and counter-vengeance, the blood-feud. Punishment, in the\nstricter sense of the term,\u2014which looks both to antecedents and effects in\ncharacter\u2014cannot yet come into existence; for to punish there must be\nsomething superior to individualities, an ethical idea embodied in an\ninstitution, to which the injurer and the injured alike belong. But as yet\npunishment is only vengeance, the personal and natural equivalent, the\nphysical reaction against injury, perhaps regulated and formulated by\ncustom and usage, but not essentially altered from its purely retaliatory\ncharacter. These crimes\u2014or transgressions\u2014are thus by Hegel quaintly\nconceived as storms which clear the air\u2014which shake the individualist out\nof his slumber. The scene in which transgression thus acts is that of the\nso-called state of nature, where particularism was rampant: where moral\nright was not, but only the right of nature, of pre-occupation, of the\nstronger, of the first maker and discoverer. Crime is thus the \u201cdialectic\u201d\nwhich shakes the fixity of practical arrangements, and calls for something\nin which the idea of a higher unity, a permanent substance of life, shall\nfind realisation.\nThe \u201cpositive supersession(107)\u201d of individualism and naturalism in ethics\nis by Hegel called \u201cAbsolute Ethics.\u201d Under this title he describes the\nethics and religion of the state\u2014a religion which is immanent in the\ncommunity, and an ethics which rises superior to particularity. The\npicture he draws is a romance fashioned upon the model of the Greek\ncommonwealth as that had been idealised by Greek literature and by the\nlongings of later ages for a freer life. It is but one of the many modes\nin which Helena\u2014to quote Goethe\u2014has fascinated the German Faust. He dreams\nhimself away from the prosaic worldliness of a German municipality to the\nunfading splendour of the Greek city with its imagined coincidence of\nindividual will with universal purpose. There is in such a commonwealth no\npain of surrender and of sacrifice, and no subsequent compensation: for,\nat the very moment of resigning self-will to common aims, he enjoys it\nretained with the added zest of self-expansion. He is not so left to\nhimself as to feel from beyond the restraint of a law which controls\u2014even\nif it wisely and well controls\u2014individual effort. There is for his happy\ncircumstances no possibility of doing otherwise. Or, it may be, Hegel has\nreminiscences from the ideals of other nations than the Greek. He recalls\nthe Israelite depicted by the Law-adoring psalmist, whose delight is to do\nthe will of the Lord, whom the zeal of God\u2019s house has consumed, whose\nwhole being runs on in one pellucid stream with the universal and eternal\nstream of divine commandment. Such a frame of spirit, where the empirical\nconsciousness with all its soul and strength and mind identifies its\nmission into conformity with the absolute order, is the mood of absolute\nEthics. It is what some have spoken of as the True life, as the Eternal\nlife; in it, says Hegel, the individual exists _auf ewige Weise_(108), as\nit were _sub specie aeternitatis_: his life is hid with his fellows in the\ncommon life of his people. His every act, and thought, and will, get their\nbeing and significance from a reality which is established in him as a\npermanent spirit. It is there that he, in the fuller sense, attains\n\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, or finds himself no longer a mere part, but an ideal totality.\nThis totality is realised under the particular form of a Nation (_Volk_),\nwhich in the visible sphere represents (or rather is, as a particular) the\nabsolute and infinite. Such a unity is neither the mere sum of isolated\nindividuals, nor a mere majority ruling by numbers: but the fraternal and\norganic commonwealth which brings all classes and all rights from their\nparticularistic independence into an ideal identity and indifference(109).\nHere all are not merely equal before the laws: but the law itself is a\nliving and organic unity, self-correcting, subordinating and organising,\nand no longer merely defining individual privileges and so-called\nliberties. \u201cIn such conjunction of the universal with the particularity\nlies the divinity of a nation: or, if we give this universal a separate\nplace in our ideas, it is the God of the nation.\u201d But in this complete\naccordance between concept and intuition, between visible and invisible,\nwhere symbol and significate are one, religion and ethics are\nindistinguishable. It is the old conception (and in its highest sense) of\nTheocracy(110). God is the national head and the national life: and in him\nall individuals have their \u201cdifference\u201d rendered \u201cindifferent.\u201d \u201cSuch an\nethical life is absolute truth, for untruth is only in the fixture of a\nsingle mode: but in the everlasting being of the nation all singleness is\nsuperseded. It is absolute culture; for in the eternal is the real and\nempirical annihilation and prescription of all limited modality. It is\nabsolute disinterestedness: for in the eternal there is nothing private\nand personal. It, and each of its movements, is the highest beauty: for\nbeauty is but the eternal made actual and given concrete shape. It is\nwithout pain, and blessed: for in it all difference and all pain is\nsuperseded. It is the divine, absolute, real, existing and being, under no\nveil; nor need one first raise it up into the ideality of divinity, and\nextract it from the appearance and empirical intuition; but it is, and\nimmediately, absolute intuition(111).\u201d\nIf we compare this language with the statement of the Encyclopaedia we can\nsee how for the moment Hegel\u2019s eye is engrossed with the glory of the\nideal nation. In it, the moral life embraces and is co-extensive with\nreligion, art and science: practice and theory are at one: life in the\nidea knows none of those differences which, in the un-ideal world, make\nart and morality often antithetical, and set religion at variance with\nscience. It is, as we have said, a memory of Greek and perhaps Hebrew\nideals. Or rather it is by the help of such memories the affirmation of\nthe essential unity of life\u2014the true, complete, many-sided life\u2014which is\nthe presupposition and idea that culture and morals rest upon and from\nwhich they get their supreme sanction, i.e. their constitutive principle\nand unity. Even in the Encyclopaedia(112) Hegel endeavours to guard\nagainst the severance of morality and art and philosophy which may be\nrashly inferred in consequence of his serial order of treatment.\n\u201cReligion,\u201d he remarks, \u201cis the very substance of the moral life itself\nand of the state.... The ethical life is the divine spirit indwelling in\nconsciousness, as it is actually present in a nation and its individual\nmembers.\u201d Yet, as we see, there is a distinction. The process of history\ncarries out a judgment on nation after nation, and reveals the divine as\nnot only immanent in the ethical life but as ever expanding the limited\nnational spirit till it become a spirit of universal humanity. Still\u2014and\nthis is perhaps for each time always the more important\u2014the national\nunity\u2014not indeed as a multitude, nor as a majority\u2014is the supreme real\nappearance of the Eternal and Absolute.\nHaving thus described the nation as an organic totality, he goes on to\npoint out that the political constitution shows this character by forming\na triplicity of political orders. In one of these there is but a silent,\npractical identity, in faith and trust, with the totality: in the second\nthere is a thorough disruption of interest into particularity: and in the\nthird, there is a living and intellectual identity or indifference, which\ncombines the widest range of individual development with the completest\nunity of political loyalty. This last order is that which lives in\nconscious identification of private with public duty: all that it does has\na universal and public function. Such a body is the ideal Nobility\u2014the\nnobility which is the _servus servorum Dei_, the supreme servant of\nhumanity. Its function is to maintain general interests, to give the other\norders (peasantry and industrials) security,\u2014receiving in return from\nthese others the means of subsistence. _Noblesse oblige_ gives the\ndeath-blow to particular interests, and imposes the duty of exhibiting, in\nthe clearest form, the supreme reality of absolute morality, and of being\nto the rest an unperturbed ideal of aesthetic, ethical, religious, and\nphilosophical completeness.\nIt is here alone, in this estate which is absolutely disinterested, that\nthe virtues appear in their true light. To the ordinary moralising\nstandpoint they seem severally to be, in their separation, charged with\nindependent value. But from the higher point of view the existence, and\nstill more the accentuation of single virtues, is a mark of\nincompleteness. Even quality, it has been said, involves its defects: it\ncan only shine by eclipsing or reflecting something else. The completely\nmoral is not the sum of the several virtues, but the reduction of them to\nindifference. It is thus that when Plato tries to get at the unity of\nvirtue, their aspect of difference tends to be subordinated. \u201cThe movement\nof absolute morality runs through all the virtues, but settles fixedly in\nnone.\u201d It is more than love _to_ fatherland, and nation, and laws:\u2014that\nstill implies a relation to something and involves a difference. For\nlove\u2014the mortal passion, where \u201cself is not annulled\u201d\u2014is the process of\napproximation, while unity is not yet attained, but wished and aimed at:\nand when it is complete\u2014and become \u201csuch love as spirits know(113)\u201d\u2014it\ngives place to a calmer rest and an active immanence. The absolute\nmorality is _life in_ the fatherland and for the nation. In the individual\nhowever it is the process upward and inward that we see, not the\nconsummation. Then the identity appears as an ideal, as a tendency not yet\naccomplished to its end, a possibility not yet made fully actual. At\nbottom\u2014in the divine substance in which the individual inheres\u2014the\nidentity is present: but in the appearance, we have only the passage from\npossible to actual, a passage which has the aspect of a struggle. Hence\nthe moral act appears as a virtue, with merit or desert. It is accordingly\nthe very characteristic of virtue to signalise its own incompleteness: it\nemerges into actuality only through antagonism, and with a taint of\nimperfection clinging to it. Thus, in the field of absolute morality, if\nthe virtues appear, it is only in their transiency. If they were\nundisputedly real in morality, they would not separately show. To feel\nthat you have done well implies that you have not done wholly well:\nself-gratulation in meritorious deed is the re-action from the shudder at\nfeeling that the self was not wholly good.\nThe essential unity of virtue\u2014its negative character as regards all the\nempirical variety of virtues\u2014is seen in the excellences required by the\nneeds of war. These military requirements demonstrate the mere relativity\nand therefore non-virtuousness of the special virtues. They equally\nprotest against the common beliefs in the supreme dignity of labour and\nits utilities. But if bravery or soldierlike virtue be essentially a\nvirtue of virtues, it is only a negative virtue after all. It is the blast\nof the universal sweeping away all the habitations and fixed structures of\nparticularist life. If it is a unity of virtue, it is only a negative\nunity\u2014an indifference. If it avoid the parcelling of virtue into a number\nof imperfect and sometimes contradictory parts, it does so only to present\na bare negation. The soldier, therefore, if in potentiality the unity of\nall the virtues, may tend in practice to represent the ability to do\nwithout any of them(114).\nThe home of these \u201crelative\u201d virtues\u2014of morality in the ordinary sense\u2014is\nthe life of the second order in the commonwealth: the order of industry\nand commerce. In this sphere the idea of the universal is gradually lost\nto view: it becomes, says Hegel, only a thought or a creature of the mind,\nwhich does not affect practice. The materialistic worker of civilisation\ndoes not see further than the empirical existence of individuals: his\nhorizon is limited by the family, and his final ideal is a competency of\ncomfort in possessions and revenues. The supreme universal to which he\nattains as the climax of his evolution is only money. But it is only with\nthe vaster development of commerce that this terrible consequence ensues.\nAt first as a mere individual, he has higher aims, though not the highest.\nHe has a limited ideal determined by his special sphere of work. To win\nrespect\u2014the character for a limited truthfulness and honesty and skilful\nwork\u2014is his ambition. He lives in a conceit of his performance\u2014his\nutility\u2014the esteem of his special circle. To his commercial soul the\nmilitary order is a scarecrow and a nuisance: military honour is but\ntrash. Yet if his range of idea is narrow and engrossing in details, his\naim is to get worship, to be recognised as the best in his little sphere.\nBut with the growth of the trading spirit his character changes: he\nbecomes the mere capitalist, is denationalised, has no definite work and\ncan claim no individualised function. Money now measures all things: it is\nthe sole ultimate reality. It transforms everything into a relation of\ncontract: even vengeance is equated in terms of money. Its motto is, The\nExchanges must be honoured, though honour and morality may go to the dogs.\nSo far as it is concerned, there is no nation, but a federation of\nshopkeepers. Such an one is the _bourgeois_ (the _B\u00fcrger_, as distinct\nfrom the peasant or _Bauer_ and the _Adel_). As an artisan\u2014i.e. a mere\nindustrial, he knows no country, but at best the reputation and interest\nof his own guild-union with its partial object. He is narrow, but honest\nand respectable. As a mere commercial agent, he knows no country: his\nfield is the world, but the world not in its concreteness and variety, but\nin the abstract aspect of a money-bag and an exchange. The larger totality\nis indeed not altogether out of sight. But if he contribute to the needy,\neither his sacrifice is lifeless in proportion as it becomes general, or\nloses generality as it becomes lively. As regards his general services to\nthe great life of his national state(115), they are unintelligently and\nperhaps grudgingly rendered.\nOf the peasant order Hegel has less to say. On one side the \u201ccountry\u201d as\nopposed to the \u201ctown\u201d has a closer natural sympathy with the common and\ngeneral interest: and the peasantry is the undifferentiated, solid and\nsound, basis of the national life. It forms the submerged mass, out of\nwhich the best soldiers are made, and which out of the depths of earth\nbrings forward nourishment as well as all the materials of elementary\nnecessity. Faithfulness and loyalty are its virtues: but it is personal\nallegiance to a commanding superior,\u2014not to a law or a general view\u2014for\nthe peasant is weak in comprehensive intelligence, though shrewd in\ndetailed observation.\nOf the purely political function of the state Hegel in this sketch says\nalmost nothing. But under the head of the general government of the state\nhe deals with its social functions. For a moment he refers to the\nwell-known distinction of the legislative, judicial and executive powers.\nBut it is only to remark that \u201cin every governmental act all three are\nconjoined. They are abstractions, none of which can get a reality of its\nown,\u2014which, in other words, cannot be constituted and organised as powers.\nLegislation, judicature, and executive are something completely formal,\nempty, and contentless.... Whether the others are or are not bare\nabstractions, empty activities, depends entirely on the executive power;\nand this is absolutely the government(116).\u201d Treating government as the\norganic movement by which the universal and the particular in the\ncommonwealth come into relations, he finds that it presents three forms,\nor gives rise to three systems. The highest and last of these is the\n\u201ceducational\u201d system. By this he understands all that activity by which\nthe intelligence of the state tries directly to mould and guide the\ncharacter and fortunes of its members: all the means of culture and\ndiscipline, whether in general or for individuals, all training to public\nfunction, to truthfulness, to good manners. Under the same head come\nconquest and colonisation as state agencies. The second system is the\njudicial, which instead of, like the former, aiming at the formation or\nreformation of its members is satisfied by subjecting individual\ntransgression to a process of rectification by the general principle. With\nregard to the system of judicature, Hegel argues for a variety of\nprocedure to suit different ranks, and for a corresponding modification of\npenalties. \u201cFormal rigid equality is just what does not spare the\ncharacter. The same penalty which in one estate brings no infamy causes in\nanother a deep and irremediable hurt.\u201d And with regard to the after life\nof the transgressor who has borne his penalty: \u201cPunishment is the\nreconciliation of the law with itself. No further reproach for his crime\ncan be addressed to the person who has undergone his punishment. He is\nrestored to membership of his estate(117).\u201d\nIn the first of the three systems, the economic system, or \u201cSystem of\nwants,\u201d the state seems at first hardly to appear in its universal and\ncontrolling function at all. Here the individual depends for the\nsatisfaction of his physical needs on a blind, unconscious destiny, on the\nobscure and incalculable properties of supply and demand in the whole\ninterconnexion of commodities. But even this is not all. With the\naccumulation of wealth in inequality, and the growth of vast capitals,\nthere is substituted for the dependence of the individual on the general\nresultant of a vast number of agencies a dependence on one enormously rich\nindividual, who can control the physical destinies of a nation. But a\nnation, truly speaking, is there no more. The industrial order has parted\ninto a mere abstract workman on one hand, and the _grande richesse_ on the\nother. \u201cIt has lost its capacity of an organic absolute intuition and of\nrespect for the divine\u2014external though its divinity be: and there sets in\nthe bestiality of contempt for all that is noble. The mere wisdomless\nuniversal, the mass of wealth, is the essential: and the ethical\nprinciple, the absolute bond of the nation, is vanished; and the nation is\ndissolved(118).\u201d\nIt would be a long and complicated task to sift, in these ill-digested but\nprofound suggestions, the real meaning from the formal statement. They\nare, like Utopia, beyond the range of practical politics. The modern\nreader, whose political conceptions are limited by contemporary\ncircumstance, may find them archaic, medieval, quixotic. But for those who\nbehind the words and forms can see the substance and the idea, they will\nperhaps come nearer the conception of ideal commonwealth than many\nreforming programmes. Compared with the maturer statements of the\n_Philosophy of Law_, they have the faults of the Romantic age to which\ntheir inception belongs. Yet even in that later exposition there is upheld\nthe doctrine of the supremacy of the eternal State against everything\nparticular, class-like, and temporary; a doctrine which has made Hegel\u2014as\nit made Fichte\u2014a voice in that \u201cprofessorial socialism\u201d which is at least\nas old as Plato.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\u00a7 377. The knowledge of Mind is the highest and hardest, just because it\nis the most \u201cconcrete\u201d of sciences. The significance of that \u201cabsolute\u201d\ncommandment, _Know thyself_\u2014whether we look at it in itself or under the\nhistorical circumstances of its first utterance\u2014is not to promote mere\nself-knowledge in respect of the _particular_ capacities, character,\npropensities, and foibles of the single self. The knowledge it commands\nmeans that of man\u2019s genuine reality\u2014of what is essentially and ultimately\ntrue and real\u2014of mind as the true and essential being. Equally little is\nit the purport of mental philosophy to teach what is called _knowledge of\nmen_\u2014the knowledge whose aim is to detect the _peculiarities_, passions,\nand foibles of other men, and lay bare what are called the recesses of the\nhuman heart. Information of this kind is, for one thing, meaningless,\nunless on the assumption that we know the _universal_\u2014man as man, and,\nthat always must be, as mind. And for another, being only engaged with\ncasual, insignificant and _untrue_ aspects of mental life, it fails to\nreach the underlying essence of them all\u2014the mind itself.\n\u00a7 378. Pneumatology, or, as it was also called, Rational Psychology, has\nbeen already alluded to in the Introduction to the Logic as an _abstract_\nand generalising metaphysic of the subject. _Empirical_ (or inductive)\npsychology, on the other hand, deals with the \u201cconcrete\u201d mind: and, after\nthe revival of the sciences, when observation and experience had been made\nthe distinctive methods for the study of concrete reality, such psychology\nwas worked on the same lines as other sciences. In this way it came about\nthat the metaphysical theory was kept outside the inductive science, and\nso prevented from getting any concrete embodiment or detail: whilst at the\nsame time the inductive science clung to the conventional common-sense\nmetaphysic, with its analysis into forces, various activities, &c., and\nrejected any attempt at a \u201cspeculative\u201d treatment.\nThe books of Aristotle on the Soul, along with his discussions on its\nspecial aspects and states, are for this reason still by far the most\nadmirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this\ntopic. The main aim of a philosophy of mind can only be to re-introduce\nunity of idea and principle into the theory of mind, and so re-interpret\nthe lesson of those Aristotelian books.\n\u00a7 379. Even our own sense of the mind\u2019s _living_ unity naturally protests\nagainst any attempt to break it up into different faculties, forces, or,\nwhat comes to the same thing, activities, conceived as independent of each\nother. But the craving for a _comprehension_ of the unity is still further\nstimulated, as we soon come across distinctions between mental freedom and\nmental determinism, antitheses between free _psychic_ agency and the\ncorporeity that lies external to it, whilst we equally note the intimate\ninterdependence of the one upon the other. In modern times especially the\nphenomena of _animal magnetism_ have given, even in experience, a lively\nand visible confirmation of the underlying unity of soul, and of the power\nof its \u201cideality.\u201d Before these facts, the rigid distinctions of practical\ncommon sense were struck with confusion; and the necessity of a\n\u201cspeculative\u201d examination with a view to the removal of difficulties was\nmore directly forced upon the student.\n\u00a7 380. The \u201cconcrete\u201d nature of mind involves for the observer the\npeculiar difficulty that the several grades and special types which\ndevelop its intelligible unity in detail are not left standing as so many\nseparate existences confronting its more advanced aspects. It is otherwise\nin external nature. There, matter and movement, for example, have a\nmanifestation all their own\u2014it is the solar system; and similarly the\n_differentiae_ of sense-perception have a sort of earlier existence in the\nproperties of _bodies_, and still more independently in the four elements.\nThe species and grades of mental evolution, on the contrary, lose their\nseparate existence and become factors, states and features in the higher\ngrades of development. As a consequence of this, a lower and more abstract\naspect of mind betrays the presence in it, even to experience, of a higher\ngrade. Under the guise of sensation, e.g., we may find the very highest\nmental life as its modification or its embodiment. And so sensation, which\nis but a mere form and vehicle, may to the superficial glance seem to be\nthe proper seat and, as it were, the source of those moral and religious\nprinciples with which it is charged; and the moral and religious\nprinciples thus modified may seem to call for treatment as species of\nsensation. But at the same time, when lower grades of mental life are\nunder examination, it becomes necessary, if we desire to point to actual\ncases of them in experience, to direct attention to more advanced grades\nfor which they are mere forms. In this way subjects will be treated of by\nanticipation which properly belong to later stages of development (e.g. in\ndealing with natural awaking from sleep we speak by anticipation of\nconsciousness, or in dealing with mental derangement we must speak of\nintellect).\nWhat Mind (or Spirit) is.\n\u00a7 381. From our point of view Mind has for its _presupposition_ Nature, of\nwhich it is the truth, and for that reason its _absolute prius_. In this\nits truth Nature is vanished, and mind has resulted as the \u201cIdea\u201d entered\non possession of itself. Here the subject and object of the Idea are\none\u2014either is the intelligent unity, the notion. This identity is\n_absolute negativity_\u2014for whereas in Nature the intelligent unity has its\nobjectivity perfect but externalised, this self-externalisation has been\nnullified and the unity in that way been made one and the same with\nitself. Thus at the same time it is this identity only so far as it is a\nreturn out of nature.\n\u00a7 382. For this reason the essential, but formally essential, feature of\nmind is Liberty: i.e. it is the notion\u2019s absolute negativity or\nself-identity. Considered as this formal aspect, it _may_ withdraw itself\nfrom everything external and from its own externality, its very existence;\nit can thus submit to infinite _pain_, the negation of its individual\nimmediacy: in other words, it can keep itself affirmative in this\nnegativity and possess its own identity. All this is possible so long as\nit is considered in its abstract self-contained universality.\n\u00a7 383. This universality is also its determinate sphere of being. Having a\nbeing of its own, the universal is self-particularising, whilst it still\nremains self-identical. Hence the special mode of mental being is\n\u201c_manifestation_.\u201d The spirit is not some one mode or meaning which finds\nutterance or externality only in a form distinct from itself: it does not\nmanifest or reveal _something_, but its very mode and meaning is this\nrevelation. And thus in its mere possibility Mind is at the same moment an\ninfinite, \u201cabsolute,\u201d _actuality_.\n\u00a7 384. _Revelation_, taken to mean the revelation of the _abstract_ Idea,\nis an unmediated transition to Nature which _comes_ to be. As Mind is\nfree, its manifestation is to _set forth_ Nature as _its_ world; but\nbecause it is reflection, it, in thus setting forth its world, at the same\ntime _presupposes_ the world as a nature independently existing. In the\nintellectual sphere to reveal is thus to create a world as its being\u2014a\nbeing in which the mind procures the _affirmation_ and _truth_ of its\nfreedom.\n_The Absolute is Mind_ (Spirit)\u2014this is the supreme definition of the\nAbsolute. To find this definition and to grasp its meaning and burthen\nwas, we may say, the ultimate purpose of all education and all philosophy:\nit was the point to which turned the impulse of all religion and science:\nand it is this impulse that must explain the history of the world. The\nword \u201cMind\u201d (Spirit)\u2014and some glimpse of its meaning\u2014was found at an early\nperiod: and the spirituality of God is the lesson of Christianity. It\nremains for philosophy in its own element of intelligible unity to get\nhold of what was thus given as a mental image, and what implicitly is the\nultimate reality: and that problem is not genuinely, and by rational\nmethods, solved so long as liberty and intelligible unity is not the theme\nand the soul of philosophy.\nSubdivision.\n\u00a7 385. The development of Mind (Spirit) is in three stages:\u2014\n(1) In the form of self-relation: within it it has the _ideal_ totality of\nthe Idea\u2014i.e. it has before it all that its notion contains: its being is\nto be self-contained and free. This is _Mind Subjective_.\n(2) In the form of _reality_: realised, i.e. in a _world_ produced and to\nbe produced by it: in this world freedom presents itself under the shape\nof necessity. This is _Mind Objective_.\n(3) In that unity of mind as objectivity and, of mind as ideality and\nconcept, which essentially and actually is and for ever produces itself,\nmind in its absolute truth. This is _Mind Absolute_.\n\u00a7 386. The two first parts of the doctrine of Mind embrace the finite\nmind. Mind is the infinite Idea; thus finitude here means the\ndisproportion between the concept and the reality\u2014but with the\nqualification that it is a shadow cast by the mind\u2019s own light\u2014a show or\nillusion which the mind implicitly imposes as a barrier to itself, in\norder, by its removal, actually to realise and become conscious of freedom\nas _its_ very being, i.e. to be fully _manifested_. The several steps of\nthis activity, on each of which, with their semblance of being, it is the\nfunction of the finite mind to linger, and through which it has to pass,\nare steps in its liberation. In the full truth of that liberation is given\nthe identification of the three stages\u2014finding a world presupposed before\nus, generating a world as our own creation, and gaining freedom from it\nand in it. To the infinite form of this truth the show purifies itself\ntill it becomes a consciousness of it.\nA rigid application of the category of finitude by the abstract logician\nis chiefly seen in dealing with Mind and reason: it is held not a mere\nmatter of strict logic, but treated also as a moral and religious concern,\nto adhere to the point of view of finitude, and the wish to go further is\nreckoned a mark of audacity, if not of insanity, of thought. Whereas in\nfact such a _modesty_ of thought, as treats the finite as something\naltogether fixed and _absolute_, is the worst of virtues; and to stick to\na post which has no sound ground in itself is the most unsound sort of\ntheory. The category of finitude was at a much earlier period elucidated\nand explained at its place in the Logic: an elucidation which, as in logic\nfor the more specific though still simple thought-forms of finitude, so in\nthe rest of philosophy for the concrete forms, has merely to show that the\nfinite _is not_, i.e. is not the truth, but merely a transition and an\nemergence to something higher. This finitude of the spheres so far\nexamined is the dialectic that makes a thing have its cessation by another\nand in another: but Spirit, the intelligent unity and the _implicit_\nEternal, is itself just the consummation of that internal act by which\nnullity is nullified and vanity is made vain. And so, the modesty alluded\nto is a retention of this vanity\u2014the finite\u2014in opposition to the true: it\nis itself therefore vanity. In the course of the mind\u2019s development we\nshall see this vanity appear as _wickedness_ at that turning-point at\nwhich mind has reached its extreme immersion in its subjectivity and its\nmost central contradiction.\nSECTION I. MIND SUBJECTIVE.\n\u00a7 387. Mind, on the ideal stage of its development, is mind as\n_cognitive_: Cognition, however, being taken here not as a merely logical\ncategory of the Idea (\u00a7 223), but in the sense appropriate to the\n_concrete_ mind.\nSubjective mind is:\u2014\n(A) Immediate or implicit: a soul\u2014the Spirit in _Nature_\u2014the object\ntreated by _Anthropology_.\n(B) Mediate or explicit: still as identical reflection into itself and\ninto other things: mind in correlation or particularisation:\nconsciousness\u2014the object treated by the _Phenomenology of Mind_.\n(C) Mind defining itself in itself, as an independent subject\u2014the object\ntreated by _Psychology_.\nIn the Soul is the _awaking of Consciousness_: Consciousness sets itself\nup as Reason, awaking at one bound to the sense of its rationality: and\nthis Reason by its activity emancipates itself to objectivity and the\nconsciousness of its intelligent unity.\nFor an intelligible unity or principle of comprehension each modification\nit presents is an advance of _development_: and so in mind every character\nunder which it appears is a stage in a process of specification and\ndevelopment, a step forward towards its goal, in order to make itself\ninto, and to realise in itself, what it implicitly is. Each step, again,\nis itself such a process, and its product is that what the mind was\nimplicitly at the beginning (and so for the observer) it is _for\nitself_\u2014for the special form, viz. which the mind has in that step. The\nordinary method of psychology is to narrate what the mind or soul is, what\nhappens to it, what it does. The soul is presupposed as a ready-made\nagent, which displays such features as its acts and utterances, from which\nwe can learn what it is, what sort of faculties and powers it\npossesses\u2014all without being aware that the act and utterance of what the\nsoul is really invests it with that character in our conception and makes\nit reach a higher stage of being than it explicitly had before.\nWe must, however, distinguish and keep apart from the progress here\nstudied what we call education and instruction. The sphere of education is\nthe individual\u2019s only: and its aim is to bring the universal mind to exist\nin them. But in the philosophic theory of mind, mind is studied as\nself-instruction and self-education in very essence; and its acts and\nutterances are stages in the process which brings it forward to itself,\nlinks it in unity with itself, and so makes it actual mind.\nSub-Section A. Anthropology. The Soul.\n\u00a7 388. Spirit (Mind) _came into_ being as the truth of Nature. But not\nmerely is it, as such a result, to be held the true and real first of what\nwent before: this becoming or transition bears in the sphere of the notion\nthe special meaning of \u201c_free judgment_.\u201d Mind, thus come into being,\nmeans therefore that Nature in its own self realises its untruth and sets\nitself aside: it means that Mind presupposes itself no longer as the\nuniversality which in corporal individuality is always self-externalised,\nbut as a universality which in its concretion and totality is one and\nsimple. At such a stage it is not yet mind, but _soul_.\n\u00a7 389. The soul is no separate immaterial entity. Wherever there is\nNature, the soul is its universal immaterialism, its simple \u201cideal\u201d life.\nSoul is the _substance_ or \u201cabsolute\u201d basis of all the particularising and\nindividualising of mind: it is in the soul that mind finds the material on\nwhich its character is wrought, and the soul remains the pervading,\nidentical ideality of it all. But as it is still conceived thus\nabstractly, the soul is only the _sleep_ of mind\u2014the passive \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 of\nAristotle, which is potentially all things.\nThe question of the immateriality of the soul has no interest, except\nwhere, on the one hand, matter is regarded as something _true_, and mind\nconceived as a _thing_, on the other. But in modern times even the\nphysicists have found matters grow thinner in their hands: they have come\nupon _imponderable_ matters, like heat, light, &c., to which they might\nperhaps add space and time. These \u201cimponderables,\u201d which have lost the\nproperty (peculiar to matter) of gravity and, in a sense, even the\ncapacity of offering resistance, have still, however, a sensible existence\nand outness of part to part; whereas the \u201cvital\u201d_ matter_, which may also\nbe found enumerated among them, not merely lacks gravity, but even every\nother aspect of existence which might lead us to treat it as material. The\nfact is that in the Idea of Life the self-externalism of nature is\n_implicitly_ at an end: subjectivity is the very substance and conception\nof life\u2014with this proviso, however, that its existence or objectivity is\nstill at the same time forfeited to the sway of self-externalism. It is\notherwise with Mind. There, in the intelligible unity which exists as\nfreedom, as absolute negativity, and not as the immediate or natural\nindividual, the object or the reality of the intelligible unity is the\nunity itself; and so the self-externalism, which is the fundamental\nfeature of matter, has been completely dissipated and transmuted into\nuniversality, or the subjective ideality of the conceptual unity. Mind is\nthe existent truth of matter\u2014the truth that matter itself has no truth.\nA cognate question is that of the _community of soul and body_. This\ncommunity (interdependence) was assumed as a _fact_, and the only problem\nwas how to _comprehend_ it. The usual answer, perhaps, was to call it an\n_incomprehensible_ mystery; and, indeed, if we take them to be absolutely\nantithetical and absolutely independent, they are as impenetrable to each\nother as one piece of matter to another, each being supposed to be found\nonly in the pores of the other, i.e. where the other is not: whence\nEpicurus, when attributing to the gods a residence in the pores, was\nconsistent in not imposing on them any connexion with the world. A\nsomewhat different answer has been given by all philosophers since this\nrelation came to be expressly discussed. Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza,\nand Leibnitz have all indicated God as this _nexus_. They meant that the\nfinitude of soul and matter were only ideal and unreal distinctions; and,\nso holding, these philosophers took God, not, as so often is done, merely\nas another word for the incomprehensible, but rather as the sole true\nidentity of finite mind and matter. But either this identity, as in the\ncase of Spinoza, is too abstract, or, as in the case of Leibnitz, though\nhis Monad of monads brings things into being, it does so only by an act of\njudgment or choice. Hence, with Leibnitz, the result is a distinction\nbetween soul and the corporeal (or material), and the identity is only\nlike the _copula_ of a judgment, and does not rise or develop into system,\ninto the absolute syllogism.\n\u00a7 390. The Soul is at first\u2014\n(_a_) In its immediate natural mode\u2014the natural soul, which only _is_.\n(_b_) Secondly, it is a soul which _feels_, as individualised, enters into\ncorrelation with its immediate being, and, in the modes of that being,\nretains an abstract independence.\n(_c_) Thirdly, its immediate being\u2014or corporeity\u2014is moulded into it, and\nwith that corporeity it exists as _actual_ soul.\n(a) The Physical Soul(119).\n\u00a7 391. The soul universal, described, it may be, as an _anima mundi_, a\nworld-soul, must not be fixed on that account as a single subject; it is\nrather the universal _substance_ which has its actual truth only in\nindividuals and single subjects. Thus, when it presents itself as a single\nsoul, it is a single soul which _is_ merely: its only modes are modes of\nnatural life. These have, so to speak, behind its ideality a free\nexistence: i.e. they are natural objects for consciousness, but objects to\nwhich the soul as such does not behave as to something external. These\nfeatures rather are _physical qualities_ of which it finds itself\npossessed.\n(\u03b1) Physical Qualities(120).\n\u00a7 392. While still a \u201csubstance\u201d (i.e. a physical soul) the mind (1) takes\npart in the general planetary life, feels the difference of climates, the\nchanges of the seasons and the periods of the day, &c. This life of nature\nfor the main shows itself only in occasional strain or disturbance of\nmental tone.\nIn recent times a good deal has been said of the cosmical, sidereal, and\ntelluric life of man. In such a sympathy with nature the animals\nessentially live: their specific characters and their particular phases of\ngrowth depend, in many cases completely, and always more or less, upon it.\nIn the case of man these points of dependence lose importance, just in\nproportion to his civilisation, and the more his whole frame of soul is\nbased upon a substructure of mental freedom. The history of the world is\nnot bound up with revolutions in the solar system, any more than the\ndestinies of individuals with the positions of the planets.\nThe difference of climate has a more solid and vigorous influence. But the\nresponse to the changes of the seasons and hours of the day is found only\nin faint changes of mood, which come expressly to the fore only in morbid\nstates (including insanity) and at periods when the self-conscious life\nsuffers depression.\nIn nations less intellectually emancipated, which therefore live more in\nharmony with nature, we find amid their superstitions and aberrations of\nimbecility _a few_ real cases of such sympathy, and on that foundation\nwhat seems to be marvellous prophetic vision of coming conditions and of\nevents arising therefrom. But as mental freedom gets a deeper hold, even\nthese few and slight susceptibilities, based upon participation in the\ncommon life of nature, disappear. Animals and plants, on the contrary,\nremain for ever subject to such influences.\n\u00a7 393. (2) According to the concrete differences of the terrestrial globe,\nthe general planetary life of the nature-governed mind specialises itself\nand breaks up into the several nature-governed minds which, on the whole,\ngive expression to the nature of the geographical continents and\nconstitute the diversities of _race_.\nThe contrast between the earth\u2019s poles, the land towards the north pole\nbeing more aggregated and preponderant over sea, whereas in the southern\nhemisphere it runs out in sharp points, widely distant from each other,\nintroduces into the differences of continents a further modification which\nTreviranus (_Biology_, Part II) has exhibited in the case of the flora and\nfauna.\n\u00a7 394. This diversity descends into specialities, that may be termed\n_local_ minds\u2014shown in the outward modes of life and occupation, bodily\nstructure and disposition, but still more in the inner tendency and\ncapacity of the intellectual and moral character of the several peoples.\nBack to the very beginnings of national history we see the several nations\neach possessing a persistent type of its own.\n\u00a7 395. (3) The soul is further de-universalised into the individualised\nsubject. But this subjectivity is here only considered as a\ndifferentiation and singling out of the modes which nature gives; we find\nit as the special temperament, talent, character, physiognomy, or other\ndisposition and idiosyncrasy, of families or single individuals.\n(\u03b2) Physical Alterations.\n\u00a7 396. Taking the soul as an individual, we find its diversities, as\nalterations in it, the one permanent subject, and as stages in its\ndevelopment. As they are at once physical and mental diversities, a more\nconcrete definition or description of them would require us to anticipate\nan acquaintance with the formed and matured mind.\nThe (1) first of these is the natural lapse of the ages in man\u2019s life. He\nbegins with _Childhood_\u2014mind wrapt up in itself. His next step is the\nfully-developed antithesis, the strain and struggle of a universality\nwhich is still subjective (as seen in ideals, fancies, hopes, ambitions)\nagainst his immediate individuality. And that individuality marks both the\nworld which, as it exists, fails to meet his ideal requirements, and the\nposition of the individual himself, who is still short of independence and\nnot fully equipped for the part he has to play (_Youth_). Thirdly, we see\nman in his true relation to his environment, recognising the objective\nnecessity and reasonableness of the world as he finds it,\u2014a world no\nlonger incomplete, but able in the work which it collectively achieves to\nafford the individual a place and a security for his performance. By his\nshare in this collective work he first is really _somebody_, gaining an\neffective existence and an objective value (_Manhood_). Last of all comes\nthe finishing touch to this unity with objectivity: a unity which, while\non its realist side it passes into the _inertia_ of deadening habit, on\nits idealist side gains freedom from the limited interests and\nentanglements of the outward present (_Old Age_).\n\u00a7 397. (2) Next we find the individual subject to a _real_ antithesis,\nleading it to seek and find _itself_ in _another_ individual. This\u2014the\n_sexual relation_\u2014on a physical basis, shows, on its one side,\nsubjectivity remaining in an instinctive and emotional harmony of moral\nlife and love, and not pushing these tendencies to an extreme _universal_\nphase, in purposes political, scientific or artistic; and on the other,\nshows an active half, where the individual is the vehicle of a struggle of\nuniversal and objective interests with the given conditions (both of his\nown existence and of that of the external world), carrying out these\nuniversal principles into a unity with the world which is his own work.\nThe sexual tie acquires its moral and spiritual significance and function\nin the _family_.\n\u00a7 398. (3) When the individuality, or self-centralised being,\ndistinguishes itself from its _mere_ being, this immediate judgment is the\n_waking_ of the soul, which confronts its self-absorbed natural life, in\nthe first instance, as one natural quality and state confronts another\nstate, viz. _sleep_.\u2014The waking is not merely for the observer, or\nexternally distinct from the sleep: it is itself the _judgment_ (primary\npartition) of the individual soul\u2014which is self-existing only as it\nrelates its self-existence to its mere existence, distinguishing itself\nfrom its still undifferentiated universality. The waking state includes\ngenerally all self-conscious and rational activity in which the mind\nrealises its own distinct self.\u2014Sleep is an invigoration of this\nactivity\u2014not as a merely negative rest from it, but as a return back from\nthe world of specialisation, from dispersion into phases where it has\ngrown hard and stiff,\u2014a return into the general nature of subjectivity,\nwhich is the substance of those specialised energies and their absolute\nmaster.\nThe distinction between sleep and waking is one of those _posers_, as they\nmay be called, which are often addressed to philosophy:\u2014Napoleon, e.g., on\na visit to the University of Pavia, put this question to the class of\nideology. The characterisation given in the section is abstract; it\nprimarily treats waking merely as a natural fact, containing the mental\nelement _implicite_ but not yet as invested with a special being of its\nown. If we are to speak more concretely of this distinction (in\nfundamentals it remains the same), we must take the self-existence of the\nindividual soul in its higher aspects as the Ego of consciousness and as\nintelligent mind. The difficulty raised anent the distinction of the two\nstates properly arises, only when we also take into account the dreams in\nsleep and describe these dreams, as well as the mental representations in\nthe sober waking consciousness, under one and the same title of mental\nrepresentations. Thus superficially classified as states of mental\nrepresentation the two coincide, because we have lost sight of the\ndifference; and in the case of any assignable distinction of waking\nconsciousness, we can always return to the trivial remark that all this is\nnothing more than mental idea. But the concrete theory of the waking soul\nin its realised being views it as _consciousness_ and _intellect_: and the\nworld of intelligent consciousness is something quite different from a\npicture of mere ideas and images. The latter are in the main only\nexternally conjoined, in an unintelligent way, by the laws of the\nso-called _Association of Ideas_; though here and there of course logical\nprinciples may also be operative. But in the waking state man behaves\nessentially as a concrete ego, an intelligence: and because of this\nintelligence his sense-perception stands before him as a concrete totality\nof features in which each member, each point, takes up its place as at the\nsame time determined through and with all the rest. Thus the facts\nembodied in his sensation are authenticated, not by his mere subjective\nrepresentation and distinction of the facts as something external from the\nperson, but by virtue of the concrete interconnexion in which each part\nstands with all parts of this complex. The waking state is the concrete\nconsciousness of this mutual corroboration of each single factor of its\ncontent by all the others in the picture as perceived. The consciousness\nof this interdependence need not be explicit and distinct. Still this\ngeneral setting to all sensations is implicitly present in the concrete\nfeeling of self.\u2014In order to see the difference of dreaming and waking we\nneed only keep in view the Kantian distinction between subjectivity and\nobjectivity of mental representation (the latter depending upon\ndetermination through categories): remembering, as already noted, that\nwhat is actually present in mind need not be therefore explicitly realised\nin consciousness, just as little as the exaltation of the intellectual\nsense to God need stand before consciousness in the shape of proofs of\nGod\u2019s existence, although, as before explained, these proofs only serve to\nexpress the net worth and content of that feeling.\n(\u03b3) Sensibility(121).\n\u00a7 399. Sleep and waking are, primarily, it is true, not mere alterations,\nbut _alternating_ conditions (a progression _in infinitum_). This is their\nformal and negative relationship: but in it the _affirmative_ relationship\nis also involved. In the self-certified existence of waking soul its mere\nexistence is implicit as an \u201cideal\u201d factor: the features which make up its\nsleeping nature, where they are implicitly as in their substance, are\n_found_ by the waking soul, in its own self, and, be it noted, for itself.\nThe fact that these particulars, though as a mode of mind they are\ndistinguished from the self-identity of our self-centred being, are yet\nsimply contained in its simplicity, is what we call sensibility.\n\u00a7 400. Sensibility (feeling) is the form of the dull stirring, the\ninarticulate breathing, of the spirit through its unconscious and\nunintelligent individuality, where every definite feature is still\n\u201cimmediate,\u201d\u2014neither specially developed in its content nor set in\ndistinction as objective to subject, but treated as belonging to its most\nspecial, its natural peculiarity. The content of sensation is thus limited\nand transient, belonging as it does to natural, immediate being,\u2014to what\nis therefore qualitative and finite.\n_Everything is in sensation_ (feeling): if you will, everything that\nemerges in conscious intelligence and in reason has its source and origin\nin sensation; for source and origin just means the first immediate manner\nin which a thing appears. Let it not be enough to have principles and\nreligion only in the head: they must also be in the heart, in the feeling.\nWhat we merely have in the head is in consciousness, in a general way: the\nfacts of it are objective\u2014set over against consciousness, so that as it is\nput in me (my abstract ego) it can also be kept away and apart from me\n(from my concrete subjectivity). But if put in the feeling, the fact is a\nmode of my individuality, however crude that individuality be in such a\nform: it is thus treated as my _very own_. My own is something inseparate\nfrom the actual concrete self: and this immediate unity of the soul with\nits underlying self in all its definite content is just this\ninseparability; which however yet falls short of the ego of developed\nconsciousness, and still more of the freedom of rational mind-life. It is\nwith a quite different intensity and permanency that the will, the\nconscience, and the character, are our very own, than can ever be true of\nfeeling and of the group of feelings (the heart): and this we need no\nphilosophy to tell us. No doubt it is correct to say that above everything\nthe _heart_ must be good. But feeling and heart is not the form by which\nanything is legitimated as religious, moral, true, just, &c., and an\nappeal to heart and feeling either means nothing or means something bad.\nThis should hardly need enforcing. Can any experience be more trite than\nthat feelings and hearts are also bad, evil, godless, mean, &c.? That the\nheart is the source only of such feelings is stated in the words: \u201cFrom\nthe heart proceed evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, blasphemy,\n&c.\u201d In such times when \u201cscientific\u201d theology and philosophy make the\nheart and feeling the criterion of what is good, moral, and religious, it\nis necessary to remind them of these trite experiences; just as it is\nnowadays necessary to repeat that thinking is the characteristic property\nby which man is distinguished from the beasts, and that he has feeling in\ncommon with them.\n\u00a7 401. What the sentient soul finds within it is, on one hand, the\nnaturally immediate, as \u201cideally\u201d in it and made its own. On the other\nhand and conversely, what originally belongs to the central individuality\n(which as further deepened and enlarged is the conscious ego and free\nmind) get the features of the natural corporeity, and is so felt. In this\nway we have two spheres of feeling. One, where what at first is a\ncorporeal affection (e.g. of the eye or of any bodily part whatever) is\nmade feeling (sensation) by being driven inward, memorised in the soul\u2019s\nself-centred part. Another, where affections originating in the mind and\nbelonging to it, are in order to be felt, and to be as if found, invested\nwith corporeity. Thus the mode or affection gets a place in the subject:\nit is felt in the soul. The detailed specification of the former branch of\nsensibility is seen in the system of the senses. But the other or inwardly\noriginated modes of feeling no less necessarily systematise themselves;\nand their corporisation, as put in the living and concretely developed\nnatural being, works itself out, following the special character of the\nmental mode, in a special system of bodily organs.\nSensibility in general is the healthy fellowship of the individual mind in\nthe life of its bodily part. The senses form the simple system of\ncorporeity specified. (_a_) The \u201cideal\u201d side of physical things breaks up\ninto two\u2014because in it, as immediate and not yet subjective ideality,\ndistinction appears as mere variety\u2014the senses of definite _light_, \u00a7\n287\u2014and of _sound_, \u00a7 300. The \u201creal\u201d aspect similarly is with its\ndifference double: (_b_) the senses of smell and taste, \u00a7\u00a7 321, 322; (_c_)\nthe sense of solid reality, of heavy matter, of heat and shape. Around the\ncentre of the sentient individuality these specifications arrange\nthemselves more simply than when they are developed in the natural\ncorporeity.\nThe system by which the internal sensation comes to give itself specific\nbodily forms would deserve to be treated in detail in a peculiar science\u2014a\n_psychical physiology_. Somewhat pointing to such a system is implied in\nthe feeling of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of an immediate\nsensation to the persistent tone of internal sensibility (the pleasant and\nunpleasant): as also in the distinct parallelism which underlies the\nsymbolical employment of sensations, e.g. of colours, tones, smells. But\nthe most interesting side of a psychical physiology would lie in studying\nnot the mere sympathy, but more definitely the bodily form adopted by\ncertain mental modifications, especially the passions or emotions. We\nshould have, e.g., to explain the line of connexion by which anger and\ncourage are felt in the breast, the blood, the \u201cirritable\u201d system, just as\nthinking and mental occupation are felt in the head, the centre of the\n\u2019sensible\u2019 system. We should want a more satisfactory explanation than\nhitherto of the most familiar connexions by which tears, and voice in\ngeneral, with its varieties of language, laughter, sighs, with many other\nspecialisations lying in the line of pathognomy and physiognomy, are\nformed from their mental source. In physiology the viscera and the organs\nare treated merely as parts subservient to the animal organism; but they\nform at the same time a physical system for the expression of mental\nstates, and in this way they get quite another interpretation.\n\u00a7 402. Sensations, just because they are immediate and are found existing,\nare single and transient aspects of psychic life,\u2014alterations in the\nsubstantiality of the soul, set in its self-centred life, with which that\nsubstance is one. But this self-centred being is not merely a formal\nfactor of sensation: the soul is virtually a reflected totality of\nsensations\u2014it feels _in itself_ the total substantiality which it\n_virtually_ is\u2014it is a soul which feels.\nIn the usage of ordinary language, sensation and feeling are not clearly\ndistinguished: still we do not speak of the sensation,\u2014but of the feeling\n(sense) of right, of self; sentimentality (sensibility) is connected with\nsensation: we may therefore say sensation emphasises rather the side of\npassivity\u2014the fact that we find ourselves feeling, i.e. the immediacy of\nmode in feeling\u2014whereas feeling at the same time rather notes the fact\nthat it is _we ourselves_ who feel.\n(b) The Feeling Soul.\u2014(Soul as Sentiency.)(122)\n\u00a7 403. The feeling or sentient individual is the simple \u201cideality\u201d or\nsubjective side of sensation. What it has to do, therefore, is to raise\nits substantiality, its merely virtual filling-up, to the character of\nsubjectivity, to take possession of it, to realise its mastery over its\nown. As sentient, the soul is no longer a mere natural, but an inward,\nindividuality: the individuality which in the merely substantial totality\nwas only formal to it has to be liberated and made independent.\nNowhere so much as in the case of the soul (and still more of the mind) if\nwe are to understand it, must that feature of \u201cideality\u201d be kept in view,\nwhich represents it as the _negation_ of the real, but a negation, where\nthe real is put past, virtually retained, although it does not _exist_.\nThe feature is one with which we are familiar in regard to our mental\nideas or to memory. Every individual is an infinite treasury of\nsensations, ideas, acquired lore, thoughts, &c.; and yet the ego is one\nand uncompounded, a deep featureless characterless mine, in which all this\nis stored up, without existing. It is only when _I_ call to mind _an_\nidea, that I bring it out of that interior to existence before\nconsciousness. Sometimes, in sickness, ideas and information, supposed to\nhave been forgotten years ago, because for so long they had not been\nbrought into consciousness, once more come to light. They were not in our\npossession, nor by such reproduction as occurs in sickness do they for the\nfuture come into our possession; and yet they were in us and continue to\nbe in us still. Thus a person can never know how much of things he once\nlearned he really has in him, should he have once forgotten them: they\nbelong not to his actuality or subjectivity as such, but only to his\nimplicit self. And under all the superstructure of specialised and\ninstrumental consciousness that may subsequently be added to it, the\nindividuality always remains this single-souled inner life. At the present\nstage this singleness is, primarily, to be defined as one of feeling\u2014as\nembracing the corporeal in itself: thus denying the view that this body is\nsomething material, with parts outside parts and outside the soul. Just as\nthe number and variety of mental representations is no argument for an\nextended and real multeity in the ego; so the \u201creal\u201d outness of parts in\nthe body has no truth for the sentient soul. As sentient, the soul is\ncharacterised as immediate, and so as natural and corporeal: but the\noutness of parts and sensible multiplicity of this corporeal counts for\nthe soul (as it counts for the intelligible unity) not as anything real,\nand therefore not as a barrier: the soul is this intelligible unity _in\nexistence_,\u2014the existent speculative principle. Thus in the body it is one\nsimple, omnipresent unity. As to the representative faculty the body is\nbut _one_ representation, and the infinite variety of its material\nstructure and organisation is reduced to the _simplicity_ of one definite\nconception: so in the sentient soul, the corporeity, and all that outness\nof parts to parts which belongs to it, is reduced to _ideality_ (the\n_truth_ of the natural multiplicity). The soul is virtually the totality\nof nature: as an individual soul it is a monad: it is itself the\nexplicitly put totality of its particular world,\u2014that world being included\nin it and filling it up; and to that world it stands but as to itself.\n\u00a7 404. As _individual_, the soul is exclusive and always exclusive: any\ndifference there is, it brings within itself. What is differentiated from\nit is as yet no external object (as in consciousness), but only the\naspects of its own sentient totality, &c. In this partition (judgment) of\nitself it is always subject: its object is its substance, which is at the\nsame time its predicate. This _substance_ is still the content of its\nnatural life, but turned into the content of the individual\nsensation-laden soul; yet as the soul is in that content still particular,\nthe content is its particular world, so far as that is, in an implicit\nmode, included in the ideality of the subject.\nBy itself, this stage of mind is the stage of its darkness: its features\nare not developed to conscious and intelligent content: so far it is\nformal and only formal. It acquires a peculiar interest in cases where it\nis as a _form_ and appears as a special _state_ of mind (\u00a7 350), to which\nthe soul, which has already advanced to consciousness and intelligence,\nmay again sink down. But when a truer phase of mind thus exists in a more\nsubordinate and abstract one, it implies a want of adaptation, which is\n_disease_. In the present stage we must treat, first, of the abstract\npsychical modifications by themselves, secondly, as morbid states of mind:\nthe latter being only explicable by means of the former.\n(\u03b1) The Feeling Soul in its Immediacy.\n\u00a7 405. (\u03b1\u03b1) Though the sensitive individuality is undoubtedly a monadic\nindividual, it is because immediate, not yet as _its self_ not a true\nsubject reflected into itself, and is therefore passive. Hence the\nindividuality of its true self is a different subject from it\u2014a subject\nwhich may even exist as another individual. By the self-hood of the latter\nit\u2014a substance, which is only a non-independent predicate\u2014is then set in\nvibration and controlled without the least resistance on its part. This\nother subject by which it is so controlled may be called its _genius_.\nIn the ordinary course of nature this is the condition of the child in its\nmother\u2019s womb:\u2014a condition neither merely bodily nor merely mental, but\npsychical\u2014a correlation of soul to soul. Here are two individuals, yet in\nundivided psychic unity: the one as yet no _self_, as yet nothing\nimpenetrable, incapable of resistance: the other is its actuating subject,\nthe _single_ self of the two. The mother is the _genius_ of the child; for\nby genius we commonly mean the total mental self-hood, as it has existence\nof its own, and constitutes the subjective substantiality of some one else\nwho is only externally treated as an individual and has only a nominal\nindependence. The underlying essence of the genius is the sum total of\nexistence, of life, and of character, not as a mere possibility, or\ncapacity, or virtuality, but as efficiency and realised activity, as\nconcrete subjectivity.\nIf we look only to the spatial and material aspects of the child\u2019s\nexistence as an embryo in its special integuments, and as connected with\nthe mother by means of umbilical cord, placenta, &c., all that is\npresented to the senses and reflection are certain anatomical and\nphysiological facts\u2014externalities and instrumentalities in the sensible\nand material which are insignificant as regards the main point, the\npsychical relationship. What ought to be noted as regards this psychical\ntie are not merely the striking effects communicated to and stamped upon\nthe child by violent emotions, injuries, &c. of the mother, but the whole\npsychical _judgment_ (partition) of the underlying nature, by which the\nfemale (like the monocotyledons among vegetables) can suffer disruption in\ntwain, so that the child has not merely got _communicated_ to it, but has\noriginally received morbid dispositions as well as other pre-dispositions\nof shape, temper, character, talent, idiosyncrasies, &c.\nSporadic examples and traces of this _magic_ tie appear elsewhere in the\nrange of self-possessed conscious life, say between friends, especially\nfemale friends with delicate nerves (a tie which may go so far as to show\n\u201cmagnetic\u201d phenomena), between husband and wife and between members of the\nsame family.\nThe total sensitivity has its self here in a separate subjectivity, which,\nin the case cited of this sentient life in the ordinary course of nature,\nis visibly present as another and a different individual. But this\nsensitive totality is meant to elevate its self-hood out of itself to\nsubjectivity in one and the same individual: which is then its indwelling\nconsciousness, self-possessed, intelligent, and reasonable. For such a\nconsciousness the merely sentient life serves as an underlying and only\nimplicitly existent material; and the self-possessed subjectivity is the\nrational, self-conscious, controlling genius thereof. But this sensitive\nnucleus includes not merely the purely unconscious, congenital disposition\nand temperament, but within its enveloping simplicity it acquires and\nretains also (in habit, as to which see later) all further ties and\nessential relationships, fortunes, principles\u2014everything in short\nbelonging to the character, and in whose elaboration self-conscious\nactivity has most effectively participated. The sensitivity is thus a soul\nin which the whole mental life is condensed. The total individual under\nthis concentrated aspect is distinct from the existing and actual play of\nhis consciousness, his secular ideas, developed interests, inclinations,\n&c. As contrasted with this looser aggregate of means and methods the more\nintensive form of individuality is termed the genius, whose decision is\nultimate whatever may be the show of reasons, intentions, means, of which\nthe more public consciousness is so liberal. This concentrated\nindividuality also reveals itself under the aspect of what is called the\nheart and soul of feeling. A man is said to be heartless and unfeeling\nwhen he looks at things with self-possession and acts according to his\npermanent purposes, be they great substantial aims or petty and unjust\ninterests: a good-hearted man, on the other hand, means rather one who is\nat the mercy of his individual sentiment, even when it is of narrow range\nand is wholly made up of particularities. Of such good nature or goodness\nof heart it may be said that it is less the genius itself than the\n_indulgere genio_.\n\u00a7 406. (\u03b2\u03b2) The sensitive life, when it becomes a _form_ or _state_ of the\nself-conscious, educated, self-possessed human being is a disease. The\nindividual in such a morbid state stands in direct contact with the\nconcrete contents of his own self, whilst he keeps his self-possessed\nconsciousness of self and of the causal order of things apart as a\ndistinct state of mind. This morbid condition is seen in _magnetic\nsomnambulism_ and cognate states.\nIn this summary encyclopaedic account it is impossible to supply a\ndemonstration of what the paragraph states as the nature of the remarkable\ncondition produced chiefly by animal magnetism\u2014to show, in other words,\nthat it is in harmony with the facts. To that end the phenomena, so\ncomplex in their nature and so very different one from another, would have\nfirst of all to be brought under their general points of view. The facts,\nit might seem, first of all call for verification. But such a verification\nwould, it must be added, be superfluous for those on whose account it was\ncalled for: for they facilitate the inquiry for themselves by declaring\nthe narratives\u2014infinitely numerous though they be and accredited by the\neducation and character of the witnesses\u2014to be mere deception and\nimposture. The _a priori_ conceptions of these inquirers are so rooted\nthat no testimony can avail against them, and they have even denied what\nthey had seen with their own eyes. In order to believe in this department\neven what one sees with these eyes, and still more to understand it, the\nfirst requisite is not to be in bondage to the hard and fast categories of\nthe practical intellect. The chief points on which the discussion turns\nmay here be given:\n(\u03b1) To the _concrete_ existence of the individual belongs the aggregate of\nhis fundamental _interests_, both the essential and the particular\nempirical ties which connect him with other men and the world at large.\nThis totality forms _his_ actuality, in the sense that it lies in fact\nimmanent in him; it has already been called his _genius_. This genius is\nnot the free mind which wills and thinks: the form of sensitivity, in\nwhich the individual here appears immersed, is, on the contrary, a\nsurrender of his self-possessed intelligent existence. The first\nconclusion to which these considerations lead, with reference to the\ncontents of consciousness in the somnambulist stage, is that it is only\nthe range of his individually moulded world (of his private interests and\nnarrow relationships) which appear there. Scientific theories and\nphilosophic conceptions or general truths require a different\nsoil,\u2014require an intelligence which has risen out of the inarticulate mass\nof mere sensitivity to free consciousness. It is foolish therefore to\nexpect revelations about the higher ideas from the somnambulist state.\n(\u03b2) Where a human being\u2019s senses and intellect are sound, he is fully and\nintelligently alive to that reality of his which gives concrete filling to\nhis individuality: but he is awake to it in the form of interconnexion\nbetween himself and the features of that reality conceived as an external\nand a separate world, and he is aware that this world is in itself also a\ncomplex of interconnexions of a practically intelligible kind. In his\nsubjective ideas and plans he has also before him this causally connected\nscheme of things he calls his world and the series of means which bring\nhis ideas and his purposes into adjustment with the objective existences,\nwhich are also means and ends to each other. At the same time, this world\nwhich is outside him has its threads in him to such a degree that it is\nthese threads which make him what he really is: he too would become\nextinct if these externalities were to disappear, unless by the aid of\nreligion, subjective reason, and character, he is in a remarkable degree\nself-supporting and independent of them. But, then, in the latter case he\nis less susceptible of the psychical state here spoken of.\u2014As an\nillustration of that identity with the surroundings may be noted the\neffect produced by the death of beloved relatives, friends, &c. on those\nleft behind, so that the one dies or pines away with the loss of the\nother. (Thus Cato, after the downfall of the Roman republic, could live no\nlonger: his inner reality was neither wider than higher than it.) Compare\nhome-sickness, and the like.\n(\u03b3) But when all that occupies the waking consciousness, the world outside\nit and its relationship to that world is under a veil, and the soul is\nthus sunk in sleep (in magnetic sleep, in catalepsy, and other diseases,\ne.g. those connected with female development, or at the approach of death,\n&c.), then that _immanent actuality_ of the individual remains the same\nsubstantial total as before, but now as a purely sensitive life with an\ninward vision and an inward consciousness. And because it is the adult,\nformed, and developed consciousness which is degraded into this state of\nsensitivity, it retains along with its content a certain nominal\nself-hood, a formal vision and awareness, which however does not go so far\nas the conscious judgment or discernment by which its contents, when it is\nhealthy and awake, exist for it as an outward objectivity. The individual\nis thus a monad which is inwardly aware of its actuality\u2014a genius which\nbeholds itself. The characteristic point in such knowledge is that the\nvery same facts (which for the healthy consciousness are an objective\npractical reality, and to know which, in its sober moods, it needs the\nintelligent chain of means and conditions in all their real expansion) are\nnow immediately known and perceived in this immanence. This perception is\na sort of _clairvoyance_; for it is a consciousness living in the\nundivided substantiality of the genius, and finding itself in the very\nheart of the interconnexion, and so can dispense with the series of\nconditions, external one to another, which lead up to the\nresult,\u2014conditions which cool reflection has in succession to traverse and\nin so doing feels the limits of its own individual externality. But such\nclairvoyance\u2014just because its dim and turbid vision does not present the\nfacts in a rational interconnexion\u2014is for that very reason at the mercy of\nevery private contingency of feeling and fancy, &c.\u2014not to mention that\nforeign _suggestions_ (see later) intrude into its vision. It is thus\nimpossible to make out whether what the clairvoyants really see\npreponderates over what they deceive themselves in.\u2014But it is absurd to\ntreat this visionary state as a sublime mental phase and as a truer state,\ncapable of conveying general truths(123).\n(\u03b4) An essential feature of this sensitivity, with its absence of\nintelligent and volitional personality, is this, that it is a state of\npassivity, like that of the child in the womb. The patient in this\ncondition is accordingly made, and continues to be, subject to the power\nof another person, the magnetiser; so that when the two are thus in\npsychical _rapport_, the selfless individual, not really a \u201cperson,\u201d has\nfor his subjective consciousness the consciousness of the other. This\nlatter self-possessed individual is thus the effective subjective soul of\nthe former, and the genius which may even supply him with a train of\nideas. That the somnambulist perceives in himself tastes and smells which\nare present in the person with whom he stands _en rapport_, and that he is\naware of the other inner ideas and present perceptions of the latter as if\nthey were his own, shows the substantial identity which the soul (which\neven in its concreteness is also truly immaterial) is capable of holding\nwith another. When the substance of both is thus made one, there is only\none subjectivity of consciousness: the patient has a sort of\nindividuality, but it is empty, not on the spot, not actual: and this\nnominal self accordingly derives its whole stock of ideas from the\nsensations and ideas of the other, in whom it sees, smells, tastes, reads,\nand hears. It is further to be noted on this point that the somnambulist\nis thus brought into _rapport_ with two genii and a twofold set of ideas,\nhis own and that of the magnetiser. But it is impossible to say precisely\nwhich sensations and which visions he, in this nominal perception,\nreceives, beholds and brings to knowledge from his own inward self, and\nwhich from the suggestions of the person with whom he stands in relation.\nThis uncertainty may be the source of many deceptions, and accounts among\nother things for the diversity that inevitably shows itself among\nsomnambulists from different countries and under _rapport_ with persons of\ndifferent education, as regards their views on morbid states and the\nmethods of cure, or medicines for them, as well as on scientific and\nintellectual topics.\n(\u03b5) As in this sensitive substantiality there is no contrast to external\nobjectivity, so within itself the subject is so entirely one that all\nvarieties of sensation have disappeared, and hence, when the activity of\nthe sense-organs is asleep, the \u201ccommon sense,\u201d or \u201cgeneral feeling\u201d\nspecifies itself to several functions; one sees and hears with the\nfingers, and especially with the pit of the stomach, &c.\nTo comprehend a thing means in the language of practical intelligence to\nbe able to trace the series of means intervening between a phenomenon and\nsome other existence on which it depends,\u2014to discover what is called the\nordinary course of nature, in compliance with the laws and relations of\nthe intellect, e.g. causality, reasons, &c. The purely sensitive life, on\nthe contrary, even when it retains that mere nominal consciousness, as in\nthe morbid state alluded to, is just this form of immediacy, without any\ndistinctions between subjective and objective, between intelligent\npersonality and objective world, and without the aforementioned finite\nties between them. Hence to understand this intimate conjunction, which,\nthough all-embracing, is without any definite points of attachment, is\nimpossible, so long as we assume independent personalities, independent\none of another and of the objective world which is their content\u2014so long\nas we assume the absolute spatial and material externality of one part of\nbeing to another.\n(\u03b2) Self-feeling (Sense of Self)(124).\n\u00a7 407. (\u03b1\u03b1) The sensitive totality is, in its capacity of individual,\nessentially the tendency to distinguish itself in itself, and to wake up\nto the _judgment in itself_, in virtue of which it has _particular_\nfeelings and stands as a _subject_ in respect of these aspects of itself.\nThe subject as such gives these feelings a place as _its own_ in itself.\nIn these private and personal sensations it is immersed, and at the same\ntime, because of the \u201cideality\u201d of the particulars, it combines itself in\nthem with itself as a subjective unit. In this way it is _self-feeling_,\nand is so at the same time only in the _particular feeling_.\n\u00a7 408. (\u03b2\u03b2) In consequence of the immediacy, which still marks the\nself-feeling, i.e. in consequence of the element of corporeality which is\nstill undetached from the mental life, and as the feeling too is itself\nparticular and bound up with a special corporeal form, it follows that\nalthough the subject has been brought to acquire intelligent\nconsciousness, it is still susceptible of disease, so far as to remain\nfast in a _special_ phase of its self-feeling, unable to refine it to\n\u201cideality\u201d and get the better of it. The fully-furnished self of\nintelligent consciousness is a conscious subject, which is consistent in\nitself according to an order and behaviour which follows from its\nindividual position and its connexion with the external world, which is no\nless a world of law. But when it is engrossed with a single phase of\nfeeling, it fails to assign that phase its proper place and due\nsubordination in the individual system of the world which a conscious\nsubject is. In this way the subject finds itself in contradiction between\nthe totality systematised in its consciousness, and the single phase or\nfixed idea which is not reduced to its proper place and rank. This is\nInsanity or mental Derangement.\nIn considering insanity we must, as in other cases, anticipate the\nfull-grown and intelligent conscious subject, which is at the same time\nthe _natural_ self of _self-feeling_. In such a phase the self can be\nliable to the contradiction between its own free subjectivity and a\nparticularity which, instead of being \u201cidealised\u201d in the former, remains\nas a fixed element in self-feeling. Mind as such is free, and therefore\nnot susceptible of this malady. But in older metaphysics mind was treated\nas a soul, as a thing; and it is only as a thing, i.e. as something\nnatural and existent, that it is liable to insanity\u2014the settled fixture of\nsome finite element in it. Insanity is therefore a psychical disease, i.e.\na disease of body and mind alike: the commencement may appear to start\nfrom one more than other, and so also may the cure.\nThe self-possessed and healthy subject has an active and present\nconsciousness of the ordered whole of his individual world, into the\nsystem of which he subsumes each special content of sensation, idea,\ndesire, inclination, &c., as it arises, so as to insert them in their\nproper place. He is the _dominant genius_ over these particularities.\nBetween this and insanity the difference is like that between waking and\ndreaming: only that in insanity the dream falls within the waking limits,\nand so makes part of the actual self-feeling. Error and that sort of thing\nis a proposition consistently admitted to a place in the objective\ninterconnexion of things. In the concrete, however, it is often difficult\nto say where it begins to become derangement. A violent, but groundless\nand senseless outburst of hatred, &c., may, in contrast to a presupposed\nhigher self-possession and stability of character, make its victim seem to\nbe beside himself with frenzy. But the main point in derangement is the\ncontradiction which a feeling with a fixed corporeal embodiment sets up\nagainst the whole mass of adjustments forming the concrete consciousness.\nThe mind which is in a condition of mere _being_, and where such being is\nnot rendered fluid in its consciousness, is diseased. The contents which\nare set free in this reversion to mere nature are the self-seeking\naffections of the heart, such as vanity, pride, and the rest of the\npassions\u2014fancies and hopes\u2014merely personal love and hatred. When the\ninfluence of self-possession and of general principles, moral and\ntheoretical, is relaxed, and ceases to keep the natural temper under lock\nand key, the earthly elements are set free\u2014that evil which is always\nlatent in the heart, because the heart as immediate is natural and\nselfish. It is the evil genius of man which gains the upper hand in\ninsanity, but in distinction from and contrast to the better and more\nintelligent part, which is there also. Hence this state is mental\nderangement and distress. The right psychical treatment therefore keeps in\nview the truth that insanity is not an abstract _loss_ of reason (neither\nin the point of intelligence nor of will and its responsibility), but only\nderangement, only a contradiction in a still subsisting reason;\u2014just as\nphysical disease is not an abstract, i.e. mere and total, loss of health\n(if it were that, it would be death), but a contradiction in it. This\nhumane treatment, no less benevolent than reasonable (the services of\nPinel towards which deserve the highest acknowledgment), presupposes the\npatient\u2019s rationality, and in that assumption has the sound basis for\ndealing with him on this side\u2014just as in the case of bodily disease the\nphysician bases his treatment on the vitality which as such still contains\nhealth.\n(\u03b3) Habit(125).\n\u00a7 409. Self-feeling, immersed in the detail of the feelings (in simple\nsensations, and also desires, instincts, passions, and their\ngratification), is undistinguished from them. But in the self there is\nlatent a simple self-relation of ideality, a nominal universality (which\nis the truth of these details): and as so universal, the self is to be\nstamped upon, and made appear in, this life of feeling, yet so as to\ndistinguish itself from the particular details, and be a realised\nuniversality. But this universality is not the full and sterling truth of\nthe specific feelings and desires; what they specifically contain is as\nyet left out of account. And so too the particularity is, as now regarded,\nequally formal; it counts only as the _particular being_ or immediacy of\nthe soul in opposition to its equally formal and abstract realisation.\nThis particular being of the soul is the factor of its corporeity; here we\nhave it breaking with this corporeity, distinguishing it from\nitself,\u2014itself a _simple_ being,\u2014and becoming the \u201cideal,\u201d subjective\nsubstantiality of it,\u2014just as in its latent notion (\u00a7 359) it was the\nsubstance, and the mere substance, of it.\nBut this abstract realisation of the soul in its corporeal vehicle is not\nyet the self\u2014not the existence of the universal which is for the\nuniversal. It is the corporeity reduced to its mere _ideality_; and so far\nonly does corporeity belong to the soul as such. That is to say, as space\nand time\u2014the abstract one-outside-another, as, in short, empty space and\nempty time\u2014are only subjective form\u2014pure act of intuition; so that pure\nbeing (which through the supersession in it of the particularity of the\ncorporeity, or of the immediate corporeity as such has realised itself) is\nmere intuition and no more, lacking consciousness, but the basis of\nconsciousness. And consciousness it becomes, when the corporeity, of which\nit is the subjective substance, and which still continues to exist, and\nthat as a barrier for it, has been absorbed by it, and it has been\ninvested with the character of self-centred subject.\n\u00a7 410. The soul\u2019s making itself an abstract universal being, and reducing\nthe particulars of feelings (and of consciousness) to a mere feature of\nits being is Habit. In this manner the soul has the contents in\npossession, and contains them in such manner that in these features it is\nnot as sentient, nor does it stand in relationship with them as\ndistinguishing itself from them, nor is absorbed in them, but has them and\nmoves in them, without feeling or consciousness of the fact. The soul is\nfreed from them, so far as it is not interested in or occupied with them:\nand whilst existing in these forms as its possession, it is at the same\ntime open to be otherwise occupied and engaged\u2014say with feeling and with\nmental consciousness in general.\nThis process of building up the particular and corporeal expressions of\nfeeling into the being of the soul appears as a _repetition_ of them, and\nthe generation of habit as _practice_. For, this being of the soul, if in\nrespect of the natural particular phase it be called an abstract\nuniversality to which the former is transmuted, is a reflexive\nuniversality (\u00a7 175); i.e. the one and the same, that recurs in a series\nof units of sensation, is reduced to unity, and this abstract unity\nexpressly stated.\nHabit, like memory, is a difficult point in mental organisation: habit is\nthe mechanism of self-feeling, as memory is the mechanism of intelligence.\nThe natural qualities and alterations of age, sleep and waking, are\n\u201cimmediately\u201d natural: habit, on the contrary, is the mode of feeling (as\nwell as intelligence, will, &c., so far as they belong to self-feeling)\nmade into a natural and mechanical existence. Habit is rightly called a\nsecond nature; nature, because it is an immediate being of the soul; a\nsecond nature, because it is an immediacy created by the soul, impressing\nand moulding the corporeality which enters into the modes of feeling as\nsuch and into the representations and volitions so far as they have taken\ncorporeal form (\u00a7 401).\nIn habit the human being\u2019s mode of existence is \u201cnatural,\u201d and for that\nreason not free; but still free, so far as the merely natural phase of\nfeeling is by habit reduced to a mere being of _his_, and he is no longer\ninvoluntarily attracted or repelled by it, and so no longer interested,\noccupied, or dependent in regard to it. The want of freedom in habit is\npartly merely formal, as habit merely attaches to the being of the soul;\npartly only relative, so far as it strictly speaking arises only in the\ncase of bad habits, or so far as a habit is opposed by another purpose:\nwhereas the habit of right and goodness is an embodiment of liberty. The\nmain point about Habit is that by its means man gets emancipated from the\nfeelings, even in being affected by them. The different forms of this may\nbe described as follows: (\u03b1) The _immediate_ feeling is negated and\ntreated as indifferent. One who gets inured against external sensations\n(frost, heat, weariness of the limbs, &c., sweet tastes, &c.), and who\nhardens the heart against misfortune, acquires a strength which consists\nin this, that although the frost, &c.\u2014or the misfortune\u2014is felt, the\naffection is deposed to a mere externality and immediacy; the universal\npsychical life keeps its own abstract independence in it, and the\nself-feeling as such, consciousness, reflection, and any other purposes\nand activity, are no longer bothered with it. (\u03b2) There is indifference\ntowards the satisfaction: the desires and impulses are by the _habit_ of\ntheir satisfaction deadened. This is the rational liberation from them;\nwhereas monastic renunciation and forcible interference do not free from\nthem, nor are they in conception rational. Of course in all this it is\nassumed that the impulses are kept as the finite modes they naturally are,\nand that they, like their satisfaction, are subordinated as partial\nfactors to the reasonable will. (\u03b3) In habit regarded as _aptitude_, or\nskill, not merely has the abstract psychical life to be kept intact _per\nse_, but it has to be imposed as a subjective aim, to be made a power in\nthe bodily part, which is rendered subject and thoroughly pervious to it.\nConceived as having the inward purpose of the subjective soul thus imposed\nupon it, the body is treated as an immediate externality and a barrier.\nThus comes out the more decided rupture between the soul as simple\nself-concentration, and its earlier naturalness and immediacy; it has lost\nits original and immediate identity with the bodily nature, and as\nexternal has first to be reduced to that position. Specific feelings can\nonly get bodily shape in a perfectly specific way (\u00a7 401); and the\nimmediate portion of body is a particular possibility for a specific aim\n(a particular aspect of its differentiated structure, a particular organ\nof its organic system). To mould such an aim in the organic body is to\nbring out and express the \u201cideality\u201d which is implicit in matter always,\nand especially so in the specific bodily part, and thus to enable the\nsoul, under its volitional and conceptual characters, to exist as\nsubstance in its corporeity. In this way an aptitude shows the corporeity\nrendered completely pervious, made into an instrument, so that when the\nconception (e.g. a series of musical notes) is in me, then without\nresistance and with ease the body gives them correct utterance.\nThe form of habit applies to all kinds and grades of mental action. The\nmost external of them, i.e. the spatial direction of an individual, viz.\nhis upright posture, has been by will made a habit\u2014a position taken\nwithout adjustment and without consciousness\u2014which continues to be an\naffair of his persistent will; for the man stands only because and in so\nfar as he wills to stand, and only so long as he wills it without\nconsciousness. Similarly our eyesight is the concrete habit which, without\nan express adjustment, combines in a single act the several modifications\nof sensation, consciousness, intuition, intelligence, &c., which make it\nup. Thinking, too, however free and active in its own pure element it\nbecomes, no less requires habit and familiarity (this impromptuity or form\nof immediacy), by which it is the property of my single self where I can\nfreely and in all directions range. It is through this habit that I come\nto realise my _existence_ as a thinking being. Even here, in this\nspontaneity of self-centred thought, there is a partnership of soul and\nbody (hence, want of habit and too-long-continued thinking cause\nheadache); habit diminishes this feeling, by making the natural function\nan immediacy of the soul. Habit on an ampler scale, and carried out in the\nstrictly intellectual range, is recollection and memory, whereof we shall\nspeak later.\nHabit is often spoken of disparagingly and called lifeless, casual and\nparticular. And it is true that the form of habit, like any other, is open\nto anything we chance to put into it; and it is habit of living which\nbrings on death, or, if quite abstract, is death itself: and yet habit is\nindispensable for the _existence_ of all intellectual life in the\nindividual, enabling the subject to be a concrete immediacy, an \u201cideality\u201d\nof soul\u2014enabling the matter of consciousness, religious, moral, &c., to be\nhis as _this_ self, _this_ soul, and no other, and be neither a mere\nlatent possibility, nor a transient emotion or idea, nor an abstract\ninwardness, cut off from action and reality, but part and parcel of his\nbeing. In scientific studies of the soul and the mind, habit is usually\npassed over\u2014either as something contemptible\u2014or rather for the further\nreason that it is one of the most difficult questions of psychology.\n(c) The Actual Soul.(126)\n\u00a7 411. The Soul, when its corporeity has been moulded and made thoroughly\nits own, finds itself there a _single_ subject; and the corporeity is an\nexternality which stands as a predicate, in being related to which, it is\nrelated to itself. This externality, in other words, represents not\nitself, but the soul, of which it is the _sign_. In this identity of\ninterior and exterior, the latter subject to the former, the soul is\n_actual_: in its corporeity it has its free shape, in which it _feels\nitself_ and makes _itself felt_, and which as the Soul\u2019s work of art has\n_human_ pathognomic and physiognomic expression.\nUnder the head of human expression are included, e.g., the upright figure\nin general, and the formation of the limbs, especially the hand, as the\nabsolute instrument, of the mouth\u2014laughter, weeping, &c., and the note of\nmentality diffused over the whole, which at once announces the body at the\nexternality of a higher nature. This note is so slight, indefinite, and\ninexpressible a modification, because the figure in its externality is\nsomething immediate and natural, and can therefore only be an indefinite\nand quite imperfect sign for the mind, unable to represent it in its\nactual universality. Seen from the animal world, the human figure is the\nsupreme phase in which mind makes an appearance. But for the mind it is\nonly its first appearance, while language is its perfect expression. And\nthe human figure, though its proximate phase of existence, is at the same\ntime in its physiognomic and pathognomic quality something contingent to\nit. To try to raise physiognomy and above all cranioscopy (phrenology) to\nthe rank of sciences, was therefore one of the vainest fancies, still\nvainer than a _signatura rerum_, which supposed the shape of a plant to\nafford indication of its medicinal virtue.\n\u00a7 412. Implicitly the soul shows the untruth and unreality of matter; for\nthe soul, in its concentrated self, cuts itself off from its immediate\nbeing, placing the latter over against it as a corporeity incapable of\noffering resistance to its moulding influence. The soul, thus setting in\nopposition its being to its (conscious) self, absorbing it, and making it\nits own, has lost the meaning of mere soul, or the \u201cimmediacy\u201d of mind.\nThe actual soul with its sensation and its concrete self-feeling turned\ninto habit, has implicitly realised the \u2019ideality\u2019 of its qualities; in\nthis externality it has recollected and inwardised itself, and is infinite\nself-relation. This free universality thus made explicit shows the soul\nawaking to the higher stage of the ego, or abstract universality in so far\nas it is _for_ the abstract universality. In this way it gains the\nposition of thinker and subject\u2014specially a subject of the judgment in\nwhich the ego excludes from itself the sum total of its merely natural\nfeatures as an object, a world external to it,\u2014but with such respect to\nthat object that in it it is immediately reflected into itself. Thus soul\nrises to become _Consciousness_.\nSub-Section B. Phenomenology Of Mind. Consciousness.\n\u00a7 413. Consciousness constitutes the reflected or correlational grade of\nmind: the grade of mind as _appearance_. _Ego_ is infinite self-relation\nof mind, but as subjective or as self-certainty. The immediate identity of\nthe natural soul has been raised to this pure \u201cideal\u201d self-identity; and\nwhat the former _contained_ is for this self-subsistent reflection set\nforth as an _object_. The pure abstract freedom of mind lets go from it\nits specific qualities,\u2014the soul\u2019s natural life\u2014to an equal freedom as an\nindependent _object_. It is of this latter, as external to it, that the\n_ego_ is in the first instance aware (conscious), and as such it is\nConsciousness. Ego, as this absolute negativity, is implicitly the\nidentity in the otherness: the _ego_ is itself that other and stretches\nover the object (as if that object were implicitly cancelled)\u2014it is one\nside of the relationship and the whole relationship\u2014the light, which\nmanifests itself and something else too.\n\u00a7 414. The self-identity of the mind, thus first made explicit as the Ego,\nis only its abstract formal identity. As _soul_ it was under the phase of\n_substantial_ universality; now, as subjective reflection in itself, it is\nreferred to this substantiality as to its negative, something dark and\nbeyond it. Hence consciousness, like reciprocal dependence in general, is\nthe contradiction between the independence of the two sides and their\nidentity in which they are merged into one. The mind as ego is _essence_;\nbut since reality, in the sphere of essence, is represented as in\nimmediate being and at the same time as \u201cideal,\u201d it is as consciousness\nonly the _appearance_ (phenomenon) of mind.\n\u00a7 415. As the ego is by itself only a formal identity, the dialectical\nmovement of its intelligible unity, i.e. the successive steps in further\nspecification of consciousness, does not to it seem to be its own\nactivity, but is implicit, and to the ego it seems an alteration of the\nobject. Consciousness consequently appears differently modified according\nto the difference of the given object; and the gradual specification of\nconsciousness appears as a variation in the characteristics of its\nobjects. Ego, the subject of consciousness, is thinking: the logical\nprocess of modifying the object is what is identical in subject and\nobject, their absolute interdependence, what makes the object the\nsubject\u2019s own.\nThe Kantian philosophy may be most accurately described as having viewed\nthe mind as consciousness, and as containing the propositions only of a\n_phenomenology_ (not of a _philosophy_) of mind. The Ego Kant regards as\nreference to something away and beyond (which in its abstract description\nis termed the thing-at-itself); and it is only from this finite point of\nview that he treats both intellect and will. Though in the notion of a\npower of _reflective_ judgment he touches upon the _Idea_ of mind\u2014a\nsubject-objectivity, an _intuitive intellect_, &c., and even the Idea of\nNature, still this Idea is again deposed to an appearance, i.e. to a\nsubjective maxim (\u00a7 58). Reinhold may therefore be said to have correctly\nappreciated Kantism when he treated it as a theory of consciousness (under\nthe name of \u201cfaculty of ideation\u201d). Fichte kept to the same point of view:\nhis non-ego is only something set over against the ego, only defined as in\n_consciousness_: it is made no more than an infinite \u201cshock,\u201d i.e. a\nthing-in-itself. Both systems therefore have clearly not reached the\nintelligible unity or the mind as it actually and essentially is, but only\nas it is in reference to something else.\nAs against Spinozism, again, it is to be noted that the mind in the\njudgment by which it \u201cconstitutes\u201d itself an ego (a free subject\ncontrasted with its qualitative affection) has emerged from substance, and\nthat the philosophy, which gives this judgment as the absolute\ncharacteristic of mind, has emerged from Spinozism.\n\u00a7 416. The aim of conscious mind is to make its appearance identical with\nits essence, to raise its _self-certainty to truth_. The _existence_ of\nmind in the stage of consciousness is finite, because it is merely a\nnominal self-relation, or mere certainty. The object is only abstractly\ncharacterised as _its_; in other words, in the object it is only as an\nabstract ego that the mind is reflected into itself: hence its existence\nthere has still a content, which is not as its own.\n\u00a7 417. The grades of this elevation of certainty to truth are three in\nnumber: first (_a_) consciousness in general, with an object set against\nit; (_b_) self-consciousness, for which _ego_ is the object; (_c_) unity\nof consciousness and self-consciousness, where the mind sees itself\nembodied in the object and sees itself as implicitly and explicitly\ndeterminate, as Reason, the _notion_ of mind.\n(a) Consciousness Proper(127).\n(\u03b1) Sensuous consciousness.\n\u00a7 418. Consciousness is, first, _immediate_ consciousness, and its\nreference to the object accordingly the simple and underived certainty of\nit. The object similarly, being immediate, an existent, reflected in\nitself, is further characterised as immediately singular. This is\nsense-consciousness.\nConsciousness\u2014as a case of correlation\u2014comprises only the categories\nbelonging to the abstract ego or formal thinking; and these it treats as\nfeatures of the object (\u00a7 415). Sense-consciousness therefore is aware of\nthe object as an existent, a something, an existing thing, a singular, and\nso on. It appears as wealthiest in matter, but as poorest in thought. That\nwealth of matter is made out of sensations: they are the _material_ of\nconsciousness (\u00a7 414), the substantial and qualitative, what the soul in\nits anthropological sphere is and finds _in itself_. This material the ego\n(the reflection of the soul in itself) separates from itself, and puts it\nfirst under the category of being. Spatial and temporal Singularness,\n_here_ and _now_ (the terms by which in the Phenomenology of the Mind (W.\nII. p. 73), I described the object of sense-consciousness) strictly\nbelongs to _intuition_. At present the object is at first to be viewed\nonly in its correlation to _consciousness_, i.e. a something _external_ to\nit, and not yet as external on its own part, or as being beside and out of\nitself.\n\u00a7 419. The _sensible_ as somewhat becomes an _other_: the reflection in\nitself of this _somewhat_, the _thing_, has _many_ properties; and as a\nsingle (thing) in its immediacy has several _predicates_. The muchness of\nthe sense-singular thus becomes a breadth\u2014a variety of relations,\nreflectional attributes, and universalities. These are logical terms\nintroduced by the thinking principle, i.e. in this case by the Ego, to\ndescribe the sensible. But the Ego as itself apparent sees in all this\ncharacterisation a change in the object; and self-consciousness, so\nconstruing the object, is sense-perception.\n(\u03b2) Sense-perception(128).\n\u00a7 420. Consciousness, having passed beyond the sensibility, wants to take\nthe object in its truth, not as merely immediate, but as mediated,\nreflected in itself, and universal. Such an object is a combination of\nsense qualities with attributes of wider range by which thought defines\nconcrete relations and connexions. Hence the identity of consciousness\nwith the object passes from the abstract identity of \u201cI am sure\u201d to the\ndefinite identity of \u201cI know, and am aware.\u201d\nThe particular grade of consciousness on which Kantism conceives the mind\nis perception: which is also the general point of view taken by ordinary\nconsciousness, and more or less by the sciences. The sensuous certitudes\nof single apperceptions or observations form the starting-point: these are\nsupposed to be elevated to truth, by being regarded in their bearings,\nreflected upon, and on the lines of definite categories turned at the same\ntime into something necessary and universal, viz. _experiences_.\n\u00a7 421. This conjunction of individual and universal is admixture\u2014the\nindividual remains at the bottom hard and unaffected by the universal, to\nwhich however it is related. It is therefore a tissue of\ncontradictions\u2014between the single things of sense apperception, which form\nthe alleged ground of general experience, and the universality which has a\nhigher claim to be the essence and ground\u2014between the individuality of a\nthing which, taken in its concrete content, constitutes its independence\nand the various properties which, free from this negative link and from\none another, are independent universal _matters_ (\u00a7 123). This\ncontradiction of the finite which runs through all forms of the logical\nspheres turns out most concrete, when the somewhat is defined as _object_\n(\u00a7 194 seqq.).\n(\u03b3) The Intellect(129).\n\u00a7 422. The proximate _truth_ of perception is that it is the object which\nis an _appearance_, and that the object\u2019s reflection in self is on the\ncontrary a self-subsistent inward and universal. The consciousness of such\nan object is _intellect_. This inward, as we called it, of the thing is on\none hand the suppression of the multiplicity of the sensible, and, in that\nmanner, an abstract identity: on the other hand, however, it also for that\nreason contains the multiplicity, but as an interior \u201csimple\u201d difference,\nwhich remains self-identical in the vicissitudes of appearance. This\nsimple difference is the realm of _the laws_ of the phenomena\u2014a copy of\nthe phenomenon, but brought to rest and universality.\n\u00a7 423. The law, at first stating the mutual dependence of universal,\npermanent terms, has, in so far as its distinction is the inward one, its\nnecessity on its own part; the one of the terms, as not externally\ndifferent from the other, lies immediately in the other. But in this\nmanner the interior distinction is, what it is in truth, the distinction\non its own part, or the distinction which is none. With this new\nform-characteristic, on the whole, consciousness _implicitly_ vanishes:\nfor consciousness as such implies the reciprocal independence of subject\nand object. The ego in its judgment has an object which is not distinct\nfrom it,\u2014it has itself. Consciousness has passed into self-consciousness.\n(b) Self-consciousness(130).\n\u00a7 424. _Self-consciousness_ is the truth of consciousness: the latter is a\nconsequence of the former, all consciousness of an other object being as a\nmatter of fact also self-consciousness. The object is my idea: I am aware\nof the object as mine; and thus in it I am aware of me. The formula of\nself-consciousness is I = I:\u2014abstract freedom, pure \u201cideality.\u201d In so far\nit lacks \u201creality\u201d: for as it is its own object, there is strictly\nspeaking no object, because there is no distinction between it and the\nobject.\n\u00a7 425. Abstract self-consciousness is the first negation of consciousness,\nand for that reason it is burdened with an external object, or, nominally,\nwith the negation of it. Thus it is at the same time the antecedent stage,\nconsciousness: it is the contradiction of itself as self-consciousness and\nas consciousness. But the latter aspect and the negation in general is in\nI = I potentially suppressed; and hence as this certitude of self against\nthe object it is the _impulse_ to realise its implicit nature, by giving\nits abstract self-awareness content and objectivity, and in the other\ndirection to free itself from its sensuousness, to set aside the given\nobjectivity and identify it with itself. The two processes are one and the\nsame, the identification of its consciousness and self-consciousness.\n(\u03b1) Appetite or Instinctive Desire(131).\n\u00a7 426. Self-consciousness, in its immediacy, is a singular, and a desire\n(appetite),\u2014the contradiction implied in its abstraction which should yet\nbe objective,\u2014or in its immediacy which has the shape of an external\nobject and should be subjective. The certitude of one\u2019s self, which issues\nfrom the suppression of mere consciousness, pronounces the _object_ null:\nand the outlook of self-consciousness towards the object equally qualifies\nthe abstract ideality of such self-consciousness as null.\n\u00a7 427. Self-consciousness, therefore, knows itself implicit in the object,\nwhich in this outlook is conformable to the appetite. In the negation of\nthe two one-sided moments by the ego\u2019s own activity, this identity comes\nto be _for_ the ego. To this activity the object, which implicitly and for\nself-consciousness is self-less, can make no resistance: the dialectic,\nimplicit in it, towards self-suppression exists in this case as that\nactivity of the ego. Thus while the given object is rendered subjective,\nthe subjectivity divests itself of its one-sidedness and becomes objective\nto itself.\n\u00a7 428. The product of this process is the fast conjunction of the ego with\nitself, its satisfaction realised, and itself made actual. On the external\nside it continues, in this return upon itself, primarily describable as an\nindividual, and maintains itself as such; because its bearing upon the\nself-less object is purely negative, the latter, therefore, being merely\nconsumed. Thus appetite in its satisfaction is always destructive, and in\nits content selfish: and as the satisfaction has only happened in the\nindividual (and that is transient) the appetite is again generated in the\nvery act of satisfaction.\n\u00a7 429. But on the inner side, or implicitly, the sense of self which the\nego gets in the satisfaction does not remain in abstract\nself-concentration or in mere individuality; on the contrary,\u2014as negation\nof _immediacy_ and individuality the result involves a character of\nuniversality and of the identity of self-consciousness with its object.\nThe judgment or diremption of this self-consciousness is the consciousness\nof a \u201c_free_\u201d object, in which ego is aware of itself as an ego, which\nhowever is _also_ still outside it.\n(\u03b2) Self-consciousness Recognitive(132).\n\u00a7 430. Here there is a self-consciousness for a self-consciousness, at\nfirst immediately as one of two things for another. In that other as ego I\nbehold myself, and yet also an immediately existing object, another ego\nabsolutely independent of me and opposed to me. (The suppression of the\nsingleness of self-consciousness was only a first step in the suppression,\nand it merely led to the characterisation of it as _particular_.) This\ncontradiction gives either self-consciousness the impulse to _show_ itself\nas a free self, and to exist as such for the other:\u2014the process of\n_recognition_.\n\u00a7 431. The process is a battle. I cannot be aware of me as myself in\nanother individual, so long as I see in that other an other and an\nimmediate existence: and I am consequently bent upon the suppression of\nthis immediacy of his. But in like measure _I_ cannot be recognised as\nimmediate, except so far as I overcome the mere immediacy on my own part,\nand thus give existence to my freedom. But this immediacy is at the same\ntime the corporeity of self-consciousness, in which as in its sign and\ntool the latter has its own _sense of self_, and its being _for others_,\nand the means for entering into relation with them.\n\u00a7 432. The fight of recognition is a life and death struggle: either\nself-consciousness imperils the other\u2019s like, and incurs a like peril for\nits own\u2014but only peril, for either is no less bent on maintaining his\nlife, as the existence of his freedom. Thus the death of one, though by\nthe abstract, therefore rude, negation of immediacy, it, from one point of\nview, solves the contradiction, is yet, from the essential point of view\n(i.e. the outward and visible recognition), a new contradiction (for that\nrecognition is at the same time undone by the other\u2019s death) and a greater\nthan the other.\n\u00a7 433. But because life is as requisite as liberty to the solution, the\nfight ends in the first instance as a one-sided negation with inequality.\nWhile the one combatant prefers life, retains his single\nself-consciousness, but surrenders his claim for recognition, the other\nholds fast to his self-assertion and is recognised by the former as his\nsuperior. Thus arises the status of _master and slave_.\nIn the battle for recognition and the subjugation under a master, we see,\non their phenomenal side, the emergence of man\u2019s social life and the\ncommencement of political union. _Force_, which is the basis of this\nphenomenon, is not on that account a basis of right, but only the\nnecessary and legitimate factor in the passage from the state of\nself-consciousness sunk in appetite and selfish isolation into the state\nof universal self-consciousness. Force, then, is the external or\nphenomenal commencement of states, not their underlying and essential\nprinciple.\n\u00a7 434. This status, in the first place, implies _common_ wants and common\nconcern for their satisfaction,\u2014for the means of mastery, the slave, must\nlikewise be kept in life. In place of the rude destruction of the\nimmediate object there ensues acquisition, preservation, and formation of\nit, as the instrumentality in which the two extremes of independence and\nnon-independence are welded together. The form of universality thus\narising in satisfying the want, creates a _permanent_ means and a\nprovision which takes care for and secures the future.\n\u00a7 435. But secondly, when we look to the distinction of the two, the\nmaster beholds in the slave and his servitude the supremacy of his\n_single_ self-hood, and that by the suppression of immediate self-hood, a\nsuppression, however, which falls on another. This other, the slave,\nhowever, in the service of the master, works off his individualist\nself-will, overcomes the inner immediacy of appetite, and in this\ndivestment of self and in \u201cthe fear of his lord\u201d makes \u201cthe beginning of\nwisdom\u201d\u2014the passage to universal self-consciousness.\n(\u03b3) Universal Self-consciousness.\n\u00a7 436. Universal self-consciousness is the affirmative awareness of self\nin an other self: each self as a free individuality has his own \u201cabsolute\u201d\nindependence, yet in virtue of the negation of its immediacy or appetite\nwithout distinguishing itself from that other. Each is thus universal\nself-conscious and objective; each has \u201creal\u201d universality in the shape of\nreciprocity, so far as each knows itself recognised in the other freeman,\nand is aware of this in so far as it recognises the other and knows him to\nbe free.\nThis universal re-appearance of self-consciousness\u2014the notion which is\naware of itself in its objectivity as a subjectivity identical with itself\nand for that reason universal\u2014is the form of consciousness which lies at\nthe root of all true mental or spiritual life\u2014in family, fatherland,\nstate, and of all virtues, love, friendship, valour, honour, fame. But\nthis appearance of the underlying essence may be severed from that\nessential, and be maintained apart in worthless honour, idle fame, &c.\n\u00a7 437. This unity of consciousness and self-consciousness implies in the\nfirst instance the individuals mutually throwing light upon each other.\nBut the difference between those who are thus identified is mere vague\ndiversity\u2014or rather it is a difference which is none. Hence its truth is\nthe fully and really existent universality and objectivity of\nself-consciousness,\u2014which is _Reason_.\nReason, as the _Idea_ (\u00a7 213) as it here appears, is to be taken as\nmeaning that the distinction between notion and reality which it unifies\nhas the special aspect of a distinction between the self-concentrated\nnotion or consciousness, and the object subsisting external and opposed to\nit.\n(c) Reason(133).\n\u00a7 438. The essential and actual truth which reason is, lies in the simple\nidentity of the subjectivity of the notion, with its objectivity and\nuniversality. The universality of reason, therefore, whilst it signifies\nthat the object, which was only given in consciousness _qu\u00e2_\nconsciousness, is now itself universal, permeating and encompassing the\nego, also signifies that the pure ego is the pure form which overlaps the\nobject, and encompasses it without it.\n\u00a7 439. Self-consciousness, thus certified that its determinations are no\nless objective, or determinations of the very being of things, than they\nare its own thoughts, is Reason, which as such an identity is not only the\nabsolute _substance_, but the _truth_ that knows it. For truth here has,\nas its peculiar mode and immanent form, the self-centred pure notion, ego,\nthe certitude of self as infinite universality. Truth, aware of what it\nis, is mind (spirit).\nSub-Section C. Psychology. Mind(134).\n\u00a7 440. Mind has defined itself as the truth of soul and consciousness,\u2014the\nformer a simple immediate totality, the latter now an infinite form which\nis not, like consciousness, restricted by that content, and does not stand\nin mere correlation to it as to its object, but is an awareness of this\nsubstantial totality, neither subjective nor objective. Mind, therefore,\nstarts only from its own being and is in correlation only with its own\nfeatures.\nPsychology accordingly studies the faculties or general modes of mental\nactivity _qu\u00e2_ mental\u2014mental vision, ideation, remembering, &c., desires,\n&c.\u2014apart both from the content, which on the phenomenal side is found in\nempirical ideation, in thinking also and in desire and will, and from the\ntwo forms in which these modes exist, viz. in the soul as a physical mode,\nand in consciousness itself as a separately existent object of that\nconsciousness. This, however, is not an arbitrary abstraction by the\npsychologist. Mind is just this elevation above nature and physical modes,\nand above the complication with an external object\u2014in one word, above the\nmaterial, as its concept has just shown. All it has now to do is to\nrealise this notion of its freedom, and get rid of the _form_ of immediacy\nwith which it once more begins. The content which is elevated to\nintuitions is _its_ sensations: it is _its_ intuitions also which are\ntransmuted into representations, and its representations which are\ntransmuted again into thoughts, &c.\n\u00a7 441. The soul is finite, so far as its features are immediate or\ncon-natural. Consciousness is finite, in so far as it has an object. Mind\nis finite, in so far as, though it no longer has an object, it has a mode\nin its knowledge; i.e., it is finite by means of its immediacy, or, what\nis the same thing, by being subjective or only a notion. And it is a\nmatter of no consequence, which is defined as its notion, and which as the\nreality of that notion. Say that its notion is the utterly infinite\nobjective reason, then its reality is knowledge or _intelligence_: say\nthat knowledge is its notion, then its reality is that reason, and the\nrealisation of knowledge consists in appropriating reason. Hence the\nfinitude of mind is to be placed in the (temporary) failure of knowledge\nto get hold of the full reality of its reason, or, equally, in the\n(temporary) failure of reason to attain full manifestation in knowledge.\nReason at the same time is only infinite so far as it is \u201cabsolute\u201d\nfreedom; so far, that is, as presupposing itself for its knowledge to work\nupon, it thereby reduces itself to finitude, and appears as everlasting\nmovement of superseding this immediacy, of comprehending itself, and being\na rational knowledge.\n\u00a7 442. The progress of mind is _development_, in so far as its existent\nphase, viz. knowledge, involves as its intrinsic purpose and burden that\nutter and complete autonomy which is rationality; in which case the action\nof translating this purpose into reality is strictly only a nominal\npassage over into manifestation, and is even there a return into itself.\nSo far as knowledge which has not shaken off its original quality of\n_mere_ knowledge is only abstract or formal, the goal of mind is to give\nit objective fulfilment, and thus at the same time produce its freedom.\nThe development here meant is not that of the individual (which has a\ncertain _anthropological_ character), where faculties and forces are\nregarded as successively emerging and presenting themselves in external\nexistence\u2014a series of steps, on the ascertainment on which there was for a\nlong time great stress laid (by the system of Condillac), as if a\nconjectural natural emergence could exhibit the origin of these faculties\nand _explain_ them. In Condillac\u2019s method there is an unmistakable\nintention to show how the _several_ modes of mental activity could be made\nintelligible without losing sight of mental unity, and to exhibit their\nnecessary interconnexion. But the categories employed in doing so are of a\nwretched sort. Their ruling principle is that the sensible is taken (and\nwith justice) as the _prius_ or the initial basis, but that the later\nphases that follow this starting-point present themselves as emerging in a\nsolely _affirmative_ manner, and the negative aspect of mental activity,\nby which this material is transmuted into mind and destroyed _as_ a\nsensible, is misconceived and overlooked. As the theory of Condillac\nstates it, the sensible is not merely the empirical first, but is left as\nif it were the true and essential foundation.\nSimilarly, if the activities of mind are treated as mere manifestations,\nforces, perhaps in terms stating their utility or suitability for some\nother interest of head or heart, there is no indication of the true final\naim of the whole business. That can only be the intelligible unity of\nmind, and its activity can only have itself as aim; i.e. its aim can only\nbe to get rid of the form of immediacy or subjectivity, to reach and get\nhold of itself, and to liberate itself to itself. In this way the\nso-called faculties of mind as thus distinguished are only to be treated\nas steps of this liberation. And this is the only _rational_ mode of\nstudying the mind and its various activities.\n\u00a7 443. As consciousness has for its object the stage which preceded it,\nviz. the natural soul (\u00a7 413), so mind has or rather makes consciousness\nits object: i.e. whereas consciousness is only the virtual identity of the\nego with its other (\u00a7 415), the mind realises that identity as the\nconcrete unity which it and it only knows. Its productions are governed by\nthe principle of all reason that the contents are at once potentially\nexistent, and are the mind\u2019s own, in freedom. Thus, if we consider the\ninitial aspect of mind, that aspect is twofold\u2014as _being_ and as _its\nown_: by the one, the mind finds in itself something which _is_, by the\nother it affirms it to be only _its own_. The way of mind is therefore\n(_a_) to be theoretical: it has to do with the rational as its immediate\naffection which it must render its own: or it has to free knowledge from\nits pre-supposedness and therefore from its abstractness, and make the\naffection subjective. When the affection has been rendered its own, and\nthe knowledge consequently characterised as free intelligence, i.e. as\nhaving its full and free characterisation in itself, it is\n(_b_) Will: _practical_ mind, which in the first place is likewise\nformal\u2014i.e. its content is at first _only_ its own, and is immediately\nwilled; and it proceeds next to liberate its volition from its\nsubjectivity, which is the one-sided form of its contents, so that it\n(_c_) confronts itself as free mind and thus gets rid of both its defects\nof one-sidedness.\n\u00a7 444. The theoretical as well as the practical mind still fall under the\ngeneral range of Mind Subjective. They are not to be distinguished as\nactive and passive. Subjective mind is productive: but it is a merely\nnominal productivity. Inwards, the theoretical mind produces only its\n\u201cideal\u201d world, and gains abstract autonomy within; while the practical,\nwhile it has to do with autonomous products, with a material which is its\nown, has a material which is only nominally such, and therefore a\nrestricted content, for which it gains the form of universality. Outwards,\nthe subjective mind (which as a unity of soul and consciousness, is thus\nalso a reality,\u2014a reality at once anthropological and conformable to\nconsciousness) has for its products, in the theoretical range, the _word_,\nand in the practical (not yet deed and action, but) _enjoyment_.\nPsychology, like logic, is one of those sciences which in modern times\nhave yet derived least profit from the more general mental culture and the\ndeeper conception of reason. It is still extremely ill off. The turn which\nthe Kantian philosophy has taken has given it greater importance: it has,\nand that in its empirical condition, been claimed as the basis of\nmetaphysics, which is to consist of nothing but the empirical apprehension\nand the analysis of the facts of human consciousness, merely as facts,\njust as they are given. This position of psychology, mixing it up with\nforms belonging to the range of consciousness and with anthropology, has\nled to no improvement in its own condition: but it has had the further\neffect that, both for the mind as such, and for metaphysics and philosophy\ngenerally, all attempts have been abandoned to ascertain the necessity of\nessential and actual reality, to get at the notion and the truth.\n(a) Theoretical mind.\n\u00a7 445. Intelligence(135) _finds_ itself determined: this is its apparent\naspect from which in its immediacy it starts. But as knowledge,\nintelligence consists in treating what is found as its own. Its activity\nhas to do with the empty form\u2014the pretence of _finding_ reason: and its\naim is to realise its concept or to be reason actual, along with which the\ncontent is realised as rational. This activity is _cognition_. The nominal\nknowledge, which is only certitude, elevates itself, as reason is\nconcrete, to definite and conceptual knowledge. The course of this\nelevation is itself rational, and consists in a necessary passage\n(governed by the concept) of one grade or term of intelligent activity (a\nso-called faculty of mind) into another. The refutation which such\ncognition gives of the semblance that the rational is _found_, starts from\nthe certitude or the faith of intelligence in its capability of rational\nknowledge, and in the possibility of being able to appropriate the reason,\nwhich it and the content virtually is.\nThe distinction of Intelligence from Will is often incorrectly taken to\nmean that each has a fixed and separate existence of its own, as if\nvolition could be without intelligence, or the activity of intelligence\ncould be without will. The possibility of a culture of the intellect which\nleaves the heart untouched, as it is said, and of the heart without the\nintellect\u2014of hearts which in one-sided way want intellect, and heartless\nintellects\u2014only proves at most that bad and radically untrue existences\noccur. But it is not philosophy which should take such untruths of\nexistence and of mere imagining for truth\u2014take the worthless for the\nessential nature. A host of other phrases used of intelligence, e.g. that\nit receives and accepts impressions from outside, that ideas arise through\nthe causal operations of external things upon it, &c., belong to a point\nof view utterly alien to the mental level or to the position of\nphilosophic study.\nA favourite reflectional form is that of powers and faculties of soul,\nintelligence, or mind. Faculty, like power or force, is the fixed quality\nof any object of thought, conceived as reflected into self. Force (\u00a7 136)\nis no doubt the infinity of form\u2014of the inward and the outward: but its\nessential finitude involves the indifference of content to form (ib.\nnote). In this lies the want of organic unity which by this reflectional\nform, treating mind as a \u201clot\u201d of forces, is brought into mind, as it is\nby the same method brought into nature. Any aspect which can be\ndistinguished in mental action is stereotyped as an independent entity,\nand the mind thus made a skeleton-like mechanical collection. It makes\nabsolutely no difference if we substitute the expression \u201cactivities\u201d for\npowers and faculties. Isolate the activities and you similarly make the\nmind a mere aggregate, and treat their essential correlation as an\nexternal incident.\nThe action of intelligence as theoretical mind has been called _cognition_\n(knowledge). Yet this does not mean intelligence _inter alia_\nknows,\u2014besides which it also intuites, conceives, remembers, imagines, &c.\nTo take up such a position is in the first instance part and parcel of\nthat isolating of mental activity just censured; but it is also in\naddition connected with the great question of modern times, as to whether\ntrue knowledge or the knowledge of truth is possible,\u2014which, if answered\nin the negative, must lead to abandoning the effort. The numerous aspects\nand reasons and modes of phrase with which external reflection swells the\nbulk of this question are cleared up in their place: the more external the\nattitude of understanding in the question, the more diffuse it makes a\nsimple object. At the present place the simple concept of cognition is\nwhat confronts the quite general assumption taken up by the question, viz.\nthe assumption that the possibility of true knowledge in general is in\ndispute, and the assumption that it is possible for us at our will either\nto prosecute or to abandon cognition. The concept or possibility of\ncognition has come out as intelligence itself, as the certitude of reason:\nthe act of cognition itself is therefore the actuality of intelligence. It\nfollows from this that it is absurd to speak of intelligence and yet at\nthe same time of the possibility or choice of knowing or not. But\ncognition is genuine, just so far as it realises itself, or makes the\nconcept its own. This nominal description has its concrete meaning exactly\nwhere cognition has it. The stages of its realising activity are\nintuition, conception, memory, &c.: these activities have no other\nimmanent meaning: their aim is solely the concept of cognition (\u00a7 445\nnote). If they are isolated, however, then an impression is implied that\nthey are useful for something else than cognition, or that they severally\nprocure a cognitive satisfaction of their own; and that leads to a\nglorification of the delights of intuition, remembrance, imagination. It\nis true that even as isolated (i.e. as non-intelligent), intuition,\nimagination, &c. can afford a certain satisfaction: what physical nature\nsucceeds in doing by its fundamental quality\u2014its\nout-of-selfness,\u2014exhibiting the elements or factors of immanent reason\nexternal to each other,\u2014that the intelligence can do by voluntary act, but\nthe same result may happen where the intelligence is itself only natural\nand untrained. But the _true satisfaction_, it is admitted, is only\nafforded by an intuition permeated by intellect and mind, by rational\nconception, by products of imagination which are permeated by reason and\nexhibit ideas\u2014in a word, by _cognitive_ intuition, cognitive conception,\n&c. The truth ascribed to such satisfaction lies in this, that intuition,\nconception, &c. are not isolated, and exist only as \u201cmoments\u201d in the\ntotality of cognition itself.\n(\u03b1) Intuition (Intelligent Perception)(136).\n\u00a7 446. The mind which as soul is physically conditioned,\u2014which as\nconsciousness stands to this condition on the same terms as to an outward\nobject,\u2014but which as intelligence _finds itself_ so characterised\u2014is (1)\nan inarticulate embryonic life, in which it is to itself as it were\npalpable and has the whole _material_ of its knowledge. In consequence of\nthe immediacy in which it is thus originally, it is in this stage only as\nan individual and possesses a vulgar subjectivity. It thus appears as mind\nin the guise of _feeling_.\nIf feeling formerly turned up (\u00a7 399) as a mode of the _soul\u2019s_ existence,\nthe finding of it or its immediacy was in that case essentially to be\nconceived as a congenital or corporeal condition; whereas at present it is\nonly to be taken abstractly in the general sense of immediacy.\n\u00a7 447. The characteristic form of feeling is that though it is a mode of\nsome \u201caffection,\u201d this mode is simple. Hence feeling, even should its\nimport be most sterling and true, has the form of casual\nparticularity,\u2014not to mention that its import may also be the most scanty\nand most untrue.\nIt is commonly enough assumed that mind has in its feeling the material of\nits ideas, but the statement is more usually understood in a sense the\nopposite of that which it has here. In contrast with the simplicity of\nfeeling it is usual rather to assume that the primary mental phase is\njudgment generally, or the distinction of consciousness into subject and\nobject; and the special quality of sensation is derived from an\nindependent _object_, external or internal. With us, in the truth of mind,\nthe mere consciousness point of view, as opposed to true mental\n\u201cidealism,\u201d is swallowed up, and the matter of feeling has rather been\nsupposed already as _immanent_ in the mind.\u2014It is commonly taken for\ngranted that as regards content there is more in feeling than in thought:\nthis being specially affirmed of moral and religious feelings. Now the\nmaterial, which the mind as it feels is to itself, is _here_ the result\nand the mature result of a fully organised reason: hence under the head of\nfeeling is comprised all rational and indeed all spiritual content\nwhatever. But the form of selfish singleness to which feeling reduces the\nmind is the lowest and worst vehicle it can have\u2014one in which it is not\nfound as a free and infinitely universal principle, but rather as\nsubjective and private, in content and value entirely contingent. Trained\nand sterling feeling is the feeling of an educated mind which has acquired\nthe consciousness of the true differences of things, of their essential\nrelationships and real characters; and it is with such a mind that this\nrectified material enters into its feeling and receives this form. Feeling\nis the immediate, as it were the closest, contact in which the thinking\nsubject can stand to a given content. Against that content the subject\nre-acts first of all with its particular self-feeling, which though it\n_may_ be of more sterling value and of wider range than a onesided\nintellectual standpoint, may just as likely be narrow and poor; and in any\ncase is the form of the particular and subjective. If a man on any topic\nappeals not to the nature and notion of the thing, or at least to\nreasons\u2014to the generalities of common sense\u2014but to his feeling, the only\nthing to do is to let him alone, because by his behaviour he refuses to\nhave any lot or part in common rationality, and shuts himself up in his\nown isolated subjectivity\u2014his private and particular self.\n\u00a7 448. (2) As this immediate finding is broken up into elements, we have\nthe one factor in _Attention_\u2014the abstract _identical_ direction of mind\n(in feeling, as also in all other more advanced developments of it)\u2014an\nactive self-collection\u2014the factor of fixing it as our own, but with an as\nyet only nominal autonomy of intelligence. Apart from such attention there\nis nothing for the mind. The other factor is to invest the special quality\nof feeling, as contrasted with this inwardness of mind, with the character\nof something existent, but as a _negative_ or as the abstract otherness of\nitself. Intelligence thus defines the content of sensation as something\nthat is out of itself, projects it into time and space, which are the\nforms in which it is intuitive. To the view of consciousness the material\nis only an object of consciousness, a relative other: from mind it\nreceives the rational characteristic of being _its very other_ (\u00a7\u00a7 147,\n254).\n\u00a7 449. (3) When intelligence reaches a concrete unity of the two factors,\nthat is to say, when it is at once self-collected in this externally\nexisting material, and yet in this self-collectedness sunk in the\nout-of-selfness, it is _Intuition_ or Mental Vision.\n\u00a7 450. At and towards this its own out-of-selfness, intelligence no less\nessentially directs its attention. In this its immediacy it is an awaking\nto itself, a recollection of itself. Thus intuition becomes a concretion\nof the material with the intelligence, which makes it its own, so that it\nno longer needs this immediacy, no longer needs to find the content.\n(\u03b2) Representation (or Mental Idea)(137).\n\u00a7 451. Representation is this recollected or inwardised intuition, and as\nsuch is the middle between that stage of intelligence where it finds\nitself immediately subject to modification and that where intelligence is\nin its freedom, or, as thought. The representation is the property of\nintelligence; with a preponderating subjectivity, however, as its right of\nproperty is still conditioned by contrast with the immediacy, and the\nrepresentation cannot as it stands be said to _be_. The path of\nintelligence in representations is to render the immediacy inward, to\ninvest itself with intuitive action in itself, and at the same time to get\nrid of the subjectivity of the inwardness, and inwardly divest itself of\nit; so as to be in itself in an externality of its own. But as\nrepresentation begins from intuition and the ready-found material of\nintuition, the intuitional contrast still continues to affect its\nactivity, and makes its concrete products still \u201csyntheses,\u201d which do not\ngrow to the concrete immanence of the notion till they reach the stage of\nthought.\n(\u03b1\u03b1) Recollection(138).\n\u00a7 452. Intelligence, as it at first recollects the intuition, places the\ncontent of feeling in its own inwardness\u2014in a space and a time of its own.\nIn this way that content is (1) an _image_ or picture, liberated from its\noriginal immediacy and abstract singleness amongst other things, and\nreceived into the universality of the ego. The image loses the full\ncomplement of features proper to intuition, and is arbitrary or\ncontingent, isolated, we may say, from the external place, time, and\nimmediate context in which the intuition stood.\n\u00a7 453. (2) The image is of itself transient, and intelligence itself is as\nattention its time and also its place, its when and where. But\nintelligence is not only consciousness and actual existence, but _qu\u00e2_\nintelligence is the subject and the potentiality of its own\nspecialisations. The image when thus kept in mind is no longer existent,\nbut stored up out of consciousness.\nTo grasp intelligence as this night-like mine or pit in which is stored a\nworld of infinitely many images and representations, yet without being in\nconsciousness, is from the one point of view the universal postulate which\nbids us treat the notion as concrete, in the way we treat e.g. the germ as\naffirmatively containing, in virtual possibility, all the qualities that\ncome into existence in the subsequent development of the tree. Inability\nto grasp a universal like this, which, though intrinsically concrete,\nstill continues _simple_, is what has led people to talk about special\nfibres and areas as receptacles of particular ideas. It was felt that what\nwas diverse should in the nature of things have a local habitation\npeculiar to itself. But whereas the reversion of the germ from its\nexisting specialisations to its simplicity in a purely potential existence\ntakes place only in another germ,\u2014the germ of the fruit; intelligence\n_qu\u00e2_ intelligence shows the potential coming to free existence in its\ndevelopment, and yet at the same time collecting itself in its inwardness.\nHence from the other point of view intelligence is to be conceived as this\nsub-conscious mine, i.e. as the _existent_ universal in which the\ndifferent has not yet been realised in its separations. And it is indeed\nthis potentiality which is the first form of universality offered in\nmental representation.\n\u00a7 454. (3) An image thus abstractly treasured up needs, if it is to exist,\nan actual intuition: and what is strictly called Remembrance is the\nreference of the image to an intuition,\u2014and that as a subsumption of the\nimmediate single intuition (impression) under what is in point of form\nuniversal, under the representation (idea) with the same content. Thus\nintelligence recognises the specific sensation and the intuition of it as\nwhat is already its own,\u2014in them it is still within itself: at the same\ntime it is aware that what is only its (primarily) internal image is also\nan immediate object of intuition, by which it is authenticated. The image,\nwhich in the mine of intelligence was only its _property_, now that it has\nbeen endued with externality, comes actually into its _possession_. And so\nthe image is at once rendered distinguishable from the intuition and\nseparable from the blank night in which it was originally submerged.\nIntelligence is thus the force which can give forth its property, and\ndispense with external intuition for its existence in it. This \u201csynthesis\u201d\nof the internal image with the recollected existence is _representation_\nproper: by this synthesis the internal now has the qualification of being\nable to be presented before intelligence and to have its existence in it.\n(\u03b2\u03b2) Imagination(139).\n\u00a7 455. (1) The intelligence which is active in this possession is the\n_reproductive imagination_, where the images issue from the inward world\nbelonging to the ego, which is now the power over them. The images are in\nthe first instance referred to this external, immediate time and space\nwhich is treasured up along with them. But it is solely in the conscious\nsubject, where it is treasured up, that the image has the individuality in\nwhich the features composing it are conjoined: whereas their original\nconcretion, i.e. at first only in space and time, as a _unit_ of\nintuition, has been broken up. The content reproduced, belonging as it\ndoes to the self-identical unity of intelligence, and an out-put from its\nuniversal mine, has a general idea (representation) to supply the link of\nassociation for the images which according to circumstances are more\nabstract or more concrete ideas.\nThe so-called _laws of the association of ideas_ were objects of great\ninterest, especially during that outburst of empirical psychology which\nwas contemporaneous with the decline of philosophy. In the first place, it\nis not _Ideas_ (properly so called) which are associated. Secondly, these\nmodes of relation are not _laws_, just for the reason that there are so\nmany laws about the same thing, as to suggest a caprice and a contingency\nopposed to the very nature of law. It is a matter of chance whether the\nlink of association is something pictorial, or an intellectual category,\nsuch as likeness and contrast, reason and consequence. The train of images\nand representations suggested by association is the sport of vacant-minded\nideation, where, though intelligence shows itself by a certain formal\nuniversality, the matter is entirely pictorial.\u2014Image and idea, if we\nleave out of account the more precise definition of those forms given\nabove, present also a distinction in content. The former is the more\nconsciously-concrete idea, whereas the idea (representation), whatever be\nits content (from image, notion, or idea), has always the peculiarity,\nthough belonging to intelligence, of being in respect of its content given\nand immediate. It is still true of this idea or representation, as of all\nintelligence, that it finds its material, as a matter of fact, to _be_ so\nand so; and the universality which the aforesaid material receives by\nideation is still abstract. Mental representation is the mean in the\nsyllogism of the elevation of intelligence, the link between the two\nsignifications of self-relatedness\u2014viz. _being_ and _universality_, which\nin consciousness receive the title of object and subject. Intelligence\ncomplements what is merely found by the attribution of universality, and\nthe internal and its own by the attribution of being, but a being of its\nown institution. (On the distinction of representations and thoughts, see\nIntrod. to the Logic, \u00a7 20 note.)\nAbstraction, which occurs in the ideational activity by which general\nideas are produced (and ideas _qu\u00e2_ ideas virtually have the form of\ngenerality), is frequently explained as the incidence of many similar\nimages one upon another and is supposed to be thus made intelligible. If\nthis super-imposing is to be no mere accident and without principle, a\nforce of attraction in like images must be assumed, or something of the\nsort, which at the same time would have the negative power of rubbing off\nthe dissimilar elements against each other. This force is really\nintelligence itself,\u2014the self-identical ego which by its internalising\nrecollection gives the images _ipso facto_ generality, and subsumes the\nsingle intuition under the already internalised image (\u00a7 453).\n\u00a7 456. Thus even the association of ideas is to be treated as a\nsubsumption of the individual under the universal, which forms their\nconnecting link. But here intelligence is more than merely a general form:\nits inwardness is an internally definite, concrete subjectivity with a\nsubstance and value of its own, derived from some interest, some latent\nconcept or Ideal principle, so far as we may by anticipation speak of\nsuch. Intelligence is the power which wields the stores of images and\nideas belonging to it, and which thus (2) freely combines and subsumes\nthese stores in obedience to its peculiar tenor. Such is creative\nimagination(140)\u2014symbolic, allegoric, or poetical imagination\u2014where the\nintelligence gets a definite embodiment in this store of ideas and informs\nthem with its general tone. These more or less concrete, individualised\ncreations are still \u201csyntheses\u201d: for the material, in which the subjective\nprinciples and ideas get a mentally pictorial existence, is derived from\nthe data of intuition.\n\u00a7 457. In creative imagination intelligence has been so far perfected as\nto need no helps for intuition. Its self-sprung ideas have pictorial\nexistence. This pictorial creation of its intuitive spontaneity is\nsubjective\u2014still lacks the side of existence. But as the creation unites\nthe internal idea with the vehicle of materialisation, intelligence has\ntherein _implicitly_ returned both to identical self-relation and to\nimmediacy. As reason, its first start was to appropriate the immediate\ndatum in itself (\u00a7\u00a7 445, 455), i.e. to universalise it; and now its action\nas reason (\u00a7 458) is from the present point directed towards giving the\ncharacter of an existent to what in it has been perfected to concrete\nauto-intuition. In other words, it aims at making itself _be_ and be a\nfact. Acting on this view, it is self-uttering, intuition-producing: the\nimagination which creates signs.\nProductive imagination is the centre in which the universal and being,\none\u2019s own and what is picked up, internal and external, are completely\nwelded into one. The preceding \u201csyntheses\u201d of intuition, recollection,\n&c., are unifications of the same factors, but they are \u201csyntheses\u201d; it is\nnot till creative imagination that intelligence ceases to be the vague\nmine and the universal, and becomes an individuality, a concrete\nsubjectivity, in which the self-reference is defined both to being and to\nuniversality. The creations of imagination are on all hands recognised as\nsuch combinations of the mind\u2019s own and inward with the matter of\nintuition; what further and more definite aspects they have is a matter\nfor other departments. For the present this internal studio of\nintelligence is only to be looked at in these abstract\naspects.\u2014Imagination, when regarded as the agency of this unification, is\nreason, but only a nominal reason, because the matter or theme it embodies\nis to imagination _qu\u00e2_ imagination a matter of indifference; whilst\nreason _qu\u00e2_ reason also insists upon the _truth_ of its content.\nAnother point calling for special notice is that, when imagination\nelevates the internal meaning to an image and intuition, and this is\nexpressed by saying that it gives the former the character of an\n_existent_, the phrase must not seem surprising that intelligence makes\nitself _be_ as a _thing_; for its ideal import is itself, and so is the\naspect which it imposes upon it. The image produced by imagination of an\nobject is a bare mental or subjective intuition: in the sign or symbol it\nadds intuitability proper; and in mechanical memory it completes, so far\nas it is concerned, this form of _being_.\n\u00a7 458. In this unity (initiated by intelligence) of an independent\nrepresentation with an intuition, the matter of the latter is, in the\nfirst instance, something accepted, somewhat immediate or given (e.g. the\ncolour of the cockade, &c.). But in the fusion of the two elements, the\nintuition does not count positively or as representing itself, but as\nrepresentative of something else. It is an image, which has received as\nits soul and meaning an independent mental representation. This intuition\nis the _Sign_.\nThe sign is some immediate intuition, representing a totally different\nimport from what naturally belongs to it; it is the pyramid into which a\nforeign soul has been conveyed, and where it is conserved. The _sign_ is\ndifferent from the _symbol_: for in the symbol the original characters (in\nessence and conception) of the visible object are more or less identical\nwith the import which it bears as symbol; whereas in the sign, strictly\nso-called, the natural attributes of the intuition, and the connotation of\nwhich it is a sign, have nothing to do with each other. Intelligence\ntherefore gives proof of wider choice and ampler authority in the use of\nintuitions when it treats them as designatory (significative) rather than\nas symbolical.\nIn logic and psychology, signs and language are usually foisted in\nsomewhere as an appendix, without any trouble being taken to display their\nnecessity and systematic place in the economy of intelligence. The right\nplace for the sign is that just given: where intelligence\u2014which as\nintuiting generates the form of time and space, but is apparently\nrecipient of sensible matter, out of which it forms ideas\u2014now gives its\nown original ideas a definite existence from itself, treating the\nintuition (or time and space as filled full) as its own property, deleting\nthe connotation which properly and naturally belongs to it, and conferring\non it an other connotation as its soul and import. This sign-creating\nactivity may be distinctively named \u201cproductive\u201d Memory (the primarily\nabstract \u201cMnemosyne\u201d); since memory, which in ordinary life is often used\nas interchangeable and synonymous with remembrance (recollection), and\neven with conception and imagination, has always to do with signs only.\n\u00a7 459. The intuition\u2014in its natural phase a something given and given in\nspace\u2014acquires, when employed as a sign, the peculiar characteristic of\nexisting only as superseded and sublimated. Such is the negativity of\nintelligence; and thus the truer phase of the intuition used as a sign is\nexistence in _time_ (but its existence vanishes in the moment of being),\nand if we consider the rest of its external psychical quality, its\n_institution_ by intelligence, but an institution growing out of its\n(anthropological) own naturalness. This institution of the natural is the\nvocal note, where the inward idea manifests itself in adequate utterance.\nThe vocal note which receives further articulation to express specific\nideas\u2014speech and, its system, language\u2014gives to sensations, intuitions,\nconceptions, a second and higher existence than they naturally\npossess,\u2014invests them with the right of existence in the ideational realm.\nLanguage here comes under discussion only in the special aspect of a\nproduct of intelligence for manifesting its ideas in an external medium.\nIf language had to be treated in its concrete nature, it would be\nnecessary for its vocabulary or material part to recall the\nanthropological or psycho-physiological point of view (\u00a7 401), and for the\ngrammar or formal portion to anticipate the standpoint of analytic\nunderstanding. With regard to the elementary _material_ of language, while\non one hand the theory of mere accident has disappeared, on the other the\nprinciple of imitation has been restricted to the slight range it actually\ncovers\u2014that of vocal objects. Yet one may still hear the German language\npraised for its wealth\u2014that wealth consisting in its special expression\nfor special sounds\u2014_Rauschen_, _Sausen_, _Knarren_, &c.;\u2014there have been\ncollected more than a hundred such words, perhaps: the humour of the\nmoment creates fresh ones when it pleases. Such superabundance in the\nrealm of sense and of triviality contributes nothing to form the real\nwealth of a cultivated language. The strictly raw material of language\nitself depends more upon an inward symbolism than a symbolism referring to\nexternal objects; it depends, i.e. on anthropological articulation, as it\nwere the posture in the corporeal act of oral utterance. For each vowel\nand consonant accordingly, as well as for their more abstract elements\n(the posture of lips, palate, tongue in each) and for their combinations,\npeople have tried to find the appropriate signification. But these dull\nsub-conscious beginnings are deprived of their original importance and\nprominence by new influences, it may be by external agencies or by the\nneeds of civilisation. Having been originally sensuous intuitions, they\nare reduced to signs, and thus have only traces left of their original\nmeaning, if it be not altogether extinguished. As to the _formal_ element,\nagain, it is the work of analytic intellect which informs language with\nits categories: it is this logical instinct which gives rise to grammar.\nThe study of languages still in their original state, which we have first\nreally begun to make acquaintance with in modern times, has shown on this\npoint that they contain a very elaborate grammar and express distinctions\nwhich are lost or have been largely obliterated in the languages of more\ncivilised nations. It seems as if the language of the most civilised\nnations has the most imperfect grammar, and that the same language has a\nmore perfect grammar when the nation is in a more uncivilised state than\nwhen it reaches a higher civilisation. (Cf. W. von Humboldt\u2019s _Essay on\nthe Dual_.)\nIn speaking of vocal (which is the original) language, we may touch, only\nin passing, upon written language,\u2014a further development in the particular\nsphere of language which borrows the help of an externally practical\nactivity. It is from the province of immediate spatial intuition to which\nwritten language proceeds that it takes and produces the signs (\u00a7 454). In\nparticular, hieroglyphics uses spatial figures to designate _ideas_;\nalphabetical writing, on the other hand, uses them to designate vocal\nnotes which are already signs. Alphabetical writing thus consists of signs\nof signs,\u2014the words or concrete signs of vocal language being analysed\ninto their simple elements, which severally receive\ndesignation.\u2014Leibnitz\u2019s practical mind misled him to exaggerate the\nadvantages which a complete written language, formed on the hieroglyphic\nmethod (and hieroglyphics are used even where there is alphabetic writing,\nas in our signs for the numbers, the planets, the chemical elements, &c.),\nwould have as a universal language for the intercourse of nations and\nespecially of scholars. But we may be sure that it was rather the\nintercourse of nations (as was probably the case in Phoenicia, and still\ntakes place in Canton\u2014see _Macartney\u2019s Travels_ by Staunton) which\noccasioned the need of alphabetical writing and led to its formation. At\nany rate a comprehensive hieroglyphic language for ever completed is\nimpracticable. Sensible objects no doubt admit of permanent signs; but, as\nregards signs for mental objects, the progress of thought and the\ncontinual development of logic lead to changes in the views of their\ninternal relations and thus also of their nature; and this would involve\nthe rise of a new hieroglyphical denotation. Even in the case of\nsense-objects it happens that their names, i.e. their signs in vocal\nlanguage, are frequently changed, as e.g. in chemistry and mineralogy. Now\nthat it has been forgotten what names properly are, viz. externalities\nwhich of themselves have no sense, and only get signification as signs,\nand now that, instead of names proper, people ask for terms expressing a\nsort of definition, which is frequently changed capriciously and\nfortuitously, the denomination, i.e. the composite name formed of signs of\ntheir generic characters or other supposed characteristic properties, is\naltered in accordance with the differences of view with regard to the\ngenus or other supposed specific property. It is only a stationary\ncivilisation, like the Chinese, which admits of the hieroglyphic language\nof that nation; and its method of writing moreover can only be the lot of\nthat small part of a nation which is in exclusive possession of mental\nculture.\u2014The progress of the vocal language depends most closely on the\nhabit of alphabetical writing; by means of which only does vocal language\nacquire the precision and purity of its articulation. The imperfection of\nthe Chinese vocal language is notorious: numbers of its words possess\nseveral utterly different meanings, as many as ten and twenty, so that, in\nspeaking, the distinction is made perceptible merely by accent and\nintensity, by speaking low and soft or crying out. The European, learning\nto speak Chinese, falls into the most ridiculous blunders before he has\nmastered these absurd refinements of accentuation. Perfection here\nconsists in the opposite of that _parler sans accent_ which in Europe is\njustly required of an educated speaker. The hieroglyphic mode of writing\nkeeps the Chinese vocal language from reaching that objective precision\nwhich is gained in articulation by alphabetic writing.\nAlphabetic writing is on all accounts the more intelligent: in it the\n_word_\u2014the mode, peculiar to the intellect, of uttering its ideas most\nworthily\u2014is brought to consciousness and made an object of reflection.\nEngaging the attention of intelligence, as it does, it is analysed; the\nwork of sign-making is reduced to its few simple elements (the primary\npostures of articulation) in which the sense-factor in speech is brought\nto the form of universality, at the same time that in this elementary\nphase it acquires complete precision and purity. Thus alphabetic writing\nretains at the same time the advantage of vocal language, that the ideas\nhave names strictly so called: the name is the simple sign for the exact\nidea, i.e. the simple plain idea, not decomposed into its features and\ncompounded out of them. Hieroglyphics, instead of springing from the\ndirect analysis of sensible signs, like alphabetic writing, arise from an\nantecedent analysis of ideas. Thus a theory readily arises that all ideas\nmay be reduced to their elements, or simple logical terms, so that from\nthe elementary signs chosen to express these (as, in the case of the\nChinese _Koua_, the simple straight stroke, and the stroke broken into two\nparts) a hieroglyphic system would be generated by their composition. This\nfeature of hieroglyphic\u2014the analytical designations of ideas\u2014which misled\nLeibnitz to regard it as preferable to alphabetic writing is rather in\nantagonism with the fundamental desideratum of language,\u2014the name. To want\na name means that for the immediate idea (which, however ample a\nconnotation it may include, is still for the mind simple in the name), we\nrequire a simple immediate sign which for its own sake does not suggest\nanything, and has for its sole function to signify and represent sensibly\nthe simple idea as such. It is not merely the image-loving and\nimage-limited intelligence that lingers over the simplicity of ideas and\nredintegrates them from the more abstract factors into which they have\nbeen analysed: thought too reduces to the form of a simple thought the\nconcrete connotation which it \u201cresumes\u201d and reunites from the mere\naggregate of attributes to which analysis has reduced it. Both alike\nrequire such signs, simple in respect of their meaning: signs, which\nthough consisting of several letters or syllables and even decomposed into\nsuch, yet do not exhibit a combination of several ideas.\u2014What has been\nstated is the principle for settling the value of these written languages.\nIt also follows that in hieroglyphics the relations of concrete mental\nideas to one another must necessarily be tangled and perplexed, and that\nthe analysis of these (and the proximate results of such analysis must\nagain be analysed) appears to be possible in the most various and\ndivergent ways. Every divergence in analysis would give rise to another\nformation of the written name; just as in modern times (as already noted,\neven in the region of sense) muriatic acid has undergone several changes\nof name. A hieroglyphic written language would require a philosophy as\nstationary as is the civilisation of the Chinese.\nWhat has been said shows the inestimable and not sufficiently appreciated\neducational value of learning to read and write an alphabetic character.\nIt leads the mind from the sensibly concrete image to attend to the more\nformal structure of the vocal word and its abstract elements, and\ncontributes much to give stability and independence to the inward realm of\nmental life. Acquired habit subsequently effaces the peculiarity by which\nalphabetic writing appears, in the interest of vision, as a roundabout way\nto ideas by means of audibility; it makes them a sort of hieroglyphic to\nus, so that in using them we need not consciously realise them by means of\ntones, whereas people unpractised in reading utter aloud what they read in\norder to catch its meaning in the sound. Thus, while (with the faculty\nwhich transformed alphabetic writing into hieroglyphics) the capacity of\nabstraction gained by the first practice remains, hieroglyphic reading is\nof itself a deaf reading and a dumb writing. It is true that the audible\n(which is in time) and the visible (which is in space), each have their\nown basis, one no less authoritative than the other. But in the case of\nalphabetic writing there is only a _single_ basis: the two aspects occupy\ntheir rightful relation to each other: the visible language is related to\nthe vocal only as a sign, and intelligence expresses itself immediately\nand unconditionally by speaking.\u2014The instrumental function of the\ncomparatively non-sensuous element of tone for all ideational work shows\nitself further as peculiarly important in memory which forms the passage\nfrom representation to thought.\n\u00a7 460. The name, combining the intuition (an intellectual production) with\nits signification, is primarily a single transient product; and\nconjunction of the idea (which is inward) with the intuition (which is\noutward) is itself outward. The reduction of this outwardness to\ninwardness is (verbal) Memory.\n(\u03b3\u03b3) Memory(141).\n\u00a7 461. Under the shape of memory the course of intelligence passes through\nthe same inwardising (recollecting) functions, as regards the intuition of\nthe _word_, as representation in general does in dealing with the first\nimmediate intuition (\u00a7 451). (1) Making its own the synthesis achieved in\nthe sign, intelligence, by this inwardising (memorising) elevates the\n_single_ synthesis to a universal, i.e. permanent, synthesis, in which\nname and meaning are for it objectively united, and renders the intuition\n(which the name originally is) a representation. Thus the import\n(connotation) and sign, being identified, form one representation: the\nrepresentation in its inwardness is rendered concrete and gets existence\nfor its import: all this being the work of memory which retains names\n(retentive Memory).\n\u00a7 462. The name is thus the thing so far as it exists and counts in the\nideational realm. (2) In the name, _Reproductive_ memory has and\nrecognises the thing, and with the thing it has the name, apart from\nintuition and image. The name, as giving an _existence_ to the content in\nintelligence, is the externality of intelligence to itself; and the\ninwardising or recollection of the name, i.e. of an intuition of\nintellectual origin, is at the same time a self-externalisation to which\nintelligence reduces itself on its own ground. The association of the\nparticular names lies in the meaning of the features sensitive,\nrepresentative, or cogitant,\u2014series of which the intelligence traverses as\nit feels, represents, or thinks.\nGiven the name lion, we need neither the actual vision of the animal, nor\nits image even: the name alone, if we _understand_ it, is the unimaged\nsimple representation. We _think_ in names.\nThe recent attempts\u2014already, as they deserved, forgotten\u2014to rehabilitate\nthe Mnemonic of the ancients, consist in transforming names into images,\nand thus again deposing memory to the level of imagination. The place of\nthe power of memory is taken by a permanent tableau of a series of images,\nfixed in the imagination, to which is then attached the series of ideas\nforming the composition to be learned by rote. Considering the\nheterogeneity between the import of these ideas and those permanent\nimages, and the speed with which the attachment has to be made, the\nattachment cannot be made otherwise than by shallow, silly, and utterly\naccidental links. Not merely is the mind put to the torture of being\nworried by idiotic stuff, but what is thus learnt by rote is just as\nquickly forgotten, seeing that the same tableau is used for getting by\nrote every other series of ideas, and so those previously attached to it\nare effaced. What is mnemonically impressed is not like what is retained\nin memory really got by heart, i.e. strictly produced from within\noutwards, from the deep pit of the ego, and thus recited, but is, so to\nspeak, read off the tableau of fancy.\u2014Mnemonic is connected with the\ncommon prepossession about memory, in comparison with fancy and\nimagination; as if the latter were a higher and more intellectual activity\nthan memory. On the contrary, memory has ceased to deal with an image\nderived from intuition,\u2014the immediate and incomplete mode of intelligence;\nit has rather to do with an object which is the product of intelligence\nitself,\u2014such a _without book_(142) as remains locked up in the\n_within-book_(143) of intelligence, and is, within intelligence, only its\noutward and existing side.\n\u00a7 463. (3) As the interconnexion of the names lies in the meaning, the\nconjunction of their meaning with the reality as names is still an\n(external) synthesis; and intelligence in this its externality has not\nmade a complete and simple return into self. But intelligence is the\nuniversal,\u2014the single plain truth of its particular self-divestments; and\nits consummated appropriation of them abolishes that distinction between\nmeaning and name. This extreme inwardising of representation is the\nsupreme self-divestment of intelligence, in which it renders itself the\nmere _being_, the universal space of names as such, i.e. of meaningless\nwords. The ego, which is this abstract being, is, because subjectivity, at\nthe same time the power over the different names,\u2014the link which, having\nnothing in itself, fixes in itself series of them and keeps them in stable\norder. So far as they merely _are_, and intelligence is here itself this\n_being_ of theirs, its power is a merely abstract subjectivity,\u2014memory;\nwhich, on account of the complete externality in which the members of such\nseries stand to one another, and because it is itself this externality\n(subjective though that be), is called mechanical (\u00a7 195).\nA composition is, as we know, not thoroughly conned by rote, until one\nattaches no meaning to the words. The recitation of what has been thus got\nby heart is therefore of course accentless. The correct accent, if it is\nintroduced, suggests the meaning: but this introduction of the\nsignification of an idea disturbs the mechanical nexus and therefore\neasily throws out the reciter. The faculty of conning by rote series of\nwords, with no principle governing their succession, or which are\nseparately meaningless, e.g. a series of proper names, is so supremely\nmarvellous, because it is the very essence of mind to have its wits about\nit; whereas in this case the mind is estranged in itself, and its action\nis like machinery. But it is only as uniting subjectivity with objectivity\nthat the mind has its wits about it. Whereas in the case before us, after\nit has in intuition been at first so external as to pick up its facts\nready-made, and in representation inwardises or recollects this datum and\nmakes it its own,\u2014it proceeds as memory to make itself external in itself,\nso that what is its own assumes the guise of something found. Thus one of\nthe two dynamic factors of thought, viz. objectivity, is here put in\nintelligence itself as a quality of it.\u2014It is only a step further to treat\nmemory as mechanical\u2014the act implying no intelligence\u2014in which case it is\nonly justified by its uses, its indispensability perhaps for other\npurposes and functions of mind. But by so doing we overlook the proper\nsignification it has in the mind.\n\u00a7 464. If it is to be the fact and true objectivity, the mere name as an\nexistent requires something else,\u2014to be interpreted by the representing\nintellect. Now in the shape of mechanical memory, intelligence is at once\nthat external objectivity and the meaning. In this way intelligence is\nexplicitly made an _existence_ of this identity, i.e. it is explicitly\nactive as such an identity which as reason it is implicitly. Memory is in\nthis manner the passage into the function of _thought_, which no longer\nhas a _meaning_, i.e. its objectivity is no longer severed from the\nsubjective, and its inwardness does not need to go outside for its\nexistence.\nThe German language has etymologically assigned memory (_Ged\u00e4chtni\u00df_), of\nwhich it has become a foregone conclusion to speak contemptuously, the\nhigh position of direct kindred with thought (_Gedanke_).\u2014It is not matter\nof chance that the young have a better memory than the old, nor is their\nmemory solely exercised for the sake of utility. The young have a good\nmemory because they have not yet reached the stage of reflection; their\nmemory is exercised with or without design so as to level the ground of\ntheir inner life to pure being or to pure space in which the fact, the\nimplicit content, may reign and unfold itself with no antithesis to a\nsubjective inwardness. Genuine ability is in youth generally combined with\na good memory. But empirical statements of this sort help little towards a\nknowledge of what memory intrinsically is. To comprehend the position and\nmeaning of memory and to understand its organic interconnexion with\nthought is one of the hardest points, and hitherto one quite unregarded in\nthe theory of mind. Memory _qu\u00e2_ memory is itself the merely _external_\nmode, or merely _existential_ aspect of thought, and thus needs a\ncomplementary element. The passage from it to thought is to our view and\nimplicitly the identity of reason with this existential mode: an identity\nfrom which it follows that reason only exists in a subject, and as the\nfunction of that subject. Thus active reason is _Thinking_.\n(\u03b3) Thinking(144).\n\u00a7 465. Intelligence is recognitive: it cognises an intuition, but only\nbecause that intuition is already its own (\u00a7 454); and in the name it\nre-discovers the fact (\u00a7 462): but now it finds _its_ universal in the\ndouble signification of the universal as such, and of the universal as\nimmediate or as being,\u2014finds i.e. the genuine universal which is its own\nunity overlapping and including its other, viz. being. Thus intelligence\nis explicitly, and on its own part cognitive: _virtually_ it is the\nuniversal,\u2014its product (the thought) is the thing: it is a plain identity\nof subjective and objective. It knows that what is _thought_, _is_, and\nthat what _is_, only _is_ in so far as it is a thought (\u00a7 521); the\nthinking of intelligence is to _have thoughts_: these are as its content\nand object.\n\u00a7 466. But cognition by thought is still in the first instance formal: the\nuniversality and its being is the plain subjectivity of intelligence. The\nthoughts therefore are not yet fully and freely determinate, and the\nrepresentations which have been inwardised to thoughts are so far still\nthe given content.\n\u00a7 467. As dealing with this given content, thought is (\u03b1) _understanding_\nwith its formal identity, working up the representations, that have been\nmemorised, into species, genera, laws, forces, &c., in short into\ncategories,\u2014thus indicating that the raw material does not get the truth\nof its being save in these thought-forms. As intrinsically infinite\nnegativity, thought is (\u03b2) essentially an act of partition,\u2014_judgment_,\nwhich however does not break up the concept again into the old antithesis\nof universality and being, but distinguishes on the lines supplied by the\ninterconnexions peculiar to the concept. Thirdly (\u03b3), thought supersedes\nthe formal distinction and institutes at the same time an identity of the\ndifferences,\u2014thus being nominal _reason_ or inferential understanding.\nIntelligence, as the act of thought, cognises. And (\u03b1) understanding out\nof its generalities (the categories) _explains_ the individual, and is\nthen said to comprehend or understand itself: (\u03b2) in the judgment it\nexplains the individual to be an universal (species, genus). In these\nforms the _content_ appears as given: (\u03b3) but in inference (syllogism) it\ncharacterises a content from itself, by superseding that form-difference.\nWith the perception of the necessity, the last immediacy still attaching\nto formal thought has vanished.\nIn _Logic_ there was thought, but in its implicitness, and as reason\ndevelops itself in this distinction-lacking medium. So in _consciousness_\nthought occurs as a stage (\u00a7 437 note). Here reason is as the truth of the\nantithetical distinction, as it had taken shape within the mind\u2019s own\nlimits. Thought thus recurs again and again in these different parts of\nphilosophy, because these parts are different only through the medium they\nare in and the antithesis they imply; while thought is this one and the\nsame centre, to which as to their truth the antithesis return.\n\u00a7 468. Intelligence which as theoretical appropriates an immediate mode of\nbeing, is, now that it has completed _taking possession_, in its own\n_property_: the last negation of immediacy has implicitly required that\nthe intelligence shall itself determine its content. Thus thought, as free\nnotion, is now also free in point of _content_. But when intelligence is\naware that it is determinative of the content, which is _its_ mode no less\nthan it is a mode of being, it is Will.\n(b) Mind Practical(145).\n\u00a7 469. As will, the mind is aware that it is the author of its own\nconclusions, the origin of its self-fulfilment. Thus fulfilled, this\nindependency or individuality form the side of existence or of _reality_\nfor the Idea of mind. As will, the mind steps into actuality; whereas as\ncognition it is on the soil of notional generality. Supplying its own\ncontent, the will is self-possessed, and in the widest sense free: this is\nits characteristic trait. Its finitude lies in the formalism that the\nspontaneity of its self-fulfilment means no more than a general and\nabstract ownness, not yet identified with matured reason. It is the\nfunction of the essential will to bring liberty to exist in the formal\nwill, and it is therefore the aim of that formal will to fill itself with\nits essential nature, i.e. to make liberty its pervading character,\ncontent, and aim, as well as its sphere of existence. The essential\nfreedom of will is, and must always be, a thought: hence the way by which\nwill can make itself objective mind is to rise to be a thinking will,\u2014to\ngive itself the content which it can only have as it thinks itself.\nTrue liberty, in the shape of moral life, consists in the will finding its\npurpose in a universal content, not in subjective or selfish interests.\nBut such a content is only possible in thought and through thought: it is\nnothing short of absurd to seek to banish thought from the moral,\nreligious, and law-abiding life.\n\u00a7 470. Practical mind, considered at first as formal or immediate will,\ncontains a double ought\u2014(1) in the contrast which the new mode of being\nprojected outward by the will offers to the immediate positivity of its\nold existence and condition,\u2014an antagonism which in consciousness grows to\ncorrelation with external objects. (2) That first self-determination,\nbeing itself immediate, is not at once elevated into a thinking\nuniversality: the latter, therefore, virtually constitutes an obligation\non the former in point of form, as it may also constitute it in point of\nmatter;\u2014a distinction which only exists for the observer.\n(\u03b1) Practical Sense or Feeling(146).\n\u00a7 471. The autonomy of the practical mind at first is immediate and\ntherefore formal, i.e. it _finds_ itself as an _individuality_ determined\nin _its_ inward _nature_. It is thus \u201cpractical feeling,\u201d or instinct of\naction. In this phase, as it is at bottom a subjectivity simply identical\nwith reason, it has no doubt a rational content, but a content which as it\nstands is individual, and for that reason also natural, contingent and\nsubjective,\u2014a content which may be determined quite as much by mere\npersonalities of want and opinion, &c., and by the subjectivity which\nselfishly sets itself against the universal, as it may be virtually in\nconformity with reason.\nAn appeal is sometimes made to the sense (feeling) of right and morality,\nas well as of religion, which man is alleged to possess,\u2014to his benevolent\ndispositions,\u2014and even to his heart generally,\u2014i.e. to the subject so far\nas the various practical feelings are in it all combined. So far as this\nappeal implies (1) that these ideas are immanent in his own self, and (2)\nthat when feeling is opposed to the logical understanding, it, and not the\npartial abstractions of the latter, _may_ be the _totality_\u2014the appeal has\na legitimate meaning. But on the other hand feeling too _may_ be onesided,\nunessential and bad. The rational, which exists in the shape of\nrationality when it is apprehended by thought, is the same content as the\n_good_ practical feeling has, but presented in its universality and\nnecessity, in its objectivity and truth.\nThus it is on the one hand _silly_ to suppose that in the passage from\nfeeling to law and duty there is any loss of import and excellence; it is\nthis passage which lets feeling first reach its truth. It is equally silly\nto consider intellect as superfluous or even harmful to feeling, heart,\nand will; the truth and, what is the same thing, the actual rationality of\nthe heart and will can only be at home in the universality of intellect,\nand not in the singleness of feeling as feeling. If feelings are of the\nright sort, it is because of their quality or content,\u2014which is right only\nso far as it is intrinsically universal or has its source in the thinking\nmind. The difficulty for the logical intellect consists in throwing off\nthe separation it has arbitrarily imposed between the several faculties of\nfeeling and thinking mind, and coming to see that in the human being there\nis only _one_ reason, in feeling, volition, and thought. Another\ndifficulty connected with this is found in the fact that the Ideas which\nare the special property of the thinking mind, viz. God, law and morality,\ncan also be _felt_. But feeling is only the form of the immediate and\npeculiar individuality of the subject, in which these facts, like any\nother objective facts (which consciousness also sets over against itself),\nmay be placed.\nOn the other hand, it is _suspicious_ or even worse to cling to feeling\nand heart in place of the intelligent rationality of law, right and duty;\nbecause all that the former holds more than the latter is only the\nparticular subjectivity with its vanity and caprice. For the same reason\nit is out of place in a scientific treatment of the feelings to deal with\nanything beyond their form, and to discuss their content; for the latter,\nwhen thought, is precisely what constitutes, in their universality and\nnecessity, the rights and duties which are the true works of mental\nautonomy. So long as we study practical feelings and dispositions\nspecially, we have only to deal with the selfish, bad, and evil; it is\nthese alone which belong to the individuality which retains its opposition\nto the universal: their content is the reverse of rights and duties, and\nprecisely in that way do they\u2014but only in antithesis to the latter\u2014retain\na speciality of their own.\n\u00a7 472. The \u201cOught\u201d of practical feeling is the claim of its essential\nautonomy to control some existing mode of fact\u2014which is assumed to be\nworth nothing save as adapted to that claim. But as both, in their\nimmediacy, lack objective determination, this relation of the\n_requirement_ to existent fact is the utterly subjective and superficial\nfeeling of pleasant or unpleasant.\nDelight, joy, grief, &c., shame, repentance, contentment, &c., are partly\nonly modifications of the formal \u201cpractical feeling\u201d in _general_, but are\npartly different in the features that give the special tone and character\nmode to their \u201cOught.\u201d\nThe celebrated question as to the origin of evil in the world, so far at\nleast as evil is understood to mean what is disagreeable and painful\nmerely, arises on this stage of the formal practical feeling. Evil is\nnothing but the incompatibility between what is and what ought to be.\n\u201cOught\u201d is an ambiguous term,\u2014indeed infinitely so, considering that\ncasual aims may also come under the form of Ought. But where the objects\nsought are thus casual, evil only executes what is rightfully due to the\nvanity and nullity of their planning: for they themselves were radically\nevil. The finitude of life and mind is seen in their judgment: the\ncontrary which is separated from them they also have as a negative in\nthem, and thus they are the contradiction called evil. In the dead there\nis neither evil nor pain: for in inorganic nature the intelligible unity\n(concept) does not confront its existence and does not in the difference\nat the same time remain its permanent subject. Whereas in life, and still\nmore in mind, we have this immanent distinction present: hence arises the\nOught: and this negativity, subjectivity, ego, freedom are the principles\nof evil and pain. Jacob B\u00f6hme viewed egoity (selfhood) as pain and\ntorment, and as the fountain of nature and of spirit.\n(\u03b2) The Impulses and Choice(147).\n\u00a7 473. The practical ought is a \u201creal\u201d judgment. Will, which is\nessentially self-determination, finds in the conformity\u2014as immediate and\nmerely _found_ to hand\u2014of the existing mode to its requirement a negation,\nand something inappropriate to it. If the will is to satisfy itself, if\nthe implicit unity of the universality and the special mode is to be\nrealised, the conformity of its inner requirement and of the existent\nthing ought to be its act and institution. The will, as regards the form\nof its content, is at first still a natural will, directly identical with\nits specific mode:\u2014natural _impulse_ and _inclination_. Should, however,\nthe totality of the practical spirit throw itself into a single one of the\nmany restricted forms of impulse, each being always in conflict to\nanother, it is _passion_.\n\u00a7 474. Inclinations and passions embody the same constituent features as\nthe practical feeling. Thus, while on one hand they are based on the\nrational nature of the mind; they on the other, as part and parcel of the\nstill subjective and single will, are infected with contingency, and\nappear as particular to stand to the individual and to each other in an\nexternal relation and with a necessity which creates bondage.\nThe special note in _passion_ is its restriction to one special mode of\nvolition, in which the whole subjectivity of the individual is merged, be\nthe value of that mode what it may. In consequence of this formalism,\npassion is neither good nor bad; the title only states that a subject has\nthrown his whole soul,\u2014his interests of intellect, talent, character,\nenjoyment,\u2014on one aim and object. Nothing great has been and nothing great\ncan be accomplished without passion. It is only a dead, too often, indeed,\na hypocritical moralising which inveighs against the form of passion as\nsuch.\nBut with regard to the inclinations, the question is directly raised,\nWhich are good and bad?\u2014Up to what degree the good continue good;\u2014and (as\nthere are many, each with its private range) In what way have they, being\nall in one subject and hardly all, as experience shows, admitting of\ngratification, to suffer at least reciprocal restriction? And, first of\nall, as regards the numbers of these impulses and propensities, the case\nis much the same as with the psychical powers, whose aggregate is to form\nthe mind theoretical,\u2014an aggregate which is now increased by the host of\nimpulses. The nominal rationality of impulse and propensity lies merely in\ntheir general impulse not to be subjective merely, but to get realised,\novercoming the subjectivity by the subject\u2019s own agency. Their genuine\nrationality cannot reveal its secret to a method of outer reflection which\npre-supposes a number of _independent_ innate tendencies and immediate\ninstincts, and therefore is wanting in a single principle and final\npurpose for them. But the immanent \u201creflection\u201d of mind itself carries it\nbeyond their particularity and their natural immediacy, and gives their\ncontents a rationality and objectivity, in which they exist as necessary\nties of social relation, as rights and duties. It is this objectification\nwhich evinces their real value, their mutual connexions, and their truth.\nAnd thus it was a true perception when Plato (especially including as he\ndid the mind\u2019s whole nature under its right) showed that the full reality\nof justice could be exhibited only in the _objective_ phase of justice,\nviz. in the construction of the State as the ethical life.\nThe answer to the question, therefore, What are the good and rational\npropensities, and how they are to be co-ordinated with each other?\nresolves itself into an exposition of the laws and forms of common life\nproduced by the mind when developing itself as _objective_ mind\u2014a\ndevelopment in which the _content_ of autonomous action loses its\ncontingency and optionality. The discussion of the true intrinsic worth of\nthe impulses, inclinations, and passions is thus essentially the theory of\nlegal, moral, and social _duties_.\n\u00a7 475. The subject is the act of satisfying impulses, an act of (at least)\nformal rationality, as it translates them from the subjectivity of content\n(which so far is _purpose_) into objectivity, where the subject is made to\nclose with itself. If the content of the impulse is distinguished as the\nthing or business from this act of carrying it out, and we regard the\nthing which has been brought to pass as containing the element of\nsubjective individuality and its action, this is what is called the\n_interest_. Nothing therefore is brought about without interest.\nAn action is an aim of the subject, and it is his agency too which\nexecutes this aim: unless the subject were in this way in the most\ndisinterested action, i.e. unless he had an interest in it, there would be\nno action at all.\u2014The impulses and inclinations are sometimes depreciated\nby being contrasted with the baseless chimera of a happiness, the free\ngift of nature, where wants are supposed to find their satisfaction\nwithout the agent doing anything to produce a conformity between immediate\nexistence and his own inner requirements. They are sometimes contrasted,\non the whole to their disadvantage, with the morality of duty for duty\u2019s\nsake. But impulse and passion are the very life-blood of all action: they\nare needed if the agent is really to be in his aim and the execution\nthereof. The morality concerns the content of the aim, which as such is\nthe universal, an inactive thing, that finds its actualising in the agent;\nand finds it only when the aim is immanent in the agent, is his interest\nand\u2014should it claim to engross his whole efficient subjectivity\u2014his\npassion.\n\u00a7 476. The will, as thinking and implicitly free, distinguishes itself\nfrom the particularity of the impulses, and places itself as simple\nsubjectivity of thought above their diversified content. It is thus\n\u201creflecting\u201d will.\n\u00a7 477. Such a particularity of impulse has thus ceased to be a mere datum:\nthe reflective will now sees it as its own, because it closes with it and\nthus gives itself specific individuality and actuality. It is now on the\nstandpoint of _choosing_ between inclinations, and is option or _choice_.\n\u00a7 478. Will as choice claims to be free, reflected into itself as the\nnegativity of its merely immediate autonomy. However, as the content, in\nwhich its former universality concludes itself to actuality, is nothing\nbut the content of the impulses and appetites, it is actual only as a\nsubjective and contingent will. It realises itself in a particularity,\nwhich it regards at the same time as a nullity, and finds a satisfaction\nin what it has at the same time emerged from. As thus contradictory, it is\nthe process of distracting and suspending one desire or enjoyment by\nanother,\u2014and one satisfaction, which is just as much no satisfaction, by\nanother, without end. But the truth of the particular satisfactions is the\nuniversal, which under the name of _happiness_ the thinking will makes its\naim.\n(\u03b3) Happiness(148).\n\u00a7 479. In this idea, which reflection and comparison have educed, of a\nuniversal satisfaction, the impulses, so far as their particularity goes,\nare reduced to a mere negative; and it is held that in part they are to be\nsacrificed to each other for the behoof that aim, partly sacrificed to\nthat aim directly, either altogether or in part. Their mutual limitation,\non one hand, proceeds from a mixture of qualitative and quantitative\nconsiderations: on the other hand, as happiness has its sole _affirmative_\ncontents in the springs of action, it is on them that the decision turns,\nand it is the subjective feeling and good pleasure which must have the\ncasting vote as to where happiness is to be placed.\n\u00a7 480. Happiness is the mere abstract and merely imagined universality of\nthings desired,\u2014a universality which only ought to be. But the\nparticularity of the satisfaction which just as much _is_ as it is\nabolished, and the abstract singleness, the option which gives or does not\ngive itself (as it pleases) an aim in happiness, find their truth in the\nintrinsic _universality_ of the will, i.e. its very autonomy or freedom.\nIn this way choice is will only as pure subjectivity, which is pure and\nconcrete at once, by having for its contents and aim only that infinite\nmode of being\u2014freedom itself. In this truth of its autonomy, where concept\nand object are one, the will is an _actually free will_.\nFree Mind(149).\n\u00a7 481. Actual free will is the unity of theoretical and practical mind: a\nfree will, which realises its own freedom of will now that the formalism,\nfortuitousness, and contractedness of the practical content up to this\npoint have been superseded. By superseding the adjustments of means\ntherein contained, the will is the _immediate individuality_\nself-instituted,\u2014an individuality, however, also purified of all that\ninterferes with its universalism, i.e. with freedom itself. This\nuniversalism the will has as its object and aim, only so far as it thinks\nitself, knows this its concept, and is _will_ as free _intelligence_.\n\u00a7 482. The mind which knows itself as free and wills itself as this its\nobject, i.e. which has its true being for characteristic and aim, is in\nthe first instance the rational will in general, or _implicit_ Idea, and\nbecause implicit only the _notion_ of absolute mind. As _abstract_ Idea\nagain, it is existent only in the _immediate_ will\u2014it is the _existential_\nside of reason,\u2014the _single_ will as aware of this its universality\nconstituting its contents and aim, and of which it is only the formal\nactivity. If the will, therefore, in which the Idea thus appears is only\nfinite, that will is also the act of developing the Idea, and of investing\nits self-unfolding content with an existence which, as realising the idea,\nis _actuality_. It is thus \u201cObjective\u201d Mind.\nNo Idea is so generally recognised as indefinite, ambiguous, and open to\nthe greatest misconceptions (to which therefore it actually falls a\nvictim) as the idea of Liberty: none in common currency with so little\nappreciation of its meaning. Remembering that free mind is _actual_ mind,\nwe can see how misconceptions about it are of tremendous consequence in\npractice. When individuals and nations have once got in their heads the\nabstract concept of full-blown liberty, there is nothing like it in its\nuncontrollable strength, just because it is the very essence of mind, and\nthat as its very actuality. Whole continents, Africa and the East, have\nnever had this idea, and are without it still. The Greeks and Romans,\nPlato and Aristotle, even the Stoics, did not have it. On the contrary,\nthey saw that it is only by birth (as e.g. an Athenian or Spartan\ncitizen), or by strength of character, education, or philosophy (\u2014the sage\nis free even as a slave and in chains) that the human being is actually\nfree. It was through Christianity that this idea came into the world.\nAccording to Christianity, the individual _as such_ has an infinite value\nas the object and aim of divine love, destined as mind to live in absolute\nrelationship with God himself, and have God\u2019s mind dwelling in him: i.e.\nman is implicitly destined to supreme freedom. If, in religion as such,\nman is aware of this relationship to the absolute mind as his true being,\nhe has also, even when he steps into the sphere of secular existence, the\ndivine mind present with him, as the substance of the state of the family,\n&c. These institutions are due to the guidance of that spirit, and are\nconstituted after its measure; whilst by their existence the moral temper\ncomes to be indwelling in the individual, so that in this sphere of\nparticular existence, of present sensation and volition, he is _actually_\nfree.\nIf to be aware of the idea\u2014to be aware, i.e. that men are aware of freedom\nas their essence, aim, and object\u2014is matter of _speculation_, still this\nvery idea itself is the actuality of men\u2014not something which they _have_,\nas men, but which they _are_. Christianity in its adherents has realised\nan ever-present sense that they are not and cannot be slaves; if they are\nmade slaves, if the decision as regards their property rests with an\narbitrary will, not with laws or courts of justice, they would find the\nvery substance of their life outraged. This will to liberty is no longer\nan _impulse_ which demands its satisfaction, but the permanent\ncharacter\u2014the spiritual consciousness grown into a non-impulsive nature.\nBut this freedom, which the content and aim of freedom has, is itself only\na notion\u2014a principle of the mind and heart, intended to develope into an\nobjective phase, into legal, moral, religious, and not less into\nscientific actuality.\nSECTION II. MIND OBJECTIVE.\n\u00a7 483. The objective Mind is the absolute Idea, but only existing _in\nposse_: and as it is thus on the territory of finitude, its actual\nrationality retains the aspect of external apparency. The free will finds\nitself immediately confronted by differences which arise from the\ncircumstance that freedom is its _inward_ function and aim, and is in\nrelation to an external and already subsisting objectivity, which splits\nup into different heads: viz. anthropological data (i.e. private and\npersonal needs), external things of nature which exist for consciousness,\nand the ties of relation between individual wills which are conscious of\ntheir own diversity and particularity. These aspects constitute the\nexternal material for the embodiment of the will.\n\u00a7 484. But the purposive action of this will is to realise its concept,\nLiberty, in these externally-objective aspects, making the latter a world\nmoulded by the former, which in it is thus at home with itself, locked\ntogether with it: the concept accordingly perfected to the Idea. Liberty,\nshaped into the actuality of a world, receives the _form of Necessity_ the\ndeeper substantial nexus of which is the system or organisation of the\nprinciples of liberty, whilst its phenomenal nexus is power or authority,\nand the sentiment of obedience awakened in consciousness.\n\u00a7 485. This unity of the rational will with the single will (this being\nthe peculiar and immediate medium in which the former is actualised)\nconstitutes the simple actuality of liberty. As it (and its content)\nbelongs to thought, and is the virtual _universal_, the content has its\nright and true character only in the form of universality. When invested\nwith this character for the intelligent consciousness, or instituted as an\nauthoritative power, it is a _Law_(150). When, on the other hand, the\ncontent is freed from the mixedness and fortuitousness, attaching to it in\nthe practical feeling and in impulse, and is set and grafted in the\nindividual will, not in the form of impulse, but in its universality, so\nas to become its habit, temper and character, it exists as manner and\ncustom, or _Usage_(151).\n\u00a7 486. This \u201creality,\u201d in general, where free will has _existence_, is the\n_Law_ (Right),\u2014the term being taken in a comprehensive sense not merely as\nthe limited juristic law, but as the actual body of all the conditions of\nfreedom. These conditions, in relation to the _subjective_ will, where\nthey, being universal, ought to have and can only have their existence,\nare its _Duties_; whereas as its temper and habit they are _Manners_. What\nis a right is also a duty, and what is a duty, is also a right. For a mode\nof existence is a right, only as a consequence of the free substantial\nwill: and the same content of fact, when referred to the will\ndistinguished as subjective and individual, is a duty. It is the same\ncontent which the subjective consciousness recognises as a duty, and\nbrings into existence in these several wills. The finitude of the\nobjective will thus creates the semblance of a distinction between rights\nand duties.\nIn the phenomenal range right and duty are _correlata_, at least in the\nsense that to a right on my part corresponds a duty in some one else. But,\nin the light of the concept, my right to a thing is not merely possession,\nbut as possession by a _person_ it is _property_, or legal possession, and\nit is a _duty_ to possess things as _property_, i.e. to be as a person.\nTranslated into the phenomenal relationship, viz. relation to another\nperson\u2014this grows into the duty of some one _else_ to respect _my_ right.\nIn the morality of the conscience, duty in general is in me\u2014a free\nsubject\u2014at the same time a right of my subjective will or disposition. But\nin this individualist moral sphere, there arises the division between what\nis only inward purpose (disposition or intention), which only has its\nbeing in me and is merely subjective duty, and the actualisation of that\npurpose: and with this division a contingency and imperfection which makes\nthe inadequacy of mere individualistic morality. In social ethics these\ntwo parts have reached their truth, their absolute unity; although even\nright and duty return to one another and combine by means of certain\nadjustments and under the guise of necessity. The rights of the father of\nthe family over its members are equally duties towards them; just as the\nchildren\u2019s duty of obedience is their right to be educated to the liberty\nof manhood. The penal judicature of a government, its rights of\nadministration, &c., are no less its duties to punish, to administer, &c.;\nas the services of the members of the State in dues, military services,\n&c., are duties and yet their right to the protection of their private\nproperty and of the general substantial life in which they have their\nroot. All the aims of society and the State are the private aim of the\nindividuals. But the set of adjustments, by which their duties come back\nto them as the exercise and enjoyment of right, produces an appearance of\ndiversity: and this diversity is increased by the variety of shapes which\nvalue assumes in the course of exchange, though it remains intrinsically\nthe same. Still it holds fundamentally good that he who has no rights has\nno duties and _vice versa_.\nDistribution.\n\u00a7 487. The free will is\nA. itself at first immediate, and hence as a single being\u2014the _person_:\nthe existence which the person gives to its liberty is _property_. The\n_Right as_ right (law) is _formal, abstract right_.\nB. When the will is reflected into self, so as to have its existence\ninside it, and to be thus at the same time characterised as a\n_particular_, it is the right of the _subjective_ will, _morality_ of the\nindividual conscience.\nC. When the free will is the substantial will, made actual in the subject\nand conformable to its concept and rendered a totality of necessity,\u2014it is\nthe ethics of actual life in family, civil society, and state.\nSub-Section A. Law.(152)\n(a) Property.\n\u00a7 488. Mind, in the immediacy of its self-secured liberty, is an\nindividual, but one that knows its individuality as an absolutely free\nwill: it is a _person_, in whom the inward sense of this freedom, as in\nitself still abstract and empty, has its particularity and fulfilment not\nyet on its own part, but on an external _thing_. This thing, as something\ndevoid of will, has no rights against the subjectivity of intelligence and\nvolition, and is by that subjectivity made adjectival to it, the external\nsphere of its liberty;\u2014_possession_.\n\u00a7 489. By the judgment of possession, at first in the outward\nappropriation, the thing acquires the predicate of \u201cmine.\u201d But this\npredicate, on its own account merely \u201cpractical,\u201d has here the\nsignification that I import my personal will into the thing. As so\ncharacterised, possession is _property_, which as possession is a _means_,\nbut as existence of the personality is an _end_.\n\u00a7 490. In his property the person is brought into union with itself. But\nthe thing is an abstractly external thing, and the I in it is abstractly\nexternal. The concrete return of me into me in the externality is that I,\nthe infinite self-relation, am as a person the repulsion of me from\nmyself, and have the existence of my personality in the _being of other\npersons_, in my relation to them and in my recognition by them, which is\nthus mutual.\n\u00a7 491. The thing is the _mean_ by which the extremes meet in one. These\nextremes are the persons who, in the knowledge of their identity as free,\nare simultaneously mutually independent. For them my will has its\n_definite recognisable existence_ in the thing by the immediate bodily act\nof taking possession, or by the formation of the thing or, it may be, by\nmere designation of it.\n\u00a7 492. The casual aspect of property is that I place my will in _this_\nthing: so far my will is _arbitrary_, I can just as well put it in it as\nnot,\u2014just as well withdraw it as not. But so far as my will lies in a\nthing, it is only I who can withdraw it: it is only with my will that the\nthing can pass to another, whose property it similarly becomes only with\nhis will:\u2014_Contract_.\n(b) Contract.\n\u00a7 493. The two wills and their agreement in the contract are as an\n_internal_ state of mind different from its realisation in the\n_performance_. The comparatively \u201cideal\u201d utterance (of contract) in the\n_stipulation_ contains the actual surrender of a property by the one, its\nchanging hands, and its acceptance by the other will. The contract is thus\nthoroughly binding: it does not need the performance of the one or the\nother to become so\u2014otherwise we should have an infinite regress or\ninfinite division of thing, labour, and time. The utterance in the\nstipulation is complete and exhaustive. The inwardness of the will which\nsurrenders and the will which accepts the property is in the realm of\nideation, and in that realm the word is deed and thing (\u00a7 462)\u2014the full\nand complete deed, since here the conscientiousness of the will does not\ncome under consideration (as to whether the thing is meant in earnest or\nis a deception), and the will refers only to the external thing.\n\u00a7 494. Thus in the stipulation we have the _substantial_ being of the\ncontract standing out in distinction from its real utterance in the\nperformance, which is brought down to a mere sequel. In this way there is\nput into the thing or performance a distinction between its immediate\nspecific _quality_ and its substantial being or _value_, meaning by value\nthe quantitative terms into which that qualitative feature has been\ntranslated. One piece of property is thus made comparable with another,\nand may be made equivalent to a thing which is (in quality) wholly\nheterogeneous. It is thus treated in general as an abstract, universal\nthing or commodity.\n\u00a7 495. The contract, as an agreement which has a voluntary origin and\ndeals with a casual commodity, involves at the same time the giving to\nthis \u201caccidental\u201d will a positive fixity. This will may just as well not\nbe conformable to law (right), and, in that case, produces a _wrong_: by\nwhich however the absolute law (right) is not superseded, but only a\nrelationship originated of right to wrong.\n(c) Right versus Wrong.\n\u00a7 496. Law (right) considered as the realisation of liberty in externals,\nbreaks up into a multiplicity of relations to this external sphere and to\nother persons (\u00a7\u00a7 491, 493 seqq.). In this way there are (1) several\ntitles or grounds at law, of which (seeing that property both on the\npersonal and the real side is exclusively individual) only one is the\nright, but which, because they face each other, each and all are invested\nwith a _show_ of right, against which the former is defined as the\nintrinsically right.\n\u00a7 497. Now so long as (compared against this show) the one intrinsically\nright, still presumed identical with the several titles, is affirmed,\nwilled, and recognised, the only diversity lies in this, that the special\nthing is subsumed under the one law or right by the _particular_ will of\n_these_ several persons. This is na\u00efve, non-malicious wrong. Such wrong in\nthe several claimants is a simple _negative judgment_, expressing the\n_civil suit_. To settle it there is required a third judgment, which, as\nthe judgment of the intrinsically right, is disinterested, and a power of\ngiving the one right existence as against that semblance.\n\u00a7 498. But (2) if the semblance of right is willed as such _against_ right\nintrinsical by the particular will, which thus becomes _wicked_, then the\nexternal _recognition_ of right is separated from the right\u2019s true value;\nand while the former only is respected, the latter is violated. This gives\nthe wrong of _fraud_\u2014the infinite judgment as identical (\u00a7 173),\u2014where the\nnominal relation is retained, but the sterling value is let slip.\n\u00a7 499. (3) Finally, the particular will sets itself in opposition to the\nintrinsic right by negating that right itself as well as its recognition\nor semblance. [Here there is a negatively infinite judgment (\u00a7 173) in\nwhich there is denied the class as a whole, and not merely the particular\nmode\u2014in this case the apparent recognition.] Thus the will is violently\nwicked, and commits a _crime_.\n\u00a7 500. As an outrage on right, such an action is essentially and actually\nnull. In it the agent, as a volitional and intelligent being, sets up a\nlaw\u2014a law however which is nominal and recognised by him only\u2014a universal\nwhich holds good _for him_, and under which he has at the same time\nsubsumed himself by his action. To display the nullity of such an act, to\ncarry out simultaneously this nominal law and the intrinsic right, in the\nfirst instance by means of a subjective individual will, is the work of\n_Revenge_. But, revenge, starting from the interest of an immediate\nparticular personality, is at the same time only a new outrage; and so on\nwithout end. This progression, like the last, abolishes itself in a third\njudgment, which is disinterested\u2014_punishment_.\n\u00a7 501. The instrumentality by which authority is given to intrinsic right\nis (\u03b1) that a particular will, that of the judge, being conformable to the\nright, has an interest to turn against the crime (\u2014which in the first\ninstance, in revenge, is a matter of chance), and (\u03b2) that an executive\npower (also in the first instance casual) negates the negation of right\nthat was created by the criminal. This negation of right has its existence\nin the will of the criminal; and consequently revenge or punishment\ndirects itself against the person or property of the criminal and\nexercises _coercion_ upon him. It is in this legal sphere that coercion in\ngeneral has possible scope,\u2014compulsion against the thing, in seizing and\nmaintaining it against another\u2019s seizure: for in this sphere the will has\nits existence immediately in externals as such, or in corporeity, and can\nbe seized only in this quarter. But more than _possible_ compulsion is\nnot, so long as I can withdraw myself as free from every mode of\nexistence, even from the range of all existence, i.e. from life. It is\nlegal only as abolishing a first and original compulsion.\n\u00a7 502. A distinction has thus emerged between the law (right) and the\nsubjective will. The \u201creality\u201d of right, which the personal will in the\nfirst instance gives itself in immediate wise, is seen to be due to the\ninstrumentality of the subjective will,\u2014whose influence as on one hand it\ngives existence to the essential right, so may on the other cut itself off\nfrom and oppose itself to it. Conversely, the claim of the subjective will\nto be in this abstraction a power over the law of right is null and empty\nof itself: it gets truth and reality essentially only so far as that will\nin itself realises the reasonable will. As such it is _morality_(153)\nproper.\nThe phrase \u201cLaw of Nature,\u201d or Natural Right(154), in use for the\nphilosophy of law involves the ambiguity that it may mean either right as\nsomething existing ready-formed in nature, or right as governed by the\nnature of things, i.e. by the notion. The former used to be the common\nmeaning, accompanied with the fiction of a _state of nature_, in which the\nlaw of nature should hold sway; whereas the social and political state\nrather required and implied a restriction of liberty and a sacrifice of\nnatural rights. The real fact is that the whole law and its every article\nare based on free personality alone,\u2014on self-determination or autonomy,\nwhich is the very contrary of determination by nature. The law of\nnature\u2014strictly so called\u2014is for that reason the predominance of the\nstrong and the reign of force, and a state of nature a state of violence\nand wrong, of which nothing truer can be said than that one ought to\ndepart from it. The social state, on the other hand, is the condition in\nwhich alone right has its actuality: what is to be restricted and\nsacrificed is just the wilfulness and violence of the state of nature.\nSub-Section B. The Morality Of Conscience(155).\n\u00a7 503. The free individual, who, in mere law, counts only as a _person_,\nis now characterised as a _subject_, a will reflected into itself so that,\nbe its affection what it may, it is distinguished (as existing in it) as\n_its own_ from the existence of freedom in an external thing. Because the\naffection of the will is thus inwardised, the will is at the same time\nmade a particular, and there arise further particularisations of it and\nrelations of these to one another. This affection is partly the essential\nand implicit will, the reason of the will, the essential basis of law and\nmoral life: partly it is the existent volition, which is before us and\nthrows itself into actual deeds, and thus comes into relationship with the\nformer. The subjective will is _morally_ free, so far as these features\nare its inward institution, its own, and willed by it. Its utterance in\ndeed with this freedom is an _action_, in the externality of which it only\nadmits as its own, and allows to be imputed to it, so much as it has\nconsciously willed.\nThis subjective or \u201cmoral\u201d freedom is what a European especially calls\nfreedom. In virtue of the right thereto a man must possess a personal\nknowledge of the distinction between good and evil in general: ethical and\nreligious principles shall not merely lay their claim on him as external\nlaws and precepts of authority to be obeyed, but have their assent,\nrecognition, or even justification in his heart, sentiment, conscience,\nintelligence, &c. The subjectivity of the will in itself is its supreme\naim and absolutely essential to it.\nThe \u201cmoral\u201d must be taken in the wider sense in which it does not signify\nthe morally good merely. In French _le moral_ is opposed to _le physique_,\nand means the mental or intellectual in general. But here the moral\nsignifies volitional mode, so far as it is in the interior of the will in\ngeneral; it thus includes purpose and intention,\u2014and also moral\nwickedness.\na. Purpose(156).\n\u00a7 504. So far as the action comes into immediate touch with _existence_,\n_my part_ in it is to this extent formal, that external existence is also\n_independent_ of the agent. This externality can pervert his action and\nbring to light something else than lay in it. Now, though any alteration\nas such, which is set on foot by the subject\u2019s action, is its _deed_(157),\nstill the subject does not for that reason recognise it as its\n_action_(158), but only admits as its own that existence in the deed which\nlay in its knowledge and will, which was its _purpose_. Only for that does\nit hold itself _responsible_.\nb. Intention and Welfare(159).\n\u00a7 505. As regards its empirically concrete _content_ (1) the action has a\nvariety of particular aspects and connexions. In point of _form_, the\nagent must have known and willed the action in its essential feature,\nembracing these individual points. This is the right of _intention_. While\n_purpose_ affects only the immediate fact of existence, _intention_\nregards the underlying essence and aim thereof. (2) The agent has no less\nthe right to see that the particularity of content in the action, in point\nof its matter, is not something external to him, but is a particularity of\nhis own,\u2014that it contains his needs, interests, and aims. These aims, when\nsimilarly comprehended in a single aim, as in happiness (\u00a7 479),\nconstitute his _well-being_. This is the right to well-being. Happiness\n(good fortune) is distinguished from well-being only in this, that\nhappiness implies no more than some sort of immediate existence, whereas\nwell-being regards it as also justified as regards morality.\n\u00a7 506. But the essentiality of the intention is in the first instance the\nabstract form of generality. Reflection can put in this form this and that\nparticular aspect in the empirically-concrete action, thus making it\nessential to the intention or restricting the intention to it. In this way\nthe supposed essentiality of the intention and the real essentiality of\nthe action may be brought into the greatest contradiction\u2014e.g. a good\nintention in case of a crime. Similarly well-being is abstract and may be\nset on this or that: as appertaining to this single agent, it is always\nsomething particular.\nc. Goodness and Wickedness(160).\n\u00a7 507. The truth of these particularities and the concrete unity of their\nformalism is the content of the universal, essential and actual, will,\u2014the\nlaw and underlying essence of every phase of volition, the essential and\nactual good. It is thus the absolute final aim of the world, and _duty_\nfor the agent who _ought_ to have _insight_ into the _good_, make it his\n_intention_ and bring it about by his activity.\n\u00a7 508. But though the good is the universal of will\u2014a universal determined\nin itself,\u2014and thus including in it particularity,\u2014still so far as this\nparticularity is in the first instance still abstract, there is no\nprinciple at hand to determine it. Such determination therefore starts up\nalso outside that universal; and as heteronomy or determinance of a will\nwhich is free and has rights of its own, there awakes here the deepest\ncontradiction. (\u03b1) In consequence of the indeterminate determinism of the\ngood, there are always _several sorts_ of good and _many kinds of duties_,\nthe variety of which is a dialectic of one against another and brings them\ninto _collision_. At the same time because good is one, they _ought_ to\nstand in harmony; and yet each of them, though it is a particular duty, is\nas good and as duty absolute. It falls upon the agent to be the dialectic\nwhich, superseding this absolute claim of each, concludes such a\ncombination of them as excludes the rest.\n\u00a7 509. (\u03b2) To the agent, who in his existent sphere of liberty is\nessentially as a _particular_, his _interest and welfare_ must, on account\nof that existent sphere of liberty, be essentially an aim and therefore a\nduty. But at the same time in aiming at the good, which is the\nnot-particular but only universal of the will, the particular interest\n_ought not_ to be a constituent motive. On account of this independency of\nthe two principles of action, it is likewise an accident whether they\nharmonise. And yet they _ought_ to harmonise, because the agent, as\nindividual and universal, is always fundamentally one identity.\n(\u03b3) But the agent is not only a mere particular in his existence; it is\nalso a form of his existence to be an abstract self-certainty, an abstract\nreflection of freedom into himself. He is thus distinct from the reason in\nthe will, and capable of making the universal itself a particular and in\nthat way a semblance. The good is thus reduced to the level of a mere \u201cmay\nhappen\u201d for the agent, who can therefore resolve itself to somewhat\nopposite to the good, can be wicked.\n\u00a7 510. (\u03b4) The external objectivity, following the distinction which has\narisen in the subjective will (\u00a7 503), constitutes a peculiar world of its\nown,\u2014another extreme which stands in no rapport with the internal\nwill-determination. It is thus a matter of chance, whether it harmonises\nwith the subjective aims, whether the good is realised, and the wicked, an\naim essentially and actually null, nullified in it: it is no less matter\nof chance whether the agent finds in it his well-being, and more precisely\nwhether in the world the good agent is happy and the wicked unhappy. But\nat the same time the world _ought_ to allow the good action, the essential\nthing, to be carried out in it; it _ought_ to grant the good agent the\nsatisfaction of his particular interest, and refuse it to the wicked; just\nas it _ought_ also to make the wicked itself null and void.\n\u00a7 511. The all-round contradiction, expressed by this repeated _ought_,\nwith its absoluteness which yet at the same time is _not_\u2014contains the\nmost abstract \u2019analysis\u2019 of the mind in itself, its deepest descent into\nitself. The only relation the self-contradictory principles have to one\nanother is in the abstract certainty of self; and for this infinitude of\nsubjectivity the universal will, good, right, and duty, no more exist than\nnot. The subjectivity alone is aware of itself as choosing and deciding.\nThis pure self-certitude, rising to its pitch, appears in the two directly\ninter-changing forms\u2014of _Conscience_ and _Wickedness_. The former is the\nwill of goodness; but a goodness which to this pure subjectivity is the\n_non-objective_, non-universal, the unutterable; and over which the agent\nis conscious that _he_ in his _individuality_ has the decision. Wickedness\nis the same awareness that the single self possesses the decision, so far\nas the single self does not merely remain in this abstraction, but takes\nup the content of a subjective interest contrary to the good.\n\u00a7 512. This supreme pitch of the \u201c_phenomenon_\u201d of will,\u2014sublimating\nitself to this absolute vanity\u2014to a goodness, which has no objectivity,\nbut is only sure of itself, and a self-assurance which involves the\nnullification of the universal\u2014collapses by its own force. Wickedness, as\nthe most intimate reflection of subjectivity itself, in opposition to the\nobjective and universal, (which it treats as mere sham,) is the same as\nthe good sentiment of abstract goodness, which reserves to the\nsubjectivity the determination thereof:\u2014the utterly abstract semblance,\nthe bare perversion and annihilation of itself. The result, the truth of\nthis semblance, is, on its negative side, the absolute nullity of this\nvolition which would fain hold its own against the good, and of the good,\nwhich would only be abstract. On the affirmative side, in the notion, this\nsemblance thus collapsing is the same simple universality of the will,\nwhich is the good. The subjectivity, in this its _identity_ with the good,\nis only the infinite form, which actualises and developes it. In this way\nthe standpoint of bare reciprocity between two independent sides,\u2014the\nstandpoint of the _ought_, is abandoned, and we have passed into the field\nof ethical life.\nSub-Section C. The Moral Life, Or Social Ethics(161).\n\u00a7 513. The moral life is the perfection of spirit objective\u2014the truth of\nthe subjective and objective spirit itself. The failure of the latter\nconsists\u2014partly in having its freedom _immediately_ in reality, in\nsomething external therefore, in a thing,\u2014partly in the abstract\nuniversality of its goodness. The failure of spirit subjective similarly\nconsists in this, that it is, as against the universal, abstractly\nself-determinant in its inward individuality. When these two imperfections\nare suppressed, subjective _freedom_ exists as the covertly and overtly\n_universal_ rational will, which is sensible of itself and actively\ndisposed in the consciousness of the individual subject, whilst its\npractical operation and immediate universal _actuality_ at the same time\nexist as moral usage, manner and custom,\u2014where self-conscious _liberty_\nhas become _nature_.\n\u00a7 514. The consciously free substance, in which the absolute \u201cought\u201d is no\nless an \u201cis,\u201d has actuality as the spirit of a nation. The abstract\ndisruption of this spirit singles it out into _persons_, whose\nindependence it however controls and entirely dominates from within. But\nthe person, as an intelligent being, feels that underlying essence to be\nhis own very being\u2014ceases when so minded to be a mere accident of it\u2014looks\nupon it as his absolute final aim. In its actuality he sees not less an\nachieved present, than somewhat he brings it about by his action,\u2014yet\nsomewhat which without all question _is_. Thus, without any selective\nreflection, the person performs its duty as _his own_ and as something\nwhich _is_; and in this necessity _he_ has himself and his actual freedom.\n\u00a7 515. Because the substance is the absolute unity of individuality and\nuniversality of freedom, it follows that the actuality and action of each\nindividual to keep and to take care of his own being, while it is on one\nhand conditioned by the pre-supposed total in whose complex alone he\nexists, is on the other a transition into a universal product.\u2014The social\ndisposition of the individuals is their sense of the substance, and of the\nidentity of all their interests with the total; and that the other\nindividuals mutually know each other and are actual only in this identity,\nis confidence (trust)\u2014the genuine ethical temper.\n\u00a7 516. The relations between individuals in the several situations to\nwhich the substance is particularised form their _ethical duties_. The\nethical personality, i.e. the subjectivity which is permeated by the\nsubstantial life, is _virtue_. In relation to the bare facts of external\nbeing, to _destiny_, virtue does not treat them as a mere negation, and is\nthus a quiet repose in itself: in relation to substantial objectivity, to\nthe total of ethical actuality, it exists as confidence, as deliberate\nwork for the community, and the capacity of sacrificing self thereto;\nwhilst in relation to the incidental relations of social circumstance, it\nis in the first instance justice and then benevolence. In the latter\nsphere, and in its attitude to its own visible being and corporeity, the\nindividuality expresses its special character, temperament, &c. as\npersonal _virtues_.\n\u00a7 517. The ethical substance is\nAA. as \u201cimmediate\u201d or _natural_ mind,\u2014the _Family_.\nBB. The \u201crelative\u201d totality of the \u201crelative\u201d relations of the individuals\nas independent persons to one another in a formal universality\u2014_Civil\nSociety_.\nCC. The self-conscious substance, as the mind developed to an organic\nactuality\u2014the _Political Constitution_.\nAA. The Family.\n\u00a7 518. The ethical spirit, in its _immediacy_, contains the _natural_\nfactor that the individual has its substantial existence in its natural\nuniversal, i.e. in its kind. This is the sexual tie, elevated however to a\nspiritual significance,\u2014the unanimity of love and the temper of trust. In\nthe shape of the family, mind appears as feeling.\n\u00a7 519. (1) The physical difference of sex thus appears at the same time as\na difference of intellectual and moral type. With their exclusive\nindividualities these personalities combine to form a _single person_: the\nsubjective union of hearts, becoming a \u201csubstantial\u201d unity, makes this\nunion an ethical tie\u2014_Marriage_. The \u2019substantial\u2019 union of hearts makes\nmarriage an indivisible personal bond\u2014monogamic marriage: the bodily\nconjunction is a sequel to the moral attachment. A further sequel is\ncommunity of personal and private interests.\n\u00a7 520. (2) By the community in which the various members constituting the\nfamily stand in reference to property, that property of the one person\n(representing the family) acquires an ethical interest, as do also its\nindustry, labour, and care for the future.\n\u00a7 521. The ethical principle which is conjoined with the natural\ngeneration of the children, and which was assumed to have primary\nimportance in first forming the marriage union, is actually realised in\nthe second or spiritual birth of the children,\u2014in educating them to\nindependent personality.\n\u00a7 522. (3) The children, thus invested with independence, leave the\nconcrete life and action of the family to which they primarily belong,\nacquire an existence of their own, destined however to found anew such an\nactual family. Marriage is of course broken up by the _natural_ element\ncontained in it, the death of husband and wife: but even their union of\nhearts, as it is a mere \u201csubstantiality\u201d of feeling, contains the germ of\nliability to chance and decay. In virtue of such fortuitousness, the\nmembers of the family take up to each other the status of persons; and it\nis thus that the family finds introduced into it for the first time the\nelement, originally foreign to it, of _legal_ regulation.\nBB. Civil Society(162).\n\u00a7 523. As the substance, being an intelligent substance, particularises\nitself abstractly into many persons (the family is only a single person),\ninto families or individuals, who exist independent and free, as private\npersons, it loses its ethical character: for these persons as such have in\ntheir consciousness and as their aim not the absolute unity, but their own\npetty selves and particular interests. Thus arises the system of\n_atomistic_: by which the substance is reduced to a general system of\nadjustments to connect self-subsisting extremes and their particular\ninterests. The developed totality of this connective system is the state\nas civil society, or _state external_.\na. The System of Wants(163).\n\u00a7 524. (\u03b1) The particularity of the persons includes in the first instance\ntheir wants. The possibility of satisfying these wants is here laid on the\nsocial fabric, the general stock from which all derive their satisfaction.\nIn the condition of things in which this method of satisfaction by\nindirect adjustment is realised, immediate seizure (\u00a7 488) of external\nobjects as means thereto exists barely or not at all: the objects are\nalready property. To acquire them is only possible by the intervention, on\none hand, of the possessors\u2019 will, which as particular has in view the\nsatisfaction of their variously defined interests; while on the other hand\nit is conditioned by the ever continued production of fresh means of\nexchange by the exchangers\u2019 _own labour_. This instrument, by which the\nlabour of all facilitates satisfaction of wants, constitutes the general\nstock.\n\u00a7 525. (\u03b2) The glimmer of universal principle in this particularity of\nwants is found in the way intellect creates differences in them, and thus\ncauses an indefinite multiplication both of wants and of means for their\ndifferent phases. Both are thus rendered more and more abstract. This\n\u201cmorcellement\u201d of their content by abstraction gives rise to the _division\nof labour_. The habit of this abstraction in enjoyment, information,\nfeeling and demeanour, constitutes training in this sphere, or nominal\nculture in general.\n\u00a7 526. The labour which thus becomes more abstract tends on one hand by\nits uniformity to make labour easier and to increase production,\u2014on\nanother to limit each person to a single kind of technical skill, and thus\nproduce more unconditional dependence on the social system. The skill\nitself becomes in this way mechanical, and gets the capability of letting\nthe machine take the place of human labour.\n\u00a7 527. (\u03b3) But the concrete division of the general stock\u2014which is also a\ngeneral business (of the whole society)\u2014into particular masses determined\nby the factors of the notion,\u2014masses each of which possesses its own basis\nof subsistence, and a corresponding mode of labour, of needs, and of means\nfor satisfying them, besides of aims and interests, as well as of mental\nculture and habit\u2014constitutes the difference of Estates (orders or ranks).\nIndividuals apportion themselves to these according to natural talent,\nskill, option and accident. As belonging to such a definite and stable\nsphere, they have their actual existence, which as existence is\nessentially a particular; and in it they have their social morality, which\nis _honesty_, their recognition and their _honour_.\nWhere civil society, and with it the State, exists, there arise the\nseveral estates in their difference: for the universal substance, as\nvital, _exists_ only so far as it organically _particularises_ itself. The\nhistory of constitutions is the history of the growth of these estates, of\nthe legal relationships of individuals to them, and of these estates to\none another and to their centre.\n\u00a7 528. To the \u201csubstantial,\u201d natural estate the fruitful soil and ground\nsupply a natural and stable capital; its action gets direction and content\nthrough natural features, and its moral life is founded on faith and\ntrust. The second, the \u201creflected\u201d estate has as its allotment the social\ncapital, the medium created by the action of middlemen, of mere agents,\nand an ensemble of contingencies, where the individual has to depend on\nhis subjective skill, talent, intelligence and industry. The third,\n\u201cthinking\u201d estate has for its business the general interests; like the\nsecond it has a subsistence procured by means of its own skill, and like\nthe first a certain subsistence, certain however because guaranteed\nthrough the whole society.\nb. Administration of Justice(164).\n\u00a7 529. When matured through the operation of natural need and free option\ninto a system of universal relationships and a regular course of external\nnecessity, the principle of casual particularity gets that stable\narticulation which liberty requires in the shape of _formal right_. (1)\nThe actualisation which right gets in this sphere of mere practical\nintelligence is that it be brought to consciousness as the stable\nuniversal, that it be known and stated in its specificality with the voice\nof authority\u2014the _Law_(165).\nThe _positive_ element in laws concerns only their form of _publicity_ and\n_authority_\u2014which makes it possible for them to be known by all in a\ncustomary and external way. Their content _per se_ may be reasonable\u2014or it\nmay be unreasonable and so wrong. But when right, in the course of\ndefinite manifestation, is developed in detail, and its content analyses\nitself to gain definiteness, this analysis, because of the finitude of its\nmaterials, falls into the falsely infinite progress: the _final_\ndefiniteness, which is absolutely essential and causes a break in this\nprogress of unreality, can in this sphere of finitude be attained only in\na way that savours of contingency and arbitrariness. Thus whether three\nyears, ten thalers, or only 2-1/2, 2-3/4, 2-4/5 years, and so on _ad\ninfinitum_, be the right and just thing, can by no means be decided on\nintelligible principles,\u2014and yet it should be decided. Hence, though of\ncourse only at the final points of deciding, on the side of external\nexistence, the \u201cpositive\u201d principle naturally enters law as contingency\nand arbitrariness. This happens and has from of old happened in all\nlegislations: the only thing wanted is clearly to be aware of it, and not\nbe misled by the talk and the pretence as if the ideal of law were, or\ncould be, to be, at _every_ point, determined through reason or legal\nintelligence, on purely reasonable and intelligent grounds. It is a futile\nperfectionism to have such expectations and to make such requirements in\nthe sphere of the finite.\nThere are some who look upon laws as an evil and a profanity, and who\nregard governing and being governed from natural love, hereditary,\ndivinity or nobility, by faith and trust, as the genuine order of life,\nwhile the reign of law is held an order of corruption and injustice. These\npeople forget that the stars\u2014and the cattle too\u2014are governed and well\ngoverned too by laws;\u2014laws however which are only internally in these\nobjects, not _for them_, not as laws _set to_ them:\u2014whereas it is man\u2019s\nprivilege to _know_ his law. They forget therefore that he can truly obey\nonly such known law,\u2014even as his law can only be a just law, as it is a\n_known_ law;\u2014though in other respects it must be in its essential content\ncontingency and caprice, or at least be mixed and polluted with such\nelements.\nThe same empty requirement of perfection is employed for an opposite\nthesis\u2014viz. to support the opinion that a code is impossible or\nimpracticable. In this case there comes in the additional absurdity of\nputting essential and universal provisions in one class with the\nparticular detail. The finite material is definable on and on to the false\ninfinite: but this advance is not, as in the mental images of space, a\ngeneration of new spatial characteristics of the same quality as those\npreceding them, but an advance into greater and ever greater speciality by\nthe acumen of the analytic intellect, which discovers new distinctions,\nwhich again make new decisions necessary. To provisions of this sort one\nmay give the name of _new_ decisions or _new_ laws; but in proportion to\nthe gradual advance in specialisation the interest and value of these\nprovisions declines. They fall within the already subsisting\n\u201csubstantial,\u201d general laws, like improvements on a floor or a door,\nwithin the house\u2014which though something _new_, are not a new _house_. But\nthere is a contrary case. If the legislation of a rude age began with\nsingle provisos, which go on by their very nature always increasing their\nnumber, there arises, with the advance in multitude, the need of a simpler\ncode,\u2014the need i.e. of embracing that lot of singulars in their general\nfeatures. To find and be able to express these principles well beseems an\nintelligent and civilised nation. Such a gathering up of single rules into\ngeneral forms, first really deserving the name of laws, has lately been\nbegun in some directions by the English Minister Peel, who has by so doing\ngained the gratitude, even the admiration, of his countrymen.\n\u00a7 530. (2) The positive form of Laws\u2014to be _promulgated and made known_ as\nlaws\u2014is a condition of the _external obligation_ to obey them; inasmuch\nas, being laws of strict right, they touch only the abstract will,\u2014itself\nat bottom external\u2014not the moral or ethical will. The subjectivity to\nwhich the will has in this direction a right is here only publicity. This\nsubjective existence is as existence of the essential and developed truth\nin this sphere of Right at the same time an externally objective\nexistence, as universal authority and necessity.\nThe legality of property and of private transactions concerned\ntherewith\u2014in consideration of the principle that all law must be\npromulgated, recognised, and thus become authoritative\u2014gets its universal\nguarantee through _formalities_.\n\u00a7 531. (3) Legal forms get the necessity, to which objective existence\ndetermines itself, in the _judicial __ system_. Abstract right has to\nexhibit itself to the _court_\u2014to the individualised right\u2014as _proven_:\u2014a\nprocess in which there may be a difference between what is abstractly\nright and what is provably right. The court takes cognisance and action in\nthe interest of right as such, deprives the existence of right of its\ncontingency, and in particular transforms this existence,\u2014as this exists\nas revenge\u2014into _punishment_ (\u00a7 500).\nThe comparison of the two species, or rather two elements in the judicial\nconviction, bearing on the actual state of the case in relation to the\naccused,\u2014(1) according as that conviction is based on mere circumstances\nand other people\u2019s witness alone,\u2014or (2) in addition requires the\nconfession of the accused, constitutes the main point in the question of\nthe so-called jury-courts. It is an essential point that the two\ningredients of a judicial cognisance, the judgment as to the state of the\nfact, and the judgment as application of the law to it, should, as at\nbottom different sides, be exercised as _different functions_. By the said\ninstitution they are allotted even to bodies differently qualified,\u2014from\nthe one of which individuals belonging to the official judiciary are\nexpressly excluded. To carry this separation of functions up to this\nseparation in the courts rests rather on extra-essential considerations:\nthe main point remains only the separate performance of these essentially\ndifferent functions.\u2014It is a more important point whether the confession\nof the accused is or is not to be made a condition of penal judgment. The\ninstitution of the jury-court loses sight of this condition. The point is\nthat on this ground certainty is completely inseparable from truth: but\nthe confession is to be regarded as the very acm\u00e9 of certainty-giving\nwhich in its nature is subjective. The final decision therefore lies with\nthe confession. To this therefore the accused has an absolute right, if\nthe proof is to be made final and the judges to be convinced. No doubt\nthis factor is incomplete, because it is only one factor; but still more\nincomplete is the other when no less abstractly taken,\u2014viz. mere\ncircumstantial evidence. The jurors are essentially judges and pronounce a\njudgment. In so far, then, as all they have to go on are such objective\nproofs, whilst at the same time their defect of certainty (incomplete in\nso far as it is only _in them_) is admitted, the jury-court shows traces\nof its barbaric origin in a confusion and admixture between objective\nproofs and subjective or so-called \u201cmoral\u201d conviction.\u2014It is easy to call\n_extraordinary_ punishments an absurdity; but the fault lies rather with\nthe shallowness which takes offence at a mere name. Materially the\nprinciple involves the difference of objective probation according as it\ngoes with or without the factor of absolute certification which lies in\nconfession.\n\u00a7 532. The function of judicial administration is only to actualise to\nnecessity the abstract side of personal liberty in civil society. But this\nactualisation rests at first on the particular subjectivity of the judge,\nsince here as yet there is not found the necessary unity of it with right\nin the abstract. Conversely, the blind necessity of the system of wants is\nnot lifted up into the consciousness of the universal, and worked from\nthat period of view.\nc. Police and Corporation(166).\n\u00a7 533. Judicial administration naturally has no concern with such part of\nactions and interests as belongs only to particularity, and leaves to\nchance not only the occurrence of crimes but also the care for public\nweal. In civil society the sole end is to satisfy want\u2014and that, because\nit is man\u2019s want, in a uniform general way, so as to _secure_ this\nsatisfaction. But the machinery of social necessity leaves in many ways a\ncasualness about this satisfaction. This is due to the variability of the\nwants themselves, in which opinion and subjective good-pleasure play a\ngreat part. It results also from circumstances of locality, from the\nconnexions between nation and nation, from errors and deceptions which can\nbe foisted upon single members of the social circulation and are capable\nof creating disorder in it,\u2014as also and especially from the unequal\ncapacity of individuals to take advantage of that general stock. The\nonward march of this necessity also sacrifices the very particularities by\nwhich it is brought about, and does not itself contain the affirmative aim\nof securing the satisfaction of individuals. So far as concerns them, it\n_may_ be far from beneficial: yet here the individuals are the\nmorally-justifiable end.\n\u00a7 534. To keep in view this general end, to ascertain the way in which the\npowers composing that social necessity act, and their variable\ningredients, and to maintain that end in them and against them, is the\nwork of an institution which assumes on _one_ hand, to the concrete of\ncivil society, the position of an external universality. Such an order\nacts with the power of an external state, which, in so far as it is rooted\nin the higher or substantial state, appears as state \u201cpolice.\u201d On the\n_other_ hand, in this sphere of particularity the only recognition of the\naim of substantial universality and the only carrying of it out is\nrestricted to the business of particular branches and interests. Thus we\nhave the _corporation_, in which the particular citizen in his private\ncapacity finds the securing of his stock, whilst at the same time he in it\nemerges from his single private interest, and has a conscious activity for\na comparatively universal end, just as in his legal and professional\nduties he has his social morality.\nCC. The State.\n\u00a7 535. The State is the _self-conscious_ ethical substance, the\nunification of the family principle with that of civil society. The same\nunity, which is in the family as a feeling of love, is its essence,\nreceiving however at the same time through the second principle of\nconscious and spontaneously active volition the _form_ of conscious\nuniversality. This universal principle, with all its evolution in detail,\nis the absolute aim and content of the knowing subject, which thus\nidentifies itself in its volition with the system of reasonableness.\n\u00a7 536. The state is (\u03b1) its inward structure as a self-relating\ndevelopment\u2014constitutional (inner-state) law: (\u03b2) a particular individual,\nand therefore in connexion with other particular\nindividuals,\u2014international (outer-state) law; (\u03b3) but these particular\nminds are only stages in the general development of mind in its actuality:\nuniversal history.\n\u03b1. Constitutional Law(167).\n\u00a7 537. The essence of the state is the universal, self-originated and\nself-developed,\u2014the reasonable spirit of will; but, as self-knowing and\nself-actualising, sheer subjectivity, and\u2014as an actuality\u2014one individual.\nIts _work_ generally\u2014in relation to the extreme of individuality as the\nmultitude of individuals\u2014consists in a double function. First it maintains\nthem as persons, thus making right a necessary actuality, then it promotes\ntheir welfare, which each originally takes care of for himself, but which\nhas a thoroughly general side; it protects the family and guides civil\nsociety. Secondly, it carries back both, and the whole disposition and\naction of the individual\u2014whose tendency is to become a centre of his\nown\u2014into the life of the universal substance; and, in this direction, as a\nfree power it interferes with those subordinate spheres and retains them\nin substantial immanence.\n\u00a7 538. The laws express the special provisions for objective freedom.\nFirst, to the immediate agent, his independent self-will and particular\ninterest, they are restrictions. But, secondly, they are an absolute final\nend and the universal work: hence they are a product of the \u201cfunctions\u201d of\nthe various orders which parcel themselves more and more out of the\ngeneral particularising, and are a fruit of all the acts and private\nconcerns of individuals. Thirdly, they are the substance of the volition\nof individuals\u2014which volition is thereby free\u2014and of their disposition:\nbeing as such exhibited as current usage.\n\u00a7 539. As a living mind, the state only is as an organised whole,\ndifferentiated into particular agencies, which, proceeding from the one\nnotion (though not known as notion) of the reasonable will, continually\nproduce it as their result. The _constitution_ is this articulation or\norganisation of state-power. It provides for the reasonable will,\u2014in so\nfar as it is in the individuals only _implicitly_ the universal\nwill,\u2014coming to a consciousness and an understanding of itself and being\n_found_; also for that will being put in actuality, through the action of\nthe government and its several branches, and not left to perish, but\nprotected both against _their_ casual subjectivity and against that of the\nindividuals. The constitution is existent _justice_,\u2014the actuality of\nliberty in the development all its reasonable provisions.\nLiberty and Equality are the simple rubrics into which is frequently\nconcentrated what should form the fundamental principle, the final aim and\nresult of the constitution. However true this is, the defect of these\nterms is their utter abstractness: if stuck to in this abstract form, they\nare principles which either prevent the rise of the concreteness of the\nstate, i.e. its articulation into a constitution and a government in\ngeneral, or destroy them. With the state there arises inequality, the\ndifference of governing powers and of governed, magistracies, authorities,\ndirectories, &c. The principle of equality, logically carried out, rejects\nall differences, and thus allows no sort of political condition to exist.\nLiberty and equality are indeed the foundation of the state, but as the\nmost abstract also the most superficial, and for that very reason\nnaturally the most familiar. It is important therefore to study them\ncloser.\nAs regards, first, Equality, the familiar proposition, All men are by\nnature equal, blunders by confusing the \u201cnatural\u201d with the \u201cnotion.\u201d It\nought rather to read: _By nature_ men are only unequal. But the notion of\nliberty, as it exists as such, without further specification and\ndevelopment, is abstract subjectivity, as a person capable of property (\u00a7\n488). This single abstract feature of personality constitutes the actual\n_equality_ of human beings. But that this freedom should exist, that it\nshould be _man_ (and not as in Greece, Rome, &c. _some_ men) that is\nrecognised and legally regarded as a person, is so little _by nature_,\nthat it is rather only a result and product of the consciousness of the\ndeepest principle of mind, and of the universality and expansion of this\nconsciousness. That the citizens are equal before the law contains a great\ntruth, but which so expressed is a tautology: it only states that the\nlegal status in general exists, that the laws rule. But, as regards the\nconcrete, the citizens\u2014besides their personality\u2014are equal before the law\nonly in these points when they are otherwise equal _outside the law_. Only\nthat equality which (in whatever way it be) they, as it happens, otherwise\nhave in property, age, physical strength, talent, skill, &c.\u2014or even in\ncrime, can and ought to make them deserve equal treatment before the\nlaw:\u2014only it can make them\u2014as regards taxation, military service,\neligibility to office, &c.\u2014punishment, &c.\u2014equal in the concrete. The laws\nthemselves, except in so far as they concern that narrow circle of\npersonality, presuppose unequal conditions, and provide for the unequal\nlegal duties and appurtenances resulting therefrom.\nAs regards Liberty, it is originally taken partly in a negative sense\nagainst arbitrary intolerance and lawless treatment, partly in the\naffirmative sense of subjective freedom; but this freedom is allowed great\nlatitude both as regards the agent\u2019s self-will and action for his\nparticular ends, and as regards his claim to have a personal intelligence\nand a personal share in general affairs. Formerly the legally defined\nrights, private as well as public rights of a nation, town, &c. were\ncalled its \u201cliberties.\u201d Really, every genuine law is a liberty: it\ncontains a reasonable principle of objective mind; in other words, it\nembodies a liberty. Nothing has become, on the contrary, more familiar\nthan the idea that each must _restrict_ his liberty in relation to the\nliberty of others: that the state is a condition of such reciprocal\nrestriction, and that the laws are restrictions. To such habits of mind\nliberty is viewed as only casual good-pleasure and self-will. Hence it has\nalso been said that \u201cmodern\u201d nations are only susceptible of equality, or\nof equality more than liberty: and that for no other reason than that,\nwith an assumed definition of liberty (chiefly the participation of all in\npolitical affairs and actions), it was impossible to make ends meet in\nactuality\u2014which is at once more reasonable and more powerful than abstract\npresuppositions. On the contrary, it should be said that it is just the\ngreat development and maturity of form in modern states which produces the\nsupreme concrete inequality of individuals in actuality: while, through\nthe deeper reasonableness of laws and the greater stability of the legal\nstate, it gives rise to greater and more stable liberty, which it can\nwithout incompatibility allow. Even the superficial distinction of the\nwords liberty and equality points to the fact that the former tends to\ninequality: whereas, on the contrary, the current notions of liberty only\ncarry us back to equality. But the more we fortify liberty,\u2014as security of\nproperty, as possibility for each to develop and make the best of his\ntalents and good qualities, the more it gets taken for granted: and then\nthe sense and appreciation of liberty especially turns in a _subjective_\ndirection. By this is meant the liberty to attempt action on every side,\nand to throw oneself at pleasure in action for particular and for general\nintellectual interests, the removal of all checks on the individual\nparticularity, as well as the inward liberty in which the subject has\nprinciples, has an insight and conviction of his own, and thus gains moral\nindependence. But this liberty itself on one hand implies that supreme\ndifferentiation in which men are unequal and make themselves more unequal\nby education; and on another it only grows up under conditions of that\nobjective liberty, and is and could grow to such height only in modern\nstates. If, with this development of particularity, there be simultaneous\nand endless increase of the number of wants, and of the difficulty of\nsatisfying them, of the lust of argument and the fancy of detecting\nfaults, with its insatiate vanity, it is all but part of that\nindiscriminating relaxation of individuality in this sphere which\ngenerates all possible complications, and must deal with them as it can.\nSuch a sphere is of course also the field of restrictions, because liberty\nis there under the taint of natural self-will and self-pleasing, and has\ntherefore to restrict itself: and that, not merely with regard to the\nnaturalness, self-will and self-conceit, of others, but especially and\nessentially with regard to reasonable liberty.\nThe term political liberty, however, is often used to mean formal\nparticipation in the public affairs of state by the will and action even\nof those individuals who otherwise find their chief function in the\nparticular aims and business of civil society. And it has in part become\nusual to give the title constitution only to the side of the state which\nconcerns such participation of these individuals in general affairs, and\nto regard a state, in which this is not formally done, as a state without\na constitution. On this use of the term, the only thing to remark is that\nby constitution must be understood the determination of rights, i.e. of\nliberties in general, and the organisation of the actualisation of them;\nand that political freedom in the above sense can in any case only\nconstitute a part of it. Of it the following paragraphs will speak.\n\u00a7 540. The guarantee of a constitution (i.e. the necessity that the laws\nbe reasonable, and their actualisation secured) lies in the collective\nspirit of the nation,\u2014especially in the specific way in which it is itself\nconscious of its reason. (Religion is that consciousness in its absolute\nsubstantiality.) But the guarantee lies also at the same time in the\nactual organisation or development of that principle in suitable\ninstitutions. The constitution presupposes that consciousness of the\ncollective spirit, and conversely that spirit presupposes the\nconstitution: for the actual spirit only has a definite consciousness of\nits principles, in so far as it has them actually existent before it.\nThe question\u2014To whom (to what authority and how organised) belongs the\npower to make a constitution? is the same as the question, Who has to make\nthe spirit of a nation? Separate our idea of a constitution from that of\nthe collective spirit, as if the latter exists or has existed without a\nconstitution, and your fancy only proves how superficially you have\napprehended the nexus between the spirit in its self-consciousness and in\nits actuality. What is thus called \u201cmaking\u201d a \u201cconstitution,\u201d is\u2014just\nbecause of this inseparability\u2014a thing that has never happened in history,\njust as little as the making of a code of laws. A constitution only\ndevelops from the national spirit identically with that spirit\u2019s own\ndevelopment, and runs through at the same time with it the grades of\nformation and the alterations required by its concept. It is the\nindwelling spirit and the history of the nation (and, be it added, the\nhistory is only that spirit\u2019s history) by which constitutions have been\nand are made.\n\u00a7 541. The really living totality,\u2014that which preserves, in other words\ncontinually produces the state in general and its constitution, is the\n_government_. The organisation which natural necessity gives is seen in\nthe rise of the family and of the \u2019estates\u2019 of civil society. The\ngovernment is the _universal_ part of the constitution, i.e. the part\nwhich intentionally aims at preserving those parts, but at the same time\ngets hold of and carries out those general aims of the whole which rise\nabove the function of the family and of civil society. The organisation of\nthe government is likewise its differentiation into powers, as their\npeculiarities have a basis in principle; yet without that difference\nlosing touch with the _actual unity_ they have in the notion\u2019s\nsubjectivity.\nAs the most obvious categories of the notion are those of _universality_\nand _individuality_ and their relationship that of _subsumption_ of\nindividual under universal, it has come about that in the state the\nlegislative and executive power have been so distinguished as to make the\nformer exist apart as the absolute superior, and to subdivide the latter\nagain into administrative (government) power and judicial power, according\nas the laws are applied to public or private affairs. The _division_ of\nthese powers has been treated as _the_ condition of political equilibrium,\nmeaning by division their _independence_ one of another in\nexistence,\u2014subject always however to the above-mentioned subsumption of\nthe powers of the individual under the power of the general. The theory of\nsuch \u201cdivision\u201d unmistakably implies the elements of the notion, but so\ncombined by \u201cunderstanding\u201d as to result in an absurd collocation, instead\nof the self-redintegration of the living spirit. The one essential canon\nto make liberty deep and real is to give every business belonging to the\ngeneral interests of the state a separate organisation wherever they are\nessentially distinct. Such real division must be: for liberty is only deep\nwhen it is differentiated in all its fullness and these differences\nmanifested in existence. But to make the business of legislation an\nindependent power\u2014to make it the first power, with the further proviso\nthat all citizens shall have part therein, and the government be merely\nexecutive and dependent, presupposes ignorance that the true idea, and\ntherefore the living and spiritual actuality, is the self-redintegrating\nnotion, in other words, the subjectivity which contains in it universality\nas only one of its moments. (A mistake still greater, if it goes with the\nfancy that the constitution and the fundamental laws were still one day to\nmake,\u2014in a state of society, which includes an already existing\ndevelopment of differences.) Individuality is the first and supreme\nprinciple _which_ makes itself fall through the state\u2019s organisation. Only\nthrough the government, and by its embracing in itself the particular\nbusinesses (including the abstract legislative business, which taken apart\nis also particular), is the state _one_. These, as always, are the terms\non which the different elements essentially and alone truly stand towards\neach other in the logic of \u201creason,\u201d as opposed to the external footing\nthey stand on in \u2019understanding,\u2019 which never gets beyond subsuming the\nindividual and particular under the universal. What disorganises the unity\nof logical reason, equally disorganises actuality.\n\u00a7 542. In the government\u2014regarded as organic totality\u2014the sovereign power\n(principate) is (_a_) _subjectivity_ as the _infinite_ self-unity of the\nnotion in its development;\u2014the all-sustaining, all-decreeing will of the\nstate, its highest peak and all-pervasive unity. In the perfect form of\nthe state, in which each and every element of the notion has reached free\nexistence, this subjectivity is not a so-called \u201cmoral person,\u201d or a\ndecree issuing from a majority (forms in which the unity of the decreeing\nwill has not an _actual_ existence), but an actual individual,\u2014the will of\na decreeing individual,\u2014_monarchy_. The monarchical constitution is\ntherefore the constitution of developed reason: all other constitutions\nbelong to lower grades of the development and realisation of reason.\nThe unification of all concrete state-powers into one existence, as in the\npatriarchal society,\u2014or, as in a democratic constitution, the\nparticipation of all in all affairs\u2014impugns the principle of the division\nof powers, i.e. the developed liberty of the constituent factors of the\nIdea. But no whit less must the division (the working out of these factors\neach to a free totality) be reduced to \u201cideal\u201d unity, i.e. to\n_subjectivity_. The mature differentiation or realisation of the Idea\nmeans, essentially, that this subjectivity should grow to be a _real_\n\u201cmoment,\u201d an _actual_ existence; and this actuality is not otherwise than\nas the individuality of the monarch\u2014the subjectivity of abstract and final\ndecision existent in _one_ person. All those forms of collective decreeing\nand willing,\u2014a common will which shall be the sum and the resultant (on\naristocratical or democratical principles) of the atomistic of single\nwills, have on them the mark of the unreality of an abstraction. Two\npoints only are all-important, first to see the necessity of each of the\nnotional factors, and secondly the form in which it is actualised. It is\nonly the nature of the speculative notion which can really give light on\nthe matter. That subjectivity\u2014being the \u201cmoment\u201d which emphasises the need\nof abstract deciding in general\u2014partly leads on to the proviso that the\nname of the monarch appear as the bond and sanction under which everything\nis done in the government;\u2014partly, being simple self-relation, has\nattached to it the characteristic of _immediacy_, and then of\n_nature_\u2014whereby the destination of individuals for the dignity of the\nprincely power is fixed by inheritance.\n\u00a7 543. (_b_) In the _particular_ government-power there emerges, first,\nthe division of state-business into its branches (otherwise defined),\nlegislative power, administration of justice or judicial power,\nadministration and police, and its consequent distribution between\nparticular boards or offices, which having their business appointed by\nlaw, to that end and for that reason, possess independence of action,\nwithout at the same time ceasing to stand under higher supervision.\nSecondly, too, there arises the participation of _several_ in\nstate-business, who together constitute the \u201cgeneral order\u201d (\u00a7 528) in so\nfar as they take on themselves the charge of universal ends as the\nessential function of their particular life;\u2014the further condition for\nbeing able to take individually part in this business being a certain\ntraining, aptitude, and skill for such ends.\n\u00a7 544. The estates-collegium or provincial council is an institution by\nwhich all such as belong to civil society in general, and are to that\ndegree private persons, participate in the governmental power, especially\nin legislation\u2014viz. such legislation as concerns the universal scope of\nthose interests which do not, like peace and war, involve the, as it were,\npersonal interference and action of the State as one man, and therefore do\nnot belong specially to the province of the sovereign power. By virtue of\nthis participation subjective liberty and conceit, with their general\nopinion, can show themselves palpably efficacious and enjoy the\nsatisfaction of feeling themselves to count for something.\nThe division of constitutions into democracy, aristocracy and monarchy, is\nstill the most definite statement of their difference in relation to\nsovereignty. They must at the same time be regarded as necessary\nstructures in the path of development,\u2014in short, in the history of the\nState. Hence it is superficial and absurd to represent them as an object\nof _choice_. The pure forms\u2014necessary to the process of evolution\u2014are, in\nso far as they are finite and in course of change, conjoined both with\nforms of their degeneration,\u2014such as ochlocracy, &c., and with earlier\ntransition-forms. These two forms are not to be confused with those\nlegitimate structures. Thus, it may be\u2014if we look only to the fact that\nthe will of one individual stands at the head of the state\u2014oriental\ndespotism is included under the vague name monarchy,\u2014as also feudal\nmonarchy, to which indeed even the favourite name of \u201cconstitutional\nmonarchy\u201d cannot be refused. The true difference of these forms from\ngenuine monarchy depends on the true value of those principles of right\nwhich are in vogue and have their actuality and guarantee in the\nstate-power. These principles are those expounded earlier, liberty of\nproperty, and above all personal liberty, civil society, with its industry\nand its communities, and the regulated efficiency of the particular\nbureaux in subordination to the laws.\nThe question which is most discussed is in what sense we are to understand\nthe participation of private persons in state affairs. For it is as\nprivate persons that the members of bodies of estates are primarily to be\ntaken, be they treated as mere individuals, or as representatives of a\nnumber of people or of the nation. The aggregate of private persons is\noften spoken of as the _nation_: but as such an aggregate it is _vulgus_,\nnot _populus_: and in this direction, it is the one sole aim of the state\nthat a nation should _not_ come to existence, to power and action, _as\nsuch an aggregate_. Such a condition of a nation is a condition of\nlawlessness, demoralisation, brutishness: in it the nation would only be a\nshapeless, wild, blind force, like that of the stormy, elemental sea,\nwhich however is not self-destructive, as the nation\u2014a spiritual\nelement\u2014would be. Yet such a condition may be often heard described as\nthat of true freedom. If there is to be any sense in embarking upon the\nquestion of the participation of private persons in public affairs, it is\nnot a brutish mass, but an already organised nation\u2014one in which a\ngovernmental power exists\u2014which should be presupposed. The desirability of\nsuch participation however is not to be put in the superiority of\nparticular intelligence, which private persons are supposed to have over\nstate officials\u2014the contrary may be the case\u2014nor in the superiority of\ntheir good will for the general best. The members of civil society as such\nare rather people who find their nearest duty in their private interest\nand (as especially in the feudal society) in the interest of their\nprivileged corporation. Take the case of _England_ which, because private\npersons have a predominant share in public affairs, has been regarded as\nhaving the freest of all constitutions. Experience shows that that\ncountry\u2014as compared with the other civilised states of Europe\u2014is the most\nbackward in civil and criminal legislation, in the law and liberty of\nproperty, in arrangements for art and science, and that objective freedom\nor rational right is rather _sacrificed_ to formal right and particular\nprivate interest; and that this happens even in the institutions and\npossessions supposed to be dedicated to religion. The desirability of\nprivate persons taking part in public affairs is partly to be put in their\nconcrete, and therefore more urgent, sense of general wants. But the true\nmotive is the right of the collective spirit to appear as an _externally\nuniversal_ will, acting with orderly and express efficacy for the public\nconcerns. By this satisfaction of this right it gets its own life\nquickened, and at the same time breathes fresh life in the administrative\nofficials; who thus have it brought home to them that not merely have they\nto enforce duties but also to have regard to rights. Private citizens are\nin the state the incomparably greater number, and form the multitude of\nsuch as are recognised as persons. Hence the will-reason exhibits its\nexistence in them as a preponderating majority of freemen, or in its\n\u201creflectional\u201d universality, which has its actuality vouchsafed it as a\nparticipation in the sovereignty. But it has already been noted as a\n\u201cmoment\u201d of civil society (\u00a7\u00a7 527, 534) that the individuals rise from\nexternal into substantial universality, and form a _particular_ kind,\u2014the\nEstates: and it is not in the inorganic form of mere individuals as such\n(after the _democratic_ fashion of election), but as organic factors, as\nestates, that they enter upon that participation. In the state a power or\nagency must never appear and act as a formless, inorganic shape, i.e.\nbasing itself on the principle of multeity and mere numbers.\nAssemblies of Estates have been wrongly designated as the _legislative\npower_, so far as they form only one branch of that power,\u2014a branch in\nwhich the special government-officials have an _ex officio_ share, while\nthe sovereign power has the privilege of final decision. In a civilised\nstate moreover legislation can only be a further modification of existing\nlaw, and so-called new laws can only deal with minutiae of detail and\nparticularities (cf. \u00a7 529, note), the main drift of which has been\nalready prepared or preliminarily settled by the practice of the\nlaw-courts. The so-called _financial law_, in so far as it requires the\nassent of the estates, is really a government affair: it is only\nimproperly called a law, in the general sense of embracing a wide, indeed\nthe whole, range of the external means of government. The finances deal\nwith what in their nature are only particular needs, ever newly recurring,\neven if they touch on the sum total of such needs. If the main part of the\nrequirement were\u2014as it very likely is\u2014regarded as permanent, the provision\nfor it would have more the nature of a law: but to be a law, it would have\nto be made once for all, and not be made yearly, or every few years,\nafresh. The part which varies according to time and circumstances concerns\nin reality the smallest part of the amount, and the provisions with regard\nto it have even less the character of a law: and yet it is and may be only\nthis slight variable part which is matter of dispute, and can be subjected\nto a varying yearly estimate. It is this last then which falsely bears the\nhigh-sounding name of the \u201c_Grant_\u201d of the _Budget_, i.e. of the whole of\nthe finances. A law for one year and made each year has even to the plain\nman something palpably absurd: for he distinguishes the essential and\ndeveloped universal, as content of a true law, from the reflectional\nuniversality which only externally embraces what in its nature is many. To\ngive the name of a law to the annual fixing of financial requirements only\nserves\u2014with the presupposed separation of legislative from executive\u2014to\nkeep up the illusion of that separation having real existence, and to\nconceal the fact that the legislative power, when it makes a decree about\nfinance, is really engaged with strict executive business. But the\nimportance attached to the power of from time to time granting \u201csupply,\u201d\non the ground that the assembly of estates possesses in it a _check_ on\nthe government, and thus a guarantee against injustice and violence,\u2014this\nimportance is in one way rather plausible than real. The financial\nmeasures necessary for the state\u2019s subsistence cannot be made conditional\non any other circumstances, nor can the state\u2019s subsistence be put yearly\nin doubt. It would be a parallel absurdity if the government were e.g. to\ngrant and arrange the judicial institutions always for a limited time\nmerely; and thus, by the threat of suspending the activity of such an\ninstitution and the fear of a consequent state of brigandage, reserve for\nitself a means of coercing private individuals. Then again, the pictures\nof a condition of affairs, in which it might be useful and necessary to\nhave in hand means of compulsion, are partly based on the false conception\nof a contract between rulers and ruled, and partly presuppose the\npossibility of such a divergence in spirit between these two parties as\nwould make constitution and government quite out of the question. If we\nsuppose the empty possibility of getting _help_ by such compulsive means\nbrought into existence, such help would rather be the derangement and\ndissolution of the state, in which there would no longer be a government,\nbut only parties, and the violence and oppression of one party would only\nbe helped away by the other. To fit together the several parts of the\nstate into a constitution after the fashion of mere understanding\u2014i.e. to\nadjust within it the machinery of a balance of powers external to each\nother\u2014is to contravene the fundamental idea of what a state is.\n\u00a7 545. The final aspect of the state is to appear in immediate actuality\nas a single nation marked by physical conditions. As a single individual\nit is exclusive against other like individuals. In their mutual relations,\nwaywardness and chance have a place; for each person in the aggregate is\nautonomous: the universal of law is only postulated between them, and not\nactually existent. This independence of a central authority reduces\ndisputes between them to terms of mutual violence, a _state of war_, to\nmeet which the general estate in the community assumes the particular\nfunction of maintaining the state\u2019s independence against other states, and\nbecomes the estate of bravery.\n\u00a7 546. This state of war shows the omnipotence of the state in its\nindividuality\u2014an individuality that goes even to abstract negativity.\nCountry and fatherland then appear as the power by which the particular\nindependence of individuals and their absorption in the external existence\nof possession and in natural life is convicted of its own nullity,\u2014as the\npower which procures the maintenance of the general substance by the\npatriotic sacrifice on the part of these individuals of this natural and\nparticular existence,\u2014so making nugatory the nugatoriness that confronts\nit.\n\u03b2. External Public Law(168).\n\u00a7 547. In the game of war the independence of States is at stake. In one\ncase the result may be the mutual recognition of free national\nindividualities (\u00a7 430): and by peace-conventions supposed to be for ever,\nboth this general recognition, and the special claims of nations on one\nanother, are settled and fixed. External state-rights rest partly on these\npositive treaties, but to that extent contain only rights falling short of\ntrue actuality (\u00a7 545): partly on so-called _international_ law, the\ngeneral principle of which is its presupposed recognition by the several\nStates. It thus restricts their otherwise unchecked action against one\nanother in such a way that the possibility of peace is left; and\ndistinguishes individuals as private persons (non-belligerents) from the\nstate. In general, international law rests on social usage.\n\u03b3. Universal History(169).\n\u00a7 548. As the mind of a special nation is actual and its liberty is under\nnatural conditions, it admits on this nature-side the influence of\ngeographical and climatic qualities. It is in time; and as regards its\nrange and scope, has essentially a _particular_ principle on the lines of\nwhich it must run through a development of its consciousness and its\nactuality. It has, in short, a history of its own. But as a restricted\nmind its independence is something secondary; it passes into universal\nworld-history, the events of which exhibit the dialectic of the several\nnational minds,\u2014the judgment of the world.\n\u00a7 549. This movement is the path of liberation for the spiritual\nsubstance, the deed by which the absolute final aim of the world is\nrealised in it, and the merely implicit mind achieves consciousness and\nself-consciousness. It is thus the revelation and actuality of its\nessential and completed essence, whereby it becomes to the outward eye a\nuniversal spirit\u2014a world-mind. As this development is in time and in real\nexistence, as it is a history, its several stages and steps are the\nnational minds, each of which, as single and endued by nature with a\nspecific character, is appointed to occupy only one grade, and accomplish\none task in the whole deed.\nThe presupposition that history has an essential and actual end, from the\nprinciples of which certain characteristic results logically flow, is\ncalled an _a priori_ view of it, and philosophy is reproached with _a\npriori_ history-writing. On this point, and on history-writing in general,\nthis note must go into further detail. That history, and above all\nuniversal history, is founded on an essential and actual aim, which\nactually is and will be realised in it\u2014the plan of Providence; that, in\nshort, there is Reason in history, must be decided on strictly\nphilosophical ground, and thus shown to be essentially and in fact\nnecessary. To presuppose such aim is blameworthy only when the assumed\nconceptions or thoughts are arbitrarily adopted, and when a determined\nattempt is made to force events and actions into conformity with such\nconceptions. For such _a priori_ methods of treatment at the present day,\nhowever, those are chiefly to blame who profess to be purely historical,\nand who at the same time take opportunity expressly to raise their voice\nagainst the habit of philosophising, first in general, and then in\nhistory. Philosophy is to them a troublesome neighbour: for it is an enemy\nof all arbitrariness and hasty suggestions. Such _a priori_\nhistory-writing has sometimes burst out in quarters where one would least\nhave expected it, especially on the philological side, and in Germany more\nthan in France and England, where the art of historical writing has gone\nthrough a process of purification to a firmer and maturer character.\nFictions, like that of a primitive age and its primitive people, possessed\nfrom the first of the true knowledge of God and all the sciences,\u2014of\nsacerdotal races,\u2014and, when we come to minutiae, of a Roman epic, supposed\nto be the source of the legends which pass current for the history of\nancient Rome, &c., have taken the place of the pragmatising which detected\npsychological motives and associations. There is a wide circle of persons\nwho seem to consider it incumbent on a _learned_ and _ingenious_ historian\ndrawing from the original sources to concoct such baseless fancies, and\nform bold combinations of them from a learned rubbish-heap of\nout-of-the-way and trivial facts, in defiance of the best-accredited\nhistory.\nSetting aside this subjective treatment of history, we find what is\nproperly the opposite view forbidding us to import into history an\n_objective purpose_. This is after all synonymous with what _seems_ to be\nthe still more legitimate demand that the historian should proceed with\n_impartiality_. This is a requirement often and especially made on the\n_history of philosophy_: where it is insisted there should be no\nprepossession in favour of an idea or opinion, just as a judge should have\nno special sympathy for one of the contending parties. In the case of the\njudge it is at the same time assumed that he would administer his office\nill and foolishly, if he had not an interest, and an exclusive interest in\njustice, if he had not that for his aim and one sole aim, or if he\ndeclined to judge at all. This requirement which we may make upon the\njudge may be called _partiality_ for justice; and there is no difficulty\nhere in distinguishing it from _subjective_ partiality. But in speaking of\nthe impartiality required from the historian, this self-satisfied insipid\nchatter lets the distinction disappear, and rejects both kinds of\ninterest. It demands that the historian shall bring with him no definite\naim and view by which he may sort out, state and criticise events, but\nshall narrate them exactly in the casual mode he finds them, in their\nincoherent and unintelligent particularity. Now it is at least admitted\nthat a history must have an object, e.g. Rome and its fortunes, or the\nDecline of the grandeur of the Roman empire. But little reflection is\nneeded to discover that this is the presupposed end which lies at the\nbasis of the events themselves, as of the critical examination into their\ncomparative importance, i.e. their nearer or more remote relation to it. A\nhistory without such aim and such criticism would be only an imbecile\nmental divagation, not as good as a fairy tale, for even children expect a\n_motif_ in their stories, a purpose at least dimly surmiseable with which\nevents and actions are put in relation.\nIn the existence of a _nation_ the substantial aim is to be a state and\npreserve itself as such. A nation with no state formation, (a _mere\nnation_), has strictly speaking no history,\u2014like the nations which existed\nbefore the rise of states and others which still exist in a condition of\nsavagery. What happens to a nation, and takes place within it, has its\nessential significance in relation to the state: whereas the mere\nparticularities of individuals are at the greatest distance from the true\nobject of history. It is true that the general spirit of an age leaves its\nimprint in the character of its celebrated individuals, and even their\nparticularities are but the very distant and the dim media through which\nthe collective light still plays in fainter colours. Ay, even such\nsingularities as a petty occurrence, a word, express not a subjective\nparticularity, but an age, a nation, a civilisation, in striking\nportraiture and brevity; and to select such trifles shows the hand of a\nhistorian of genius. But, on the other hand, the main mass of\nsingularities is a futile and useless mass, by the painstaking\naccumulation of which the objects of real historical value are overwhelmed\nand obscured. The essential characteristic of the spirit and its age is\nalways contained in the great events. It was a correct instinct which\nsought to banish such portraiture of the particular and the gleaning of\ninsignificant traits, into the _Novel_ (as in the celebrated romances of\nWalter Scott, &c.). Where the picture presents an unessential aspect of\nlife it is certainly in good taste to conjoin it with an unessential\nmaterial, such as the romance takes from private events and subjective\npassions. But to take the individual pettinesses of an age and of the\npersons in it, and, in the interest of so-called truth, weave them into\nthe picture of general interests, is not only against taste and judgment,\nbut violates the principles of objective truth. The only truth for mind is\nthe substantial and underlying essence, and not the trivialities of\nexternal existence and contingency. It is therefore completely indifferent\nwhether such insignificancies are duly vouched for by documents, or, as in\nthe romance, invented to suit the character and ascribed to this or that\nname and circumstances.\nThe point of interest of _Biography_\u2014to say a word on that here\u2014appears to\nrun directly counter to any universal scope and aim. But biography too has\nfor its background the historical world, with which the individual is\nintimately bound up: even purely personal originality, the freak of\nhumour, &c. suggests by allusion that central reality and has its interest\nheightened by the suggestion. The mere play of sentiment, on the contrary,\nhas another ground and interest than history.\nThe requirement of impartiality addressed to the history of philosophy\n(and also, we may add, to the history of religion, first in general, and\nsecondly, to church history) generally implies an even more decided bar\nagainst presupposition of any objective aim. As the State was already\ncalled the point to which in political history criticism had to refer all\nevents, so here the \u201c_Truth_\u201d must be the object to which the several\ndeeds and events of the spirit would have to be referred. What is actually\ndone is rather to make the contrary presupposition. Histories with such an\nobject as religion or philosophy are understood to have only subjective\naims for their theme, i.e. only opinions and mere ideas, not an essential\nand realised object like the truth. And that with the mere excuse that\nthere is no truth. On this assumption the sympathy with truth appears as\nonly a partiality of the usual sort, a partiality for opinion and mere\nideas, which all alike have no stuff in them, and are all treated as\nindifferent. In that way historical truth means but correctness\u2014an\naccurate report of externals, without critical treatment save as regards\nthis correctness\u2014admitting, in this case, only qualitative and\nquantitative judgments, no judgments of necessity or notion (cf. notes to\n\u00a7\u00a7 172 and 175). But, really, if Rome or the German empire, &c. are an\nactual and genuine object of political history, and the aim to which the\nphenomena are to be related and by which they are to be judged; then in\nuniversal history the genuine spirit, the consciousness of it and of its\nessence, is even in a higher degree a true and actual object and theme,\nand an aim to which all other phenomena are essentially and actually\nsubservient. Only therefore through their relationship to it, i.e. through\nthe judgment in which they are subsumed under it, while it inheres in\nthem, have they their value and even their existence. It is the spirit\nwhich not merely broods _over_ history as over the waters, but lives in it\nand is alone its principle of movement: and in the path of that spirit,\nliberty, i.e. a development determined by the notion of spirit, is the\nguiding principle and only its notion its final aim, i.e. truth. For\nSpirit is consciousness. Such a doctrine\u2014or in other words that Reason is\nin history\u2014will be partly at least a plausible faith, partly it is a\ncognition of philosophy.\n\u00a7 550. This liberation of mind, in which it proceeds to come to itself and\nto realise its truth, and the business of so doing, is the supreme right,\nthe absolute Law. The self-consciousness of a particular nation is a\nvehicle for the contemporary development of the collective spirit in its\nactual existence: it is the objective actuality in which that spirit for\nthe time invests its will. Against this absolute will the other particular\nnatural minds have no rights: _that_ nation dominates the world: but yet\nthe universal will steps onward over its property for the time being, as\nover a special grade, and then delivers it over to its chance and doom.\n\u00a7 551. To such extent as this business of actuality appears as an action,\nand therefore as a work of _individuals_, these individuals, as regards\nthe substantial issue of their labour, are _instruments_, and their\nsubjectivity, which is what is peculiar to them, is the empty form of\nactivity. What they personally have gained therefore through the\nindividual share they took in the substantial business (prepared and\nappointed independently of them) is a formal universality or subjective\nmental idea\u2014_Fame_, which is their reward.\n\u00a7 552. The national spirit contains nature-necessity, and stands in\nexternal existence (\u00a7 423): the ethical substance, potentially infinite,\nis actually a particular and limited substance (\u00a7\u00a7 549, 550); on its\nsubjective side it labours under contingency, in the shape of its\nunreflective natural usages, and its content is presented to it as\nsomething _existing_ in time and tied to an external nature and external\nworld. The spirit, however, (which _thinks_ in this moral organism)\noverrides and absorbs within itself the finitude attaching to it as\nnational spirit in its state and the state\u2019s temporal interests, in the\nsystem of laws and usages. It rises to apprehend itself in its\nessentiality. Such apprehension, however, still has the immanent\nlimitedness of the national spirit. But the spirit which thinks in\nuniversal history, stripping off at the same time those limitations of the\nseveral national minds and its own temporal restrictions, lays hold of its\nconcrete universality, and rises to apprehend the absolute mind, as the\neternally actual truth in which the contemplative reason enjoys freedom,\nwhile the necessity of nature and the necessity of history are only\nministrant to its revelation and the vessels of its honour.\nThe strictly technical aspects of the Mind\u2019s elevation to God have been\nspoken of in the Introduction to the Logic (cf. especially \u00a7 51, note). As\nregards the starting-point of that elevation, Kant has on the whole\nadopted the most correct, when he treats belief in God as proceeding from\nthe practical Reason. For that starting-point contains the material or\ncontent which constitutes the content of the notion of God. But the true\nconcrete material is neither Being (as in the cosmological) nor mere\naction by design (as in the physico-theological proof) but the Mind, the\nabsolute characteristic and function of which is effective reason, i.e.\nthe self-determining and self-realising notion itself,\u2014Liberty. That the\nelevation of subjective mind to God which these considerations give is by\nKant again deposed to a _postulate_\u2014a mere \u201cought\u201d\u2014is the peculiar\nperversity, formerly noticed, of calmly and simply reinstating as true and\nvalid that very antithesis of finitude, the supersession of which into\ntruth is the essence of that elevation.\nAs regards the \u201cmediation\u201d which, as it has been already shown (\u00a7 192, cf.\n\u00a7 204 note), that elevation to God really involves, the point specially\ncalling for note is the \u201cmoment\u201d of negation through which the essential\ncontent of the starting-point is purged of its finitude so as to come\nforth free. This factor, abstract in the formal treatment of logic, now\ngets its most concrete interpretation. The finite, from which the start is\nnow made, is the real ethical self-consciousness. The negation through\nwhich that consciousness raises its spirit to its truth, is the\npurification, _actually_ accomplished in the ethical world, whereby its\nconscience is purged of subjective opinion and its will freed from the\nselfishness of desire. Genuine religion and genuine religiosity only issue\nfrom the moral life: religion is that life rising to think, i.e. becoming\naware of the free universality of its concrete essence. Only from the\nmoral life and by the moral life is the Idea of God seen to be free\nspirit: outside the ethical spirit therefore it is vain to seek for true\nreligion and religiosity.\nBut\u2014as is the case with all speculative process\u2014this development of one\nthing out of another means that what appears as sequel and derivative is\nrather the absolute _prius_ of what it appears to be mediated by, and what\nis here in mind known as its truth.\nHere then is the place to go more deeply into the reciprocal relations\nbetween the state and religion, and in doing so to elucidate the\nterminology which is familiar and current on the topic. It is evident and\napparent from what has preceded that moral life is the state retracted\ninto its inner heart and substance, while the state is the organisation\nand actualisation of moral life; and that religion is the very substance\nof the moral life itself and of the state. At this rate, the state rests\non the ethical sentiment, and that on the religious. If religion then is\nthe consciousness of \u201cabsolute\u201d_ truth_, then whatever is to rank as right\nand justice, as law and duty, i.e. as _true_ in the world of free will,\ncan be so esteemed only as it is participant in that truth, as it is\nsubsumed under it and is its sequel. But if the truly moral life is to be\na sequel of religion, then perforce religion must have the _genuine_\ncontent; i.e. the idea of God it knows must be the true and real. The\nethical life is the divine spirit as indwelling in self-consciousness, as\nit is actually present in a nation and its individual members. This\nself-consciousness retiring upon itself out of its empirical actuality and\nbringing its truth to consciousness, has in its _faith_ and in its\n_conscience_ only what it has consciously secured in its spiritual\nactuality. The two are inseparable: there cannot be two kinds of\nconscience, one religious and another ethical, differing from the former\nin body and value of truth. But in point of form, i.e. for thought and\nknowledge\u2014(and religion and ethical life belong to intelligence and are a\nthinking and knowing)\u2014the body of religious truth, as the pure\nself-subsisting and therefore supreme truth, exercises a sanction over the\nmoral life which lies in empirical actuality. Thus for self-consciousness\nreligion is the \u201cbasis\u201d of moral life and of the state. It has been the\nmonstrous blunder of our times to try to look upon these inseparables as\nseparable from one another, and even as mutually indifferent. The view\ntaken of the relationship of religion and the state has been that, whereas\nthe state had an independent existence of its own, springing from some\nforce and power, religion was a later addition, something desirable\nperhaps for strengthening the political bulwarks, but purely subjective in\nindividuals:\u2014or it may be, religion is treated as something without effect\non the moral life of the state, i.e. its reasonable law and constitution\nwhich are based on a ground of their own.\nAs the inseparability of the two sides has been indicated, it may be worth\nwhile to note the separation as it appears on the side of religion. It is\nprimarily a point of form: the attitude which self-consciousness takes to\nthe body of truth. So long as this body of truth is the very substance or\nindwelling spirit of self-consciousness in its actuality, then\nself-consciousness in this content has the certainty of itself and is\nfree. But if this present self-consciousness is lacking, then there may be\ncreated, in point of form, a condition of spiritual slavery, even though\nthe _implicit_ content of religion is absolute spirit. This great\ndifference (to cite a specific case) comes out within the Christian\nreligion itself, even though here it is not the nature-element in which\nthe idea of God is embodied, and though nothing of the sort even enters as\na factor into its central dogma and sole theme of a God who is known in\nspirit and in truth. And yet in Catholicism this spirit of all truth is in\nactuality set in rigid opposition to the self-conscious spirit. And, first\nof all, God is in the \u201chost\u201d presented to religious adoration as an\n_external thing_. (In the Lutheran Church, on the contrary, the host as\nsuch is not at first consecrated, but in the moment of enjoyment, i.e. in\nthe annihilation of its externality, and in the act of faith, i.e. in the\nfree self-certain spirit: only then is it consecrated and exalted to be\npresent God.) From that first and supreme status of externalisation flows\nevery other phase of externality,\u2014of bondage, non-spirituality, and\nsuperstition. It leads to a laity, receiving its knowledge of divine\ntruth, as well as the direction of its will and conscience from without\nand from another order\u2014which order again does not get possession of that\nknowledge in a spiritual way only, but to that end essentially requires an\nexternal consecration. It leads to the non-spiritual style of\npraying\u2014partly as mere moving of the lips, partly in the way that the\nsubject foregoes his right of directly addressing God, and prays others to\npray\u2014addressing his devotion to miracle-working images, even to bones, and\nexpecting miracles from them. It leads, generally, to justification by\nexternal works, a merit which is supposed to be gained by acts, and even\nto be capable of being transferred to others. All this binds the spirit\nunder an externalism by which the very meaning of spirit is perverted and\nmisconceived at its source, and law and justice, morality and conscience,\nresponsibility and duty are corrupted at their root.\nAlong with this principle of spiritual bondage, and these applications of\nit in the religious life, there can only go in the legislative and\nconstitutional system a legal and moral bondage, and a state of\nlawlessness and immorality in political life. Catholicism has been loudly\npraised and is still often praised\u2014logically enough\u2014as the one religion\nwhich secures the stability of governments. But in reality this applies\nonly to governments which are bound up with institutions founded on the\nbondage of the spirit (of that spirit which should have legal and moral\nliberty), i.e. with institutions that embody injustice and with a morally\ncorrupt and barbaric state of society. But these governments are not aware\nthat in fanaticism they have a terrible power, which does not rise in\nhostility against them, only so long as and only on condition that they\nremain sunk in the thraldom of injustice and immorality. But in mind there\nis a very different power available against that externalism and\ndismemberment induced by a false religion. Mind collects itself into its\ninward free actuality. Philosophy awakes in the spirit of governments and\nnations the wisdom to discern what is essentially and actually right and\nreasonable in the real world. It was well to call these products of\nthought, and in a special sense Philosophy, the wisdom of the world(170);\nfor thought makes the spirit\u2019s truth an actual present, leads it into the\nreal world, and thus liberates it in its actuality and in its own self.\nThus set free, the content of religion assumes quite another shape. So\nlong as the form, i.e. our consciousness and subjectivity, lacked liberty,\nit followed necessarily that self-consciousness was conceived as not\nimmanent in the ethical principles which religion embodies, and these\nprinciples were set at such a distance as to seem to have true being only\nas negative to actual self-consciousness. In this unreality ethical\ncontent gets the name of _Holiness_. But once the divine spirit introduces\nitself into actuality, and actuality emancipates itself to spirit, then\nwhat in the world was a postulate of holiness is supplanted by the\nactuality of _moral_ life. Instead of the vow of chastity, _marriage_ now\nranks as the ethical relation; and, therefore, as the highest on this side\nof humanity stands the family. Instead of the vow of poverty (muddled up\ninto a contradiction of assigning merit to whosoever gives away goods to\nthe poor, i.e. whosoever enriches them) is the precept of action to\nacquire goods through one\u2019s own intelligence and industry,\u2014of honesty in\ncommercial dealing, and in the use of property,\u2014in short moral life in the\nsocio-economic sphere. And instead of the vow of obedience, true religion\nsanctions obedience to the law and the legal arrangements of the state\u2014an\nobedience which is itself the true freedom, because the state is a\nself-possessed, self-realising reason\u2014in short, moral life in the state.\nThus, and thus only, can law and morality exist. The precept of religion,\n\u201cGive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s and to God what is God\u2019s\u201d is not enough:\nthe question is to settle what is Caesar\u2019s, what belongs to the secular\nauthority: and it is sufficiently notorious that the secular no less than\nthe ecclesiastical authority have claimed almost everything as their own.\nThe divine spirit must interpenetrate the entire secular life: whereby\nwisdom is concrete within it, and it carries the terms of its own\njustification. But that concrete indwelling is only the aforesaid ethical\norganisations. It is the morality of marriage as against the sanctity of a\ncelibate order;\u2014the morality of economic and industrial action against the\nsanctity of poverty and its indolence;\u2014the morality of an obedience\ndedicated to the law of the state as against the sanctity of an obedience\nfrom which law and duty are absent and where conscience is enslaved. With\nthe growing need for law and morality and the sense of the spirit\u2019s\nessential liberty, there sets in a conflict of spirit with the religion of\nunfreedom. It is no use to organise political laws and arrangements on\nprinciples of equity and reason, so long as in religion the principle of\nunfreedom is not abandoned. A free state and a slavish religion are\nincompatible. It is silly to suppose that we may try to allot them\nseparate spheres, under the impression that their diverse natures will\nmaintain an attitude of tranquillity one to another and not break out in\ncontradiction and battle. Principles of civil freedom can be but abstract\nand superficial, and political institutions deduced from them must be, if\ntaken alone, untenable, so long as those principles in their wisdom\nmistake religion so much as not to know that the maxims of the reason in\nactuality have their last and supreme sanction in the religious conscience\nin subsumption under the consciousness of \u201cabsolute\u201d truth. Let us suppose\neven that, no matter how, a code of law should arise, so to speak _a\npriori_, founded on principles of reason, but in contradiction with an\nestablished religion based on principles of spiritual unfreedom; still, as\nthe duty of carrying out the laws lies in the hands of individual members\nof the government, and of the various classes of the administrative\n_personnel_, it is vain to delude ourselves with the abstract and empty\nassumption that the individuals will act only according to the letter or\nmeaning of the law, and not in the spirit of their religion where their\ninmost conscience and supreme obligation lies. Opposed to what religion\npronounces holy, the laws appear something made by human hands: even\nthough backed by penalties and externally introduced, they could offer no\nlasting resistance to the contradiction and attacks of the religious\nspirit. Such laws, however sound their provisions may be, thus founder on\nthe conscience, whose spirit is different from the spirit of the laws and\nrefuses to sanction them. It is nothing but a modern folly to try to alter\na corrupt moral organisation by altering its political constitution and\ncode of laws without changing the religion,\u2014to make a revolution without\nhaving made a reformation, to suppose that a political constitution\nopposed to the old religion could live in peace and harmony with it and\nits sanctities, and that stability could be procured for the laws by\nexternal guarantees, e.g. so-called \u201cchambers,\u201d and the power given them\nto fix the budget, &c. (cf. \u00a7 544 note). At best it is only a temporary\nexpedient\u2014when it is obviously too great a task to descend into the depths\nof the religious spirit and to raise that same spirit to its truth\u2014to seek\nto separate law and justice from religion. Those guarantees are but rotten\nbulwarks against the consciences of the persons charged with administering\nthe laws\u2014among which laws these guarantees are included. It is indeed the\nheight and profanity of contradiction to seek to bind and subject to the\nsecular code the religious conscience to which mere human law is a thing\nprofane.\nThe perception had dawned upon Plato with great clearness of the gulf\nwhich in his day had commenced to divide the established religion and the\npolitical constitution, on one hand, from those deeper requirements which,\non the other hand, were made upon religion and politics by liberty which\nhad learnt to recognise its inner life. Plato gets hold of the thought\nthat a genuine constitution and a sound political life have their deeper\nfoundation on the Idea,\u2014on the essentially and actually universal and\ngenuine principles of eternal righteousness. Now to see and ascertain what\nthese are is certainly the function and the business of _philosophy_. It\nis from this point of view that Plato breaks out into the celebrated or\nnotorious passage where he makes Socrates emphatically state that\nphilosophy and political power must coincide, that the Idea must be\nregent, if the distress of nations is to see its end. What Plato thus\ndefinitely set before his mind was that the Idea\u2014which implicitly indeed\nis the free self-determining thought\u2014could not get into consciousness save\nonly in the form of a thought; that the substance of the thought could\nonly be true when set forth as a universal, and as such brought to\nconsciousness under its most abstract form.\nTo compare the Platonic standpoint in all its definiteness with the point\nof view from which the relationship of state and religion is here\nregarded, the notional differences on which everything turns must be\nrecalled to mind. The first of these is that in natural things their\nsubstance or genus is different from their existence in which that\nsubstance is as subject: further that this subjective existence of the\ngenus is distinct from that which it gets, when specially set in relief as\ngenus, or, to put it simply, as the universal in a mental concept or idea.\nThis additional \u201cindividuality\u201d\u2014the soil on which the universal and\nunderlying principle _freely_ and expressly exists,\u2014is the intellectual\nand thinking _self_. In the case of _natural_ things their truth and\nreality does not get the form of universality and essentiality through\nthemselves, and their \u201cindividuality\u201d is not itself the form: the form is\nonly found in subjective thinking, which in philosophy gives that\nuniversal truth and reality an existence of its own. In man\u2019s case it is\notherwise: his truth and reality is the free mind itself, and it comes to\nexistence in his self-consciousness. This absolute nucleus of man\u2014mind\nintrinsically concrete\u2014is just this\u2014to have the form (to have thinking)\nitself for a content. To the height of the thinking consciousness of this\nprinciple Aristotle ascended in his notion of the entelechy of thought,\n(which is \u03bd\u03bf\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2), thus surmounting the Platonic Idea (the\ngenus, or essential being). But thought always\u2014and that on account of this\nvery principle\u2014contains the immediate self-subsistence of subjectivity no\nless than it contains universality; the genuine Idea of the intrinsically\nconcrete mind is just as essentially under the one of its terms\n(subjective consciousness) as under the other (universality): and in the\none as in the other it is the same substantial content. Under the\nsubjective form, however, fall feeling, intuition, pictorial\nrepresentation: and it is in fact necessary that in point of time the\nconsciousness of the absolute Idea should be first reached and apprehended\nin this form: in other words, it must exist in its immediate reality as\nreligion, earlier than it does as philosophy. Philosophy is a later\ndevelopment from this basis (just as Greek philosophy itself is later than\nGreek religion), and in fact reaches its completion by catching and\ncomprehending in all its definite essentiality that principle of spirit\nwhich first manifests itself in religion. But Greek philosophy could set\nitself up only in opposition to Greek religion: the unity of thought and\nthe substantiality of the Idea could take up none but a hostile attitude\nto an imaginative polytheism, and to the gladsome and frivolous humours of\nits poetic creations. The _form_ in its infinite truth, the _subjectivity_\nof mind, broke forth at first only as a subjective free _thinking_, which\nwas not yet identical with the _substantiality_ itself,\u2014and thus this\nunderlying principle was not yet apprehended as _absolute mind_. Thus\nreligion might appear as first purified only through philosophy,\u2014through\npure self-existent thought: but the form pervading this underlying\nprinciple\u2014the form which philosophy attacked\u2014was that creative\nimagination.\nPolitical power, which is developed similarly, but earlier than\nphilosophy, from religion, exhibits the onesidedness, which in the actual\nworld may infect its _implicitly_ true Idea, as demoralisation. Plato, in\ncommon with all his thinking contemporaries, perceived this demoralisation\nof democracy and the defectiveness even of its principle; he set in relief\naccordingly the underlying principle of the state, but could not work into\nhis idea of it the infinite form of subjectivity, which still escaped his\nintelligence. His state is therefore, on its own showing, wanting in\nsubjective liberty (\u00a7 503 note, \u00a7 513, &c.). The truth which should be\nimmanent in the state, should knit it together and control it, he, for\nthese reasons, got hold of only the form of thought-out truth, of\nphilosophy; and hence he makes that utterance that \u201cso long as\nphilosophers do not rule in the states, or those who are now called kings\nand rulers do not soundly and comprehensively philosophise, so long\nneither the state nor the race of men can be liberated from evils,\u2014so long\nwill the idea of the political constitution fall short of possibility and\nnot see the light of the sun.\u201d It was not vouchsafed to Plato to go on so\nfar as to say that so long as true religion did not spring up in the world\nand hold sway in political life, so long the genuine principle of the\nstate had not come into actuality. But so long too this principle could\nnot emerge even in thought, nor could thought lay hold of the genuine idea\nof the state,\u2014the idea of the substantial moral life, with which is\nidentical the liberty of an independent self-consciousness. Only in the\nprinciple of mind, which is aware of its own essence, is implicitly in\nabsolute liberty, and has its actuality in the act of self-liberation,\ndoes the absolute possibility and necessity exist for political power,\nreligion, and the principles of philosophy coinciding in one, and for\naccomplishing the reconciliation of actuality in general with the mind, of\nthe state with the religious conscience as well as with the philosophical\nconsciousness. Self-realising subjectivity is in this case absolutely\nidentical with substantial universality. Hence religion as such, and the\nstate as such,\u2014both as forms in which the principle exists\u2014each contain\nthe absolute truth: so that the truth, in its philosophic phase, is after\nall only in one of its forms. But even religion, as it grows and expands,\nlets other aspects of the Idea of humanity grow and expand also (\u00a7 500\nsqq.). As it is left therefore behind, in its first immediate, and so also\none-sided phase, Religion may, or rather _must_, appear in its existence\ndegraded to sensuous externality, and thus in the sequel become an\ninfluence to oppress liberty of spirit and to deprave political life.\nStill the principle has in it the infinite \u201celasticity\u201d of the \u201cabsolute\u201d\nform, so as to overcome this depraving of the form-determination (and of\nthe content by these means), and to bring about the reconciliation of the\nspirit in itself. Thus ultimately, in the Protestant conscience the\nprinciples of the religious and of the ethical conscience come to be one\nand the same: the free spirit learning to see itself in its reasonableness\nand truth. In the Protestant state, the constitution and the code, as well\nas their several applications, embody the principle and the development of\nthe moral life, which proceeds and can only proceed from the truth of\nreligion, when reinstated in its original principle and in that way as\nsuch first become actual. The moral life of the state and the religious\nspirituality of the state are thus reciprocal guarantees of strength.\nSECTION III. ABSOLUTE MIND(171).\n\u00a7 553. The _notion_ of mind has its _reality_ in the mind. If this reality\nin identity with that notion is to exist as the consciousness of the\nabsolute Idea, then the necessary aspect is that the _implicitly_ free\nintelligence be in its actuality liberated to its notion, if that\nactuality is to be a vehicle worthy of it. The subjective and the\nobjective spirit are to be looked on as the road on which this aspect of\n_reality_ or existence rises to maturity.\n\u00a7 554. The absolute mind, while it is self-centred _identity_, is always\nalso identity returning and ever returned into itself: if it is the one\nand universal _substance_ it is so as a spirit, discerning itself into a\nself and a consciousness, for which it is as substance. _Religion_, as\nthis supreme sphere may be in general designated, if it has on one hand to\nbe studied as issuing from the subject and having its home in the subject,\nmust no less be regarded as objectively issuing from the absolute spirit\nwhich as spirit is in its community.\nThat here, as always, belief or faith is not opposite to consciousness or\nknowledge, but rather to a sort of knowledge, and that belief is only a\nparticular form of the latter, has been remarked already (\u00a7 63 note). If\nnowadays there is so little consciousness of God, and his objective\nessence is so little dwelt upon, while people speak so much more of the\nsubjective side of religion, i.e. of God\u2019s indwelling in us, and if that\nand not the truth as such is called for,\u2014in this there is at least the\ncorrect principle that God must be apprehended as spirit in his community.\n\u00a7 555. The subjective consciousness of the absolute spirit is essentially\nand intrinsically a process, the immediate and substantial unity of which\nis the _Belief_ in the witness of the spirit as the _certainty_ of\nobjective truth. Belief, at once this immediate unity and containing it as\na reciprocal dependence of these different terms, has in _devotion_\u2014the\nimplicit or more explicit act of worship (_cultus_)\u2014passed over into the\nprocess of superseding the contrast till it becomes spiritual liberation,\nthe process of authenticating that first certainty by this intermediation,\nand of gaining its concrete determination, viz. reconciliation, the\nactuality of the spirit.\nSub-Section A. Art.\n\u00a7 556. As this consciousness of the Absolute first takes shape, its\nimmediacy produces the factor of finitude in Art. On one hand that is, it\nbreaks up into a work of external common existence, into the subject which\nproduces that work, and the subject which contemplates and worships it.\nBut, on the other hand, it is the concrete _contemplation_ and mental\npicture of implicitly absolute spirit as the _Ideal_. In this ideal, or\nthe concrete shape born of the subjective spirit, its natural immediacy,\nwhich is only a _sign_ of the Idea, is so transfigured by the informing\nspirit in order to express the Idea, that the figure shows it and it\nalone:\u2014the shape or form of _Beauty_.\n\u00a7 557. The sensuous externality attaching to the beautiful,\u2014the _form of\nimmediacy_ as such,\u2014at the same time _qualifies_ what it _embodies_: and\nthe God (of art) has with his spirituality at the same time the stamp upon\nhim of a natural medium or natural phase of existence\u2014He contains the\nso-called _unity_ of nature and spirit\u2014i.e. the immediate unity in\nsensuously intuitional form\u2014hence not the spiritual unity, in which the\nnatural would be put only as \u201cideal,\u201d as superseded in spirit, and the\nspiritual content would be only in self-relation. It is not the absolute\nspirit which enters this consciousness. On the subjective side the\ncommunity has of course an ethical life, aware, as it is, of the\nspirituality of its essence: and its self-consciousness and actuality are\nin it elevated to substantial liberty. But with the stigma of immediacy\nupon it, the subject\u2019s liberty is only a _manner of life_, without the\ninfinite self-reflection and the subjective inwardness of _conscience_.\nThese considerations govern in their further developments the devotion and\nthe worship in the religion of fine art.\n\u00a7 558. For the objects of contemplation it has to produce, Art requires\nnot only an external given material\u2014(under which are also included\nsubjective images and ideas), but\u2014for the expression of spiritual\ntruth\u2014must use the given forms of nature with a significance which art\nmust divine and possess (cf. \u00a7 411). Of all such forms the human is the\nhighest and the true, because only in it can the spirit have its\ncorporeity and thus its visible expression.\nThis disposes of the principle of the _imitation of nature_ in art: a\npoint on which it is impossible to come to an understanding while a\ndistinction is left thus abstract,\u2014in other words, so long as the natural\nis only taken in its externality, not as the \u201ccharacteristic\u201d meaningful\nnature-form which is significant of spirit.\n\u00a7 559. In such single shapes the \u201cabsolute\u201d mind cannot be made explicit:\nin and to art therefore the spirit is a limited natural spirit whose\nimplicit universality, when steps are taken to specify its fullness in\ndetail, breaks up into an indeterminate polytheism. With the essential\nrestrictedness of its content, Beauty in general goes no further than a\npenetration of the vision or image by the spiritual principle,\u2014something\nformal, so that the thought embodied, or the idea, can, like the material\nwhich it uses to work in, be of the most diverse and unessential kind, and\nstill the work be something beautiful and a work of art.\n\u00a7 560. The one-sidedness of _immediacy_ on the part of the Ideal involves\nthe opposite one-sidedness (\u00a7 556) that it is something _made_ by the\nartist. The subject or agent is the mere technical activity: and the work\nof art is only then an expression of the God, when there is no sign of\nsubjective particularity in it, and the net power of the indwelling spirit\nis conceived and born into the world, without admixture and unspotted from\nits contingency. But as liberty only goes as far as there is thought, the\naction inspired with the fullness of this indwelling power, the artist\u2019s\n_enthusiasm_, is like a foreign force under which he is bound and passive;\nthe artistic _production_ has on its part the form of natural immediacy,\nit belongs to the _genius_ or particular endowment of the artist,\u2014and is\nat the same time a labour concerned with technical cleverness and\nmechanical externalities. The work of art therefore is just as much a work\ndue to free option, and the artist is the master of the God.\n\u00a7 561. In work so inspired the reconciliation appears so obvious in its\ninitial stage that it is without more ado accomplished in the subjective\nself-consciousness, which is thus self-confident and of good cheer,\nwithout the depth and without the sense of its antithesis to the absolute\nessence. On the further side of the perfection (which is reached in such\nreconciliation, in the beauty of _classical art_) lies the art of\nsublimity,\u2014_symbolic art_, in which the figuration suitable to the Idea is\nnot yet found, and the thought as going forth and wrestling with the\nfigure is exhibited as a negative attitude to it, and yet all the while\ntoiling to work itself into it. The meaning or theme thus shows it has not\nyet reached the infinite form, is not yet known, not yet conscious of\nitself, as free spirit. The artist\u2019s theme only is as the abstract God of\npure thought, or an effort towards him,\u2014a restless and unappeased effort\nwhich throws itself into shape after shape as it vainly tries to find its\ngoal.\n\u00a7 562. In another way the Idea and the sensuous figure it appears in are\nincompatible; and that is where the infinite form, subjectivity, is not as\nin the first extreme a mere superficial personality, but its inmost depth,\nand God is known not as only seeking his form or satisfying himself in an\nexternal form, but as only finding himself in himself, and thus giving\nhimself his adequate figure in the spiritual world alone. _Romantic art_\ngives up the task of showing him as such in external form and by means of\nbeauty: it presents him as only condescending to appearance, and the\ndivine as the heart of hearts in an externality from which it always\ndisengages itself. Thus the external can here appear as contingent towards\nits significance.\nThe Philosophy of Religion has to discover the logical necessity in the\nprogress by which the Being, known as the Absolute, assumes fuller and\nfirmer features; it has to note to what particular feature the kind of\ncultus corresponds,\u2014and then to see how the secular self-consciousness,\nthe consciousness of what is the supreme vocation of man,\u2014in short how the\nnature of a nation\u2019s moral life, the principle of its law, of its actual\nliberty, and of its constitution, as well as of its art and science,\ncorresponds to the principle which constitutes the substance of a\nreligion. That all these elements of a nation\u2019s actuality constitute one\nsystematic totality, that one spirit creates and informs them, is a truth\non which follows the further truth that the history of religions coincides\nwith the world-history.\nAs regards the close connexion of art with the various religions it may be\nspecially noted that _beautiful_ art can only belong to those religions in\nwhich the spiritual principle, though concrete and intrinsically free, is\nnot yet absolute. In religions where the Idea has not yet been revealed\nand known in its free character, though the craving for art is felt in\norder to bring in imaginative visibility to consciousness the idea of the\nsupreme being, and though art is the sole organ in which the abstract and\nradically indistinct content,\u2014a mixture from natural and spiritual\nsources,\u2014can try to bring itself to consciousness;\u2014still this art is\ndefective; its form is defective because its subject-matter and theme is\nso,\u2014for the defect in subject-matter comes from the form not being\nimmanent in it. The representations of this symbolic art keep a certain\ntastelessness and stolidity\u2014for the principle it embodies is itself stolid\nand dull, and hence has not the power freely to transmute the external to\nsignificance and shape. Beautiful art, on the contrary, has for its\ncondition the self-consciousness of the free spirit,\u2014the consciousness\nthat compared with it the natural and sensuous has no standing of its own:\nit makes the natural wholly into the mere expression of spirit, which is\nthus the inner form that gives utterance to itself alone.\nBut with a further and deeper study, we see that the advent of art, in a\nreligion still in the bonds of sensuous externality, shows that such\nreligion is on the decline. At the very time it seems to give religion the\nsupreme glorification, expression and brilliancy, it has lifted the\nreligion away over its limitation. In the sublime divinity to which the\nwork of art succeeds in giving expression the artistic genius and the\nspectator find themselves at home, with their personal sense and feeling,\nsatisfied and liberated: to them the vision and the consciousness of free\nspirit has been vouchsafed and attained. Beautiful art, from its side, has\nthus performed the same service as philosophy: it has purified the spirit\nfrom its thraldom. The older religion in which the need of fine art, and\njust for that reason, is first generated, looks up in its principle to an\nother-world which is sensuous and unmeaning: the images adored by its\ndevotees are hideous idols regarded as wonder-working talismans, which\npoint to the unspiritual objectivity of that other world,\u2014and bones\nperform a similar or even a better service than such images. But even fine\nart is only a grade of liberation, not the supreme liberation itself.\u2014The\ngenuine objectivity, which is only in the medium of thought,\u2014the medium in\nwhich alone the pure spirit is for the spirit, and where the liberation is\naccompanied with reverence,\u2014is still absent in the sensuous beauty of the\nwork of art, still more in that external, unbeautiful sensuousness.\n\u00a7 563. Beautiful Art, like the religion peculiar to it, has its future in\ntrue religion. The restricted value of the Idea passes utterly and\nnaturally into the universality identical with the infinite form;\u2014the\nvision in which consciousness has to depend upon the senses passes into a\nself-mediating knowledge, into an existence which is itself\nknowledge,\u2014into _revelation_. Thus the principle which gives the Idea its\ncontent is that it embody free intelligence, and as \u201cabsolute\u201d _spirit it\nis for the spirit_.\nSub-Section B. Revealed Religion(172).\n\u00a7 564. It lies essentially in the notion of religion,\u2014the religion i.e.\nwhose content is absolute mind\u2014that it be _revealed_, and, what is more,\nrevealed _by God_. Knowledge (the principle by which the substance is\nmind) is a self-determining principle, as infinite self-realising form,\u2014it\ntherefore is manifestation out and out. The spirit is only spirit in so\nfar as it is for the spirit, and in the absolute religion it is the\nabsolute spirit which manifests no longer abstract elements of its being\nbut itself.\nThe old conception\u2014due to a one-sided survey of human life\u2014of Nemesis,\nwhich made the divinity and its action in the world only a levelling\npower, dashing to pieces everything high and great,\u2014was confronted by\nPlato and Aristotle with the doctrine that God is not _envious_. The same\nanswer may be given to the modern assertions that man cannot ascertain\nGod. These assertions (and more than assertions they are not) are the more\nillogical, because made within a religion which is expressly called the\nrevealed; for according to them it would rather be the religion in which\nnothing of God was revealed, in which he had not revealed himself, and\nthose belonging to it would be the heathen \u201cwho know not God.\u201d If the word\nof God is taken in earnest in religion at all, it is from Him, the theme\nand centre of religion, that the method of divine knowledge may and must\nbegin: and if self-revelation is refused Him, then the only thing left to\nconstitute His nature would be to ascribe envy to Him. But clearly if the\nword Mind is to have a meaning, it implies the revelation of Him.\nIf we recollect how intricate is the knowledge of the divine Mind for\nthose who are not content with the homely pictures of faith but proceed to\nthought,\u2014at first only \u201crationalising\u201d reflection, but afterwards, as in\nduty bound, to speculative comprehension, it may almost create surprise\nthat so many, and especially theologians whose vocation it is to deal with\nthese Ideas, have tried to get off their task by gladly accepting anything\noffered them for this behoof. And nothing serves better to shirk it than\nto adopt the conclusion that man knows nothing of God. To know what God as\nspirit is\u2014to apprehend this accurately and distinctly in thoughts\u2014requires\ncareful and thorough speculation. It includes, in its fore-front, the\npropositions: God is God only so far as he knows himself: his\nself-knowledge is, further, his self-consciousness in man, and man\u2019s\nknowledge _of_ God, which proceeds to man\u2019s self-knowledge in God.\u2014See the\nprofound elucidation of these propositions in the work from which they are\ntaken: _Aphorisms on Knowing and Not-knowing, &c._, by C. F. G\u2014l.: Berlin\n1829.\n\u00a7 565. When the immediacy and sensuousness of shape and knowledge is\nsuperseded, God is, in point of content, the essential and actual spirit\nof nature and spirit, while in point of form he is, first of all,\npresented to consciousness as a mental representation. This\nquasi-pictorial representation gives to the elements of his content, on\none hand, a separate being, making them presuppositions towards each\nother, and phenomena which succeed each other; their relationship it makes\na series of events according to finite reflective categories. But, on the\nother hand, such a form of finite representationalism is also overcome and\nsuperseded in the faith which realises one spirit and in the devotion of\nworship.\n\u00a7 566. In this separating, the form parts from the content: and in the\nform the different functions of the notion part off into special spheres\nor media, in each of which the absolute spirit exhibits itself; (\u03b1) as\neternal content, abiding self-centred, even in its manifestation; (\u03b2) as\ndistinction of the eternal essence from its manifestation, which by this\ndifference becomes the phenomenal world into which the content enters; (\u03b3)\nas infinite return, and reconciliation with the eternal being, of the\nworld it gave away\u2014the withdrawal of the eternal from the phenomenal into\nthe unity of its fullness.\n\u00a7 567. (\u03b1) Under the \u201cmoment\u201d of _Universality_,\u2014the sphere of pure\nthought or the abstract medium of essence,\u2014it is therefore the absolute\nspirit, which is at first the presupposed principle, not however staying\naloof and inert, but (as underlying and essential power under the\nreflective category of causality) creator of heaven and earth: but yet in\nthis eternal sphere rather only begetting himself as his _son_, with whom,\nthough different, he still remains in original identity,\u2014just as, again,\nthis differentiation of him from the universal essence eternally\nsupersedes itself, and, though this mediating of a self-superseding\nmediation, the first substance is essentially as _concrete individuality_\nand subjectivity,\u2014is the _Spirit_.\n\u00a7 568. (\u03b2) Under the \u201cmoment\u201d of _particularity_, or of judgment, it is\nthis concrete eternal being which is presupposed: its movement is the\ncreation of the phenomenal world. The eternal \u201cmoment\u201d of mediation\u2014of the\nonly Son\u2014divides itself to become the antithesis of two separate worlds.\nOn one hand is heaven and earth, the elemental and the concrete nature,\u2014on\nthe other hand, standing in action and reaction with such nature, the\nspirit, which therefore is finite. That spirit, as the extreme of inherent\nnegativity, completes its independence till it becomes wickedness, and is\nthat extreme through its connexion with a confronting nature and through\nits own naturalness thereby investing it. Yet, amid that naturalness, it\nis, when it thinks, directed towards the Eternal, though, for that reason,\nonly standing to it in an external connexion.\n\u00a7 569. (\u03b3) Under the \u201cmoment\u201d of _individuality_ as such,\u2014of subjectivity\nand the notion itself, in which the contrast of universal and particular\nhas sunk to its identical ground, the place of presupposition (1) is taken\nby the _universal_ substance, as actualised out of its abstraction into an\n_individual_ self-consciousness. This individual, who as such is\nidentified with the essence,\u2014(in the Eternal sphere he is called the\nSon)\u2014is transplanted into the world of time, and in him wickedness is\nimplicitly overcome. Further, this immediate, and thus sensuous, existence\nof the absolutely concrete is represented as putting himself in judgment\nand expiring in the pain of _negativity_, in which he, as infinite\nsubjectivity, keeps himself unchanged, and thus, as absolute return from\nthat negativity and as universal unity of universal and individual\nessentiality, has realised his being as the Idea of the spirit, eternal,\nbut alive and present in the world.\n\u00a7 570. (2) This objective totality of the divine man who is the Idea of\nthe spirit is the implicit presupposition for the _finite_ immediacy of\nthe single subject. For such subject therefore it is at first an Other, an\nobject of contemplating vision,\u2014but the vision of implicit truth, through\nwhich witness of the spirit in him, he, on account of his immediate\nnature, at first characterised himself as nought and wicked. But,\nsecondly, after the example of his truth, by means of the faith on the\nunity (in that example implicitly accomplished) of universal and\nindividual essence, he is also the movement to throw off his immediacy,\nhis natural man and self-will, to close himself in unity with that example\n(who is his implicit life) in the pain of negativity, and thus to know\nhimself made one with the essential Being. Thus the Being of Beings (3)\nthrough this mediation brings about its own indwelling in\nself-consciousness, and is the actual presence of the essential and\nself-subsisting spirit who is all in all.\n\u00a7 571. These three syllogisms, constituting the one syllogism of the\nabsolute self-mediation of spirit, are the revelation of that spirit whose\nlife is set out as a cycle of concrete shapes in pictorial thought. From\nthis its separation into parts, with a temporal and external sequence, the\nunfolding of the mediation contracts itself in the result,\u2014where the\nspirit closes in unity with itself,\u2014not merely to the simplicity of faith\nand devotional feeling, but even to thought. In the immanent simplicity of\nthought the unfolding still has its expansion, yet is all the while known\nas an indivisible coherence of the universal, simple, and eternal spirit\nin itself. In this form of truth, truth is the object of _philosophy_.\nIf the result\u2014the realised Spirit in which all meditation has superseded\nitself\u2014is taken in a merely formal, contentless sense, so that the spirit\nis not also at the same time known as _implicitly_ existent and\nobjectively self-unfolding;\u2014then that infinite subjectivity is the merely\nformal self-consciousness, knowing itself in itself as absolute,\u2014Irony.\nIrony, which can make every objective reality nought and vain, is itself\nthe emptiness and vanity, which from itself, and therefore by chance and\nits own good pleasure, gives itself direction and content, remains master\nover it, is not bound by it,\u2014and, with the assertion that it stands on the\nvery summit of religion and philosophy, falls rather back into the vanity\nof wilfulness. It is only in proportion as the pure infinite form, the\nself-centred manifestation, throws off the one-sidedness of subjectivity\nin which it is the vanity of thought, that it is the free thought which\nhas its infinite characteristic at the same time as essential and actual\ncontent, and has that content as an object in which it is also free.\nThinking, so far, is only the formal aspect of the absolute content.\nSub-Section C. Philosophy.\n\u00a7 572. This science is the unity of Art and Religion. Whereas the\nvision-method of Art, external in point of form, is but subjective\nproduction and shivers the substantial content into many separate shapes,\nand whereas Religion, with its separation into parts, opens it out in\nmental picture, and mediates what is thus opened out; Philosophy not\nmerely keeps them together to make a total, but even unifies them into the\nsimple spiritual vision, and then in that raises them to self-conscious\nthought. Such consciousness is thus the intelligible unity (cognised by\nthought) of art and religion, in which the diverse elements in the content\nare cognised as necessary, and this necessary as free.\n\u00a7 573. Philosophy thus characterises itself as a cognition of the\nnecessity in the content of the absolute picture-idea, as also of the\nnecessity in the two forms\u2014on one hand, immediate vision and its poetry,\nand the objective and external revelation presupposed by\nrepresentation,\u2014on the other hand, first the subjective retreat inwards,\nthen the subjective movement of faith and its final identification with\nthe presupposed object. This cognition is thus the _recognition_ of this\ncontent and its form; it is the liberation from the one-sidedness of the\nforms, elevation of them into the absolute form, which determines itself\nto content, remains identical with it, and is in that the cognition of\nthat essential and actual necessity. This movement, which philosophy is,\nfinds itself already accomplished, when at the close it seizes its own\nnotion,\u2014i.e. only _looks back_ on its knowledge.\nHere might seem to be the place to treat in a definite exposition of the\nreciprocal relations of philosophy and religion. The whole question turns\nentirely on the difference of the forms of speculative thought from the\nforms of mental representation and \u201creflecting\u201d intellect. But it is the\nwhole cycle of philosophy, and of logic in particular, which has not\nmerely taught and made known this difference, but also criticised it, or\nrather has let its nature develop and judge itself by these very\ncategories. It is only by an insight into the value of these forms that\nthe true and needful conviction can be gained, that the content of\nreligion and philosophy is the same,\u2014leaving out, of course, the further\ndetails of external nature and finite mind which fall outside the range of\nreligion. But religion is the truth _for all men_: faith rests on the\nwitness of the spirit, which as witnessing is the spirit in man. This\nwitness\u2014the underlying essence in all humanity\u2014takes, when driven to\nexpound itself, its first definite form under those acquired habits of\nthought which his secular consciousness and intellect otherwise employs.\nIn this way the truth becomes liable to the terms and conditions of\nfinitude in general. This does not prevent the spirit, even in employing\nsensuous ideas and finite categories of thought, from retaining its\ncontent (which as religion is essentially speculative,) with a tenacity\nwhich does violence to them, and acts _inconsistently_ towards them. By\nthis inconsistency it corrects their defects. Nothing easier therefore for\nthe \u201cRationalist\u201d than to point out contradictions in the exposition of\nthe faith, and then to prepare triumphs for its principle of formal\nidentity. If the spirit yields to this finite reflection, which has\nusurped the title of reason and philosophy\u2014(\u201cRationalism\u201d)\u2014it strips\nreligious truth of its infinity and makes it in reality nought. Religion\nin that case is completely in the right in guarding herself against such\nreason and philosophy and treating them as enemies. But it is another\nthing when religion sets herself against comprehending reason, and against\nphilosophy in general, and specially against a philosophy of which the\ndoctrine is speculative, and so religious. Such an opposition proceeds\nfrom failure to appreciate the difference indicated and the value of\nspiritual form in general, and particularly of the logical form; or, to be\nmore precise, still from failure to note the distinction of the\ncontent\u2014which may be in both the same\u2014from these forms. It is on the\nground of form that philosophy has been reproached and accused by the\nreligious party; just as conversely its speculative content has brought\nthe same charges upon it from a self-styled philosophy\u2014and from a pithless\northodoxy. It had too little of God in it for the former; too much for the\nlatter.\nThe charge of _Atheism_, which used often to be brought against philosophy\n(that it has _too little_ of God), has grown rare: the more wide-spread\ngrows the charge of Pantheism, that it has _too much_ of him:\u2014so much so,\nthat it is treated not so much as an imputation, but as a proved fact, or\na sheer fact which needs no proof. Piety, in particular, which with its\npious airs of superiority fancies itself free to dispense with proof, goes\nhand in hand with empty rationalism\u2014(which means to be so much opposed to\nit, though both repose really on the same habit of mind)\u2014in the wanton\nassertion, almost as if it merely mentioned a notorious fact, that\nPhilosophy is the All-one doctrine, or Pantheism. It must be said that it\nwas more to the credit of piety and theology when they accused a\nphilosophical system (e.g. Spinozism) of Atheism than of Pantheism, though\nthe former imputation at the first glance looks more cruel and insidious\n(cf. \u00a7 71 note). The imputation of Atheism presupposes a definite idea of\na full and real God, and arises because the popular idea does not detect\nin the philosophical notion the peculiar form to which it is attached.\nPhilosophy indeed can recognise its own forms in the categories of\nreligious consciousness, and even its own teaching in the doctrine of\nreligion\u2014which therefore it does not disparage. But the converse is not\ntrue: the religious consciousness does not apply the criticism of thought\nto itself, does not comprehend itself, and is therefore, as it stands,\nexclusive. To impute Pantheism instead of Atheism to Philosophy is part of\nthe modern habit of mind\u2014of the new piety and new theology. For them\nphilosophy has too much of God:\u2014so much so, that, if we believe them, it\nasserts that God is everything and everything is God. This new theology,\nwhich makes religion only a subjective feeling and denies the knowledge of\nthe divine nature, thus retains nothing more than a God in general without\nobjective characteristics. Without interest of its own for the concrete,\nfulfilled notion of God, it treats it only as an interest which _others_\nonce had, and hence treats what belongs to the doctrine of God\u2019s concrete\nnature as something merely historical. The indeterminate God is to be\nfound in all religions; every kind of piety (\u00a7 72)\u2014that of the Hindoo to\nasses, cows,\u2014or to dalai-lamas,\u2014that of the Egyptians to the ox\u2014is always\nadoration of an object which, with all its absurdities, also contains the\ngeneric abstract, God in General. If this theory needs no more than such a\nGod, so as to find God in everything called religion, it must at least\nfind such a God recognised even in philosophy, and can no longer accuse it\nof Atheism. The mitigation of the reproach of Atheism into that of\nPantheism has its ground therefore in the superficial idea to which this\nmildness has attenuated and emptied God. As that popular idea clings to\nits abstract universality, from which all definite quality is excluded,\nall such definiteness is only the non-divine, the secularity of things,\nthus left standing in fixed undisturbed substantiality. On such a\npresupposition, even after philosophy has maintained God\u2019s absolute\nuniversality, and the consequent untruth of the being of external things,\nthe hearer clings as he did before to his belief that secular things still\nkeep their being, and form all that is definite in the divine\nuniversality. He thus changes that universality into what he calls the\npantheistic:\u2014_Everything is_\u2014(empirical things, without distinction,\nwhether higher or lower in the scale, _are_)\u2014all possess substantiality;\nand so\u2014thus he understands philosophy\u2014each and every secular thing is God.\nIt is only his own stupidity, and the falsifications due to such\nmisconception, which generate the imagination and the allegation of such\npantheism.\nBut if those who give out that a certain philosophy is Pantheism, are\nunable and unwilling to see this\u2014for it is just to see the notion that\nthey refuse\u2014they should before everything have verified the alleged fact\nthat _any one philosopher, or any one man_, had really ascribed\nsubstantial or objective and inherent reality to _all_ things and regarded\nthem as God:\u2014that such an idea had ever come into the hand of any body but\nthemselves. This allegation I will further elucidate in this exoteric\ndiscussion: and the only way to do so is to set down the evidence. If we\nwant to take so-called Pantheism in its most poetical, most sublime, or if\nyou will, its grossest shape, we must, as is well known, consult the\noriental poets: and the most copious delineations of it are found in\nHindoo literature. Amongst the abundant resources open to our disposal on\nthis topic, I select\u2014as the most authentic statement accessible\u2014the\nBhagavat-Gita, and amongst its effusions, prolix and reiterative _ad\nnauseam_, some of the most telling passages. In the 10th Lesson (in\nSchlegel, p. 162) Krishna says of himself(173):\u2014\u201cI am the self, seated in\nthe hearts of all beings. I am the beginning and the middle and the end\nalso of all beings ... I am the beaming sun amongst the shining ones, and\nthe moon among the lunar mansions.... Amongst the Vedas I am the\nS\u00e2ma-Veda: I am mind amongst the senses: I am consciousness in living\nbeings. And I am Sankara (Siva) among the Rudras, ... Meru among the\nhigh-topped mountains, ... the Himalaya among the firmly-fixed\n(mountains).... Among beasts I am the lord of beasts.... Among letters I\nam the letter A.... I am the spring among the seasons.... I am also that\nwhich is the seed of all things: there is nothing moveable or immoveable\nwhich can exist without me.\u201d\nEven in these totally sensuous delineations, Krishna (and we must not\nsuppose there is, besides Krishna, still God, or a God besides; as he said\nbefore he was Siva, or Indra, so it is afterwards said that Brahma too is\nin him) makes himself out to be\u2014not everything, but only\u2014the most\nexcellent of everything. Everywhere there is a distinction drawn between\nexternal, unessential existences, and one essential amongst them, which he\nis. Even when, at the beginning of the passage, he is said to be the\nbeginning, middle, and end of living things, this totality is\ndistinguished from the living things themselves as single existences. Even\nsuch a picture which extends deity far and wide in its existence cannot be\ncalled pantheism: we must rather say that in the infinitely multiple\nempirical world, everything is reduced to a limited number of essential\nexistences, to a polytheism. But even what has been quoted shows that\nthese very substantialities of the externally-existent do not retain the\nindependence entitling them to be named Gods; even Siva, Indra, &c. melt\ninto the one Krishna.\nThis reduction is more expressly made in the following scene (7th Lesson,\np. 7 sqq.). Krishna says: \u201cI am the producer and the destroyer of the\nwhole universe. There is nothing else higher than myself; all this is\nwoven upon me, like numbers of pearls upon a thread. I am the taste in\nwater;... I am the light of the sun and the moon; I am \u2018Om\u2019 in all the\nVedas.... I am life in all beings.... I am the discernment of the\ndiscerning ones.... I am also the strength of the strong.\u201d Then he adds:\n\u201cThe whole universe deluded by these three states of mind developed from\nthe qualities [sc. goodness, passion, darkness] does not know me who am\nbeyond them and inexhaustible: for this delusion of mine,\u201d [even the Maya\nis _his_, nothing independent], \u201cdeveloped from the qualities is divine\nand difficult to transcend. Those cross beyond this delusion who resort to\nme alone.\u201d Then the picture gathers itself up in a simple expression: \u201cAt\nthe end of many lives, the man possessed of knowledge approaches me,\n(believing) that Vasudeva is everything. Such a high-souled mind is very\nhard to find. Those who are deprived of knowledge by various desires\napproach other divinities... Whichever form of deity one worships with\nfaith, from it he obtains the beneficial things he desires really given by\nme. But the fruit thus obtained by those of little judgment is\nperishable.... The undiscerning ones, not knowing my transcendent and\ninexhaustible essence, than which there is nothing higher, think me who am\nunperceived to have become perceptible.\u201d\nThis \u201cAll,\u201d which Krishna calls himself, is not, any more than the Eleatic\nOne, and the Spinozan Substance, the Every-thing. This every-thing,\nrather, the infinitely-manifold sensuous manifold of the finite is in all\nthese pictures, but defined as the \u201caccidental,\u201d without essential being\nof its very own, but having its truth in the substance, the One which, as\ndifferent from that accidental, is alone the divine and God. Hindooism\nhowever has the higher conception of Brahma, the pure unity of thought in\nitself, where the empirical everything of the world, as also those\nproximate substantialities, called Gods, vanish. On that account\nColebrooke and many others have described the Hindoo religion as at bottom\na Monotheism. That this description is not incorrect is clear from these\nshort citations. But so little concrete is this divine unity\u2014spiritual as\nits idea of God is\u2014so powerless its grip, so to speak\u2014that Hindooism, with\na monstrous inconsistency, is also the maddest of polytheisms. But the\nidolatry of the wretched Hindoo, when he adores the ape, or other\ncreature, is still a long way from that wretched fancy of a Pantheism, to\nwhich everything is God, and God everything. Hindoo monotheism moreover is\nitself an example how little comes of mere monotheism, if the Idea of God\nis not deeply determinate in itself. For that unity, if it be\nintrinsically abstract and therefore empty, tends of itself to let\nwhatever is concrete, outside it\u2014be it as a lot of Gods or as secular,\nempirical individuals\u2014keep its independence. That pantheism indeed\u2014on the\nshallow conception of it\u2014might with a show of logic as well be called a\nmonotheism: for if God, as it says, is identical with the world, then as\nthere is only one world there would be in that pantheism only one God.\nPerhaps the empty numerical unity must be predicated of the world: but\nsuch abstract predication of it has no further special interest; on the\ncontrary, a mere numerical unity just means that its _content_ is an\ninfinite multeity and variety of finitudes. But it is that delusion with\nthe empty unity, which alone makes possible and induces the wrong idea of\npantheism. It is only the picture\u2014floating in the indefinite blue\u2014of the\nworld as _one thing_, _the all_, that could ever be considered capable of\ncombining with God: only on that assumption could philosophy be supposed\nto teach that God is the world: for if the world were taken as it is, as\neverything, as the endless lot of empirical existence, then it would\nhardly have been even held possible to suppose a pantheism which asserted\nof such stuff that it is God.\nBut to go back again to the question of fact. If we want to see the\nconsciousness of the One\u2014not as with the Hindoos split between the\nfeatureless unity of abstract thought, on one hand, and on the other, the\nlong-winded weary story of its particular detail, but\u2014in its finest purity\nand sublimity, we must consult the Mohammedans. If e.g. in the excellent\nJelaleddin-Rumi in particular, we find the unity of the soul with the One\nset forth, and that unity described as love, this spiritual unity is an\nexaltation above the finite and vulgar, a transfiguration of the natural\nand the spiritual, in which the externalism and transitoriness of\nimmediate nature, and of empirical secular spirit, is discarded and\nabsorbed(174).\nI refrain from accumulating further examples of the religious and poetic\nconceptions which it is customary to call pantheistic. Of the philosophies\nto which that name is given, the Eleatic, or Spinozist, it has been\nremarked earlier (\u00a7 50, note) that so far are they from identifying God\nwith the world and making him finite, that in these systems this\n\u201ceverything\u201d has no truth, and that we should rather call them\nmonotheistic, or, in relation to the popular idea of the world, acosmical.\nThey are most accurately called systems which apprehend the Absolute only\nas substance. Of the oriental, especially the Mohammedan, modes of\nenvisaging God, we may rather say that they represent the Absolute as the\nutterly universal genus which dwells in the species or existences, but\ndwells so potently that these existences have no actual reality. The fault\nof all these modes of thought and systems is that they stop short of\ndefining substance as subject and as mind.\nThese systems and modes of pictorial conception originate from the one\nneed common to all philosophies and all religions of getting an idea of\nGod, and, secondly, of the relationship of God and the world. (In\nphilosophy it is specially made out that the determination of God\u2019s nature\ndetermines his relations with the world.) The \u201creflective\u201d understanding\nbegins by rejecting all systems and modes of conception, which, whether\nthey spring from heart, imagination or speculation, express the\ninterconnexion of God and the world: and in order to have God pure in\nfaith or consciousness, he is as essence parted from appearance, as\ninfinite from the finite. But, after this partition, the conviction arises\nalso that the appearance has a relation to the essence, the finite to the\ninfinite, and so on: and thus arises the question of reflection as to the\nnature of this relation. It is in the reflective form that the whole\ndifficulty of the affair lies, and that causes this relation to be called\nincomprehensible by the agnostic. The close of philosophy is not the\nplace, even in a general exoteric discussion, to waste a word on what a\n\u201cnotion\u201d means. But as the view taken of this relation is closely\nconnected with the view taken of philosophy generally and with all\nimputations against it, we may still add the remark that though philosophy\ncertainly has to do with unity in general, it is not however with abstract\nunity, mere identity, and the empty absolute, but with concrete unity (the\nnotion), and that in its whole course it has to do with nothing else;\u2014that\neach step in its advance is a peculiar term or phase of this concrete\nunity, and that the deepest and last expression of unity is the unity of\nabsolute mind itself. Would-be judges and critics of philosophy might be\nrecommended to familiarise themselves with these phases of unity and to\ntake the trouble to get acquainted with them, at least to know so much\nthat of these terms there are a great many, and that amongst them there is\ngreat variety. But they show so little acquaintance with them\u2014and still\nless take trouble about it\u2014that, when they hear of unity\u2014and relation\n_ipso facto_ implies unity\u2014they rather stick fast at quite abstract\nindeterminate unity, and lose sight of the chief point of interest\u2014the\nspecial mode in which the unity is qualified. Hence all they can say about\nphilosophy is that dry identity is its principle and result, and that it\nis the system of identity. Sticking fast to the undigested thought of\nidentity, they have laid hands on, not the concrete unity, the notion and\ncontent of philosophy, but rather its reverse. In the philosophical field\nthey proceed, as in the physical field the physicist; who also is well\naware that he has before him a variety of sensuous properties and\nmatters\u2014or usually matters alone, (for the properties get transformed into\nmatters also for the physicist)\u2014and that these matters (elements) _also_\nstand in _relation_ to one another. But the question is, Of what kind is\nthis relation? Every peculiarity and the whole difference of natural\nthings, inorganic and living, depend solely on the different modes of this\nunity. But instead of ascertaining these different modes, the ordinary\nphysicist (chemist included) takes up only one, the most external and the\nworst, viz. _composition_, applies only it in the whole range of natural\nstructures, which he thus renders for ever inexplicable.\nThe aforesaid shallow pantheism is an equally obvious inference from this\nshallow identity. All that those who employ this invention of their own to\naccuse philosophy gather from the study of God\u2019s _relation_ to the world\nis that the one, but only the one factor of this category of relation\u2014and\nthat the factor of indeterminateness\u2014is identity. Thereupon they stick\nfast in this half-perception, and assert\u2014falsely as a fact\u2014that philosophy\nteaches the identity of God and the world. And as in their judgment either\nof the two,\u2014the world as much as God\u2014has the same solid substantiality as\nthe other, they infer that in the philosophic Idea God is _composed_ of\nGod and the world. Such then is the idea they form of pantheism, and which\nthey ascribe to philosophy. Unaccustomed in their own thinking and\napprehending of thoughts to go beyond such categories, they import them\ninto philosophy, where they are utterly unknown; they thus infect it with\nthe disease against which they subsequently raise an outcry. If any\ndifficulty emerge in comprehending God\u2019s relation to the world, they at\nonce and very easily escape it by admitting that this relation contains\nfor them an inexplicable contradiction; and that hence, they must stop at\nthe vague conception of such relation, perhaps under the more familiar\nnames of, e.g. omnipresence, providence, &c. Faith in their use of the\nterm means no more than a refusal to define the conception, or to enter on\na closer discussion of the problem. That men and classes of untrained\nintellect are satisfied with such indefiniteness, is what one expects; but\nwhen a trained intellect and an interest for reflective study is\nsatisfied, in matters admitted to be of superior, if not even of supreme\ninterest, with indefinite ideas, it is hard to decide whether the thinker\nis really in earnest with the subject. But if those who cling to this\ncrude \u201crationalism\u201d were in earnest, e.g. with God\u2019s omnipresence, so far\nas to realise their faith thereon in a definite mental idea, in what\ndifficulties would they be involved by their belief in the true reality of\nthe things of sense! They would hardly like, as Epicurus does, to let God\ndwell in the interspaces of things, i.e. in the pores of the\nphysicists,\u2014said pores being the negative, something supposed to exist\n_beside_ the material reality. This very \u201cBeside\u201d would give their\npantheism its spatiality,\u2014their everything, conceived as the mutual\nexclusion of parts in space. But in ascribing to God, in his relation to\nthe world, an action on and in the space thus filled on the world and in\nit, they would endlessly split up the divine actuality into infinite\nmateriality. They would really thus have the misconception they call\npantheism or all-one-doctrine, only as the necessary sequel of their\nmisconceptions of God and the world. But to put that sort of thing, this\nstale gossip of oneness or identity, on the shoulders of philosophy, shows\nsuch recklessness about justice and truth that it can only be explained\nthrough the difficulty of getting into the head thoughts and notions, i.e.\nnot abstract unity, but the many-shaped modes specified. If statements as\nto facts are put forward, and the facts in question are thoughts and\nnotions, it is indispensable to get hold of their meaning. But even the\nfulfilment of this requirement has been rendered superfluous, now that it\nhas long been a foregone conclusion that philosophy is pantheism, a system\nof identity, an All-one doctrine, and that the person therefore who might\nbe unaware of this fact is treated either as merely unaware of a matter of\ncommon notoriety, or as prevaricating for a purpose. On account of this\nchorus of assertions, then, I have believed myself obliged to speak at\nmore length and exoterically on the outward and inward untruth of this\nalleged fact: for exoteric discussion is the only method available in\ndealing with the external apprehension of notions as mere facts,\u2014by which\nnotions are perverted into their opposite. The esoteric study of God and\nidentity, as of cognitions and notions, is philosophy itself.\n\u00a7 574. This notion of philosophy is the self-thinking Idea, the truth\naware of itself (\u00a7 236),\u2014the logical system, but with the signification\nthat it is universality approved and certified in concrete content as in\nits actuality. In this way the science has gone back to its beginning: its\nresult is the logical system but as a spiritual principle: out of the\npresupposing judgment, in which the notion was only implicit and the\nbeginning an immediate,\u2014and thus out of the _appearance_ which it had\nthere\u2014it has risen into its pure principle and thus also into its proper\nmedium.\n\u00a7 575. It is this appearing which originally gives the motive of the\nfurther development. The first appearance is formed by the syllogism,\nwhich is based on the Logical system as starting-point, with Nature for\nthe middle term which couples the Mind with it. The Logical principle\nturns to Nature and Nature to Mind. Nature, standing between the Mind and\nits essence, sunders itself, not indeed to extremes of finite abstraction,\nnor itself to something away from them and independent,\u2014which, as other\nthan they, only serves as a link between them: for the syllogism is _in\nthe Idea_ and Nature is essentially defined as a transition-point and\nnegative factor, and as implicitly the Idea. Still the mediation of the\nnotion has the external form of _transition_, and the science of Nature\npresents itself as the course of necessity, so that it is only in the one\nextreme that the liberty of the notion is explicit as a self-amalgamation.\n\u00a7 576. In the second syllogism this appearance is so far superseded, that\nthat syllogism is the standpoint of the Mind itself, which\u2014as the\nmediating agent in the process\u2014presupposes Nature and couples it with the\nLogical principle. It is the syllogism where Mind reflects on itself in\nthe Idea: philosophy appears as a subjective cognition, of which liberty\nis the aim, and which is itself the way to produce it.\n\u00a7 577. The third syllogism is the Idea of philosophy, which has\nself-knowing reason, the absolutely-universal, for its middle term: a\nmiddle, which divides itself into Mind and Nature, making the former its\npresupposition, as process of the Idea\u2019s subjective activity, and the\nlatter its universal extreme, as process of the objectively and implicitly\nexisting Idea. The self-judging of the Idea into its two appearances (\u00a7\u00a7\n575, 576) characterises both as its (the self-knowing reason\u2019s)\nmanifestations: and in it there is a unification of the two aspects:\u2014it is\nthe nature of the fact, the notion, which causes the movement and\ndevelopment, yet this same movement is equally the action of cognition.\nThe eternal Idea, in full fruition of its essence, eternally sets itself\nto work, engenders and enjoys itself as absolute Mind.\n\u1f29 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f21 \u03bc\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n\u03bc\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1. \u0391\u1f51\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f41 \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1\n\u03b3\u03af\u03b3\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03bf\u1ff6\u03bd, \u1f65\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd. \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2. \u1f18\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f14\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd. \u1f6d\u03c3\u03c4\u1fbd\n\u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f42 \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f41 \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f21 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f78\n\u1f25\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd. \u0395\u1f30 \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03bf\u1f55\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f56 \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad, \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2\n\u1f00\u03b5\u03af, \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd; \u03b5\u1f30 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. \u1f1c\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f61\u03b4\u03af. \u039a\u03b1\u1f76\n\u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u03b4\u03ad \u03b3\u03b5 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9; \u1f21 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae, \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1;\n\u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f00\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. \u03a6\u03b1\u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72\n\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f65\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u03b1\u1f30\u1f7c\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c7\u1f74\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f00\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff7; \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.

Darwin\u2019s _Origin of Species_ is 1859. But such ideas, both in\nMr. Spencer and others, are earlier than Darwin\u2019s book.\n3 Hegel\u2019s _Verh\u00e4ltniss_, the supreme category of what is called\nactuality: where object is necessitated by outside object.\n4 Cf. Herbart, _Werke_ (ed. Kehrbach), iv. 372. This consciousness\nproper is what Leibniz called _\u00ab __Apperception,__ \u00bb__ la\nconnaissance r\u00e9flexive de l\u2019\u00e9tat int\u00e9rieur (Nouveaux Essais)_.\n5 Herbart, _Werke_, vi. 55 (ed.

See also Leibniz, who (in 1693, _De Notionibus juris et\njustitiae_) had given the following definitions: \u201cCaritas est\nbenevolentia universalis. Justitia est caritas sapientis. Sapientia\nest scientia felicitatis.\u201d The jus naturae has three grades: the\nlowest, jus strictum; the second, aequitas (or caritas, in the\nnarrower sense); and the highest, pietas, which is honeste, i.e. pie\nvivere.\n9 To which the Greek \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, the Latin civitas or respublica, were only\napproximations. Hegel _is not writing a history_. If he were, it\nwould be necessary for him to point out how far the individual\ninstance, e.g. Rome, or Prussia, corresponded to its Idea.\n10 Shakespeare\u2019s phrase, as in _Othello_, iii. 2; _Lover\u2019s Complaint_,\nv. 24.\n_   11 Iliad_, xii. 243.\n12 See Hegel\u2019s _Logic_, pp. 257 seq.\n13 See p. 153 (\u00a7 550).\n14 Cf. _Prolegomena to the Study of Hegel_, chaps. xviii, xxvi.\n15 As stated in p. 167 (_Encycl._ \u00a7 554).

And herein is a proof that God has given the art of\ndivination, not to the wisdom, but, to the foolishness of man; for\nno man when in his wits attains prophetic truth and inspiration; but\nwhen he receives the inspired word, either his intelligence is\nenthralled by sleep, or he is demented by some distemper or\npossession (enthusiasm).\u201d Plato very correctly notes not merely the\nbodily conditions on which such visionary knowledge depends, and the\npossibility of the truth of the dreams, but also the inferiority of\nthem to the reasonable frame of mind.\n_  124 Selbstgef\u00fchl._\n_  125 Gewohnheit._\n_  126 Die wirkliche Seele._\n_  127 Das Bewu\u00dftsein als solches_: (a) _Das sinnliche Bewu\u00dftsein._\n_  128 Wahrnehmung._\n_  129 Der Verstand._\n_  130 Selbstbewu\u00dftsein._\n_  131 Die Begierde._\n_  132 Das anerkennende Selbstbewu\u00dftsein._\n_  133 Die Vernunft._\n_  134 Der Geist._\n_  135 Die Intelligenz._\n_  136 Anschauung._\n_  137 Vorstellung._\n_  138 Die Erinnerung._\n_  139 Die Einbildungskraft._\n_  140 Phantasie._\n_  141 Ged\u00e4chtni\u00df._\n_  142 Auswendiges._\n_  143 Inwendiges._\n_  144 Das Denken._\n_  145 Der praktische Geist._\n_  146 Der praktische Gef\u00fchl._\n_  147 Der Triebe und die Willk\u00fchr._\n_  148 Die Gl\u00fcckseligkeit._\n_  149 Der freie Geist._\n_  150 Gesess._\n_  151 Sitte._\n_  152 Das Recht._\n_  153 Moralit\u00e4t._\n_  154 Naturrecht._\n_  155 Moralit\u00e4t._\n_  156 Der Vorsatz._\n_  157 That._\n_  158 Handlung._\n_  159 Die Absicht und das Wohl._\n_  160 Das Gute und das B\u00f6se._\n_  161 Die Sittlichkeit._\n_  162 Die b\u00fcrgerliche Gesellschaft._\n_  163 Das System der Bed\u00fcrfnisse._\n_  164 Die Rechtspflege._\n_  165 Gese\u00df._\n_  166 Die Polizei und die Corporation._\n_  167 Inneres Staatsrecht._\n_  168 Das \u00e4u\u00dfere Staatsrecht._\n_  169 Die Weltgeschichte._\n_  170 Weltweisheit._\n_  171 Der absolute Geist._\n_  172 Die geoffenbarte Religion._\n173 [The citation given by Hegel from Schlegel\u2019s translation is here\nreplaced by the version (in one or two points different) in the\n_Sacred Books of the East_, vol. viii.]\n174 In order to give a clearer impression of it, I cannot refrain from\nquoting a few passages, which may at the same time give some\nindication of the marvellous skill of R\u00fcckert, from whom they are\ntaken, as a translator. [For R\u00fcckert\u2019s verses a version is here\nsubstituted in which I have been kindly helped by Miss May Kendall.]\nIII.\nI saw but One through all heaven\u2019s starry spaces gleaming:\nI saw but One in all sea billows wildly streaming.\nI looked into the heart, a waste of worlds, a sea,\u2014\nI saw a thousand dreams,\u2014yet One amid all dreaming.\nAnd earth, air, water, fire, when thy decree is given,\nAre molten into One: against thee none hath striven.\nThere is no living heart but beats unfailingly\nIn the one song of praise to thee, from earth and heaven.\nV.\nAs one ray of thy light appears the noonday sun,\nBut yet thy light and mine eternally are one.\nAs dust beneath thy feet the heaven that rolls on high:\nYet only one, and one for ever, thou and I.\nThe dust may turn to heaven, and heaven to dust decay;\nYet art thou one with me, and shalt be one for aye.\nHow may the words of life that fill heaven\u2019s utmost part\nRest in the narrow casket of one poor human heart?\nHow can the sun\u2019s own rays, a fairer gleam to fling,\nHide in a lowly husk, the jewel\u2019s covering?\nHow may the rose-grove all its glorious bloom unfold,\nDrinking in mire and slime, and feeding on the mould?\nHow can the darksome shell that sips the salt sea stream\nFashion a shining pearl, the sunlight\u2019s joyous beam?\nOh, heart! should warm winds fan thee, should\u2019st thou floods\nendure,\nOne element are wind and flood; but be thou pure.\nIX.\nI\u2019ll tell thee how from out the dust God moulded man,\u2014\nBecause the breath of Love He breathed into his clay:\nI\u2019ll tell thee why the spheres their whirling paths began,\u2014\nThey mirror to God\u2019s throne Love\u2019s glory day by day:\nI\u2019ll tell thee why the morning winds blow o\u2019er the grove,\u2014\nIt is to bid Love\u2019s roses bloom abundantly:\nI\u2019ll tell thee why the night broods deep the earth above,\u2014\nLove\u2019s bridal tent to deck with sacred canopy:\nAll riddles of the earth dost thou desire to prove?\u2014\nTo every earthly riddle is Love alone the key.\nXV.\nLife shrinks from Death in woe and fear,\nThough Death ends well Life\u2019s bitter need:\nSo shrinks the heart when Love draws near,\nAs though \u2019twere Death in very deed:\nFor wheresoever Love finds room,\nThere Self, the sullen tyrant, dies.\nSo let him perish in the gloom,\u2014\nThou to the dawn of freedom rise.\nIn this poetry, which soars over all that is external and sensuous,\nwho would recognise the prosaic ideas current about so-called\npantheism\u2014ideas which let the divine sink to the external and the\nsensuous? The copious extracts which Tholuck, in his work _Anthology\nfrom the Eastern Mystics_, gives us from the poems of Jelaleddin and\nothers, are made from the very point of view now under discussion.\nIn his Introduction, Herr Tholuck proves how profoundly his soul has\ncaught the note of mysticism; and there, too, he points out the\ncharacteristic traits of its oriental phase, in distinction from\nthat of the West and Christendom. With all their divergence,\nhowever, they have in common the mystical character. The conjunction\nof Mysticism with so-called Pantheism, as he says (p. 53), implies\nthat inward quickening of soul and spirit which inevitably tends to\nannihilate that external _Everything_, which Pantheism is usually\nheld to adore. But beyond that, Herr Tholuck leaves matters standing\nat the usual indistinct conception of Pantheism; a profounder\ndiscussion of it would have had, for the author\u2019s emotional\nChristianity, no direct interest; but we see that personally he is\ncarried away by remarkable enthusiasm for a mysticism which, in the\nordinary phrase, entirely deserves the epithet Pantheistic. Where,\nhowever, he tries philosophising (p. 12), he does not get beyond the\nstandpoint of the \u201crationalist\u201d metaphysic with its uncritical\ncategories.\n***", "source": "philosophy_of_mind.txt"}

In the case\nof the History of Philosophy, that difficulty is possibly enhanced\nby the fact that the greater part of the book is put together from\nthe notes of different courses of lectures delivered on the subject\nat various times. Hegel, as we learn from Michelet, in his preface\nto the first edition of this work, lectured in all nine times on the\nHistory of Philosophy: first in Jena in 1805-1806, then in Heidelberg\nin 1816-1817 and 1817-1818, and the other six times in Berlin between\nthe years 1819 and 1830. He had begun the tenth course on the subject\nin 1831 when death cut his labours short. It was only for the first\ncourse of lectures\u2014that delivered in Jena\u2014that Hegel fully wrote out\nhis lectures; this was evidently done with the intention of future\npublication in book form. At Heidelberg he composed a short abstract\nof his subject, giving in a few terse words the main points dealt with\nin each system of Philosophy. In the later courses of lectures Hegel\ntrusted to extempore speaking, but at the same time made considerable\nuse of the above writings, the margins of which he annotated with\nsubsequent additions. Besides these annotations he left behind him a\nlarge number of miscellaneous notes, which have proved of the greatest\nvalue. The present translation is taken from the second and amended\nedition of the \u201cGeschichte der Philosophie,\u201d published in 1840. This\nedition is derived from no one set of lectures in particular, but\ncarefully prepared by Michelet\u2014himself one of Hegel\u2019s pupils\u2014from all\navailable sources, including the notes of students. The Jena volume\nis, however, made the basis, as representing the main elements of the\nsubject afterwards to be more fully amplified; or, in Michelet\u2019s words,\nas the skeleton which was afterwards to be clothed with flesh.\nI have endeavoured to make this translation as literal as possible\nconsistently with intelligibility, and have attempted, so far as\nmight be, to give the recognized symbols for the words for which we\nhave in English no satisfactory equivalents. \u201cBegriff,\u201d when used in\nits technical sense, is translated by \u201cNotion,\u201d \u201cIdee\u201d by \u201cIdea,\u201d as\ndistinguished from the colloquial \u201cidea\u201d; \u201cVorstellung\u201d is usually\nrendered by \u201cpopular\u201d or \u201cordinary conception.\u201d\nMiss Frances H. Simson has rendered very valuable assistance in going\ncarefully over most of the proofs of the first volume, and she is now\nengaged with me in the translation of the volumes following.\nE. S.

For the period seems to have been arrived at when\nPhilosophy may again hope to receive some attention and love\u2014this\nalmost dead science may again raise its voice, and hope that the world\nwhich had become deaf to its teaching, may once more lend it an ear.\nThe necessities of the time have accorded to the petty interests of\nevery-day life such overwhelming attention: the deep interests of\nactuality and the strife respecting these have engrossed all the powers\nand the forces of the mind\u2014as also the necessary means\u2014to so great\nan extent, that no place has been left to the higher inward life, the\nintellectual operations of a purer sort; and the better natures have\nthus been stunted in their growth, and in great measure sacrificed.\nBecause the spirit of the world was thus occupied, it could not look\nwithin and withdraw into itself. But since this stream of actuality\nis checked, since the German nation has cut its way out of its most\nmaterial conditions, since its nationality, the basis of all higher\nlife, has been saved, we may hope that, in addition to the State, which\nhas swallowed up all other interests in its own, the Church may now\nresume her high position\u2014that in addition to the kingdom of the world\nto which all thoughts and efforts have hitherto been directed; the\nKingdom of God may also be considered. In other words, along with the\nbusiness of politics and the other interests of every-day life, we may\ntrust that Science, the free rational world of mind, may again flourish.\nWe shall see in the History of Philosophy that in other European\ncountries in which the sciences and the cultivation of the\nunderstanding have been prosecuted with zeal and with respect,\nPhilosophy, excepting in name, has sunk even from memory, and that\nit is in the German nation that it has been retained as a peculiar\npossession. We have received the higher call of Nature to be the\nconservers of this holy flame, just as the Eumolpid\u00e6 in Athens had\nthe conservation of the Eleusinian mysteries, the inhabitants of the\nisland of Samothrace the preservation and maintenance of a higher\ndivine service; and as, earlier still, the World-spirit reserved to the\nJewish nation the highest consciousness that it should once more rise\nfrom thence as a new spiritual force. We have already got so far, and\nhave attained to a seriousness so much greater and a consciousness so\nmuch deeper, that for us ideas and that which our reason justifies, can\nalone have weight; to speak more plainly, the Prussian State is a State\nconstituted on principles of intelligence. But the needs of the time\nand the interests of the events in the world already mentioned, have\nrepressed a real and earnest effort after Philosophy and driven hence\nany general attention to it. It has thus happened that because vigorous\nnatures turned to the practical, insipidity and dulness appropriated\nto themselves the preeminence in Philosophy and flourished there. It\nmay indeed be said that since Philosophy began to take a place in\nGermany, it has never looked so badly as at the present time\u2014never\nhave emptiness and shallowness overlaid it so completely, and never\nhave they spoken and acted with such arrogance, as though all power\nwere in their hands! To combat the shallowness, to strive with German\nearnestness and honesty, to draw Philosophy out of the solitude into\nwhich it has wandered\u2014to do such work as this we may hope that we are\ncalled by the higher spirit of our time. Let us together greet the dawn\nof a better time in which the spirit, hitherto a prey to externalities,\nmay return within itself, come to itself again, and win space and\nroom for a kingdom of its own, where true minds will rise above the\ninterests of the moment, and obtain the power to receive the true,\neternal and divine, the power to consider and to grasp the highest.\nWe elders, who in the storms of the age have ripened into men, may\nthink you happy whose youth falls in the day in which you may devote\nthe same undisturbed to Science and to Truth. I have dedicated my life\nto Science, and it is a true joy to me to find myself again in this\nplace where I may, in a higher measure and more extensive circle,\nwork with others in the interests of the higher sciences, and help to\ndirect your way therein. I hope that I may succeed in deserving and\nobtaining your confidence. But in the first place, I can ask nothing of\nyou but to bring with you, above all, a trust in science and a trust\nin yourselves. The love of truth, faith in the power of mind, is the\nfirst condition in Philosophy. Man, because he is Mind, should and must\ndeem himself worthy of the highest; he cannot think too highly of the\ngreatness and the power of his mind, and, with this belief, nothing\nwill be so difficult and hard that it will not reveal itself to him.\nThe Being of the universe, at first hidden and concealed, has no power\nwhich can offer resistance to the search for knowledge; it has to lay\nitself open before the seeker\u2014to set before his eyes and give for his\nenjoyment, its riches and its depths.\nPREFATORY NOTE\nIN the History of Philosophy the observation is immediately forced\nupon us that it certainly presents great interest if its subject is\nregarded from a favourable point of view, but that it would still\npossess interest even if its end were regarded as opposite to what it\nis. Indeed, this interest may seem to increase in the degree in which\nthe ordinary conception of Philosophy, and of the end which its history\nserves, is reversed; for from the History of Philosophy a proof of the\nfutility of the science is mainly derived.\nThe demand that a history, whatever the subject may be, should state\nthe facts without prejudice and without any particular object or end\nto be gained by its means, must be regarded as a fair one. But with a\ncommonplace demand like this, we do not get far; for the history of a\nsubject is necessarily intimately connected with the conception which\nis formed of it. In accordance with this what is important in it is\ndetermined, and the relation of the events to the end regulates the\nselection of facts to be recorded, the mode of comprehending them, and\nthe point of view under which they are regarded. It may happen from the\nideas formed of what a State really is, that a reader of the political\nhistory of a country may find therein nothing of what he looks for.\nStill more may this be the case in the history of Philosophy, and\nrepresentations of this history may be instanced in which everything,\nexcepting what was supposed to be Philosophy, appears to be found.\nIn other histories we have a clear conception of their subjects, at\nleast so far as their principal points are concerned; we know whether\nthey concern a particular land, people or race, or whether their\nsubject is the science of mathematics, physics, &c., or an art, such as\npainting. The science of Philosophy has, however, this distinguishing\nfeature, and, if you will, this disadvantage as compared with other\nsciences, that we find the most varied points of view as regards its\nNotion, and regarding that which it ought to and can accomplish. If\nthis first assumption, the conception of the subject of the history, is\nnot established, the history itself is necessarily made vacillating,\nand it only obtains consistency when it sets forth a definite\nconception: but then in view of the various ways of regarding its\nsubject, it easily draws upon itself the reproach of one-sidedness.\nThat drawback relates, however, only to an external consideration of\nthis narrative; there is another and greater disadvantage allied to\nit. If there are different Notions of the science of Philosophy, it\nis the true Notion alone that puts us in a position to understand the\nwritings of philosophers who have worked in the knowledge of it. For in\nthought, and particularly in speculative thought, comprehension means\nsomething quite different from understanding the grammatical sense\nof the words alone, and also from understanding them in the region\nof ordinary conception only. Hence we may possess a knowledge of the\nassertions, propositions, or of the opinions of philosophers; we may\nhave occupied ourselves largely with the grounds of and deductions from\nthese opinions, and the main point in all that we have done may be\nwanting\u2014the comprehension of the propositions. There is hence no lack\nof voluminous and even learned histories of Philosophy in which the\nknowledge of the matter itself about which so much ado has been made,\nis absent. The authors of such histories may be compared to animals\nwhich have listened to all the tones in some music, but to whose senses\nthe unison, the harmony of their tones, has not penetrated.\nThe circumstance mentioned makes it in no science so necessary as in\nthe history of Philosophy to commence with an Introduction, and in it\ncorrectly to define, in the first place, the subject of the history\nabout to be related. For it may be said, How should we begin to treat\na subject, the name of which is certainly mentioned often enough, but\nof whose nature we as yet know nothing? In treating the history of\nPhilosophy thus, we could have no other guidance than that of seeking\nout and taking up whatever has received the name of Philosophy,\nanywhere or any time. But in fact, when the Notion of Philosophy is\nestablished, not arbitrarily but in a scientific way, such treatment\nbecomes the science of Philosophy itself. For in this science the\npeculiar characteristic is that its Notion forms the beginning in\nappearance merely, and it is only the whole treatment of the science\nthat is the proof, and indeed we may say the finding of its Notion; and\nthis is really a result of that treatment.\nIn this Introduction the Notion of the science of Philosophy, of the\nsubject of its history, has thus likewise to be set forth. At the same\ntime, though this Introduction professes to relate to the history of\nPhilosophy only, what has just been said of Philosophy on the whole,\nalso holds good. What can be said in this Introduction is not so much\nsomething which may be stated beforehand, as what can be justified or\nproved in the treatment of the history. These preparatory explanations\nare for this reason only, not to be placed in the category of arbitrary\nassumptions. But to begin with stating what in their justification are\nreally results, can only have the interest which may be possessed by a\nsummary, given in advance, of the most general contents of a science.\nIt must serve to set aside many questions and demands which might, from\nour ordinary prejudices, arise in such a history.\nINTRODUCTION\nTHERE are various aspects under which the History of Philosophy may\npossess interest. We shall find the central point of this interest in\nthe essential connection existing between what is apparently past and\nthe present stage reached by Philosophy. That this connection is not\none of the external considerations which may be taken into account in\nthe history of Philosophy, but really expresses its inner character:\nthat the events of this history, while they perpetuate themselves in\ntheir effects like all other events, yet produce their results in a\nspecial way\u2014this it is which is here to be more clearly expounded.\nWhat the history of Philosophy shows us is a succession of noble minds,\na gallery of heroes of thought, who, by the power of Reason, have\npenetrated into the being of things, of nature and of spirit, into\nthe Being of God, and have won for us by their labours the highest\ntreasure, the treasure of reasoned knowledge.\nThe events and actions of this history are therefore such that\npersonality and individual character do not enter to any large degree\ninto its content and matter. In this respect the history of Philosophy\ncontrasts with political history, in which the individual, according to\nthe peculiarity of his disposition, talents, affections, the strength\nor weakness of his character, and in general, according to that through\nwhich he is this individual, is the subject of actions and events. In\nPhilosophy, the less deserts and merits are accorded to the particular\nindividual, the better is the history; and the more it deals with\nthought as free, with the universal character of man as man, the more\nthis thought, which is devoid of special characteristic, is itself\nshown to be the producing subject.\nThe acts of thought appear at first to be a matter of history, and,\ntherefore, things of the past, and outside our real existence. But in\nreality we are what we are through history: or, more accurately, as\nin the history of Thought, what has passed away is only one side, so\nin the present, what we have as a permanent possession is essentially\nbound up with our place in history. The possession of self-conscious\nreason, which belongs to us of the present world, did not arise\nsuddenly, nor did it grow only from the soil of the present. This\npossession must be regarded as previously present, as an inheritance,\nand as the result of labour\u2014the labour of all past generations of men.\nJust as the arts of outward life, the accumulated skill and invention,\nthe customs and arrangements of social and political life, are the\nresult of the thought, care, and needs, of the want and the misery, of\nthe ingenuity, the plans and achievements of those who preceded us in\nhistory, so, likewise, in science, and specially in Philosophy, do we\nowe what we are to the tradition which, as Herder has put it,[1] like\na holy chain, runs through all that was transient, and has therefore\npassed away. Thus has been preserved and transmitted to us what\nantiquity produced.\nBut this tradition is not only a stewardess who simply guards\nfaithfully that which she has received, and thus delivers it unchanged\nto posterity, just as the course of nature in the infinite change and\nactivity of its forms ever remains constant to its original laws and\nmakes no step in advance. Such tradition is no motionless statue, but\nis alive, and swells like a mighty river, which increases in size the\nfurther it advances from its source. The content of this tradition is\nthat which the intellectual world has brought forth, and the universal\nMind does not remain stationary. But it is just the universal Mind\nwith which we have to do. It may certainly be the case with a single\nnation that its culture, art, science\u2014its intellectual activities as a\nwhole\u2014are at a standstill. This appears, perhaps, to be the case with\nthe Chinese, for example, who may have been as far advanced in every\nrespect two thousand years ago as now. But the world-spirit does not\nsink into this rest of indifference; this follows from its very nature,\nfor its activity is its life. This activity presupposes a material\nalready present, on which it acts, and which it does not merely augment\nby the addition, of new matter, but completely fashions and transforms.\nThus that which each generation has produced in science and in\nintellectual activity, is an heirloom to which all the past generations\nhave added their savings, a temple in which all races of men thankfully\nand cheerfully deposit that which rendered aid to them through life,\nand which they had won from the depths of Nature and of Mind. To\nreceive this inheritance is also to enter upon its use. It constitutes\nthe soul of each successive generation, the intellectual substance of\nthe time; its principles, prejudices, and possessions; and this legacy\nis degraded to a material which becomes metamorphosed by Mind. In this\nmanner that which is received is changed, and the material worked upon\nis both enriched and preserved at the same time.\nThis is the function of our own and of every age: to grasp the\nknowledge which is already existing, to make it our own, and in so\ndoing to develop it still further and to raise it to a higher level. In\nthus appropriating it to ourselves we make it into something different\nfrom what it was before. On the presupposition of an already existing\nintellectual world which is transformed in our appropriation of it,\ndepends the fact that Philosophy can only arise in connection with\nprevious Philosophy, from which of necessity it has arisen. The course\nof history does not show us the Becoming of things foreign to us, but\nthe Becoming of ourselves and of our own knowledge.\nThe ideas and questions which may be present to our mind regarding the\ncharacter and ends of the history of Philosophy, depend on the nature\nof the relationship here given. In this lies the explanation of the\nfact that the study of the history of Philosophy is an introduction to\nPhilosophy itself. The guiding principles for the formation of this\nhistory are given in this fact, the further discussion of which must\nthus be the main object of this introduction. We must also, however,\nkeep in mind, as being of fundamental importance, the conception of\nthe aim of Philosophy. And since, as already mentioned, the systematic\nexposition of this conception cannot here find a place, such discussion\nas we can now undertake, can only propose to deal with the subject\nprovisionally and not to give a thorough and conclusive account of the\nnature of the Becoming of Philosophy.\nThis Becoming is not merely a passive movement, as we suppose movements\nsuch as those of the sun and moon to be. It is no mere movement in\nthe unresisting medium of space and time. What we must represent to\nourselves is the activity of free thought; we have to present the\nhistory of the world of thought as it has arisen and produced itself.\nThere is an old tradition that it is the faculty of thought which\nseparates men from beasts; and to this tradition we shall adhere. In\naccordance with this, what man has, as being nobler than a beast,\nhe has through thinking. Everything which is human, however it may\nappear, is so only because the thought contained in it works and has\nworked. But thought, although it is thus the essential, substantial,\nand effectual, has many other elements. We must, however, consider it\nbest when Thought does not pursue anything else, but is occupied only\nwith itself\u2014with what is noblest\u2014when it has sought and found itself.\nThe history which we have before us is the history of Thought finding\nitself, and it is the case with Thought that it only finds itself in\nproducing itself; indeed, that it only exists and is actual in finding\nitself. These productions are the philosophic systems; and the series\nof discoveries on which Thought sets out in order to discover itself,\nforms a work which has lasted twenty-five hundred years.\nIf the Thought which is essentially Thought, is in and for itself\nand eternal, and that which is true is contained in Thought alone,\nhow, then, does this intellectual world come to have a history? In\nhistory what appears is transient, has disappeared in the night of\nthe past and is no more. But true, necessary thought\u2014and it is only\nwith such that we have to do\u2014is capable of no change. The question\nhere raised constitutes one of those matters first to be brought\nunder our consideration. But in the second place, there are also\nmany most important things outside of Philosophy, which are yet the\nwork of Thought, and which are left unconsidered. Such are Religion,\nPolitical History, forms of Government, and the Arts and Sciences. The\nquestion arises as to how these operations differ from the subject of\nconsideration, and how they are related in history? As regards these\ntwo points of view, it is desirable to show in what sense the history\nof Philosophy is here taken, in order to see clearly what we are about.\nMoreover, in the third place, we must first take a general survey\nbefore we descend to particulars, else the whole is not seen for the\nmere details\u2014the wood is not seen for the trees, nor Philosophy for\nmere philosophies. We require to have a general idea of the nature and\naim of the whole in order to know what to look for. Just as we first\ndesire to obtain a general idea of a country, which we should no longer\nsee in going into detail, so we desire to see the relation which single\nphilosophies bear to the whole; for in reality, the high value of the\ndetail lies in its relation to the whole. This is nowhere more the\ncase than with Philosophy, and also with its history. In the case of a\nhistory, indeed, the establishment of the Universal seems to be less\nneedful than in that of one of the sciences proper. For history seems\nat first to be a succession of chance events, in which each fact stands\nisolated by itself, which has Time alone as a connecting-link. But even\nin political history we are not satisfied with this. We see, or at\nleast divine in it, that essential connection in which the individual\nevents have their place and relation to an end or aim, and in this\nway obtain significance. For the significant in history is such only\nthrough its relation to and connection with a Universal. To perceive\nthis Universal is thus to apprehend the significance.\nThere are, therefore, the following points with which I wish to deal in\nthis introduction.\nThe first of these will be to investigate the character of the history\nof Philosophy, its significance, its nature, and its aim, from which\nwill follow inferences as to its treatment. In particular, we shall\nget an insight into the relation of the history of Philosophy to the\nscience of Philosophy, and this will be the most interesting point of\nall. That is to say, this history represents, not merely the external,\naccidental, events contained within it, but it shows how the content,\nor that which appears to belong to mere history, really belongs to the\nscience of Philosophy. The history of Philosophy is itself scientific,\nand thus essentially becomes the science of Philosophy.\nIn the second place, the Notion of Philosophy must be more adequately\ndetermined, and from it must be deduced what should be excluded\nfrom the history of Philosophy out of the infinite material and the\nmanifold aspects of the intellectual culture of the nations. Religion,\ncertainly, and the thoughts contained in and regarding it, particularly\nwhen these are in the form of mythology, are, on account of their\nmatter, and the sciences with their ideas on the state, duties and\nlaws, on account of their form, so near Philosophy that the history\nof the science of Philosophy threatens to become quite indefinite in\nextent. It might be supposed that the history of Philosophy should take\naccount of all these ideas. Has not everything been called Philosophy\nand philosophizing? On the one hand, the close connection has to be\nfurther considered in which Philosophy stands with its allied subjects,\nreligion, art, the other sciences, and likewise with political history.\nOn the other hand, when the province of Philosophy has been correctly\ndefined, we reach, with the determination of what Philosophy is and\nwhat pertains to it, the starting-point of its history, which must\nbe distinguished from the commencements of religious ideas and mere\nthoughtful conjectures.\nFrom the idea of the subject which is contained in these first two\npoints of view, it is necessary to pass on to the consideration of the\nthird point, to the general review of this history and to the division\nof its progress into natural periods\u2014such an arrangement to exhibit\nit as an organic, progressive whole, as a rational connection through\nwhich this history attains the dignity of a science. And I will not\noccupy further space with reflections on the use of the history of\nPhilosophy, and other methods of treating it. The use is evident.\nBut, in conclusion, I wish to consider the sources of the history of\nPhilosophy, for this is customary.\nA\nTHE NOTION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.\nTHE thought which may first occur to us in the history of Philosophy,\nis that the subject itself contains an inner contradiction. For\nPhilosophy aims at understanding what is unchangeable, eternal, in and\nfor itself: its end is Truth. But history tells us of that which has at\none time existed, at another time has vanished, having been expelled by\nsomething else. Truth is eternal; it does not fall within the sphere of\nthe transient, and has no history. But if it has a history, and as this\nhistory is only the representation of a succession of past forms of\nknowledge, the truth is not to be found in it, for the truth cannot be\nwhat has passed away.\nIt might be said that all this argument would affect not only the other\nsciences, but in like degree the Christian religion, and it might be\nfound inconsistent that a history of this religion and of the other\nsciences should exist; but it would be superfluous further to examine\nthis argument, for it is immediately contradicted by the very fact that\nthere are such histories. But in order to get a better understanding\nof this apparent contradiction, we must distinguish between the\noutward history of a religion or a science and the history of the\nsubject itself. And then we must take into account that the history\nof Philosophy because of the special nature of its subject-matter,\nis different from other histories. It is at once evident that the\ncontradiction in question could not refer to the outward history, but\nmerely to the inward, or that of the content itself. There is a history\nof the spread of Christianity and of the lives of those who have avowed\nit, and its existence has formed itself into that of a Church. This in\nitself constitutes an external existence such that being brought into\ncontact with temporal affairs of the most diverse kind, its lot is a\nvaried one and it essentially possesses a history. And of the Christian\ndoctrine it is true that it, too, has its history, but it necessarily\nsoon reached its full development and attained to its appointed powers.\nAnd this old creed has been an acknowledged influence to every age, and\nwill still be acknowledged unchanged as the Truth, even though this\nacknowledgment were become no more than a pretence, and the words\nan empty form. But the history of this doctrine in its wider sense\nincludes two elements: first the various additions to and deviations\nfrom the truth formerly established, and secondly the combating of\nthese errors, the purification of the principles that remain from such\nadditions, and a consequent return to their first simplicity.\nThe other sciences, including Philosophy, have also an external history\nlike Religion. Philosophy has a history of its origin, diffusion,\nmaturity, decay, revival; a history of its teachers, promoters, and\nof its opponents\u2014often, too, of an outward relation to religion\nand occasionally to the State. This side of its history likewise\ngives occasion to interesting questions. Amongst other such, it is\nasked why Philosophy, the doctrine of absolute Truth, seems to have\nrevealed itself on the whole to a small number of individuals, to\nspecial nations, and how it has limited itself to particular periods\nof time. Similarly with respect to Christianity, to the Truth in\na much more universal form than the philosophical, a difficulty\nhas been encountered in respect to the question whether there is a\ncontradiction in the fact that this religion should have appeared so\nlate in time, and that it should have remained so long and should still\nremain limited to special races of men. But these and other similar\nquestions are too much a matter of detail to depend merely on the\ngeneral conflict referred to, and when we have further touched upon the\npeculiar character of philosophic knowledge, we may go more specially\ninto the aspects which relate to the external existence and external\nhistory of Philosophy.\nBut as regards the comparison between the history of Religion and that\nof Philosophy as to inner content, there is not in the latter as there\nis in Religion a fixed and fundamental truth which, as unchangeable, is\napart from history. The content of Christianity, which is Truth, has,\nhowever, remained unaltered as such, and has therefore little history\nor as good as none.[2] Hence in Religion, on account of its very nature\nas Christianity, the conflict referred to disappears. The errors and\nadditions constitute no difficulty. They are transitory and altogether\nhistorical in character.\nThe other sciences, indeed, have also according to their content a\nHistory, a part of which relates to alterations, and the renunciation\nof tenets which were formerly current. But a great, perhaps the\ngreater, part of the history relates to what has proved permanent,\nso that what was new, was not an alteration on earlier acquisitions,\nbut an addition to them. These sciences progress through a process of\njuxtaposition. It is true that in Botany, Mineralogy, and so on, much\nis dependent on what was previously known, but by far the greatest\npart remains stationary and by means of fresh matter is merely added\nto without itself being affected by the addition. With a science\nlike Mathematics, history has, in the main, only the pleasing task\nof recording further additions. Thus to take an example, elementary\ngeometry in so far as it was created by Euclid, may from his time on be\nregarded as having no further history.\nThe history of Philosophy, on the other hand, shows neither the\nmotionlessness of a complete, simple content, nor altogether the onward\nmovement of a peaceful addition of new treasures to those already\nacquired. It seems merely to afford the spectacle of ever-recurring\nchanges in the whole, such as finally are no longer even connected by a\ncommon aim.\n1. COMMON IDEAS REGARDING THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.\nAt this point appear these ordinary superficial ideas regarding the\nhistory of Philosophy which have to be referred to and corrected. As\nregards these very current views, which are doubtless known to you,\ngentlemen, for indeed they are the reflections most likely to occur\nin one\u2019s first crude thoughts on a history of Philosophy, I will\nshortly explain what requires explanation, and the explanation of the\ndifferences in philosophies will lead us further into the matter itself.\na. _The History of Philosophy as an accumulation of Opinions._\nHistory, at the first glance, includes in its aim the narration of\nthe accidental circumstances of times, of races, and of individuals,\ntreated impartially partly as regards their relation in time,\nand partly as to their content. The appearance of contingency in\ntime-succession is to be dealt with later on. It is contingency of\ncontent which is the idea with which we have first to deal\u2014the idea of\ncontingent actions. But thoughts and not external actions, or griefs,\nor joys, form the content of Philosophy. Contingent thoughts, however,\nare nothing but opinions, and philosophical opinions are opinions\nrelating to the more special content of Philosophy, regarding God,\nNature and Spirit.\nThus we now meet the view very usually taken of the history of\nPhilosophy which ascribes to it the narration of a number of\nphilosophical opinions as they have arisen and manifested themselves\nin time. This kind of matter is in courtesy called opinions; those who\nthink themselves more capable of judging rightly, call such a history\na display of senseless follies, or at least of errors made by men\nengrossed in thought and in mere ideas. This view is not only held by\nthose who recognize their ignorance of Philosophy. Those who do this,\nacknowledge it, because that ignorance is, in common estimation, held\nto be no obstacle to giving judgment upon what has to do with the\nsubject; for it is thought that anybody can form a judgment on its\ncharacter and value without any comprehension, of it whatever. But\nthe same view is even held by those who write or have written on the\nhistory of Philosophy. This history, considered only as the enumeration\nof various opinions, thus becomes an idle tale, or, if you will, an\nerudite investigation. For erudition is, in the main, acquaintance with\na number of useless things, that is to say, with that which has no\nintrinsic interest or value further than being known. Yet it is thought\nthat profit is to be derived from learning the various opinions and\nreflections of other men. It stimulates the powers of thought and also\nleads to many excellent reflections; this signifies that now and then\nit occasions an idea, and its art thus consists in the spinning one\nopinion out of the other.\nIf the history of Philosophy merely represented various opinions in\narray, whether they be of God or of natural and spiritual things\nexistent, it would be a most superfluous and tiresome science, no\nmatter what advantage might be brought forward as derived from such\nthought-activity and learning. What can be more useless than to learn\na string of bald opinions, and what more unimportant? Literary works,\nbeing histories of Philosophy in the sense that they produce and\ntreat the ideas of Philosophy as if they were opinions, need be only\nsuperficially glanced at to find how dry and destitute of interest\neverything about them is.\nAn opinion is a subjective conception, an uncontrolled thought, an\nidea which may occur to me in one direction or in another: an opinion\nis mine,[3] it is in itself a universal thought which is existent in\nand for itself. But Philosophy possesses no opinions, for there is no\nsuch thing as philosophical opinions. When we hear a man speaking of\nphilosophical opinions, even though he be an historian of philosophy\nitself, we detect at once this want of fundamental education.\nPhilosophy is the objective science of truth, it is science of\nnecessity, conceiving knowledge, and neither opinion nor the spinning\nout of opinions.\nThe more precise significance of this idea is that we get to know\nopinions only, thus laying emphasis upon the word Opinion. Now the\ndirect opposite of opinion is the Truth; it is Truth before which\nmere opinion pales. Those who in the history of Philosophy seek mere\ntheories, or who suppose that on the whole only such are to be found\nwithin it, also turn aside when that word Truth confronts them.\nPhilosophy here encounters opposition from two different sides. On the\none hand piety openly declares Reason or Thought to be incapable of\napprehending what is true, and to lead only to the abyss of doubt; it\ndeclares that independent thought must be renounced, and reason held in\nbounds by faith in blind authority, if Truth is to be reached. Of the\nrelation existing between Religion and Philosophy and of its history,\nwe shall deal later on. On the other hand, it is known just as well,\nthat so-called reason has maintained its rights, abandoning faith in\nmere authority, and has endeavoured to make Christianity rational, so\nthat throughout it is only my personal insight and conviction which\nobliges me to make any admissions. But this affirmation of the right\nof reason is turned round in an astonishing manner, so that it results\nin making knowledge of the truth through reason an impossibility.\nThis so-called reason on the one hand has combated religious faith in\nthe name and power of thinking reason, and at the same time it has\nitself turned against reason and is true reason\u2019s adversary. Instinct\nand feeling are maintained by it against the true reason, thus making\nthe measure of true value the merely subjective\u2014that is a particular\nconviction such as each can form in and for himself in his subjective\ncapacity. A personal conviction such as this is no more than the\nparticular opinion that has become final for men.\nIf we begin with what meets us in our very first conceptions, we cannot\nneglect to make mention of this aspect in the history of Philosophy.\nIn its results it permeates culture generally, being at once the\nmisconception and true sign of our times. It is the principle through\nwhich men mutually understand and know each other; an hypothesis\nwhose value is established and which is the ground of all the other\nsciences. In theology it is not so much the creed of the church that\npasses for Christianity, as that every one to a greater or less degree\nmakes a Christianity of his own to tally with his conviction. And in\nhistory we often see theology driven into acquiring the knowledge of\nvarious opinions in order that an interest may thus be furnished to\nthe science, and one of the first results of the attention paid them\nis the honour awarded to all convictions, and the esteem vouchsafed to\nwhat has been constituted merely by the individual. The endeavour to\nknow the Truth is then of course relinquished. It is true that personal\nconviction is the ultimate and absolute essential which reason and its\nphilosophy, from a subjective point of view, demand in knowledge. But\nthere is a distinction between conviction when it rests on subjective\ngrounds such as feelings, speculations and perceptions, or, speaking\ngenerally, on the particular nature of the subject, and when it rests\non thought proceeding from acquaintance with the Notion and the nature\nof the thing. In the former case conviction is opinion.\nThis opposition between mere opinion and truth now sharply defined, we\nalready recognize in the culture of the period of Socrates and Plato\u2014a\nperiod of corruption in Greek life\u2014as the Platonic opposition between\nopinion _\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1_ and Science _\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7_. It is the same opposition as\nthat which existed in the decadence of Roman public and political life\nunder Augustus, and subsequently when Epicureanism and indifference set\nthemselves up against Philosophy. Under this influence, when Christ\nsaid, \u201cI came into the world that I should bear witness unto the\nTruth,\u201d Pilate answered, \u201cWhat is Truth?\u201d That was said in a superior\nway, and signifies that this idea of truth is an expedient which is\nobsolete: we have got further, we know that there is no longer any\nquestion about knowing the Truth, seeing that we have gone beyond it.\nWho makes this statement has gone beyond it indeed. If this is made our\nstarting point in the history of Philosophy, its whole significance\nwill consist in finding out the particular ideas of others, each one of\nwhich is different from the other: these individual points of view are\nthus foreign to me: my thinking reason is not free, nor is it present\nin them: for me they are but extraneous, dead historic matter, or so\nmuch empty content, and to satisfy oneself with empty vanity is mere\nsubjective vanity itself.\nTo the impartial man, the Truth has always been a heart-stirring word\nand one of great import. As to the assertion that the Truth cannot be\nknown, we shall consider it more closely in the history of Philosophy\nitself where it appears. The only thing to be here remarked is that\nif this assumption be allowed, as was the case with Tennemann, it is\nbeyond conception why anyone should still trouble about Philosophy,\nsince each opinion asserts falsely in its turn that it has found\nthe truth. This immediately recalls to me the old belief that Truth\nconsists in knowledge, but that an individual only knows the Truth in\nso far as he reflects and not as he walks and stands: and that the\nTruth cannot be known in immediate apprehension and perception, whether\nit be external and sensuous, or whether it be intellectual perception\n(for every perception as a perception is sensuous) but only through the\nlabour of thought.\nb. _Proof of the futility of Philosophical Knowledge obtained through\nthe History of Philosophy itself._\nFrom another point of view another consequence ensues from the above\nconception of the history of Philosophy which may at will be looked\nat as an evil or a benefit. In view of such manifold opinions and\nphilosophical systems so numerous, one is perplexed to know which\none ought to be accepted. In regard to the great matters to which\nman is attracted and a knowledge of which Philosophy would bestow,\nit is evident that the greatest minds have erred, because they have\nbeen contradicted by others. \u201cSince this has been so with minds so\ngreat, how then can _ego homuncio_ attempt to form a judgment?\u201d This\nconsequence, which ensues from the diversity in philosophical systems,\nis, as may be supposed, the evil in the matter, while at the same time\nit is a subjective good. For this diversity is the usual plea urged by\nthose who, with an air of knowledge, wish to make a show of interest\nin Philosophy, to explain the fact that they, with this pretence of\ngood-will, and, indeed, with added motive for working at the science,\ndo in fact utterly neglect it. But this diversity in philosophical\nsystems is far from being merely an evasive plea. It has far more\nweight as a genuine serious ground of argument against the zeal\nwhich Philosophy requires. It justifies its neglect and demonstrates\nconclusively the powerlessness of the endeavour to attain to\nphilosophic knowledge of the truth. When it is admitted that Philosophy\nought to be a real science, and one Philosophy must certainly be the\ntrue, the question arises as to which Philosophy it is, and when it can\nbe known. Each one asserts its genuineness, each even gives different\nsigns and tokens by which the Truth can be discovered; sober reflective\nthought must therefore hesitate to give its judgment.\nThis, then, is the wider interest which the history of Philosophy is\nsaid to afford. Cicero (De natura Deorum I. 8 sq.) gives us from this\npoint of view, a most slovenly history of philosophic thought on God.\nHe puts it in the mouth of an Epicurean, but he himself knew of nothing\nmore favourable to say, and it is thus his own view. The Epicurean\nsays that no certain knowledge has been arrived at. The proof that\nthe efforts of philosophy are futile is derived directly from the\nusual superficial view taken of its history; the results attendant\non that history make it appear to be a process in which the most\nvarious thoughts arise in numerous philosophies, each of which opposes,\ncontradicts and refutes the other. This fact, which cannot be denied,\nseems to contain the justification, indeed the necessity for applying\nto Philosophy the words of Christ, \u201cLet the dead bury their dead;\narise, and follow Me.\u201d The whole of the history of Philosophy becomes\na battlefield covered with the bones of the dead; it is a kingdom\nnot merely formed of dead and lifeless individuals, but of refuted\nand spiritually dead systems, since each has killed and buried the\nother. Instead of \u201cFollow thou Me,\u201d here then it must indeed be said,\n\u201cFollow thine own self\u201d\u2014that is, hold by thine own convictions, remain\nsteadfast to thine own opinion, why adopt another?\nIt certainly happens that a new philosophy makes its appearance, which\nmaintains the others to be valueless; and indeed each one in turn\ncomes forth at first with the pretext that by its means all previous\nphilosophies not only are refuted, but what in them is wanting is\nsupplied, and now at length the right one is discovered. But following\nupon what has gone before, it would rather seem that other words of\nScripture are just as applicable to such a philosophy\u2014the words which\nthe Apostle Peter spoke to Ananias, \u201cBehold the feet of them that shall\ncarry thee out are at the door.\u201d Behold the philosophy by which thine\nown will be refuted and displaced shall not tarry long as it has not\ntarried before.\nc. _Explanatory remarks on the diversity in Philosophies._\nCertainly the fact is sufficiently well established that there are and\nhave been different philosophies. The Truth is, however, one; and the\ninstinct of reason maintains this irradicable intuition or belief. It\nis said that only one philosophy can be true, and, because philosophies\nare different, it is concluded that all others must be erroneous.\nBut, in fact, each one in turn gives every assurance, evidence and\nproof of being the one and true Philosophy. This is a common mode of\nreasoning and is what seems in truth to be the view of sober thought.\nAs regards the sober nature of the word at issue\u2014thought\u2014we can tell\nfrom every-day experience that if we fast we feel hunger either at once\nor very soon. But sober thought always has the fortunate power of not\nresulting in hunger and desire, but of being and remaining as it is,\ncontent. Hence the thought expressed in such an utterance reveals the\nfact that it is dead understanding; for it is only death which fasts\nand yet rests satisfied. But neither physical life nor intellectual\nremains content with mere abstention; as desire it presses on through\nhunger and through thirst towards Truth, towards knowledge itself. It\npresses on to satisfy this desire and does not allow itself to feast\nand find sufficiency in a reflection such as this.\nAs to this reflection, the next thing to be said of it is that however\ndifferent the philosophies have been, they had a common bond in\nthat they were Philosophy. Thus whoever may have studied or become\nacquainted with a philosophy, of whatever kind, provided only that it\nis such, has thereby become acquainted with Philosophy. That delusive\nmode of reasoning which regards diversity alone, and from doubt of\nor aversion to the particular form in which a Universal finds its\nactuality, will not grasp or even allow this universal nature, I\nhave elsewhere[4] likened to an invalid recommended by the doctor to\neat fruit, and who has cherries, plums or grapes, before him, but\nwho pedantically refuses to take anything because no part of what is\noffered him is fruit, some of it being cherries, and the rest plums or\ngrapes.\nBut it is really important to have a deeper insight into the bearings\nof this diversity in the systems of Philosophy. Truth and Philosophy\nknown philosophically, make such diversity appear in another light from\nthat of abstract opposition between Truth and Error. The explanation\nof how this comes about will reveal to us the significance of the\nwhole history of Philosophy. We must make the fact conceivable, that\nthe diversity and number of philosophies not only does not prejudice\nPhilosophy itself, that is to say the possibility of a philosophy,\nbut that such diversity is, and has been, absolutely necessary to the\nexistence of a science of Philosophy and that it is essential to it.\nThis makes it easy to us to comprehend the aim of Philosophy, which\nis in thought and in conception to grasp the Truth, and not merely\nto discover that nothing can be known, or that at least temporal,\nfinite truth, which also is an untruth, can alone be known and not\nthe Truth indeed. Further we find that in the history of Philosophy\nwe have to deal with Philosophy itself. The facts within that history\nare not adventures and contain no more romance than does the history\nof the world. They are not a mere collection of chance events, of\nexpeditions of wandering knights, each going about fighting, struggling\npurposelessly, leaving no results to show for all his efforts. Nor is\nit so that one thing has been thought out here, another there, at will;\nin the activity of thinking mind there is real connection, and what\nthere takes place is rational. It is with this belief in the spirit of\nthe world that we must proceed to history, and in particular to the\nhistory of Philosophy.\n2. EXPLANATORY REMARKS UPON THE DEFINITION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.\nThe above statement, that the Truth is only one, is still abstract\nand formal. In the deeper sense it is our starting point. But the\naim of Philosophy is to know this one Truth as the immediate source\nfrom which all else proceeds, both all the laws of nature and all\nthe manifestations of life and consciousness of which they are\nmere reflections, or to lead these laws and manifestations in ways\napparently contrary, back to that single source, and from that source\nto comprehend them, which is to understand their derivation. Thus what\nis most essential is to know that the single truth is not merely a\nsolitary, empty thought, but one determined within itself. To obtain\nthis knowledge we must enter into some abstract Notions which, as\nsuch, are quite general and dry, and which are the two principles of\n_Development_ and of the _Concrete_. We could, indeed, embrace the\nwhole in the single principle of development; if this were clear, all\nelse would result and follow of its own accord. The product of thinking\nis the thought; thought is, however, still formal; somewhat more\ndefined it becomes Notion, and finally Idea is Thought in its totality,\nimplicitly and explicitly determined. Thus the Idea, and it alone is\nTruth. Now it is essentially in the nature of the Idea to develop, and\nonly through development to arrive at comprehension of itself, or to\nbecome what it is. That the Idea should have to make itself what it is,\nseems like a contradiction; it may be said that it is what it is.\na. _The Notion of Development._\nThe idea of development is well known, but it is the special\ncharacteristic of Philosophy to investigate such matters as were\nformerly held as known. What is dealt with or made use of without\nconsideration as an aid to daily life, is certainly the unknown to man\nunless he be informed in Philosophy. The further discussion of this\nidea belongs to the science of Logic.\nIn order to comprehend what development is, what may be called two\ndifferent states must be distinguished. The first is what is known as\ncapacity, power, what I call being-in-itself (_potentia_, _\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2_);\nthe second principle is that of being-for-itself, actuality (_actus_,\n_\u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1_). If we say, for example, that man is by nature rational,\nwe would mean that he has reason only inherently or in embryo: in this\nsense, reason, understanding, imagination, will, are possessed from\nbirth or even from the mother\u2019s womb. But while the child only has\ncapacities or the actual possibility of reason, it is just the same as\nif he had no reason; reason does not yet exist in him since he cannot\nyet do anything rational, and has no rational consciousness. Thus what\nman is at first implicitly becomes explicit, and it is the same with\nreason. If, then, man has actuality on whatever side, he is actually\nrational; and now we come to reason.\nWhat is the real meaning of this word? That which is in itself must\nbecome an object to mankind, must arrive at consciousness, thus\nbecoming for man. What has become an object to him is the same as what\nhe is in himself; through the becoming objective of this implicit\nbeing, man first becomes for himself; he is made double, is retained\nand not changed into another. For example, man is thinking, and thus he\nthinks out thoughts. In this way it is in thought alone that thought is\nobject; reason produces what is rational: reason is its own object. The\nfact that thought may also descend to what is destitute of reason is\na consideration involving wider issues, which do not concern us here.\nBut even though man, who in himself is rational, does not at first\nseem to have got further on since he became rational for himself\u2014what\nis implicit having merely retained itself\u2014the difference is quite\nenormous: no new content has been produced, and yet this form of\nbeing for self makes all the difference. The whole variation in the\ndevelopment of the world in history is founded on this difference.\nThis alone explains how since all mankind is naturally rational, and\nfreedom is the hypothesis on which this reason rests, slavery yet has\nbeen, and in part still is, maintained by many peoples, and men have\nremained contented under it. The only distinction between the Africans\nand the Asiatics on the one hand, and the Greeks, Romans, and moderns\non the other, is that the latter know and it is explicit for them, that\nthey are free, but the others are so without knowing that they are,\nand thus without existing as being free. This constitutes the enormous\ndifference in their condition. All knowledge, and learning, science,\nand even commerce have no other object than to draw out what is inward\nor implicit and thus to become objective.\nBecause that which is implicit comes into existence, it certainly\npasses into change, yet it remains one and the same, for the whole\nprocess is dominated by it. The plant, for example, does not lose\nitself in mere indefinite change. From the germ much is produced when\nat first nothing was to be seen; but the whole of what is brought\nforth, if not developed, is yet hidden and ideally contained within\nitself. The principle of this projection into existence is that\nthe germ cannot remain merely implicit, but is impelled towards\ndevelopment, since it presents the contradiction of being only implicit\nand yet not desiring so to be. But this coming without itself has\nan end in view; its completion fully reached, and its previously\ndetermined end is the fruit or produce of the germ, which causes a\nreturn to the first condition. The germ will produce itself alone and\nmanifest what is contained in it, so that it then may return to itself\nonce more thus to renew the unity from which it started. With nature it\ncertainly is true that the subject which commenced and the matter which\nforms the end are two separate units, as in the case of seed and fruit.\nThe doubling process has apparently the effect of separating into two\nthings that which in content is the same. Thus in animal life the\nparent and the young are different individuals although their nature is\nthe same.\nIn Mind it is otherwise: it is consciousness and therefore it is free,\nuniting in itself the beginning and the end. As with the germ in\nnature, Mind indeed resolves itself back into unity after constituting\nitself another. But what is in itself becomes for Mind and thus\narrives at being for itself. The fruit and seed newly contained within\nit on the other hand, do not become for the original germ, but for us\nalone; in the case of Mind both factors not only are implicitly the\nsame in character, but there is a being for the other and at the same\ntime a being for self. That for which the \u201cother\u201d is, is the same\nas that \u201cother;\u201d and thus alone Mind is at home with itself in its\n\u201cother.\u201d The development of Mind lies in the fact that its going forth\nand separation constitutes its coming to itself.\nThis being-at-home-with-self, or coming-to-self of Mind may be\ndescribed as its complete and highest end: it is this alone that it\ndesires and nothing else. Everything that from eternity has happened\nin heaven and earth, the life of God and all the deeds of time simply\nare the struggles for Mind to know itself, to make itself objective\nto itself, to find itself, be for itself, and finally unite itself to\nitself; it is alienated and divided, but only so as to be able thus to\nfind itself and return to itself. Only in this manner does Mind attain\nits freedom, for that is free which is not connected with or dependent\non another. True self-possession and satisfaction are only to be found\nin this, and in nothing else but Thought does Mind attain this freedom.\nIn sense-perception, for instance, and in feeling, I find myself\nconfined and am not free; but I am free when I have a consciousness of\nthis my feeling. Man has particular ends and interests even in will; I\nam free indeed when this is mine. Such ends, however, always contain\n\u201canother,\u201d or something which constitutes for me \u201canother,\u201d such as\ndesire and impulse. It is in Thought alone that all foreign matter\ndisappears from view, and that Mind is absolutely free. All interest\nwhich is contained in the Idea and in Philosophy is expressed in it.\nb. _The Notion of the Concrete._\nAs to development, it may be asked, what does develop and what forms\nthe absolute content? Development is considered in the light of a\nformal process in action and as destitute of content. But the act\nhas no other end but activity, and through this activity the general\ncharacter of the content is already fixed. For being-in-self and\nbeing-for-self are the moments present in action; but the act is the\nretention of these diverse elements within itself. The act thus is\nreally one, and it is just this unity of differences which is the\nconcrete. Not only is the act concrete, but also the implicit, which\nstands to action in the relation of subject which begins, and finally\nthe product is just as concrete as the action or as the subject which\nbegins. Development in process likewise forms the content, the Idea\nitself; for this we must have the one element and then the other: both\ncombined will form a unity as third, because the one in the other is\nat home with, and not without, itself. Thus the Idea is in its content\nconcrete within itself, and this in two ways: first it is concrete\npotentially, and then it is its interest that what is in itself should\nbe there for it.\nIt is a common prejudice that the science of Philosophy deals only with\nabstractions and empty generalities, and that sense-perception, our\nempirical self-consciousness, natural instinct, and the feelings of\nevery-day life, lie, on the contrary, in the region of the concrete and\nthe self-determined. As a matter of fact, Philosophy is in the region\nof thought, and has therefore to deal with universals; its content\nis abstract, but only as to form and element. In itself the Idea is\nreally concrete, for it is the union of the different determinations.\nIt is here that reasoned knowledge differs from mere knowledge of the\nunderstanding, and it is the business of Philosophy, as opposed to\nunderstanding, to show that the Truth or the Idea does not consist\nin empty generalities, but in a universal; and that is within itself\nthe particular and the determined. If the Truth is abstract it must\nbe untrue. Healthy human reason goes out towards what is concrete;\nthe reflection of the understanding comes first as abstract and\nuntrue, correct in theory only, and amongst other things unpractical.\nPhilosophy is what is most antagonistic to abstraction, and it leads\nback to the concrete.\nIf we unite the Notion of the concrete with that of development we have\nthe motion of the concrete. Since the implicit is already concrete\nwithin itself, and we only set forth what is implicitly there, the new\nform which now looks different and which was formerly shut up in the\noriginal unity, is merely distinguished. The concrete must become for\nitself or explicit; as implicit or potential it is only differentiated\nwithin itself, not as yet explicitly set forth, but still in a state\nof unity. The concrete is thus simple, and yet at the same time\ndifferentiated. This, its inward contradiction, which is indeed the\nimpelling force in development, brings distinction into being. But\nthus, too, its right to be taken back and reinstated extends beyond\nthe difference; for its truth is only to be found in unity. Life, both\nthat which is in Nature and that which is of the Idea, of Mind within\nitself, is thus manifested. Were the Idea abstract, it would simply be\nthe highest conceivable existence, and that would be all that could\nbe said of it; but such a God is the product of the understanding of\nmodern times. What is true is rather found in motion, in a process,\nhowever, in which there is rest; difference, while it lasts, is but a\ntemporary condition, through which comes unity, full and concrete.\nWe may now proceed to give examples of sensuous things, which will help\nus further to explain this Notion of the concrete. Although the flower\nhas many qualities, such as smell, taste, form, colour, &c., yet it is\none. None of these qualities could be absent in the particular leaf or\nflower: each individual part of the leaf shares alike all the qualities\nof the leaf entire. Gold, similarly contains in every particle all\nits qualities unseparated and entire. It is frequently allowed with\nsensuous things that such varied elements may be joined together, but,\nin the spiritual, differentiation is supposed to involve opposition. We\ndo not controvert the fact, or think it contradictory, that the smell\nand taste of the flower, although otherwise opposed, are yet clearly\nin one subject; nor do we place the one against the other. But the\nunderstanding and understanding thought find everything of a different\nkind, placed in conjunction, to be incompatible. Matter, for example,\nis complex and coherent, or space is continuous and uninterrupted.\nLikewise we may take separate points in space and break up matter\ndividing it ever further into infinity. It then is said that matter\nconsists of atoms and points, and hence is not continuous. Therefore\nwe have here the two determinations of continuity and of definite\npoints, which understanding regards as mutually exclusive, combined\nin one. It is said that matter must be clearly either continuous or\ndivisible into points, but in reality it has both these qualities. Or\nwhen we say of the mind of man that it has freedom, the understanding\nat once brings up the other quality, which in this case is necessity,\nsaying, that if Mind is free it is not in subjection to necessity, and,\ninversely, if its will and thought are determined through necessity, it\nis not free\u2014the one, they say, excludes the other. The distinctions\nhere are regarded as exclusive, and not as forming something concrete.\nBut that which is true, the Mind, is concrete, and its attributes are\nfreedom and necessity. Similarly the higher point of view is that Mind\nis free in its necessity, and finds its freedom in it alone, since\nits necessity rests on its freedom. But it is more difficult for us\nto show the unity here than in the case of natural objects. Freedom\ncan, however, be also abstract freedom without necessity, which\nfalse freedom is self-will, and for that reason it is self-opposed,\nunconsciously limited, an imaginary freedom which is free in form\nalone.\nThe fruit of development, which comes third, is a result of motion,\nbut inasmuch as it is merely the result of one stage in development,\nas being last in this stage, it is both the starting point and the\nfirst in order in another such stage. Goethe somewhere truly says,\n\u201cThat which is formed ever resolves itself back into its elements.\u201d\nMatter\u2014which as developed has form\u2014constitutes once more the material\nfor a new form. Mind again takes as its object and applies its activity\nto the Notion in which in going within itself, it has comprehended\nitself, which it is in form and being, and which has just been\nseparated from it anew. The application of thought to this, supplies it\nwith the form and determination of thought. This action thus further\nforms the previously formed, gives it additional determinations, makes\nit more determinate in itself, further developed and more profound. As\nconcrete, this activity is a succession of processes in development\nwhich must be represented not as a straight line drawn out into vague\ninfinity, but as a circle returning within itself, which, as periphery,\nhas very many circles, and whose whole is a large number of processes\nin development turning back within themselves.\nc. _Philosophy as the apprehension of the development of the Concrete._\nHaving thus generally explained the nature of the Concrete, I now add\nas regards its import, that the Truth thus determined within itself\nis impelled towards development. It is only the living and spiritual\nwhich internally bestirs and develops itself. Thus the Idea as concrete\nin itself, and self-developing, is an organic system and a totality\nwhich contains a multitude of stages and of moments in development.\nPhilosophy has now become for itself the apprehension of this\ndevelopment, and as conceiving Thought, is itself this development in\nThought. The more progress made in this development, the more perfect\nis the Philosophy.\nThis development goes no further out than into externality, but the\ngoing without itself of development also is a going inwards. That\nis to say, the universal Idea continues to remain at the foundation\nand still is the all-embracing and unchangeable. While in Philosophy\nthe going out of the Idea in course of its development is not a\nchange, a becoming \u201canother,\u201d but really is a going within itself,\na self-immersion, the progress forward makes the Idea which was\npreviously general and undetermined, determined within itself. Further\ndevelopment of the Idea or its further determination is the same\nthing exactly. Depth seems to signify intensiveness, but in this case\nthe most extensive is also the most intensive. The more intensive is\nthe Mind, the more extensive is it, hence the larger is its embrace.\nExtension as development, is not dispersion or falling asunder, but\na uniting bond which is the more powerful and intense as the expanse\nof that embraced is greater in extent and richer. In such a case what\nis greater is the strength of opposition and of separation; and the\ngreater power overcomes the greater separation.\nThese are the abstract propositions regarding the nature of the Idea\nand of its development, and thus within it Philosophy in its developed\nstate is constituted: it is one Idea in its totality and in all its\nindividual parts, like one life in a living being, one pulse throbs\nthroughout all its members. All the parts represented in it, and their\nsystematization, emanate from the one Idea; all these particulars are\nbut the mirrors and copies of this one life, and have their actuality\nonly in this unity. Their differences and their various qualities are\nonly the expression of the Idea and the form contained within it. Thus\nthe Idea is the central point, which is also the periphery, the source\nof light, which in all its expansion does not come without itself, but\nremains present and immanent within itself. Thus it is both the system\nof necessity and its own necessity, which also constitutes its freedom.\n3. RESULTS OBTAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTION OF THE HISTORY OF\nPHILOSOPHY.\nThus we see that Philosophy is system in development; the history of\nPhilosophy is the same; and this is the main point to be noted and the\nfirst principle to be dealt with in this treatise on that history. In\norder to make this evident, the difference in respect to the possible\nmodes of manifestation must first be pointed out. That is to say, the\nprogression of the various stages in the advance of Thought may occur\nwith the consciousness of necessity, in which case each in succession\ndeduces itself, and this form and this determination can alone emerge.\nOr else it may come about without this consciousness as does a natural\nand apparently accidental process, so that while inwardly, indeed,\nthe Notion brings about its result consistently, this consistency is\nnot made manifest. This is so in nature; in the various stages of the\ndevelopment of twigs, leaves, blossom and fruit, each proceeds for\nitself, but the inward Idea is the directing and determining force\nwhich governs the progression. This is also so with the child whose\nbodily powers, and above all whose intellectual activities, make their\nappearance one after the other, simply and naturally, so that those\nparents who form such an experience for the first time, marvel whence\nall that is now showing itself from within, comes from; for the whole\nof these manifestations merely have the form of a succession in time.\nThe one kind of progression which represents the deduction of the\nforms, the necessity thought out and recognized, of the determinations,\nis the business of Philosophy; and because it is the pure Idea which\nis in question and not yet its mere particularized form as Nature and\nas Mind, that representation is, in the main, the business of logical\nPhilosophy. But the other method, which represents the part played by\nthe history of Philosophy, shows the different stages and moments in\ndevelopment in time, in manner of occurrence, in particular places,\nin particular people or political circumstances, the complications\narising thus, and, in short, it shows us the empirical form. This point\nof view is the only one worthy of this science. From the very nature\nof the subject it is inherently the true one, and through the study of\nthis history it will be made manifest that it actually shows and proves\nitself so.\nNow in reference to this Idea, I maintain that the sequence in the\nsystems of Philosophy in History is similar to the sequence in the\nlogical deduction of the Notion-determinations in the Idea. I maintain\nthat if the fundamental conceptions of the systems appearing in the\nhistory of Philosophy be entirely divested of what regards their\noutward form, their relation to the particular and the like, the\nvarious stages in the determination of the Idea are found in their\nlogical Notion. Conversely in the logical progression taken for\nitself, there is, so far as its principal elements are concerned,\nthe progression of historical manifestations; but it is necessary to\nhave these pure Notions in order to know what the historical form\ncontains. It may be thought that Philosophy must have another order as\nto the stages in the Idea than that in which these Notions have gone\nforth in time; but in the main the order is the same. This succession\nundoubtedly separates itself, on the one hand, into the sequence in\ntime of History, and on the other into succession in the order of\nideas. But to treat more fully of this last would divert us too far\nfrom our aim.\nI would only remark this, that what has been said reveals that the\nstudy of the history of Philosophy is the study of Philosophy itself,\nfor, indeed, it can be nothing else. Whoever studies the history of\nsciences such as Physics and Mathematics, makes himself acquainted with\nPhysics and Mathematics themselves. But in order to obtain a knowledge\nof its progress as the development of the Idea in the empirical,\nexternal form in which Philosophy appears in History, a corresponding\nknowledge of the Idea is absolutely essential, just as in judging of\nhuman affairs one must have a conception of that which is right and\nfitting. Else, indeed, as in so many histories of Philosophy, there is\npresented to the vision devoid of idea, only a disarranged collection\nof opinions. To make you acquainted with this Idea, and consequently\nto explain the manifestations, is the business of the history of\nPhilosophy, and to do this is my object in undertaking to lecture on\nthe subject. Since the observer must bring with him the Notion of\nthe subject in order to see it in its phenomenal aspect and in order\nto expose the object faithfully to view, we need not wonder at there\nbeing so many dull histories of Philosophy in which the succession of\nits systems are represented simply as a number of opinions, errors and\nfreaks of thought. They are freaks of thought which, indeed, have been\ndevised with a great pretension of acuteness and of mental exertion,\nand with everything else which can be said in admiration of what is\nmerely formal. But, considering the absence of philosophic mind in\nsuch historians as these, how should they be able to comprehend and\nrepresent the content, which is reasoned thought?\nIt is shown from what has been said regarding the formal nature of the\nIdea, that only a history of Philosophy thus regarded as a system of\ndevelopment in Idea, is entitled to the name of Science: a collection\nof facts constitutes no science. Only thus as a succession of phenomena\nestablished through reason, and having as content just what is reason\nand revealing it, does this history show that it is rational: it shows\nthat the events recorded are in reason. How should the whole of what\nhas taken place in reason not itself be rational? That faith must\nsurely be the more reasonable in which chance is not made ruler over\nhuman affairs, and it is the business of Philosophy to recognize that\nhowever much its own manifestations may be history likewise, it is yet\ndetermined through the Idea alone.\nThrough these general preliminary conceptions the categories are now\ndetermined, the more immediate application of which to the history of\nPhilosophy we have now to consider. This application will bring before\nus the most significant aspects in this history.\na. _The development in Time of the various Philosophies._\nThe first question which may be asked in reference to this history,\nconcerns that distinction in regard to the manifestation of the Idea,\nwhich has just been noticed. It is the question as to how it happens\nthat Philosophy appears to be a development in time and has a history.\nThe answer to this question encroaches on the metaphysics of Time, and\nit would be a digression from our object to give here more than the\nelements on which the answer rests.\nIt has been shown above in reference to the existence of Mind, that\nits Being is its activity. Nature, on the contrary, is, as it is; its\nchanges are thus only repetitions, and its movements take the form of a\ncircle merely. To express this better, the activity of Mind is to know\nitself. I am, immediately, but this I am only as a living organism;\nas Mind I am only in so far as I know myself. _\u0393\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd_, Know\nthyself, the inscription over the temple of the oracle at Delphi,\nis the absolute command which is expressed by Mind in its essential\ncharacter. But consciousness really implies that for myself, I am\nobject to myself. In forming this absolute division between what is\nmine and myself, Mind constitutes its existence and establishes itself\nas external to itself. It postulates itself in the externality which is\njust the universal and the distinctive form of existence in Nature. But\none of the forms of externality is Time, and this form requires to be\nfurther examined both in the Philosophy of Nature and the finite Mind.\nThis Being in existence and therefore Being in time is a moment not\nonly of the individual consciousness, which as such is essentially\nfinite, but also of the development of the philosophical Idea in the\nelement of Thought. For the Idea, thought of as being at rest, is,\nindeed, not in Time. To think of it as at rest, and to preserve it in\nthe form of immediacy is equivalent to its inward perception. But the\nIdea as concrete, is, as has been shown, the unity of differences; it\nis not really rest, and its existence is not really sense-perception,\nbut as differentiation within itself and therefore as development,\nit comes into existent Being and into externality in the element of\nThought, and thus pure Philosophy appears in thought as a progressive\nexistence in time. But this element of Thought is itself abstract and\nis the activity of a single consciousness. Mind is, however, not only\nto be considered as individual, finite consciousness, but as that\nMind which is universal and concrete within itself; this concrete\nuniversality, however, comprehends all the various sides and modes\nevolved in which it is and becomes object to the Idea. Thus Mind\u2019s\nthinking comprehension of self is at the same time the progression of\nthe total actuality evolved. This progression is not one which takes\nits course through the thought of an individual and exhibits itself\nin a single consciousness, for it shows itself to be universal Mind\npresenting itself in the history of the world in all the richness of\nits form. The result of this development is that one form, one stage in\nthe Idea comes to consciousness in one particular race, so that this\nrace and this time expresses only this particular form, within which it\nconstructs its universe and works out its conditions. The higher stage,\non the other hand, centuries later reveals itself in another race of\npeople.\nNow if we thus grasp the principles of the Concrete and of Development,\nthe nature of the manifold obtains quite another signification, and\nwhat is said of the diversity in philosophies as if the manifold were\nfixed and stationary and composed of what is mutually exclusive, is at\nonce refuted and relegated to its proper place. Such talk is that in\nwhich those who despise Philosophy think they possess an invincible\nweapon against it, and in their truly beggarly pride in their pitiful\nrepresentations of it, they are in perfect ignorance even of what they\nhave and what they have to know in any meagre ideas attained, such as\nin that of the manifold and diverse. Yet this category is one which\nanybody can understand; no difficulty is made in regard to it, for\nit is thoroughly known, and those who use it think they can do so as\nbeing entirely comprehensible\u2014as a matter of course they understand\nwhat it is. But those who believe the principle of diversity to be\none absolutely fixed, do not know its nature, or its dialectic; the\nmanifold or diverse is in a state of flux; it must really be conceived\nof as in the process of development, and as but a passing moment.\nPhilosophy in its concrete Idea is the activity of development in\nrevealing the differences which it contains within itself; these\ndifferences are thoughts, for we are now speaking of development in\nThought. In the first place, the differences which rest in the Idea\nare manifested as thoughts. Secondly, these distinctions must come\ninto existence, one here and the other there; and in order that they\nmay do this, they must be complete, that is, they must contain within\nthemselves the Idea in its totality. The concrete alone as including\nand supporting the distinctions, is the actual; it is thus, and thus\nalone, that the differences are in their form entire.\nA complete form of thought such as is here presented, is a Philosophy.\nBut the Idea contains the distinctions in a peculiar form. It may be\nsaid that the form is indifferent, and that the content, the Idea, is\nthe main consideration; and people think themselves quite moderate and\nreasonable when they state that the different philosophies all contain\nthe Idea, though in different forms, understanding by this that these\nforms are contingent. But everything hangs on this: these forms are\nnothing else than the original distinctions in the Idea itself, which\nis what it is only in them. They are in this way essential to, and\nconstitute the content of the Idea, which in thus sundering itself,\nattains to form. The manifold character of the principles which\nappear, is, however, not accidental, but necessary: the different\nforms constitute an integral part of the whole form. They are the\ndeterminations of the original Idea, which together constitute the\nwhole; but as being outside of one another, their union does not take\nplace in them, but in us, the observers. Each system is determined as\none, but it is not a permanent condition that the differences are thus\nmutually exclusive. The inevitable fate of these determinations must\nfollow, and that is that they shall be drawn together and reduced to\nelements or moments. The independent attitude taken up by each moment\nis again laid aside. After expansion, contraction follows\u2014the unity\nout of which they first emerged. This third may itself be but the\nbeginning of a further development. It may seem as if this progression\nwere to go on into infinitude, but it has an absolute end in view,\nwhich we shall know better later on; many turnings are necessary,\nhowever, before Mind frees itself in coming to consciousness.\nThe temple of self-conscious reason is to be considered from this the\npoint of view alone worthy of the history of Philosophy. It is hence\nrationally built by an inward master worker, and not in Solomon\u2019s\nmethod, as freemasons build. The great assumption that what has taken\nplace on this side, in the world, has also done so in conformity\nwith reason\u2014which is what first gives the history of Philosophy\nits true interest\u2014is nothing else than trust in Providence, only\nin another form. As the best of what is in the world is that which\nThought produces, it is unreasonable to believe that reason only is\nin Nature, and not in Mind. That man who believes that what, like the\nphilosophies, belongs to the region of mind must be merely contingent,\nis insincere in his belief in divine rule, and what he says of it is\nbut empty talk.\nA long time is undoubtedly required by Mind in working out Philosophy,\nand when one first reflects on it, the length of the time may seem\nastonishing, like the immensity of the space spoken of in astronomy.\nBut it must be considered in regard to the slow progress of the\nworld-spirit, that there is no need for it to hasten:\u2014\u201cA thousand\nyears are in Thy sight as one day.\u201d It has time enough just because it\nis itself outside of time, because it is eternal. The fleeting events\nof the day pass so quickly that there is not time enough for all that\nhas to be done. Who is there who does not die before he has achieved\nhis aims? The world-spirit has time enough, but that is not all. It\nis not time alone which has to be made use of in the acquisition of\na conception; much else is required. The fact that so many races and\ngenerations are devoted to these operations of its consciousness by\nMind, and that the appearance is so perpetually presented of rising\nup and passing away, concern it not at all; it is rich enough for\nsuch displays, it pursues its work on the largest possible scale,\nand has nations and individuals enough and to spare. The saying that\nNature arrives at its end in the shortest possible way, and that this\nis right, is a trivial one. The way shown by mind is indirect, and\naccommodates itself to circumstances. Considerations of finite life,\nsuch as time, trouble, and cost, have no place here. We ought, too, to\nfeel no disappointment that particular kinds of knowledge cannot yet be\nattained, or that this or that is still absent. In the history of the\nworld progression is slow.\nb. _The application of the foregoing to the treatment of Philosophy._\nThe first result which follows from what has been said, is that the\nwhole of the history of Philosophy is a progression impelled by an\ninherent necessity, and one which is implicitly rational and _\u00e0 priori_\ndetermined through its Idea; and this the history of Philosophy has to\nexemplify. Contingency must vanish on the appearance of Philosophy.\nIts history is just as absolutely determined as the development of\nNotions, and the impelling force is the inner dialectic of the forms.\nThe finite is not true, nor is it what it is to be\u2014its determinate\nnature is bound up with its existence. But the inward Idea abolishes\nthese finite forms: a philosophy which has not the absolute form\nidentical with the content, must pass away because its form is not that\nof truth.\nWhat follows, secondly from what we have said, is that every philosophy\nhas been and still is necessary. Thus none have passed away, but\nall are affirmatively contained as elements in a whole. But we must\ndistinguish between the particular principle of these philosophies as\nparticular, and the realization of this principle throughout the whole\ncompass of the world. The principles are retained, the most recent\nphilosophy being the result of all preceding, and hence no philosophy\nhas ever been refuted. What has been refuted is not the principle of\nthis philosophy, but merely the fact that this principle should be\nconsidered final and absolute in character. The atomic philosophy,\nfor example, has arrived at the affirmation that the atom is the\nabsolute existence, that it is the indivisible unit which is also the\nindividual or subject; seeing, then, that the bare unit also is the\nabstract being-for-self, the Absolute would be grasped as infinitely\nmany units. The atomic theory has been refuted, and we are atomists\nno longer. Mind is certainly explicitly existent as a unit or atom,\nbut that is to attribute to it a barren character and qualities\nincapable of expressing anything of its depth. The principle is indeed\nretained, although it is not the absolute in its entirety. This same\ncontradiction appears in all development. The development of the tree\nis the negation of the germ, and the blossom that of the leaves, in so\nfar as that they show that these do not form the highest and truest\nexistence of the tree. Last of all, the blossom finds its negation in\nthe fruit. Yet none of them can come into actual existence excepting\nas preceded by all the earlier stages. Our attitude to a philosophy\nmust thus contain an affirmative side and a negative; when we take both\nof these into consideration, we do justice to a philosophy for the\nfirst time. We get to know the affirmative side later on both in life\nand in science; thus we find it easier to refute than to justify.\nIn the third place, we shall limit ourselves to the particular\nconsideration of the principle itself. Each principle has reigned for a\ncertain time, and when the whole system of the world has been explained\nfrom this special form, it is called a philosophical system. Its whole\ntheory has certainly to be learned, but as long as the principle is\nabstract it is not sufficient to embrace the forms belonging to our\nconception of the world. The Cartesian principles, for instance, are\nvery suitable for application to mechanism, but for nothing further;\ntheir representation of other manifestations in the world, such as\nthose of vegetable and animal nature, are insufficient, and hence\nuninteresting. Therefore we take into consideration the principles of\nthese philosophies only, but in dealing with concrete philosophies\nwe must also regard the chief forms of their development and their\napplications. The subordinate philosophies are inconsistent; they have\nhad bright glimpses of the truth, which are, however, independent\nof their principles. This is exemplified in the Tim\u00e6us of Plato, a\nphilosophy of nature, the working out of which is empirically very\nbarren because its principle does not as yet extend far enough, and it\nis not to its principle that we owe the deep gleams of thought there\ncontained.\nIn the fourth place it follows that we must not regard the history\nof Philosophy as dealing with the past, even though it is history.\nThe scientific products of reason form the content of this history,\nand these are not past. What is obtained in this field of labour is\nthe True, and, as such, the Eternal; it is not what exists now, and\nnot then; it is true not only to-day or to-morrow, but beyond all\ntime, and in as far as it is in time, it is true always and for every\ntime. The bodily forms of those great minds who are the heroes of this\nhistory, the temporal existence and outward lives of the philosophers,\nare, indeed, no more, but their works and thoughts have not followed\nsuit, for they neither conceived nor dreamt of the rational import\nof their works. Philosophy is not somnambulism, but is developed\nconsciousness; and what these heroes have done is to bring that which\nis implicitly rational out of the depths of Mind, where it is found at\nfirst as substance only, or as inwardly existent, into the light of\nday, and to advance it into consciousness and knowledge. This forms a\ncontinuous awakening. Such work is not only deposited in the temple of\nMemory as forms of times gone by, but is just as present and as living\nnow as at the time of its production. The effects produced and work\nperformed are not again destroyed or interrupted by what succeeds, for\nthey are such that we must ourselves be present in them. They have as\nmedium neither canvas, paper, marble, nor representation or memorial\nto preserve them. These mediums are themselves transient, or else form\na basis for what is such. But they do have Thought, Notion, and the\neternal Being of Mind, which moths cannot corrupt, nor thieves break\nthrough and steal. The conquests made by Thought when constituted\ninto Thought form the very Being of Mind. Such knowledge is thus not\nlearning merely, or a knowledge of what is dead, buried and corrupt:\nthe history of Philosophy has not to do with what is gone, but with the\nliving present.\nc. _Further comparison between the History of Philosophy and Philosophy\nitself._\nWe may appropriate to ourselves the whole of the riches apportioned\nout in time: it must be shown from the succession in philosophies how\nthat succession is the systematization of the science of Philosophy\nitself. But a distinction is to be noted here: that which first\ncommences is implicit, immediate, abstract, general\u2014it is what has\nnot yet advanced; the more concrete and richer comes later, and the\nfirst is poorer in determinations. This may appear contrary to one\u2019s\nfirst impressions, but philosophic ideas are often enough directly\nopposed to ordinary ideas, and what is generally supposed, is not found\nto be the case. It may be thought that what comes first must be the\nconcrete. The child, for instance, as still in the original totality\nof his nature, is thought to be more concrete than the man, hence we\nimagine the latter to be more limited, no longer forming a totality,\nbut living an abstract life. Certainly the man acts in accordance with\ndefinite ends, not bringing his whole soul and mind into a subject,\nbut splitting his life into a number of abstract unities. The child\nand the youth, on the contrary, act straight from the fulness of the\nheart. Feeling and sense-perception come first, thought last, and thus\nfeeling appears to us to be more concrete than thought, or the activity\nof abstraction and of the universal. In reality, it is just the other\nway. The sensuous consciousness is certainly the more concrete, and if\npoorer in thought, at least richer in content. We must thus distinguish\nthe naturally concrete from the concrete of thought, which on its\nside, again, is wanting in sensuous matter. The child is also the most\nabstract and the poorest in thought: as to what pertains to nature, the\nman is abstract, but in thought he is more concrete than the child.\nMan\u2019s ends and objects are undoubtedly abstract in general affairs,\nsuch as in maintaining his family or performing his business duties,\nbut he contributes to a great objective organic whole, whose progress\nhe advances and directs. In the acts of a child, on the other hand,\nonly a childish and, indeed, momentary \u201cI,\u201d and in those of the youth\nthe subjective constitution or the random aim, form the principle\nof action. It is in this way that science is more concrete than\nsense-perception.\nIn applying this to the different forms of Philosophy, it follows in\nthe first place, that the earliest philosophies are the poorest and the\nmost abstract. In them the Idea is least determined; they keep merely\nto generalities not yet realized. This must be known in order that we\nmay not seek behind the old philosophies for more than we are entitled\nto find; thus we need not require from them determinations proceeding\nfrom a deeper consciousness. For instance, it has been asked whether\nthe philosophy of Thales is, properly speaking, Theism or Atheism,[5]\nwhether he asserted a personal God or merely an impersonal, universal\nexistence. The question here regards the attribution of subjectivity\nto the highest Idea, the conception of the Personality of God. Such\nsubjectivity as we comprehend it, is a much richer, more concentrated,\nand therefore much later conception, which need not be sought for in\ndistant ages. The Greek gods had, indeed, personality in imagination\nand idea like the one God of the Jewish religion, but to know what\nis the mere picture of fancy, and what the insight of pure Thought\nand Notion, is quite another thing. If we take as basis our own\nideas judged by these deeper conceptions, an ancient Philosophy may\nundoubtedly be spoken of as Atheism. But this expression would at the\nsame time be false, for the thoughts as thoughts in beginning, could\nnot have arrived at the development which we have reached.\nFrom this it follows\u2014since the progress of development is equivalent\nto further determination, and this means further immersion in and a\nfuller grasp of the Idea itself\u2014that the latest, most modern and\nnewest philosophy is the most developed, richest and deepest. In that\nphilosophy everything which at first seems to be past and gone must be\npreserved and retained, and it must itself be a mirror of the whole\nhistory. The original philosophy is the most abstract, because it is\nthe original and has not as yet made any movement forward; the last,\nwhich proceeds from this forward and impelling influence, is the\nmost concrete. This, as may at once be remarked, is no mere pride in\nthe philosophy of our time, because it is in the nature of the whole\nprocess that the more developed philosophy of a later time is really\nthe result of the previous operations of the thinking mind; and that\nit, pressed forwards and onwards from the earlier standpoints, has not\ngrown up on its own account or in a state of isolation.\nIt must also be recollected that we must not hesitate to say, what is\nnaturally implied, that the Idea, as comprehended and shown forth in\nthe latest and newest philosophy, is the most developed, the richest\nand deepest. I call this to remembrance because the designation, new\nor newest of all in reference to Philosophy, has become a very common\nby-word. Those who think they express anything by using such terms\nmight quite easily render thanks respecting any number of philosophies\njust as fast as their inclination directs, regarding either every\nshooting-star and even every candle-gleam in the light of a sun, or\nelse calling every popular cry a philosophy, and adducing as proof that\nat any rate there are so many philosophies that every day one displaces\nanother. Thus they have the category in which they can place any\napparently significant philosophy, and through which they may at the\nsame time set it aside; this they call a fashion-philosophy.\n\u201cScoffer, thou call\u2019st this but a fleeting phase\nWhen the Spirit of Man once again and anew,\nStrives earnestly on, towards forms that are higher.\u201d\nA second consequence has regard to the treatment of the older\nphilosophies. Such insight also prevents us from ascribing any blame\nto the philosophies when we miss determinations in them which were not\nyet present to their culture, and similarly it prevents our burdening\nthem with deductions and assertions which were neither made nor thought\nof by them, though they might correctly enough allow themselves to\nbe derived from the thought of such a philosophy. It is necessary\nto set to work on an historical basis, and to ascribe to Philosophy\nwhat is immediately given to us, and that alone. Errors crop up here\nin most histories of Philosophy, since we may see in them a number\nof metaphysical propositions ascribed to a philosopher and given out\nas an historical statement of the views which he has propounded, of\nwhich he neither thought nor knew a word, and of which there is not\nthe slightest trace found in history. Thus in Brucker\u2019s great History\nof Philosophy (Pt. I. pp. 465-478 seq.) a list of thirty, forty, or a\nhundred theorems are quoted from Thales and others, no idea of which\ncan be traced in history as having been present to these philosophers.\nThere are also propositions in support of them and citations taken\nfrom discussions of a similar kind with which we may occupy ourselves\nlong enough. Brucker\u2019s method is to endow the single theorem of an\nancient philosopher with all the consequences and premises which must,\naccording to the idea of the Wolffian Metaphysics, be the premises and\nconclusions of that theorem, and thus easily to produce a simple, naked\nfiction as if it were an actual historical fact. Thus, according to\nBrucker, Thales said, _Ex nihilo fit nihil_, since he said that water\nwas eternal. Thus, too, he was to be counted amongst the philosophers\nwho deny creation out of nothing; and of this, historically at least,\nThales was ignorant. Professor Ritter, too, whose history of Ionic\nPhilosophy is carefully written, and who on the whole is cautious not\nto introduce foreign matter, has very possibly ascribed to Thales more\nthan is found in history. He says (pp. 12, 13), \u201cHence we must regard\nthe view of nature which we find in Thales as dynamic in principle.\nHe regarded the world as the all-embracing, living animal which\nhas developed from a germ like every other animal, and this germ,\nlike that of all other animals, is either damp or water. Thus the\nfundamental idea of Thales is that the world is a living whole which\nhas developed from a germ and carries on its life as does an animal,\nby means of nourishment suitable to its nature\u201d (cf. p. 16). This is\nquite a different account from that of Aristotle, and none of it is\ncommunicated by the ancients regarding Thales. The sequence of thought\nis evident, but historically it is not justified. We ought not by such\ndeductions to make an ancient philosophy into something quite different\nfrom what it originally was.\nWe are too apt to mould the ancient philosophers into our own forms of\nthought, but this is just to constitute the progress of development;\nthe difference in times, in culture and in philosophies, depends on\nwhether certain reflections, certain thought determinations, and\ncertain stages in the Notion have come to consciousness, whether a\nconsciousness has been developed to a particular point or not. The\nhistory of Philosophy has simply to deal with this development and\nbringing forth of thought. The determinations involved certainly follow\nfrom a proposition, but whether they are put forth as yet or not is\nquite another thing, and the bringing forth of the inner content is the\nonly matter of importance. We must therefore only make use of the words\nwhich are actually literal, for to use further thought determinations\nwhich do not yet belong to the consciousness of the philosopher in\nquestion, is to carry on development. Thus Aristotle states that\nThales has defined the principle (_\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae_) of every thing to be water.\nBut Anaximander first made use of _\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae_, and Thales thus did not\npossess this determination of thought at all; he recognized _\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae_ as\ncommencement in time, but not as the fundamental principle. Thales did\nnot once introduce the determination of cause into his philosophy, and\nfirst cause is a further determination still. There are whole nations\nwhich have not this conception at all; indeed it involves a great step\nforward in development. And seeing that difference in culture on the\nwhole depends on difference in the thought determinations which are\nmanifested, this must be so still more with respect to philosophies.\nNow, as in the logical system of thought each of its forms has its\nown place in which alone it suffices, and this form becomes, by means\nof ever-progressing development, reduced to a subordinate element,\neach philosophy is, in the third place, a particular stage in the\ndevelopment of the whole process and has its definite place where it\nfinds its true value and significance. Its special character is really\nto be conceived of in accordance with this determination, and it is to\nbe considered with respect to this position in order that full justice\nmay be done to it. On this account nothing more must be demanded or\nexpected from it than what it actually gives, and the satisfaction\nis not to be sought for in it, which can only be found in a fuller\ndevelopment of knowledge. We must not expect to find the questions of\nour consciousness and the interest of the present world responded to\nby the ancients; such questions presuppose a certain development in\nthought. Therefore every philosophy belongs to its own time and is\nrestricted by its own limitations, just because it is the manifestation\nof a particular stage in development. The individual is the offspring\nof his people, of his world, whose constitution and attributes are\nalone manifested in his form; he may spread himself out as he will, he\ncannot escape out of his time any more than out of his skin, for he\nbelongs to the one universal Mind which is his substance and his own\nexistence. How should he escape from this? It is the same universal\nMind that is embraced by thinking Philosophy; that Philosophy is\nMind\u2019s thought of itself and therefore its determinate and substantial\ncontent. Every philosophy is the philosophy of its own day, a link in\nthe whole chain of spiritual development, and thus it can only find\nsatisfaction for the interests belonging to its own particular time.\nOn this account an earlier philosophy does not give satisfaction\nto the mind in which a deeper conception reigns. What Mind seeks\nfor in Philosophy is this conception which already constitutes its\ninward determination and the root of its existence conceived of as\nobject to thought; Mind demands a knowledge of itself. But in the\nearlier philosophy the Idea is not yet present in this determinate\ncharacter. Hence the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, and indeed\nall philosophies, ever live and are present in their principles, but\nPhilosophy no longer has the particular form and aspect possessed\nby that of Plato and of Aristotle. We cannot rest content with\nthem, and they cannot be revived; hence there can be no Platonists,\nAristotelians, Stoics, or Epicureans to-day. To re-awaken them would\nbe to try to bring back to an earlier stage the Mind of a deeper\nculture and self-penetration. But this cannot be the case; it would be\nan impossibility and as great a folly as were a man to wish to expend\nhis energies in attaining the standpoint of the youth, the youth in\nendeavouring to be the boy or child again; whereas the man, the youth,\nand the child, are all one and the same individual. The period of\nrevival in the sciences, the new epoch in learning which took place in\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, began not only with the revived\nstudy of, but also with the re-animation of the old philosophies.\nMarsilius Ficinus was a Platonist; an Academy of Platonic philosophy\nwas established and installed with professors by Cosmos de Medici, and\nFicinus was placed at the head of it. There were pure Aristotelians\nlike Pomponius: Gassendi later on maintained the Epicurean philosophy,\nfor his philosophy dealt with Physics after the manner of the\nEpicureans; Lipsius wished to be a Stoic, and so on. The sense of\nopposition was so great, ancient philosophy and Christianity\u2014from or\nin which no special philosophy had developed\u2014were so diverse, that\nno philosophy peculiar to itself could develop in Christianity. What\nwas or could be had as philosophy, either in conformity with or in\nopposition to Christianity, was a certain ancient philosophy which was\nthus taken up anew. But mummies when brought amongst living beings\ncannot there remain. Mind had for long possessed a more substantial\nlife, a more profound Notion of itself, and hence its thought had\nhigher needs than such as could be satisfied by these philosophies.\nA revival such as this is then to be regarded only as the transitory\nperiod in which we learn to know the forms which are implied and which\nhave gone before, and as the renewal of former struggles through the\nsteps necessary in development. Such reconstructions and repetitions in\na distant time of principles which have become foreign to Mind, are in\nhistory transitory only, and formed in a language which is dead. Such\nthings are translations only and not originals, and Mind does not find\nsatisfaction excepting in knowledge of its own origination.\nWhen modern times are in the same way called upon to revert to the\nstandpoint of an ancient philosophy (as is recommended specially in\nregard to the philosophy of Plato) in order to make this a means of\nescaping from the complications and difficulties of succeeding times,\nthis reversion does not come naturally as in the first case. This\ndiscreet counsel has the same origin as the request to cultivated\nmembers of society to turn back to the customs and ideas of the savages\nof the North American forests, or as the recommendation to adopt the\nreligion of Melchisedec which Fichte[6] has maintained to be the\npurest and simplest possible, and therefore the one at which we must\neventually arrive. On the one hand, in this retrogression the desire\nfor an origin and for a fixed point of departure is unmistakable,\nbut such must be sought for in thought and Idea alone and not in an\nauthoritatively given form. On the other hand, the return of the\ndeveloped, enriched Mind to a simplicity such as this\u2014which means to\nan abstraction, an abstract condition or thought\u2014is to be regarded\nonly as the escape of an incapacity which cannot enjoy the rich\nmaterial of development which it sees before it, and which demands to\nbe controlled and comprehended in its very depths by thought, but seeks\na refuge in fleeing from the difficulty and in mere sterility.\nFrom what has been said it is quite comprehensible how so many of\nthose who, whether induced by some special attraction such as this,\nor simply by the fame of a Plato or ancient philosophy in general,\ndirect their way thereto in order to draw their own philosophy from\nthese sources, do not find themselves satisfied by the study, and\nunjustifiably quit such altogether. Satisfaction is found in them to\na certain extent only. We must know in ancient philosophy or in the\nphilosophy of any given period, what we are going to look for. Or at\nleast we must know that in such a philosophy there is before us a\ndefinite stage in the development of thought, and in it those forms\nand necessities of Mind which lie within the limits of that stage\nalone are brought into existence. There slumber in the Mind of modern\ntimes ideas more profound which require for their awakening other\nsurroundings and another present than the abstract, dim, grey thought\nof olden times. In Plato, for instance, questions regarding the nature\nof freedom, the origin of evil and of sin, providence, &c., do not\nfind their philosophic answer. On such subjects we certainly may in\npart take the ordinary serious views of the present time, and in part\nphilosophically set their consideration altogether aside, or else\nconsider sin and freedom as something negative only. But neither the\none plan nor the other gives freedom to Mind if such subjects have once\nbeen explicitly for it, and if the opposition in self-consciousness\nhas given it the power of sinking its interests therein. The case is\nsimilar with regard to questions regarding the limits of knowledge, the\nopposition between subjectivity and objectivity which had not yet come\nup in Plato\u2019s age. The independence of the \u201cI\u201d within itself and its\nexplicit existence was foreign to him; man had not yet gone back within\nhimself, had not yet set himself forth as explicit. The subject was\nindeed the individual as free, but as yet he knew himself only as in\nunity with his Being. The Athenian knew himself to be free, as such,\njust as the Roman citizen would, as _ingenuus_. But the fact that man\nis in and for himself free, in his essence and as man, free born, was\nknown neither by Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, nor the Roman legislators,\neven though it is this conception alone which forms the source of\nlaw. In Christianity the individual, personal mind for the first time\nbecomes of real, infinite and absolute value; God wills that all men\nshall be saved. It was in the Christian religion that the doctrine\nwas advanced that all men are equal before God, because Christ has\nset them free with the freedom of Christianity. These principles make\nfreedom independent of any such things as birth, standing or culture.\nThe progress made through them is enormous, but they still come short\nof this, that to be free constitutes the very idea of man. The sense\nof this existent principle has been an active force for centuries and\ncenturies, and an impelling power which has brought about the most\ntremendous revolutions; but the conception and the knowledge of the\nnatural freedom of man is a knowledge of himself which is not old.\nB\nTHE RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE.\nThe History of Philosophy has to represent this science in that form\nof time and individualities from which its outward form has resulted.\nSuch a representation has, however, to shut out from itself the\nexternal history of the time, and to take into account only the general\ncharacter of the people and time, and likewise their circumstances as a\nwhole. But as a matter of fact, the history of Philosophy does present\nthis character, and that indeed in the highest possible degree;\nits connection with it is of the closest kind, and the particular\nappearance presented by a philosophy belonging to one special period,\nis only a particular aspect or element in the character. Because of\nthis inward correspondence we have partly to consider more closely\nthe particular relation borne by a philosophy to its historical\nsurroundings, and partly, but pre-eminently, what is proper to itself,\nfrom which alone, after separating everything related however closely,\nwe can fix our standpoint. This connection, which is not merely\nexternal but essential, has thus two sides, which we must consider. The\nfirst is the distinctly historical side, the second is the connection\nwith other matters\u2014the connection of Philosophy with Religion, for\ninstance, by which we at once obtain a deeper conception of Philosophy\nitself.\n1. THE HISTORICAL SIDE OF THIS CONNECTION.\nIt is usually said that political affairs and such matters as Religion\nare to be taken into consideration because they have exercised a great\ninfluence on the Philosophy of the time, and similarly it exerts an\ninfluence upon them. But when people are content with such a category\nas \u201cgreat influence\u201d they place the two in an external relationship,\nand start from the point of view that both sides are for themselves\nindependent. Here, however, we must think of this relationship in\nanother category, and not according to the influence or effect of one\nupon the other. The true category is the unity of all these different\nforms, so that it is one Mind which manifests itself in, and impresses\nitself upon these different elements.\na. _Outward and historical conditions imposed upon Philosophy._\nIt must be remarked in the first place, that a certain stage is\nrequisite in the intellectual culture of a people in order that it\nmay have a Philosophy at all. Aristotle says, \u201cMan first begins to\nphilosophize when the necessities of life are supplied\u201d (Metaphysics,\nI. 2); because since Philosophy is a free and not self-seeking\nactivity, cravings of want must have disappeared, a strength, elevation\nand inward fortitude of mind must have appeared, passions must be\nsubdued and consciousness so far advanced, before what is universal\ncan be thought of. Philosophy may thus be called a kind of luxury,\nin so far as luxury signifies those enjoyments and pursuits which do\nnot belong to external necessity as such. Philosophy in this respect\nseems more capable of being dispensed with than anything else; but that\ndepends on what is called indispensable. From the point of view of\nmind, Philosophy may even be said to be that which is most essential.\nb. _The commencement in History of an intellectual necessity for\nPhilosophy._\nHowever much Philosophy, as the thought and conception of the Mind\nof a particular time, is _\u00e0 priori_, it is at the same time just as\nreally a result, since the thought produced and, indeed, the life and\naction are produced to produce themselves. This activity contains the\nessential element of a negation, because to produce is also to destroy;\nPhilosophy in producing itself, has the natural as its starting point\nin order to abrogate it again. Philosophy thus makes its appearance\nat a time when the Mind of a people has worked its way out of the\nindifference and stolidity of the first life of nature, as it has also\ndone from the standpoint of the emotional, so that the individual aim\nhas blotted itself out. But as Mind passes on from its natural form,\nit also proceeds from its exact code of morals and the robustness of\nlife to reflection and conception. The result of this is that it lays\nhold of and troubles this real, substantial kind of existence, this\nmorality and faith, and thus the period of destruction commences.\nFurther progress is then made through the gathering up of thought\nwithin itself. It may be said that Philosophy first commences when a\nrace for the most part has left its concrete life, when separation and\nchange of class have begun, and the people approach toward their fall;\nwhen a gulf has arisen between inward strivings and external reality,\nand the old forms of Religion, &c., are no longer satisfying; when Mind\nmanifests indifference to its living existence or rests unsatisfied\ntherein, and moral life becomes dissolved. Then it is that Mind takes\nrefuge in the clear space of thought to create for itself a kingdom of\nthought in opposition to the world of actuality, and Philosophy is the\nreconciliation following upon the destruction of that real world which\nthought has begun. When Philosophy with its abstractions paints grey in\ngrey, the freshness and life of youth has gone, the reconciliation is\nnot a reconciliation in the actual, but in the ideal world. Thus the\nGreek philosophers held themselves far removed from the business of\nthe State and were called by the people idlers, because they withdrew\nthemselves within the world of thought.\nThis holds good throughout all the history of Philosophy. It was so\nwith Ionic Philosophy in the decline of the Ionic States in Asia Minor.\nSocrates and Plato had no more pleasure in the life of the State in\nAthens, which was in the course of its decline; Plato tried to bring\nabout something better with Dionysius. Thus in Athens, with the ruin of\nthe Athenian people, the period was reached when Philosophy appeared.\nIn Rome, Philosophy first expanded in the decline of the Republic and\nof Roman life proper, under the despotism of the Roman Emperors: a\ntime of misfortune for the world and of decay in political life, when\nearlier religious systems tottered and everything was in the process\nof struggle and disintegration. With the decline of the Roman Empire,\nwhich was so great, rich and glorious, and yet inwardly dead, the\nheight and indeed the zenith of ancient Philosophy is associated\nthrough the Neo-Platonists at Alexandria. It was also in the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries, when the Teutonic life of the Middle Ages\nacquired another form, that Philosophy first became taught, though it\nwas later on that it attained to independence. Before that, political\nlife still existed in unity with Religion, or if the State fought\nagainst the Church, the Church still kept the foremost place, but now\nthe gulf between Church and State came into existence. Philosophy thus\ncomes in at a certain epoch only in the development of the whole.\nc. _Philosophy as the thought of its time._\nBut men do not at certain epochs, merely philosophize in general,\nfor there is a definite Philosophy which arises among a people, and\nthe definite character of the standpoint of thought is the same\ncharacter which permeates all the other historical sides of the spirit\nof the people, which is most intimately related to them, and which\nconstitutes their foundation. The particular form of a Philosophy is\nthus contemporaneous with a particular constitution of the people\namongst whom it makes its appearance, with their institutions and forms\nof government, their morality, their social life and the capabilities,\ncustoms and enjoyments of the same; it is so with their attempts and\nachievements in art and science, with their religious, warfares and\nexternal relationships, likewise with the decadence of the States in\nwhich this particular principle and form had maintained its supremacy,\nand with the origination and progress of new States in which a higher\nprinciple finds its manifestation and development. Mind in each case\nhas elaborated and expanded in the whole domain of its manifold nature\nthe principle of the particular stage of self-consciousness to which\nit has attained. Thus the Mind of a people in its richness is an\norganization, and, like a Cathedral, is divided into numerous vaults,\npassages, pillars and vestibules, all of which have proceeded out of\none whole and are directed to one end. Philosophy is one form of these\nmany aspects. And which is it? It is the fullest blossom, the Notion\nof Mind in its entire form, the consciousness and spiritual essence of\nall things, the spirit of the time as spirit present in itself. The\nmultifarious whole is reflected in it as in the single focus, in the\nNotion which knows itself.\nThe Philosophy which is essential within Christianity could not be\nfound in Rome, for all the various forms of the whole are only the\nexpression of one and the same determinate character. Hence political\nhistory, forms of government, art and religion are not related to\nPhilosophy as its causes, nor, on the other hand, is Philosophy the\nground of their existence\u2014one and all have the same common root, the\nspirit of the time. It is one determinate existence, one determinate\ncharacter which permeates all sides and manifests itself in politics\nand in all else as in different elements; it is a condition which hangs\ntogether in all its parts, and the various parts of which contain\nnothing which is really inconsistent, however diverse and accidental\nthey may appear to be, and however much they may seem to contradict one\nanother. This particular stage is the product of the one preceding. But\nto show how the spirit of a particular time moulds its whole actuality\nand destiny in accordance with its principle, to show this whole\nedifice in its conception, is far from us\u2014for that would be the object\nof the whole philosophic world-history. Those forms alone concern us\nwhich express the principle of the Mind in a spiritual element related\nto Philosophy.\nThis is the position of Philosophy amongst its varying forms, from\nwhich it follows that it is entirely identical with its time. But\nif Philosophy does not stand above its time in content, it does so\nin form, because, as the thought and knowledge of that which is the\nsubstantial spirit of its time, it makes that spirit its object. In\nas far as Philosophy is in the spirit of its time, the latter is its\ndetermined content in the world, although as knowledge, Philosophy is\nabove it, since it places it in the relation of object. But this is in\nform alone, for Philosophy really has no other content. This knowledge\nitself undoubtedly is the actuality of Mind, the self-knowledge of Mind\nwhich previously was not present: thus the formal difference is also a\nreal and actual difference. Through knowledge, Mind makes manifest a\ndistinction between knowledge and that which is; this knowledge is thus\nwhat produces a new form of development. The new forms at first are\nonly special modes of knowledge, and it is thus that a new Philosophy\nis produced: yet since it already is a wider kind of spirit, it is the\ninward birthplace of the spirit which will later arrive at actual form.\nWe shall deal further with this in the concrete below, and we shall\nthen see that what the Greek Philosophy was, entered, in the Christian\nworld, into actuality.\n2. SEPARATION OF PHILOSOPHY FROM OTHER ALLIED DEPARTMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE.\nThe history of the other Sciences, of culture and above all the history\nof art and of religion are, partly in regard to the elements contained\nin them, and partly to their particular objects, related to the history\nof Philosophy. It is through this relationship that the treatment\nof the history of Philosophy has been so confused. If it is to\nconcern itself with the possession of culture generally and then with\nscientific culture, and then again with popular myths and the dogmas\ncontained only in them, and yet farther with the religious reflections\nwhich are already thoughts of a speculative kind, and which make their\nappearance in them, no bounds are left to Philosophy at all. This is\nso, partly on account of the amount of material itself and the labour\nrequired in working it up and preparing it, and partly because it is in\nimmediate connection with so much else. But the separation must not be\nmade arbitrarily or as by chance, but must be derived from fundamental\ndeterminations. If we merely look at the name of Philosophy, all this\nmatter will pertain to its history.\nI shall speak of this material from three points of view, for three\nrelated aspects are to be eliminated and separated from Philosophy. The\nfirst of these is that which is generally considered to be the domain\nof science, and in which are found the beginnings of understanding\nthought. The second region is that of mythology and religion; the\nrelation of Philosophy to them seems often to be inimical both in\nthe time of the Greeks and of the Christians. The third is that of\nphilosophizing and the metaphysics of the understanding. While we\ndistinguish what is related to Philosophy, we must also take note of\nthe elements in this related matter which belong to the Notion of\nPhilosophy, but which appear to us to be partially separated from it:\nand thus we may become acquainted with the Notion of Philosophy.\na. _Relation of Philosophy to Scientific Knowledge._\nKnowledge and thought certainly form the element of whatever has to do\nwith particular sciences as they form the element of Philosophy; but\ntheir subjects are mainly finite subjects and appearance. A collection\nof facts known about this content is by its nature excluded from\nPhilosophy: neither this content nor such a form has anything to do\nwith it. But even if the sciences are systematic and contain universal\nprinciples and laws from which they proceed, they are still related to\na limited circle of objects. The ultimate principles are assumed as are\nthe objects themselves; that is, the outward experience or the feelings\nof the heart, natural or educated sense of right and duty, constitute\nthe source from which they are created. Logic and the determinations\nand principles of thought in general are in their methods assumed.\nThe forms of thought or the points of view and principles which hold\ngood in the sciences and constitute the ultimate support of all their\nmatter, are not peculiar to them, but are common to the condition\nand culture of the time and of the people. This culture consists\nmainly in the general ideas and aims, in the whole extent of the\nparticular intellectual powers dominating consciousness and life. Our\nconsciousness has these ideas and allows them to be considered ultimate\ndeterminations; it makes use of them as guiding and connecting links,\nbut does not know them and does not even make them the objects of its\nconsideration. To give an abstract example, each act of consciousness\nhas and requires the whole abstract thought-determination of Being.\n\u201cThe sun is in the heavens, the bunch of grapes is ripe,\u201d and so on\ninto infinitude. Again, in a higher culture, such relations as those\nof cause and effect are involved, as also those of force and its\nmanifestation. All its knowledge and ideas are permeated and governed\nby a metaphysic such as this; it is the net in which all the concrete\nmatter which occupies mankind in action and in impulses, is grasped.\nBut this web and its knots in our ordinary consciousness are sunk into\na manifold material, for it contains the objects and interests which we\nknow and which we have before us. These common threads are not drawn up\nand made explicitly the objects of our reflection.\nWe Germans seldom now count general scientific knowledge as Philosophy.\nAnd yet traces of this are found, as for instance, in the fact that\nthe philosophic Faculty contains all the Sciences which have not as\ntheir immediate aim the Church and State. In connection with this,\nthe significance of the name of Philosophy, which is even now an\nimportant matter of discussion in England, comes in question. Natural\nSciences are in England called Philosophy. A \u201cPhilosophic Journal\u201d\nin England, edited by Thompson, treats of Chemistry, Agriculture,\nManuring, Husbandry, Technology, like Hermbst\u00e4dt\u2019s Journal, and gives\ninventions connected therewith. The English call physical instruments,\nsuch as the barometer and thermometer, philosophical instruments.\nTheories too, and especially morality and the moral sciences, which\nare derived from the feelings of the human heart or from experience,\nare called Philosophy, and finally this is also so with the theories\nand principles of Political Economy. And thus at least in England, is\nthe name of Philosophy respected. Some time ago a banquet took place\nunder the presidency of Lord Liverpool, at which the minister Canning\nwas also present. The latter in returning thanks congratulated England\nin having philosophic principles of government there brought into\noperation. There, at least, Philosophy is no by-word.\nIn the first beginnings of culture, however, we are more often met by\nthis admixture of Philosophy and general knowledge. There comes a time\nto a nation when mind applies itself to universal objects, when, for\nexample, in seeking to bring natural things under general modes of\nunderstanding, it tries to learn their causes. Then it is said that a\npeople begins to philosophize, for this content has thought in common\nwith Philosophy. At such a time we find deliverances about all the\ncommon events of Nature, as we also find intellectual maxims, moral\nsentences, general principles respecting morality, the will, duty,\nand the like, and those who expressed them have been called wise men\nor philosophers. Thus in the beginnings of Greek Philosophy we find\nthe seven sages and the Ionic Philosophers. From them a number of\nideas and discoveries are conveyed to us which seem like philosophic\npropositions. Thus Thales, amongst others, has explained that the\neclipse of sun and moon is due to the intervention of the moon or\nearth. This is called a theorem. Pythagoras found out the principle\nof the harmony of sounds. Others have had ideas about the stars: the\nheavens were supposed to be composed of perforated metal, by which we\nsee throughout the empyrean region, the eternal fire which surrounds\nthe world. Such propositions as products of the understanding, do not\nbelong to the history of Philosophy, although they imply that the\nmerely sensuous gaze has been left behind, as also the representation\nof those objects by the imagination only. Earth and heaven thus become\nunpeopled with gods, because the understanding distinguishes things in\ntheir outward and natural qualities from Mind.\nIn a later time the epoch of the revival in the sciences is as\nnoteworthy in this respect. General principles regarding the state,\n&c., were given expression to, and in them a philosophic side cannot be\nmistaken. To this place the philosophic systems of Hobbes and Descartes\nbelong: the writings of the latter contain philosophic principles, but\nhis Philosophy of Nature is quite empirical. Hugo Grotius composed\nan international law in which what was historically held by the\npeople as law, the _consensus gentium_, was a main element. Though,\nearlier, medicine was a collection of isolated facts and a theosophic\ncombination mixed up with astrology, &c. (it is not so long ago since\ncures were effected by sacred relics), a mode of regarding nature\ncame into vogue according to which men went forth to discover the\nlaws and forces of Nature. The _\u00e0 priori_ reasoning regarding natural\nthings, according to the metaphysics of the Scholastic Philosophy or\nto Religion, has now been given up. The Philosophy of Newton contains\nnothing but Natural Science, that is, the knowledge of the laws,\nforces, and general constitution of Nature, derived from observation\nand from experience. However much this may seem to be contrary to the\nprinciple of Philosophy, it has in common with it the fact that the\nbases of both are universal, and still further that _I_ have made\nthis experience, that it rests on my consciousness and obtains its\nsignificance through me.\nThis form is in its general aspect antagonistic to the positive, and\nhas come forward as particularly opposed to Religion and to that which\nis positive in it. If, in the Middle Ages, the Church had its dogmas\nas universal truths, man, on the contrary, has now obtained from the\ntestimony of his \u201cown thought,\u201d feeling and ideas, a mistrust of these.\nIt is merely to be remarked of this that \u201cmy own thought\u201d is in itself\na pleonasm, because each individual must think for himself, and no one\ncan do so for another. Similarly this principle has turned against the\nrecognized constitutions and has sought different principles instead,\nby them to correct the former. Universal principles of the State have\nnow been laid down, while earlier, because religion was positive, the\nground of obedience of subjects to princes and of all authority were\nalso so. Kings, as the anointed of the Lord, in the sense that Jewish\nkings were so, derived their power from God, and had to give account to\nHim alone, because all authority is given by God. So far theology and\njurisprudence were on the whole fixed and positive sciences, wherever\nthis positive character might have been derived. Against this external\nauthority reflection has been brought to bear, and thus, especially\nin England, the source of public and civil law became no longer mere\nauthority derived from God like the Mosaic Law. For the authority of\nkings other justification was sought, such as the end implied in the\nState, the good of the people. This forms quite another source of\ntruth, and it is opposed to that which is revealed, given and positive.\nThis substitution of another ground than that of authority has been\ncalled philosophizing.\nThe knowledge was then a knowledge of what is finite\u2014the world of\nthe content of knowledge. Because this content proceeded through\nthe personal insight of human reason, man has become independent in\nhis actions. This independence of the Mind is the true moment of\nPhilosophy, although the Notion of Philosophy through this formal\ndetermination, which limits it to finite objects, has not yet been\nexhausted. This independent thought is respected, has been called\nhuman wisdom or worldly wisdom, for it has had what is earthly as its\nobject, and it took its origin in the world. This was the meaning of\nPhilosophy, and men did rightly to call it worldly wisdom. Frederick\nvon Schlegel revived this by-name for Philosophy, and desired to\nindicate by it that what concerns higher spheres, such as religion,\nmust be kept apart; and he had many followers. Philosophy, indeed,\noccupies itself with finite things, but, according to Spinoza, as\nresting in the divine Idea: it has thus the same end as religion. To\nthe finite sciences which are now separated also from Philosophy, the\nChurches objected that they led men away from God, since they have as\nobjects only what is finite. This defect in them, conceived of from the\npoint of view of content, leads us to the second department allied to\nPhilosophy,\u2014that is, to Religion.\nb. _Relation of Philosophy to Religion.\n_As the first department of knowledge was related to Philosophy\nprincipally by means of formal and independent knowledge, Religion,\nthough in its content quite different from this first kind or sphere\nof knowledge, is through it related to Philosophy. Its object is not\nthe earthly and worldly, but the infinite. In the case of art and\nstill more in that of Religion, Philosophy has in common a content\ncomposed entirely of universal objects; they constitute the mode in\nwhich the highest Idea is existent for the unphilosophical feeling, the\nperceiving and imagining consciousness. Inasmuch as in the progress of\nculture in time the manifestation of Religion precedes the appearance\nof Philosophy, this circumstance must really be taken account of, and\nthe conditions requisite for beginning the History of Philosophy have\nto depend on this, because it has to be shown in how far what pertains\nto Religion is to be excluded from it, and that a commencement must not\nbe made with Religion.\nIn Religion, races of men have undoubtedly expressed their idea of the\nnature of the world, the substance of nature and of intellect and the\nrelation of man thereto. Absolute Being is here the object of their\nconsciousness; and as such, is for them pre-eminently the \u201cother,\u201d a\n\u201cbeyond,\u201d nearer or further off, more or less friendly or frightful\nand alarming. In the act and forms of worship this opposition is\nremoved by man, and he raises himself to the consciousness of unity\nwith his Being, to the feeling of, or dependence on, the Grace of\nGod, in that God has reconciled mankind to Himself. In conception,\nwith the Greeks, for instance, this existence is to man one which is\nalready in and for itself and friendly, and thus worship is but the\nenjoyment of this unity. This existence is now reason which is existent\nin and for itself, the universal and concrete substance, the Mind\nwhose first cause is objective to itself in consciousness; it thus is\na representation of this last in which not only reason in general,\nbut the universal infinite reason is. We must, therefore, comprehend\nReligion, as Philosophy, before everything else, which means to know\nand apprehend it in reason; for it is the work of self-revealing reason\nand is the highest form of reason. Such ideas as that priests have\nframed a people\u2019s Religion in fraud and self-interest are consequently\nabsurd; to regard Religion as an arbitrary matter or a deception is as\nfoolish as it is perverted. Priests have often profaned Religion\u2014the\npossibility of which is a consequence of the external relations\nand temporal existence of Religion. It can thus, in this external\nconnection, be laid hold of here and there, but because it is Religion,\nit is really that which stands firm against finite ends and their\ncomplications and constitutes a region exalted high above them. This\nregion of Mind is really the Holy place of Truth itself, the Holy place\nin which are dissolved the remaining illusions of the sensuous world,\nof finite ideas and ends, and of the sphere of opinion and caprice.\nInasmuch as it really is the content of religions, this rational matter\nmight now seem to be capable of being abstracted and expressed as a\nnumber of historical theorems. Philosophy stands on the same basis\nas Religion and has the same object\u2014the universal reason existing\nin and for itself; Mind desires to make this object its own, as is\ndone with Religion in the act and form of worship. But the form, as\nit is present in Religion, is different from what is found to be\ncontained in Philosophy, and on this account a history of Philosophy\nis different from a history of Religion. Worship is only the operation\nof reflection; Philosophy attempts to bring about the reconciliation\nby means of thinking knowledge, because Mind desires to take up its\nBeing into itself. Philosophy is related in the form of thinking\nconsciousness to its object; with Religion it is different. But the\ndistinction between the two should not be conceived of so abstractly as\nto make it seem that thought is only in Philosophy and not in Religion.\nThe latter has likewise ideas and universal thoughts. Because both are\nso nearly related, it is an old tradition in the history of Philosophy\nto deduce Philosophy from Persian, Indian, or similar philosophy, a\ncustom which is still partly retained in all histories of Philosophy.\nFor this reason, too, it is a legend universally believed, that\nPythagoras, for instance, received his Philosophy from India and Egypt;\nthe fame of the wisdom of these people, which wisdom is understood also\nto contain Philosophy, is an old one. The Oriental ideas and religious\nworship which prevailed throughout the West up to the time of the Roman\nEmpire, likewise bear the name of Oriental Philosophy. The Christian\nReligion and Philosophy are thought of in the Christian world, as more\ndefinitely divided; in these Eastern days, on the other hand, Religion\nand Philosophy are still conceived of as one in so far as that the\ncontent has remained in the form in which it is Philosophy. Considering\nthe prevalence of these ideas and in order to have a definite limit to\nthe relations between a history of Philosophy and religious ideas, it\nis desirable to note some further considerations as to the form which\nseparates religious ideas from philosophical theorems.\nReligion has not only universal thought as inward content _implicite_\ncontained in its myths, ideas, imaginations and in its exact and\npositive histories, so that we require first of all to dig this\ncontent out of such myths in the form of theorems, but it often has\nits content _explicite_ in the form of thought. In the Persian and\nIndian Religions very deep, sublime and speculative thoughts are even\nexpressed. Indeed, in Religion we even meet philosophies directly\nexpressed, as in the Philosophy of the Fathers. The scholastic\nPhilosophy really was Theology; there is found in it a union or, if you\nwill, a mixture of Theology and Philosophy which may very well puzzle\nus. The question which confronts us on the one side is, how Philosophy\ndiffers from Theology, as the science of Religion, or from Religion\nas consciousness? And then, in how far have we in the history of\nPhilosophy to take account of what pertains to Religion? For the reply\nto this last question three aspects have again to be dealt with; first\nof all the mythical and historical aspect of Religion and its relation\nto Philosophy; in the second place the theorems and speculative\nthoughts directly expressed in Religion; and in the third place we must\nspeak of Philosophy within Theology.\n_\u03b1. Difference between Philosophy and Religion._\nThe consideration of the mythical aspect of Religion or the historical\nand positive side generally, is interesting, because from it the\ndifference in respect of form will show in what this content is\nantagonistic to Philosophy. Indeed, taken in its connections, its\ndifference passes into apparent inconsistency. This diversity is not\nonly found in our contemplation but forms a very definite element\nin history. It is required by Philosophy that it should justify its\nbeginning and its manner of knowledge, and Philosophy has thus placed\nitself in opposition to Religion. On the other hand Philosophy is\ncombated and condemned by Religion and by the Churches. The Greek\npopular religion indeed, proscribed several philosophers; but the\nopposition is even more apparent in the Christian Church. The question\nis thus not only whether regard is to be paid to Religion in the\nhistory of Philosophy, for it has been the case that Philosophy has\npaid attention to Religion, and the latter to the former. Since neither\nof the two has allowed the other to rest undisturbed, we are not\npermitted to do so either. Of their relations, therefore, we must speak\ndefinitely, openly and honestly\u2014_aborder la question_, as the French\nsay. We must not hesitate, as if such a discussion were too delicate,\nnor try to help ourselves out by beating about the bush; nor must we\nseek to find evasions or shifts, so that in the end no one can tell\nwhat we mean. We must not seem to wish to leave Religion alone. This is\nnothing else than to appear to wish to conceal the fact that Philosophy\nhas directed its efforts against Religion. Religion, that is, the\ntheologians, are indeed the cause of this; they ignore Philosophy, but\nonly in order that they may not be contradicted in their arbitrary\nreasoning.\nIt may appear as if Religion demanded that man should abstain from\nthinking of universal matters and Philosophy because they are merely\nworldly wisdom and represent human operations. Human reason is\nhere opposed to the divine. Men are, indeed, well accustomed to a\ndistinction between divine teaching and laws and human power and\ninventions, such that under the latter everything is comprehended which\nin its manifestation proceeds from the consciousness, the intelligence\nor the will of mankind; which makes all this opposed to the knowledge\nof God and to things rendered divine by divine revelation. But the\ndepreciation of what is human expressed by this opposition is then\ndriven further still, inasmuch as while it implies the further view\nthat man is certainly called upon to admire the wisdom of God in\nNature, and that the grain, the mountains, the cedars of Lebanon in all\ntheir glory, the song of the birds in the bough, the superior skill\nand the domestic instincts of animals are all magnified as being the\nwork of God, it also implies that the wisdom, goodness and justice of\nGod is, indeed, pointed out in human affairs, but not so much in the\ndisposition or laws of man or in actions performed voluntarily and in\nthe ordinary progress of the world, as in human destiny, that is, in\nthat which is external and even arbitrary in relation to knowledge\nand free-will. Thus what is external and accidental is regarded as\nemphatically the work of God, and what has its root in will and\nconscience, as the work of man. The harmony between outward relations,\ncircumstances and events and the general aims of man is certainly\nsomething of a higher kind, but this is the case only for the reason\nthat this harmony is considered with respect to ends which are human\nand not natural\u2014such as those present in the life of a sparrow which\nfinds its food. But if the summit of everything is found in this, that\nGod rules over Nature, what then is free-will? Does He not rule over\nwhat is spiritual, or rather since He himself is spiritual, in what\nis spiritual? and is not the ruler over or in the spiritual region\nhigher than a ruler over or in Nature? But is that admiration of God as\nrevealed in natural things as such, in trees and animals as opposed to\nwhat is human, far removed from the religion of the ancient Egyptians,\nwhich derived its knowledge of what is divine from the ibis, or from\ncats and dogs? or does it differ from the deplorable condition of the\nancient and the modern Indians, who held and still hold cows and apes\nin reverence, and are scrupulously concerned for the maintenance and\nnourishment of these animals, while they allow men to suffer hunger;\nwho would commit a crime by removing the pangs of starvation through\ntheir slaughter or even by partaking of their food?\nIt seems to be expressed by such a view that human action as regards\nNature is ungodly; that the operations of Nature are divine operations,\nbut what man produces is ungodly. But the productions of human reason\nmight, at least, be esteemed as much as Nature. In so doing, however,\nwe cede less to reason than is permitted to us. If the life and the\naction of animals be divine, human action must stand much higher, and\nmust be worthy to be called divine in an infinitely higher sense. The\npreeminence of human thought must forthwith be avowed. Christ says on\nthis subject (Matt. vi. 26-80), \u201cBehold the fowls of the air,\u201d (in\nwhich we may also include the Ibis and the _Kokilas_,) \u201care ye not much\nbetter than they? Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,\nwhich to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall He not\nmuch more clothe you?\u201d The superiority of man, of the image of God, to\nanimals and plants is indeed implicitly and explicitly established,\nbut in asking wherein the divine element is to be sought and seen\u2014in\nmaking use of such expressions\u2014none of the superior, but only the\ninferior nature, is indicated. Similarly, in regard to the knowledge of\nGod, it is remarkable that Christ places the knowledge of and faith in\nHim not in any admiration of the creatures of nature nor in marvelling\nat any so-called dominion, over them, nor in signs and wonders, but in\nthe witness of the Spirit. Spirit is infinitely high above Nature, in\nit the Divine Nature manifests itself more than in Nature.\nBut the form in which the universal content which is in and for itself,\nfirst belongs to Philosophy is the form of Thought, the form of the\nuniversal itself. In Religion, however, this content is for immediate\nand outward perception, and further for idea and sensation through art.\nThe import is for the sensuous nature; it is the evidence of the Mind\nwhich comprehends that content. To make this clearer, the difference\nmust be recollected between that which we are and have, and how we know\nthe same\u2014that is, in what manner we know it and have it as our object.\nThis distinction is an infinitely important matter, and it alone is\nconcerned in the culture of races and of individuals. We are men and\nhave reason; what is human, or above all, what is rational vibrates\nwithin us, both in our feelings, mind and heart and in our subjective\nnature generally. It is in this corresponding vibration and in the\ncorresponding motion effected that a particular content becomes our own\nand is like our own. The manifold nature of the determinations which\nit contains is concentrated and wrapt up within this inward nature\u2014an\nobscure motion of Mind in itself and in universal substantiality. The\ncontent is thus directly identical with the simple abstract certainty\nof ourselves and with self-consciousness. But Mind, because it is\nMind, is as truly consciousness. What is confined within itself in its\nsimplicity must be objective to itself and must come to be known. The\nwhole difference lies in the manner and method of this objectivity, and\nhence in the manner and method of consciousness.\nThis method and manner extends from the simple expression of the\ndulness of mere feeling to the most objective form, to that which is\nin and for itself objective, to Thought. The most simple, most formal\nobjectivity is the expression of a name for that feeling and for the\nstate of mind according with it, as seen in these words, worship,\nprayer, etc. Such expressions as \u201cLet us pray\u201d and \u201cLet us worship\u201d\nare simply the recalling of that feeling. But \u201cLet us think about God\u201d\nbrings with it something more; it expresses the absolutely embracing\ncontent of that substantial feeling, and the object, which differs\nfrom mere sensation as subjective self-conscious activity; or which is\ncontent distinguished from this activity as form. This object, however,\ncomprehending in itself the whole substantial content, is itself still\nundeveloped and entirely undetermined. To develop that content, to\ncomprehend, express and bring to consciousness its relations, is the\ncommencement, creation and manifestation of Religion. The form in which\nthis developed content first possesses objectivity is that of immediate\nperception, of sensuous idea or of a more defined idea deduced from\nnatural, physical or mental manifestations and conditions.\nArt brings about this consciousness, in that it gives permanence and\ncohesion to the fleeting visible appearance through which objectivity\npasses in sensation. The shapeless, sacred stone, the mere place, or\nwhatever it is to which the desire for objectivity first attaches\nitself, receives from art, form, feature, determinate character and\ncontent which can be known and which is now present for consciousness.\nArt has thus become the instructress of the people. This was the case\nwith Homer and Hesiod for instance, who, according to Herodotus (II.\n53), \u201cMade the Greeks their Theogony,\u201d because they elevated and\nconsolidated ideas and traditions in unison with the spirit of the\npeople, wherever and in whatever confusion they might be found, into\ndefinite images and ideas. This is not the art which merely gives\nexpression in its own way to the content, already perfectly expressed,\nof a Religion which in thought, idea and words has already attained\ncomplete development; that is to say, which puts its matter into stone,\ncanvas, or words as is done by modern art, which, in dealing either\nwith religious or with historical objects, takes as its groundwork\nideas and thoughts which are already there. The consciousness of this\nReligion is rather the product of thinking imagination, or of thought\nwhich comprehends through the organ of imagination alone and finds\nexpression in its forms.\nIf the infinite Thought, the absolute Mind, has revealed and does\nreveal itself in true Religion, that in which it reveals itself is the\nheart, the representing consciousness and the understanding of what\nis finite. Religion is not merely directed to every sort of culture.\n\u201cTo the poor is the Gospel preached,\u201d but it must as being Religion\nexpressly directed towards heart and mind, enter into the sphere of\nsubjectivity and consequently into the region of finite methods of\nrepresentation. In the perceiving and, with reference to perceptions,\nreflecting consciousness, man possesses for the speculative relations\nbelonging to the absolute, only finite relations, whether taken in an\nexact or in a symbolical sense, to serve him to comprehend and express\nthose qualities and relationships of the infinite.\nIn Religion as the earliest and the immediate revelations of God, the\nform of representation and of reflecting finite thought cannot be the\nonly form in which He gives existence to Himself in consciousness, but\nit must also appear in this form, for such alone is comprehensible\nto religious consciousness. To make this clearer, something must be\nsaid as to what is the meaning of comprehension. On the one hand,\nas has been remarked above, there is in it the substantial basis of\ncontent, which, coming to Mind as its absolute Being, affects it in\nits innermost, finds an answering chord, and thereby obtains from\nit confirmation. This is the first absolute condition necessary to\ncomprehension; what is not implicitly there cannot come within it or\nbe for it\u2014that is, a content which is infinite and eternal. For the\nsubstantial as infinite, is just that which has no limitations in that\nto which it is related, for else it would be limited and not the true\nsubstantial. And Mind is that alone which is not implicit, which is\nfinite and external; for what is finite and external is no longer what\nis implicit but what is for another, what has entered into a relation.\nBut, on the other hand, because the true and eternal must be for Mind\nbecome known, that is, enter into finite consciousness, the Mind for\nwhich it is, is finite and the manner of its consciousness consists\nin the ideas and forms of finite things and relations. These forms\nare familiar and well known to consciousness, the ordinary mode of\nfinality, which mode it has appropriated to itself, having constituted\nit the universal medium of its representation, into which everything\nthat comes to consciousness must be resolved in order that it may have\nand know itself therein.\nThe assertion of Religion is that the manifestation of Truth which\nis revealed to us through it, is one which is given to man from\noutside, and on this account it is also asserted that man has humbly\nto assent to it, because human reason cannot attain to it by itself.\nThe assertion of positive Religion is that its truths exist without\nhaving their source known, so that the content as given, is one which\nis above and beyond reason. By means of some prophet or other divine\ninstrument, the truth is made known: just as Ceres and Triptolemus who\nintroduced agriculture and matrimony, for so doing were honoured by\nthe Greeks, men have rendered thanks to Moses and to Mahomed. Through\nwhatever individual the Truth may have been given, the external matter\nis historical, and this is indifferent to the absolute content and to\nitself, since the person is not the import of the doctrine. But the\nChristian Religion has this characteristic that the Person of Christ\nin His character of the Son of God, Himself partakes of the nature\nof God. If Christ be for Christians only a teacher like Pythagoras,\nSocrates or Columbus, there would be here no universal divine content,\nno revelation or knowledge imparted about the Nature of God, and it is\nregarding this alone that we desire to obtain knowledge.\nWhatever stage it may itself have reached, the Truth must undoubtedly\nin the first place come to men from without as a present object,\nsensuously represented, just as Moses saw God in the fiery bush, and as\nthe Greek brought the god into conscious being by means of sculpture\nor other representations. But there is the further fact, that neither\nin Religion nor in Philosophy does this external form remain, nor can\nit so remain. A form of the imagination or an historical form, such\nas Christ, must for the spirit be spiritual; and thus it ceases to be\nan external matter, seeing that the form of externality is dead. We\nmust know God \u201cin Spirit and in Truth.\u201d He is the absolute and actual\nSpirit. The relation borne by the human spirit to this Spirit involves\nthe following considerations.\nWhen man determines to adopt a Religion he asks himself, \u201cWhat is the\nground of my faith?\u201d The Christian Religion replies\u2014\u201cThe Spirit\u2019s\nwitness to its content.\u201d Christ reproved the Pharisees for wishing to\nsee miracles; the Spirit alone comprehends Spirit, the miracle is only\na presentiment of that Spirit; and if the miracle be the suspension\nof natural laws, Spirit itself is the real miracle in the operations\nof nature. Spirit in itself is merely this comprehension of itself.\nThere is only one Spirit, the universal divine Spirit. Not that it\nis merely everywhere; it is not to be comprehended as what is common\nto everything, as an external totality, to be found in many or in\nall individuals, which are essentially individuals; but it must be\nunderstood as that which permeates through everything, as the unity\nof itself and of a semblance of its \u201cother,\u201d as of the subjective and\nparticular. As universal, it is object to itself, and thus determined\nas a particular, it is this individual: but as universal it reaches\nover this its \u201cother,\u201d so that its \u201cother\u201d and itself are comprised in\none. The true universality seems, popularly expressed, to be two\u2014what\nis common to the universal itself and to the particular. A division\nis formed in the understanding of itself, and the Spirit is the unity\nof what is understood and the understanding person. The divine Spirit\nwhich is comprehended, is objective; the subjective Spirit comprehends.\nBut Spirit is not passive, or else the passivity can be momentary only;\nthere is one spiritual substantial unity. The subjective Spirit is the\nactive, but the objective Spirit is itself this activity; the active\nsubjective Spirit is that which comprehends the divine, and in its\ncomprehension of it it is itself the divine Spirit. The relation of\nSpirit to self alone is the absolute determination; the divine Spirit\nlives in its own communion and presence. This comprehension has been\ncalled Faith, but it is not an historical faith; we Lutherans\u2014I am\na Lutheran and will remain the same\u2014have only this original faith.\nThis unity is not the Substance of Spinoza, but the apprehending\nSubstance in self-consciousness which makes itself eternal and relates\nto universality. The talk about the limitations of human thought is\nfutile; to know God is the only end of Religion. The testimony of the\nSpirit to the content of Religion is itself Religion; it is a testimony\nthat both bears witness and at the same time is that witness. The\nSpirit proves itself, and does so first in the proof; it is only proved\nbecause it proves itself and shows or manifests itself.\nIt has further to be said, that this testimony, this inward stirring\nand self-consciousness, reveals itself, while in the enshrouded\nconsciousness of devotion it does not arrive at the proper\nconsciousness of an object, but only at the consciousness of immersion\nin absolute Being. This permeating and permeated Spirit now enters\ninto conception; God goes forth into the \u201cother\u201d and makes Himself\nobjective. All that pertains to revelation and its reception, and\nwhich comes before us in mythology, here appears; everything which is\nhistorical and which belongs to what is positive has here its proper\nplace. To speak more definitely, we now have the Christ who came into\nthe world nearly two thousand years ago. But He says, \u201cI am with you\neven unto the ends of the earth; where two or three are gathered\ntogether in My Name, there will I be in the midst.\u201d I shall not be seen\nof you in the flesh, but \u201cThe Spirit of Truth will guide you into all\nTruth.\u201d The external is not the true relation; it will disappear.\nThe two stages have here been given, the first of which is the stage\nof devotion, of worship, such as that reached in partaking of the\nCommunion. That is the perception of the divine Spirit in the community\nin which the present, indwelling, living Christ as self-consciousness\nhas attained to actuality. The second stage is that of developed\nconsciousness, when the content becomes the object; here this present,\nindwelling Christ retreats two thousand years to a small corner of\nPalestine, and is an individual historically manifested far away at\nNazareth or Jerusalem. It is the same thing in the Greek Religion where\nthe god present in devotion changes into prosaic statues and marble;\nor in painting, where this externality is likewise arrived at, when\nthe god becomes mere canvas or wood. The Supper is, according to the\nLutheran conception, of Faith alone; it is a divine satisfaction,\nand is not adored as if it were the Host. Thus a sacred image is no\nmore to us than is a stone or thing. The second point of view must\nindeed be that with which consciousness begins; it must start from the\nexternal comprehension of this form: it must passively accept report\nand take it up into memory. But if it remain where it is, that is the\nunspiritual point of view; to remain fixed in this second standpoint\nin this dead far-away historic distance, is to reject the Spirit. The\nsins of him who lies against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven. That\nlie is the refusal to be a universal, to be holy, that is to make\nChrist become divided, separated, to make Him only another person as\nthis particular person in Judea; or else to say that He now exists, but\nonly far away in Heaven, or in some other place, and not in present\nactual form amongst His people. The man who speaks of the _merely_\nfinite, of _merely_ human reason, and of the limits to mere reason,\nlies against the Spirit, for the Spirit as infinite and universal, as\nself-comprehension, comprehends itself not in a \u201cmerely\u201d nor in limits,\nnor in the finite as such. It has nothing to do with this, for it\ncomprehends itself within itself alone, in its infinitude.\nIf it be said of Philosophy that it makes reality the subject of its\nknowledge, the principal point is that the reality should not be one\noutside of that of which it is the reality. For example, if from the\nreal content of a book, I abstract the binding, paper, ink, language,\nthe many thousand letters that are contained in it, the simple\nuniversal content as reality, is not outside of the book. Similarly\nlaw is not outside of the individual, but it constitutes the true\nBeing of the individual. The reality of my Mind is thus in my Mind\nitself and not outside of it; it is my real Being, my own substance,\nwithout which I am without existence. This reality is, so to speak, the\ncombustible material which may be kindled and lit up by the universal\nreality as such as objective; and only so far as this phosphorus is\nin men, is comprehension, the kindling and lighting up, possible.\nFeeling, anticipation, knowledge of God, are only thus in men; without\nsuch, the divine Mind would not be the in and for itself Universal.\nReality is itself a real content and not the destitute of content\nand undetermined; yet, as the book has other content besides, there\nis in the individual mind also a great amount of other matter which\nbelongs only to the manifestation of this reality, and the individual\nsurrounded with what is external, must be separated from this\nexistence. Since reality is itself Spirit and not an abstraction, \u201cGod\nis not a God for the dead but for the living,\u201d and indeed for living\nspirits.\nThe great Creator was alone\nAnd experienced desire,\nTherefore He created Spirits,\nHoly mirrors of His holiness.\nThe noblest Being He found no equal;\nFrom out the bowl of all the spiritual world,\nThere sparkled up to Him infinitude.\nReligion is also the point of view from which this existence is known.\nBut as regards the different forms of knowledge existing in Religion\nand Philosophy, Philosophy appears to be opposed to the conception in\nReligion that the universal mind first shows itself as external, in the\nobjective mode of consciousness. Worship, commencing with the external,\nthen turns against and abrogates it as has just been said, and thus\nPhilosophy is justified through the acts and forms of worship, and only\ndoes what they do. Philosophy has to deal with two different objects;\nfirst as in the Religion present in worship, with the substantial\ncontent, the spiritual soul, and secondly with bringing this before\nconsciousness as object, but in the form of thought. Philosophy\nthinks and conceives of that which Religion represents as the object\nof consciousness, whether it is as the work of the imagination or as\nexistent facts in history. The form of the knowledge of the object\nis, in religious consciousness, such as pertains to the ordinary\nidea, and is thus more or less sensuous in nature. In Philosophy\nwe do not say that God begot a Son, which is a relation derived\nfrom natural life. Thought, or the substance of such a relation, is\ntherefore still recognized in Philosophy. Since Philosophy thinks its\nobject, it has the advantage of uniting the two stages of religious\nconsciousness\u2014which in Religion are different moments\u2014into one unity\nin philosophic thought.\nIt is these two forms which are different from one another and which,\nas opposed, may therefore seem to be mutually conflicting; and it\nis natural and it necessarily seems to be the case, that on first\ndefinitely coming to view they are so to speak conscious of their\ndiversity, and hence at first appear as inimical to one another. The\nfirst stage in the order of manifestation is definite existence, or\na determinate Being-for-self as opposed to the other. The later form\nis that Thought embraces itself in the concrete, immerses itself in\nitself, and Mind, as such, comes in it to consciousness. In the earlier\nstage, Mind is abstract, and in this constraint it knows itself to be\ndifferent, and in opposition to the other. When it embraces itself in\nthe concrete, it is no more simply confined in determinate existence,\nonly knowing or possessing itself in that diversity, but it is the\nUniversal which, inasmuch as it determines itself, contains its \u201cother\u201d\nwithin itself. As concrete intelligence, Mind thus comprehends the\nsubstantial in the form which seemed to differ from it, of which it had\nonly grasped the outward manifestation and had turned away from it; it\nrecognizes itself in its inward content, and so it for the first time\ngrasps its object, and deals justice to its opposite.\nGenerally speaking, the course of this antithesis in history is that\nThought first of all comes forth within Religion, as not free and in\nseparate manifestations. Secondly, it strengthens itself, feels itself\nto be resting upon itself, holds and conducts itself inimically towards\nthe other form, and does not recognize itself therein. In the third\nplace, it concludes by acknowledging itself as in this other. Or else\nPhilosophy has to begin with carrying on its work entirely on its\nown account, isolating Thought from all popular beliefs, and taking\nfor itself quite a different field of operation, a field for which\nthe world of ordinary ideas lies quite apart, so that the two exist\npeacefully side by side, or, to put it better, so that no reflection\non their opposition is arrived at. Just as little did the thought of\nreconciling them occur, since in the popular beliefs the same content\nappeared as in any external form other than the notion\u2014the thought\nthat is, of explaining and justifying popular belief, in order thus to\nbe able again to express the conceptions of free thought in the form of\npopular religion.\nThus we see Philosophy first restrained and confined within the range\nof the Greek heathen world; then resting upon itself, it goes forth\nagainst popular religion and takes up an unfriendly attitude to it,\nuntil it grasps that religion in its innermost and recognizes itself\ntherein. Thus the ancient Greek philosophers generally respected the\npopular religion, or at least they did not oppose it, or reflect upon\nit. Those coming later, including even Xenophanes, handled popular\nideas most severely, and thus many so-called atheists made their\nappearance. But as the spheres of popular conception, and abstract\nthought stood peacefully side by side, we also find Greek philosophers\nof even a later period in development, in whose case speculative\nthought and the act of worship, as also the pious invocation upon\nand sacrifice to the gods, coexist in good faith, and not in mere\nhypocrisy. Socrates was accused of teaching other gods than those\nbelonging to the popular religion; his _\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_ was indeed opposed\nto the principles of Greek morals and religion, but at the same time\nhe followed quite honestly the usages of his religion, and we know\nbesides that his last request was to ask his friends to offer a cock to\n\u00c6sculapius\u2014a desire quite inconsistent with his conclusions regarding\nthe existence of God and above all regarding morality. Plato declaimed\nagainst the poets and their gods. It was in a much later time that\nthe Neo-platonists first recognized in the popular mythology rejected\nearlier by the philosophers, the universal content; they transposed\nand translated it into what is significant for thought, and thus used\nmythology itself as a symbolical imagery for giving expression to their\nformulas.\nSimilarly do we see in the Christian Religion, thought which is not\nindependent first placing itself in conjunction with the form belonging\nto this Religion and acting within it\u2014that is to say, taking the\nReligion as its groundwork, and proceeding from the absolute assumption\nof the Christian doctrine. We see later on the opposition between\nso-called faith and so-called reason; when the wings of thought have\nbecome strengthened, the young eaglet flies away for himself to the sun\nof Truth; but like a bird of prey he turns upon Religion and combats\nit. Latest of all Philosophy permits full justice to be done to the\ncontent of Religion through the speculative Notion, which is through\nThought itself. For this end the Notion must have grasped itself in the\nconcrete and penetrated to concrete spirituality. This must be the\nstandpoint of the Philosophy of the present time; it has begun within\nChristianity and can have no other content than the world-spirit. When\nthat spirit comprehends itself in Philosophy, it also comprehends\nitself in that form which formerly was inimical to Philosophy.\nThus Religion has a content in common with Philosophy the forms alone\nbeing different; and the only essential point is that the form of the\nNotion should be so far perfected as to be able to grasp the content of\nReligion. The Truth is just that which has been called the mysteries\nof Religion. These constitute the speculative element in Religion\nsuch as were called by the Neo-platonists _\u03bc\u03c5\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, \u03bc\u03c5\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9_ (being\ninitiated), or being occupied with speculative Notions. By mysteries is\nmeant, superficially speaking, the secret, what remains such and does\nnot arrive at being known. But in the Eleusinian mysteries there was\nnothing unknown; all Athenians were initiated into them, Socrates alone\nshut himself out. Openly to make them known to strangers was the one\nthing forbidden, as indeed it was made a crime in the case of certain\npeople. Such matters however, as being holy, were not to be spoken of.\nHerodotus often expressly says (e.g. ii. 45-47) that he would speak\nof the Egyptian Divinities and mysteries in as far as it was pious so\nto do: he knew more, but it would be impious to speak of them. In the\nChristian Religion dogmas are called mysteries. They are that which man\nknows about the Nature of God. Neither is there anything mysterious in\nthis; it is known by all those who are partakers in that Religion, and\nthese are thus distinguished from the followers of other Religions.\nHence mystery here signifies nothing unknown, since all Christians are\nin the secret. Mysteries are in their nature speculative, mysterious\ncertainly to the understanding, but not to reason; they are rational,\njust in the sense of being speculative. The understanding does not\ncomprehend the speculative which simply is the concrete because it\nholds to the differences in their separation; their contradiction\nis indeed contained in the mystery, which, however, is likewise the\nresolution of the same.\nPhilosophy, on the contrary, is opposed to the so-called Rationalism\nof the new Theology which for ever keeps reason on its lips, but which\nis dry understanding only; no reason is recognizable in it as the\nmoment of independent thought which really is abstract thought and that\nalone. When the understanding which does not comprehend the truths of\nReligion, calls itself the illuminating reason and plays the lord and\nmaster, it goes astray. Rationalism is opposed to Philosophy in content\nand form, for it has made the content empty as it has made the heavens,\nand has reduced all that is, to finite relations\u2014in its form it is a\nreasoning process which is not free and which has no conceiving power.\nThe supernatural in Religion is opposed to rationalism, and if indeed\nthe latter is related in respect of the real content to Philosophy,\nyet it differs from it in form, for it has become unspiritual and\nwooden, looking for its justification to mere external authority. The\nscholastics were not supernaturalists in this sense; they knew the\ndogmas of the Church in thought and in conception. If Religion in the\ninflexibility of its abstract authority as opposed to thought, declares\nof it that \u201cthe gates of Hell shall not triumph over it,\u201d the gates of\nreason are stronger than the gates of Hell, not to overcome the Church\nbut to reconcile itself to the Church. Philosophy, as the conceiving\nthought of this content, has as regards the idea of Religion, the\nadvantage of comprehending both sides\u2014it comprehends Religion and\nalso comprehends both rationalism and supernaturalism and itself\nlikewise. But this is not the case on the other side. Religion from the\nstandpoint of idea, comprehends only what stands on the same platform\nas itself, and not Philosophy, the Notion, the universal thought\ndeterminations. Often no injustice is done to a Philosophy when its\nopposition to Religion has been made matter of reproach; but often,\ntoo, a wrong has been inflicted where this is done from the religious\npoint of view.\nThe form of Religion is necessary to Mind as it is in and for\nitself; it is the form of truth as it is for all men, and for every\nmode of consciousness. This universal mode is first of all for men\nin the form of sensuous consciousness, and then, secondly, in the\nintermingling of the form of the universal with sensuous manifestation\nor reflection\u2014the representing consciousness, the mythical, positive\nand historical form, is that pertaining to the understanding. What\nis received in evidence of Mind only becomes object to consciousness\nwhen it appears in the form of the understanding, that is to say,\nconsciousness must first be already acquainted with these forms from\nlife and from experience. Now, because thinking consciousness is not\nthe outward universal form for all mankind, the consciousness of the\ntrue, the spiritual and the rational, must have the form of Religion,\nand this is the universal justification of this form.\nWe have here laid down the distinction between Philosophy and Religion,\nbut taking into account what it is we wish to deal with in the history\nof Philosophy, there is something still which must be remarked upon,\nand which partly follows from what has been already said. There is\nthe question still confronting us as to what attitude we must take in\nreference to this matter in the history of Philosophy.\n_\u03b2. The religious element to be excluded from the content of the\nHistory of Philosophy._\n_\u03b1\u03b1_. Mythology first meets us, and it seems as if it might be drawn\nwithin the history of Philosophy. It is indeed a product of the\nimagination, but not of caprice, although that also has its place\nhere. But the main part of mythology is the work of the imaginative\nreason, which makes reality its object, but yet has no other means\nof so doing, than that of sensuous representation, so that the gods\nmake their appearance in human guise. Mythology can now be studied for\nart, &c. But the thinking mind must seek out the substantial content,\nthe thought and the theory implicitly contained therein, as reason\nis sought in Nature. This mode of treating mythology was that of the\nNeo-platonists; in recent times it has for the most part become the\nwork of my friend Creuzer in symbolism. This method of treatment is\ncombated and condemned by others. Man, it is said, must set to work\nhistorically alone, and it is not historic when a theory unthought\nof by the ancients, is read into a myth, or brought out of it. In\none light, this is quite correct, for it points to a method adopted\nby Creuzer, and also by the Alexandrians who acted in a similar way.\nIn conscious thought the ancients had not such theories before them,\nnor did anyone maintain them, yet to say that such content was not\nimplicitly present, is an absurd contention. As the products of reason,\nthough not of thinking reason, the religions of the people, as also\nthe mythologies, however simple and even foolish they may appear,\nindubitably contain as genuine works of art, thoughts, universal\ndeterminations and truth, for the instinct of reason is at their basis.\nBound up with this is the fact that since mythology in its expression\ntakes sensuous forms, much that is contingent and external becomes\nintermingled, for the representation of the Notion in sensuous forms\nalways possesses a certain incongruity, seeing that what is founded on\nimagination cannot express the Idea in its real aspect. This sensuous\nform produced as it is by an historic or natural method, must be\ndetermined on many sides, and this external determination must, more or\nless, be of such a nature as not to express the Idea. It may also be\nthat many errors are contained in that explanation, particularly when\na single one is brought within our notice; all the customs, actions,\nfurnishings, vestments, and offerings taken together, may undoubtedly\ncontain something of the Idea in analogy, but the connection is far\nremoved, and many contingent circumstances must find their entrance.\nBut that there is a Reason there, must certainly be recognized, and it\nis essential so to comprehend and grasp mythology.\nBut Mythology must remain excluded from our history of Philosophy.\nThe reason of this is found in the fact that in Philosophy we have\nto do not with theorems generally, or with thoughts which only are\n_implicite_ contained in some particular form or other, but with\nthoughts which are explicit, and only in so far as they are explicit\nand in so far as a content such as that belonging to Religion, has\ncome to consciousness in the form of Thought. And this is just what\nforms the immense distinction which we saw above, between capacity and\nactuality. The theorems which are _implicite_ contained within Religion\ndo not concern us; they must be in the form of thoughts, since Thought\nalone is the absolute form of the Idea.\nIn many mythologies, images are certainly used along with their\nsignificance, or else the images are closely attended by their\ninterpretation. The ancient Persians worshipped the sun, or fire, as\nbeing the highest existence; the first cause in the Persian Religion\nis Zervane Akerene\u2014unlimited time, eternity. This simple eternal\nexistence possesses according to Diogenes L\u00e6rtius (I. 8), \u201cthe two\nprinciples Ormuzd (_\u1f68\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2_) and Ahriman (_\u1f08\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2_), the rulers\nover good and evil.\u201d Plutarch in writing on Isis and Osiris (T. II. p.\n369, ed. Xyl.) says, \u201cIt is not one existence which holds and rules\nthe whole, but good is mingled with evil; nature as a rule brings\nforth nothing pure and simple; it is not one dispenser, who, like a\nhost, gives out and mixes up the drink from two different barrels. But\nthrough two opposed and inimical principles of which the one impels\ntowards what is right, and the other in the opposite direction, if not\nthe whole world, at least this earth is influenced in different ways.\nZoroaster has thus emphatically set up the one principle (Ormuzd) as\nbeing the Light, and the other (Ahriman) as the Darkness. Between the\ntwo (_\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd_) is Mithra, hence called by the Persians the\nMediator (_\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2_).\u201d Mithra is then likewise substance, the universal\nexistence, the sun raised to a totality. It is not the mediator between\nOrmuzd and Ahriman by establishing peace and leaving each to remain\nas it was; it does not partake of good and evil both, like an unblest\nmiddle thing, but it stands on the side of Ormuzd and strives with him\nagainst the evil. Ahriman is sometimes called the first-born son of the\nLight, but Ormuzd only remained within the Light. At the creation of\nthe visible world, Ormuzd places on the earth in his incomprehensible\nkingdom of Light, the firm arches of the heavens which are above yet\nsurrounded on every side with the first original Light. Midway to the\nearth is the high hill Albordi, which reaches into the source of Light.\nOrmuzd\u2019s empire of Light extended uninterruptedly over the firm vault\nof the heavens and the hill Albordi, and over the earth too, until\nthe third age was reached. Then Ahriman, whose kingdom of night was\nformerly bound beneath the earth, broke in upon Ormuzd\u2019s corporeal\nworld and ruled in common with him. Now the space between heaven and\nearth was divided into light and night. As Ormuzd had formerly only a\nspiritual kingdom of light, Ahriman had only one of night, but now that\nthey were intermingled he placed the terrestrial light thus created in\nopposition to the terrestrial night. From this time on, two corporeal\nworlds stand opposed, one pure and good, and one impure and evil, and\nthis opposition permeates all nature. On Albordi, Ormuzd created Mithra\nas mediator for the earth. The end of the creation of the bodily world\nis none other than to reinstate existence, fallen from its creator,\nto make it good again, and thus to make the evil disappear for ever.\nThe bodily world is the battle-ground between good and evil; but the\nbattle between light and darkness is not in itself an absolute and\nirreconcilable opposition, but one which can be conquered, and in it\nOrmuzd, the principle of Light, will be the conqueror.\nI would remark of this, that when we consider the elements in these\nideas which bear some further connection with Philosophy, the universal\nof that duality with which the Notion is necessarily set forth can\nalone be interesting and noteworthy to us; for in it the Notion is just\nthe immediate opposite of itself, the unity of itself with itself in\nthe \u201cother:\u201d a simple existence in which absolute opposition appears\nas the opposition of existence, and the sublation of that opposition.\nBecause properly the Light principle is the only existence of both, and\nthe principle of Darkness is the null and void,\u2014the principle of Light\nidentifies itself with Mithra, which was before called the highest\nexistence. The opposition has laid aside the appearance of contingency,\nbut the spiritual principle is not separate from the physical, because\nthe good and evil are both determined as Light and Darkness. We thus\nhere see thought breaking forth from actuality, and yet not such a\nseparation as only takes place in Religion, when the supersensuous\nis itself again represented in a manner sensuous, notionless and\ndispersed, for the whole of what is dispersed in sensuous form is\ngathered together in the one single opposition, and activity is thus\nsimply represented. These determinations lie much nearer to Thought;\nthey are not mere images or symbols, but yet these myths do not concern\nPhilosophy. In them Thought does not take the first place, for the\nmyth-form remains predominant. In all religions this oscillation\nbetween form and thought is found, and such a combination still lies\noutside Philosophy.\nThis is also so in the Sanchuniathonic Cosmogony of the Ph\u0153nicians.\nThese fragments, which are found in Eusebius (Pr\u00e6par. Evang. I. 10),\nare taken from the translation of the Sanchuniathon from Ph\u0153nician\ninto Greek made by a Grammarian named Philo from Biblus. Philo\nlived in the time of Vespasian and ascribes great antiquity to the\nSanchuniathon. It is there said, \u201cThe principles of things are found\nin Chaos, in which the elements exist undeveloped and confused, and\nin a Spirit of Air. The latter permeated the chaos, and with it\nengendered a slimy matter or mud (_\u1f30\u03bb\u03cd\u03bd_) which contained within it the\nliving forces and the germs of animals. By mingling this mud with the\ncomponent matter of chaos and the resulting fermentation, the elements\nseparated themselves. The fire elements ascended into the heights and\nformed the stars. Through their influence in the air, clouds were\nformed and the earth was made fruitful. From the mingling of water\nand earth, through the mud converted into putrefying matter, animals\ntook their origin as imperfect and senseless. These again begot other\nanimals perfect and endowed with senses. It was the crash of thunder in\na thunder-storm that caused the first animals still sleeping in their\nhusks to waken up to life.\u201d[7]\nThe fragments of Berosus of the Chaldeans were collected from Josephus,\nSyncellus and Eusebius under the title _Berosi Chaldaica_, by Scaliger,\nas an appendix to his work _De emendatione temporum_, and they are\nfound complete in the Greek Library of Fabricius (T. xiv. pp. 175-211).\nBerosus lived in the time of Alexander, is said to have been a Priest\nof Bel and to have drawn upon the archives of the temple at Babylon.\nHe says, \u201cThe original god is Bel and the goddess Omoroka (the sea),\nbut beside them there were yet other gods. Bel divided Omoroka in two,\nin order to create from her parts heaven and earth. Hereupon he cut\noff his own head and the human race originated from the drops of his\ndivine blood. After the creation of man, Bel banished the darkness,\ndivided heaven and earth, and formed the world into its natural shape.\nSince certain parts of the earth seemed to him to be insufficiently\npopulated, he compelled another god to lay hands upon himself, and from\nhis blood more men and more kinds of animals were created. At first\nthe men lived a wild and uncultivated life, until a monster\u201d (called\nby Berosus, Oannes) \u201cjoined them into a state, taught them arts and\nsciences, and in a word brought Humanity into existence. The monster\nset about this end with the rising of the sun out of the sea, and with\nits setting he again hid himself under the waves.\u201d\n_\u03b2\u03b2_. What belongs to Mythology may in the second place make a pretence\nof being a kind of Philosophy. It has produced philosophers who availed\nthemselves of the mythical form in order to bring their theories and\nsystems more prominently before the imagination, for they made the\nthoughts the content of the myth. But the myth is not a mere cloak\nin the ancient myths; it is not merely that the thoughts were there\nand were concealed. This may happen in our reflecting times; but the\nfirst poetry does not start from a separation of prose and poetry. If\nphilosophers used myths, it was usually the case that they had the\nthoughts and then sought for images appropriate to them; Plato has\nmany beautiful myths of this kind. Others likewise have spoken in\nmyths, as for example, Jacobi, whose Philosophy took the form of the\nChristian Religion, through which he gave utterance to matter of a\nhighly speculative nature. But this form is not suitable to Philosophy.\nThought which has itself as object, must have raised itself to its own\nform, to the form of thought. Plato is often esteemed on account of his\nmyths; he is supposed to have evinced by their means greater genius\nthan other philosophers were capable of. It is contended here that\nthe myths of Plato are superior to the abstract form of expression,\nand Plato\u2019s method of representation is certainly a wonderful one.\nOn closer examination we find that it is partly the impossibility of\nexpressing himself after the manner of pure thought that makes Plato\nput his meaning so, and also such methods of expression are only used\nby him in introducing a subject. When he comes to the matter in point,\nPlato expresses himself otherwise, as we see in the Parmenides, where\nsimple thought determinations are used without imagery. Externally\nthese myths may certainly serve when the heights of speculative thought\nare left behind, in order to present the matter in an easier form, but\nthe real value of Plato does not rest in his myths. If thought once\nattains power sufficient to give existence to itself within itself\nand in its element, the myth becomes a superfluous adornment, by\nwhich Philosophy is not advanced. Men often lay hold of nothing but\nthese myths. Hence Aristotle has been misunderstood just because he\nintersperses similes here and there; the simile can never be entirely\nin accord with thought, for it always carries with it something more.\nThe difficulty of representing thoughts as thoughts always attaches to\nthe expedient of expression in sensuous form. Thought, too, ought not\nto be concealed by means of the myth, for the object of the mythical\nis just to give expression to and to reveal thought. The symbol is\nundoubtedly insufficient for this expression; thought concealed in\nsymbols is not yet possessed, for thought is self-revealing, and hence\nthe myth does not form a medium adequate for its conveyance. Aristotle\n(Metaph. III. 4) says, \u201cIt is not worth while to treat seriously of\nthose whose philosophy takes a mythical form.\u201d Such is not the form in\nwhich thought allows itself to be stated, but only is a subordinate\nmode.\nConnected with this, there is a similar method of representing the\nuniversal content by means of numbers, lines and geometric figures.\nThese are figurative, but not concretely so, as in the case of myths.\nThus it may be said that eternity is a circle, the snake that bites\nits own tail. This is only an image, but Mind does not require such\na symbol. There are people who value such methods of representation,\nbut these forms do not go far. The most abstract determinations\ncan indeed be thus expressed, but any further progress brings about\nconfusion. Just as the freemasons have symbols which are esteemed\nfor their depth of wisdom\u2014depth as a brook is deep when one cannot\nsee the bottom\u2014that which is hidden very easily seems to men deep,\nor as if depth were concealed beneath. But when it is hidden, it may\npossibly prove to be the case that there is nothing behind. This is so\nin freemasonry, in which everything is concealed to those outside and\nalso to many people within, and where nothing remarkable is possessed\nin learning or in science, and least of all in Philosophy. Thought is,\non the contrary, simply its manifestation; clearness is its nature and\nitself. The act of manifestation is not a condition which may be or\nmay not be equally, so that thought may remain as thought when it is\nnot manifested, but its manifestation is itself, its Being. Numbers,\nas will be remarked in respect of the Pythagoreans, are unsuitable\nmediums for expressing thoughts; thus _\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c2_, _\u03b4\u03c5\u03ac\u03c2_, _\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2_ are,\nwith Pythagoras, unity, difference, and unity of the unity and of\nthe difference. The two first of the three are certainly united by\naddition; this kind of union is, however, the worst form of unity.\nIn Religion the three make their appearance in a deeper sense as the\nTrinity, and in Philosophy as the Notion, but enumeration forms a\nbad method of expression. There is the same objection to it as would\nexist to making the mensuration of space the medium for expressing the\nabsolute. People also quote the Philosophy of the Chinese, of the Fo\u00ef,\nin which it is said that thoughts are represented by numbers. Yet the\nChinese have explained their symbols and hence have made their meaning\nevident. Universal simple abstractions have been present to all people\nwho have arrived at any decree of culture.\n_\u03b3\u03b3_. We have still to remark in the third place, that Religion, as\nsuch, does not merely form its representations after the manner of\nart; and also that Poetry likewise contains actual thoughts. In the\ncase of the poets whose art has speech as medium, we find all through\ndeep universal thought regarding reality; these are more explicitly\nexpressed in the Indian Religion, but with the Indians everything is\nmixed up. Hence it is said that such races have also had a Philosophy\nproper to themselves; but the universal thoughts of interest in Indian\nbooks limit themselves to what is most abstract, to the idea of rising\nup and passing away, and thus of making a perpetual round. The story of\nthe Ph\u0153nix is well known as an example of this; it is one which took\nits origin in the East. We are able similarly to find thoughts about\nlife and death and of the transition of Being into passing away; from\nlife comes death and from death comes life; even in Being, in what\nis positive, the negation is already present. The negative side must\nindeed contain within it the positive, for all change, all the process\nof life is founded on this. But such reflections only occasionally come\nforth; they are not to be taken as being proper philosophic utterances.\nFor Philosophy is only present when thought, as such, is made the\nabsolute ground and root of everything else, and in these modes of\nrepresentation this is not so.\nPhilosophy does not reflect on any particular thing or object already\nexisting as a first substratum; its content is just Thought, universal\nthought which must plainly come first of all; to put it otherwise, the\nAbsolute must in Philosophy be in the form of thought. In the Greek\nReligion we find the thought-determination \u201ceternal necessity;\u201d which\nmeans an absolute and clearly universal relation. But such thought has\nother subjects besides; it only expresses a relation, the necessity to\nbe the true and all-embracing Being. Thus neither must we take this\nform into our consideration. We might speak in that way of a philosophy\nof Euripides, Schiller or Goethe. But all such reflection respecting,\nor general modes of representing what is true, the ends of men,\nmorality and so on, are in part only incidentally set forth, and in\npart they have not reached the proper form of thought, which implies\nthat what is so expressed must be ultimate, thus constituting the\nAbsolute.\n_\u03b3. Particular theories found in Religion._\nIn conclusion, the philosophy which we find within Religion does not\nconcern us. We find deep, speculative thoughts regarding the nature\nof God not only in the Indian Religions, but also in the Fathers and\nthe Schoolmen. In the history of dogmatism there is a real interest\nin becoming acquainted with these thoughts, but they do not belong\nto the history of Philosophy. Nevertheless more notice must be taken\nof the Schoolmen than of the Fathers, for they were certainly great\nphilosophers to whom the culture of Christendom owes much. But their\nspeculations belong in part to other philosophies such as to that of\nPlato, which must in so far be considered for themselves; partly, too,\nthey emanate from the speculative content of Religion itself which\nalready exists as independent truth in the doctrine of the Church,\nand belongs primarily to faith. Thus such modes of thought rest on an\nhypothesis and not on Thought itself; they are not properly speaking\nthemselves Philosophy or thought which rests on itself, but as ideas\nalready firmly rooted, they act on its behalf either in refuting\nother ideas and conclusions or in philosophically vindicating against\nthem their own religious teaching. Thought in this manner does not\nrepresent and know itself as the ultimate and absolute culmination of\nthe content, or as the inwardly self-determining Thought. Hence, too,\nwhen the Fathers, seeing that the content of the Christian Religion can\nonly be grasped after the speculative form, did, within the teaching\nof the Church, produce thoughts of a highly speculative nature, the\nultimate justification of these was not found in Thought as such, but\nin the teaching of the Church. Philosophic teaching here finds itself\nwithin a strongly bound system and not as thought which emanates freely\nfrom itself. Thus with the scholastics, too, Thought does not construct\nitself out of itself, but depends upon hypotheses; and although it ever\nrests more and more upon itself, it never does so in opposition to the\ndoctrine of the Church. Both must and do agree, since Thought has to\nprove from itself what the Church has already verified.\nc. _Philosophy proper distinguished from Popular Philosophy._\nOf the two departments of knowledge allied to Philosophy we found\nthat the one, that of the special sciences, could not be called a\nphilosophy in that it, as independent seeing and thinking immersed in\nfinite matter, and as the active principle in becoming acquainted with\nthe finite, was not the content, but simply the formal and subjective\nmoment. The second sphere, Religion, is deficient in that it only had\nthe content or the objective moment in common with Philosophy. In it\nindependent thought was an essential moment, since the subject had\nan imaginary or historical form. Philosophy demands the unity and\nintermingling of these two points of view; it unites the Sunday of\nlife when man in humility renounces himself, and the working-day when\nhe stands up independently, is master of himself and considers his\nown interests. A third point of view seems to unite both elements,\nand that is popular Philosophy. It deals with universal objects and\nphilosophizes as to God and the world; and thought is likewise occupied\nin learning about these matters. Yet this Philosophy must also be\ncast aside. The writings of Cicero may be put under this category;\nthey contain a kind of philosophy that has its own place and in which\nexcellent things are said. Cicero formed many experiences both in the\naffairs of life and mind, and from them and after observing what takes\nplace in the world, he deduced the truth. He expresses himself with\nculture on the concerns most important to man, and hence his great\npopularity. Fanatics and mystics may from another point of view be\nreckoned as in this category. They give expression to a deep sense of\ndevotion, and have had experiences in the higher regions. They are able\nto express the highest content, and the result is attractive. We thus\nfind the brightest gleams of thought in the writings of a Pascal\u2014as we\ndo in his _Pens\u00e9es_.\nBut the drawback that attaches to this Philosophy is that the ultimate\nappeal\u2014even in modern times\u2014is made to the fact that men are\nconstituted such as they are by nature, and with this Cicero is very\nfree. Here the moral instinct comes into question, only under the\nname of feeling; Religion now rests not on what is objective but on\nreligious feeling, because the immediate consciousness of God by men\nis its ultimate ground. Cicero makes copious use of the _consensus\ngentium_; in more modern times this appeal has been more or less left\nalone, since the individual subject has to rest upon himself. Feeling\nis first of all laid hold of, then comes reasoning from what is given,\nbut in these we can appeal to what is immediate only. Independent\nthought is certainly here advanced; the content too, is taken from the\nself; but we must just as necessarily exclude this mode of thinking\nfrom Philosophy. For the source from which the content is derived is\nof the same description as in the other cases. Nature is the source in\nfinite sciences, and in Religion it is Spirit; but here the source is\nin authority; the content is given and the act of worship removes but\nmomentarily this externality. The source of popular Philosophy is in\nthe heart, impulses and capacities, our natural Being, my impression of\nwhat is right and of God; the content is in a form which is of nature\nonly. I certainly have everything in feeling, but the whole content is\nalso in Mythology, and yet in neither is it so in veritable form. The\nlaws and doctrines of Religion are that in which this content always\ncomes to consciousness in a more definite way, while in feeling there\nstill is intermingled the arbitrary will of that which is subjective.\n3. COMMENCEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY AND OF ITS HISTORY.\nNow that we have thus defined the Notion of Philosophy to be the\nThought which, as the universal content, is complete Being, it will\nbe shown in the history of Philosophy how the determinations in this\ncontent make their appearance little by little. At first we only ask\nwhere Philosophy and its History begin.\n_a. Freedom of Thought as a first condition._\nThe general answer is in accordance with what has been said. Philosophy\nbegins where the universal is comprehended as the all-embracing\nexistence, or where the existent is laid hold of in a universal form,\nand where thinking about thought first commences. Where, then, has\nthis occurred? Where did it begin? That is a question of history.\nThought must be for itself, must come into existence in its freedom,\nliberate itself from nature and come out of its immersion in mere\nsense-perception; it must as free, enter within itself and thus arrive\nat the consciousness of freedom. Philosophy is properly to be commenced\nwhere the Absolute is no more in the form of ordinary conception, and\nfree thought not merely thinks the Absolute but grasps its Idea. That\nis to say where Thought grasps as Thought, the Being (which may be\nThought itself), which it recognizes as the essence of things, the\nabsolute totality and the immanent essence of everything, and does so\nas an external Being. The simple existence which is not sensuous and\nwhich the Jews thought of as God (for all Religion is thinking), is\nthus not a subject to be treated of by Philosophy, but just such a\nproposition as that \u201cThe existence or principle of things is water,\nfire or thought.\u201d\nThought, this universal determination which sets forth itself, is\nan abstract determinateness; it is the beginning of Philosophy, but\nthis beginning is at the same time in history, the concrete form taken\nby a people, the principle of which constitutes what we have stated\nabove. If we say that the consciousness of freedom is connected with\nthe appearance of Philosophy, this principle must be a fundamental\none with those with whom Philosophy begins; a people having this\nconsciousness of freedom founds its existence on that principle seeing\nthat the laws and the whole circumstances of the people are based\nonly on the Notion that Mind forms of itself, and in the categories\nwhich it has. Connected with this on the practical side, is the fact\nthat actual freedom develops political freedom, and this only begins\nwhere the individual knows himself as an independent individual to be\nuniversal and real, where his significance is infinite, or where the\nsubject has attained the consciousness of personality and thus desires\nto be esteemed for himself alone. Free, philosophic thought has this\ndirect connection with practical freedom, that as the former supplies\nthought about the absolute, universal and real object, the latter,\nbecause it thinks itself, gives itself the character of universality.\nThinking means the bringing of something into the form of universality;\nhence Thought first treats of the universal, or determines what is\nobjective and individual in the natural things which are present in\nsensuous consciousness, as the universal, as an objective Thought. Its\nsecond attribute is that in recognizing and knowing this objective and\ninfinite universal, I, at the same time, remain confronting it from the\nstandpoint of objectivity.\nOn account of this general connection between political freedom and the\nfreedom of Thought, Philosophy only appears in History where and in as\nfar as free institutions are formed. Since Mind requires to separate\nitself from its natural will and engrossment in matter if it wishes\nto enter upon Philosophy, it cannot do so in the form with which the\nworld-spirit commences and which takes precedence of that separation.\nThis stage of the unity of Mind with Nature which as immediate is not\nthe true and perfect state, is mainly found in the Oriental conception\nof existence, therefore Philosophy first begins in the Grecian world.\nb. _Separation of the East and its Philosophy._\nSome explanations have to be given regarding this first form.\nSince Mind in it, as consciousness and will, is but desire,\nself-consciousness still stands upon its first stage in which the\nsphere of its idea and will is finite. As intelligence is thus finite\ntoo, its ends are not yet a universal for themselves; but if a people\nmakes for what is moral, if laws and justice are possessed, the\ncharacter of universality underlies its will. This presupposes a new\npower in Mind with which it commences to be free, for the universal\nwill as the relation of thought to thought or as the universal,\ncontains a thought which is at home with itself. If a people desire to\nbe free, they will subordinate their desires to universal laws, while\nformerly that which was desired was only a particular. Now finitude\nof the will characterizes the orientals, because with them the will\nhas not yet grasped itself as universal, for thought is not yet free\nfor itself. Hence there can but be the relation of lord and slave,\nand in this despotic sphere fear constitutes the ruling category.\nBecause the will is not yet free from what is finite, it can therein\nbe comprehended and the finite can be shown forth as negative. This\nsensation of negation, that something cannot last, is just fear as\ndistinguished from freedom which does not consist in being finite\nbut in being for itself, and this cannot be laid hold of. Religion\nnecessarily has this character, since the fear of the Lord is the\nessential element beyond which we cannot get. \u201cThe fear of the Lord is\nthe beginning of wisdom\u201d is indeed a true saying; man must begin with\nthis in order to know the finite ends in their negative character. But\nman must also have overcome fear through the relinquishment of finite\nends, and the satisfaction which that Religion affords is confined\nto what is finite, seeing that the chief means of reconciliation are\nnatural forms which are impersonated and held in reverence.\nThe oriental consciousness raises itself, indeed, above the natural\ncontent to what is infinite; but it only knows itself as accidental\nin reference to the power which makes the individual fear. This\nsubordination may take two forms and must indeed from one extreme pass\nto the other. The finite, which is for consciousness, may have the form\nof finitude as finite, or it may become the infinite, which is however\nan abstraction. The man who lives in fear, and he who rules over\nmen through fear, both stand upon the same platform; the difference\nbetween them is only in the greater power of will which can go forth to\nsacrifice all that is finite for some particular end. The despot brings\nabout what his caprice directs, including certainly what is good, not\nas law, but as arbitrary will: the passive will, like that of slavery,\nis converted into the active energy of will, which will, however, is\narbitrary still. In Religion we even find self-immersion in the deepest\nsensuality represented as the service of God, and then there follows in\nthe East a flight to the emptiest abstraction as to what is infinite,\nas also the exaltation attained through the renunciation of everything,\nand this is specially so amongst the Indians, who torture themselves\nand enter into the most profound abstraction. The Indians look straight\nbefore them for ten years at a time, are fed by those around, and are\ndestitute of other spiritual content than that of knowing what is\nabstract, which content therefore is entirely finite. This, then, is\nnot the soil of freedom.\nIn the East, Mind indeed begins to dawn, but it is still true of it\nthat the subject is not presented as a person, but appears in the\nobjectively substantial, which is represented as partly supersensuous\nand partly, and even more, material, as negative and perishing. The\nhighest point attainable by the individual, the everlasting bliss, is\nmade an immersion into substance, a vanishing away of consciousness,\nand thus of all distinction between substance and individuality\u2014hence\nan annihilation. A spiritually dead relation thus comes into existence,\nsince the highest point there to be reached is insensibility. So\nfar, however, man has not attained that bliss, but finds himself to\nbe a single existent individual, distinguished from the universal\nsubstance. He is thus outside the unity, has no significance, and as\nbeing what is accidental and without rights, is finite only; he finds\nhimself limited through Nature\u2014in caste for instance. The will is\nnot here the substantial will; it is the arbitrary will given up to\nwhat is outwardly and inwardly contingent, for substance alone is the\naffirmative. With it greatness, nobility, or exaltitude of character,\nare certainly not excluded, but they are only present as the naturally\ndetermined or the arbitrary will, and not in the objective forms of\nmorality and law to which all owe respect, which hold good for all, and\nin which for that same reason all are recognized. The oriental subject\nthus has the advantage of independence, since there is nothing fixed;\nhowever undetermined is the substance of the Easterns, as undetermined,\nfree and independent may their character be. What for us is justice\nand morality is also in their state, but in a substantial, natural,\npatriarchal way, and not in subjective freedom. Conscience does not\nexist nor does morality. Everything is simply in a state of nature,\nwhich allows the noblest to exist as it does the worst.\nThe conclusion to be derived from this is that no philosophic knowledge\ncan be found here. To Philosophy belongs the knowledge of Substance,\nthe absolute Universal, that whether I think it and develop it or not,\nconfronts me still as for itself objective; and whether this is to me\nsubstantial or not, still just in that I think it, it is mine, that in\nwhich I possess my distinctive character or am affirmative: thus my\nthoughts are not mere subjective determinations or opinions, but, as\nbeing my thoughts, are also thoughts of what is objective, or they are\nsubstantial thoughts. The Eastern form must therefore be excluded from\nthe History of Philosophy, but still, upon the whole, I will take some\nnotice of it. I have touched on this elsewhere,[8] for some time ago we\nfor the first time reached a position to judge of it. Earlier a great\nparade was made about the Indian wisdom without any real knowledge of\nwhat it was; now this is for the first time known, and naturally it is\nfound to be in conformity with the rest.\nc. _Beginnings of Philosophy in Greece._\nPhilosophy proper commences in the West. It is in the West that\nthis freedom of self-consciousness first comes forth; the natural\nconsciousness, and likewise Mind disappear into themselves. In the\nbrightness of the East the individual disappears; the light first\nbecomes in the West the flash of thought which strikes within itself,\nand from thence creates its world out of itself. The blessedness of\nthe West is thus so determined that in it the subject as such endures\nand continues in the substantial; the individual mind grasps its Being\nas universal, but universality is just this relation to itself. This\nbeing at home with self, this personality and infinitude of the \u201cI\u201d\nconstitutes the Being of Mind; it is thus and can be none else. For a\npeople to know themselves as free, and to be only as universal, is for\nthem to be; it is the principle of their whole life as regards morality\nand all else. To take an example, we only know our real Being in so far\nas personal freedom is its first condition, and hence we never can be\nslaves. Were the mere arbitrary will of the prince a law, and should\nhe wish slavery to be introduced, we would have the knowledge that this\ncould not be. To sleep, to live, to have a certain office, is not our\nreal Being, and certainly to be no slave is such, for that has come to\nmean the being in nature. Thus in the West we are upon the soil of a\nveritable Philosophy.\nBecause in desire I am subject to another, and my Being is in a\nparticularity, I am, as I exist, unlike myself; for I am \u201cI,\u201d the\nuniversal complete, but hemmed in by passion. This last is self-will\nor formal freedom, which has desire as content. Amongst the Greeks we\nfirst find the freedom which is the end of true will, the equitable and\nright, in which I am free and universal, and others, too, are free, are\nalso \u201cI\u201d and like me; where a relationship between free and free is\nthus established with its actual laws, determinations of the universal\nwill, and justly constituted states. Hence it is here that Philosophy\nbegan.\nIn Greece we first see real freedom flourish, but still in a restricted\nform, and with a limitation, since slavery was still existent, and the\nstates were by its means conditioned. In the following abstractions we\nmay first of all superficially describe the freedom of the East, of\nGreece, and of the Teutonic world. In the East only one individual is\nfree, the despot; in Greece the few are free; in the Teutonic world\nthe saying is true that all are free, that is, man is free as man. But\nsince the one in Eastern countries cannot be free because that would\nnecessitate the others also being free to him, impulse, self-will, and\nformal freedom, can there alone be found. Since in Greece we have to\ndeal with the particular, the Athenians, and the Spartans, are free\nindeed, but not the Messenians or the Helots. The principle of the\n\u201cfew\u201d has yet to be discovered, and this implies some modifications of\nthe Greek point of view which we must consider in connection with the\nHistory of Philosophy. To take these into consideration means simply to\nproceed to the dividing up of Philosophy.\nC\nDIVISION, SOURCES, AND METHOD ADOPTED IN TREATING OF THE HISTORY OF\nPHILOSOPHY.\n1. DIVISION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.\nSince we set to work systematically this division must present itself\nas necessary. Speaking generally, we have properly only two epochs to\ndistinguish in the history of Philosophy, as in ancient and modern\nart\u2014these are the Greek and the Teutonic. The Teutonic Philosophy\nis the Philosophy within Christendom in so far as it belongs to the\nTeutonic nations; the Christian-European people, inasmuch as they\nbelong to the world of science, possess collectively Teutonic culture;\nfor Italy, Spain, France, England, and the rest, have through the\nTeutonic nations, received a new form. The influence of Greece also\nreaches into the Roman world, and hence we have to speak of Philosophy\nin the territory of the Roman world; but the Romans produced no proper\nPhilosophy any more than any proper poets. They have only received\nfrom and imitated others, although they have often done this with\nintelligence; even their religion is derived from the Greek, and the\nspecial character that it has, makes no approach to Philosophy and Art,\nbut is unphilosophical and inartistic.\nA further description of these two outstanding opposites must be given.\nThe Greek world developed thought as far as to the Idea; the Christian\nTeutonic world, on the contrary, has comprehended Thought as Spirit;\nIdea and Spirit are thus the distinguishing features. More particularly\nthe facts are as follows. Because God, the still undetermined and\nimmediate Universal, Being, or objective Thought, jealously allowing\nnothing to exist beside Him, is the substantial groundwork of all\nPhilosophy, which never alters, but ever sinks more deeply within\nitself, and through the development of determinations manifests itself\nand brings to consciousness, we may designate the particular character\nof the development in the first period of Philosophy by saying that\nthis development is a simple process of determinations, figurations,\nabstract qualities, issuing from the one ground that potentially\nalready contains the whole.\nThe second stage in this universal principle is the gathering up of\nthe determinations manifested thus, into ideal, concrete unity, in the\nmode of subjectivity. The first determinations as immediate, were still\nabstractions, but now the Absolute, as the endlessly self-determining\nUniversal, must furthermore be comprehended as active Thought, and not\nas the Universal in this determinate character. Hence it is manifested\nas the totality of determinations and as concrete individuality. Thus,\nwith the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras, and still more with Socrates, there\ncommences a subjective totality in which Thought grasps itself, and\nthinking activity is the fundamental principle.\nThe third stage, then, is that this totality, which is at first\nabstract, in that it becomes realized through the active,\ndetermining, distinguishing thought, sets itself forth even in the\nseparated determinations, which, as ideal, belong to it. Since these\ndeterminations are contained unseparated in the unity, and thus\neach in it is also the other, these opposed moments are raised into\ntotalities. The quite general forms of opposition are the universal\nand the particular, or, in another form, Thought as such, external\nreality, feeling or perception. The Notion is the identity of universal\nand particular; because each of these is thus set forth as concrete in\nitself, the universal is in itself at once the unity of universality\nand particularity, and the same holds good of particularity. Unity\nis thus posited in both forms, and the abstract moments can be made\ncomplete through this unity alone; thus it has come to pass that the\ndifferences themselves are each raised up to a system of totality,\nwhich respectively confront one another as the Philosophy of Stoicism\nand of Epicureanism. The whole concrete universal is now Mind; and\nthe whole concrete individual, Nature. In Stoicism pure Thought\ndevelops into a totality; if we make the other side from Mind\u2014natural\nbeing or feeling\u2014into a totality, Epicureanism is the result. Each\ndetermination is formed into a totality of thought, and, in accordance\nwith the simple mode which characterizes this sphere, these principles\nseem to be for themselves and independent, like two antagonistic\nsystems of Philosophy. Implicitly both are identical, but they\nthemselves take up their position as conflicting, and the Idea is also,\nas it is apprehended, in a one-sided determinateness.\nThe higher stage is the union of these differences. This may occur\nin annihilation, in scepticism; but the higher point of view is the\naffirmative, the Idea in relation to the Notion. If the Notion is,\nthen, the universal\u2014that which determines itself further within\nitself, but yet remains there in its unity and in the ideality and\ntransparency of its determinations which do not become independent\u2014the\nfurther step is, on the other hand, the reality of the Notion in which\nthe differences are themselves brought to totalities. Thus the fourth\nstage is the union of the Idea, in which all these differences, as\ntotalities, are yet at the same time blended into one concrete unity of\nNotion. This comprehension first takes place without constraint, since\nthe ideal is itself only apprehended in the element of universality.\nThe Greek world got as far as this Idea, since they formed an ideal\nintellectual world; and this was done by the Alexandrian Philosophy,\nin which the Greek Philosophy perfected itself and reached its end.\nIf we wish to represent this process figuratively, _A._ Thought, is\n(_\u03b1_) speaking generally abstract, as in universal or absolute space,\nby which empty space is often understood; (_\u03b2_) then the most simple\nspace determinations appear, in which we commence with the point in\norder that we may arrive at the line and angle; (_\u03b3_) what comes third\nis their union into the triangle, that which is indeed concrete, but\nwhich is still retained in this abstract element of surface, and\nthus is only the first and still formal totality and limitation which\ncorresponds to the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_. _B._ The next point is, that since we allow\neach of the enclosing lines of the triangle to be again surface, each\nforms itself into the totality of the triangle and into the whole\nfigure to which it belongs; that is the realization of the whole in the\nsides as we see it in Scepticism or Stoicism. _C._ The last stage of\nall is, that these surfaces or sides of the triangle join themselves\ninto a body or a totality; the body is for the first time the perfect\nspacial determination, and that is a reduplication of the triangle.\nBut in as far as the triangle which forms the basis is outside of the\npyramid, this simile does not hold good.\nGrecian Philosophy in the Neo-platonists finds its end in a perfect\nkingdom of Thought and of bliss, and in a potentially existent world\nof the ideal, which is yet unreal because the whole only exists in the\nelement of universality. This world still lacks individuality as such,\nwhich is an essential moment in the Notion; actuality demands that in\nthe identity of both sides of the Idea, the independent totality shall\nbe also posited as negative. Through this self-existent negation, which\nis absolute subjectivity, the Idea is first raised into Mind. Mind is\nthe subjectivity of self-knowledge; but it is only Mind inasmuch as\nit knows what is object to itself, and that is itself, as a totality,\nand is for itself a totality. That is to say, the two triangles which\nare above and below in the prism must not be two in the sense of being\ndoubled, but they must be one intermingled unity. Or, in the case of\nbody, the difference arises between the centre and the peripheral\nparts. This opposition of real corporeality and centre as the simple\nexistence, now makes its appearance, and the totality is the union of\nthe centre and the substantial\u2014not, however, the simple union, but a\nunion such that the subjective knows itself as subjective in relation\nto the objective and substantial. Hence the Idea is this totality,\nand the Idea which knows itself is essentially different from the\nsubstantial; the former manifests itself independently, but in such a\nmanner that as such it is considered to be for itself substantial. The\nsubjective Idea is at first only formal, but it is the real possibility\nof the substantial and of the potentially universal; its end is to\nrealize itself and to identify itself with substance. Through this\nsubjectivity and negative unity, and through this absolute negativity,\nthe ideal becomes no longer our object merely, but object to itself,\nand this principle has taken effect in the world of Christianity. Thus\nin the modern point of view the subject is for itself free, man is\nfree as man, and from this comes the idea that because he is Mind he\nhas from his very nature the eternal quality of being substantial. God\nbecomes known as Mind which appears to itself as double, yet removes\nthe difference that it may in it be for and at home with itself. The\nbusiness of the world, taking it as a whole, is to become reconciled\nwith Mind, recognizing itself therein, and this business is assigned to\nthe Teutonic world.\nThe first beginning of this undertaking is found in the Religion which\nis the contemplation of and faith in this principle as in an actual\nexistence before a knowledge of the principle has been arrived at. In\nthe Christian Religion this principle is found more as feeling and\nidea; in it man as man is destined to everlasting bliss, and is an\nobject of divine grace, pity and interest, which is as much as saying\nthat man has an absolute and infinite value. We find it further in\nthat dogma revealed through Christ to men, of the unity of the divine\nand human nature, according to which the subjective and the objective\nIdea\u2014man and God\u2014are one. This, in another form, is found in the\nold story of the Fall, in which the serpent did not delude man, for\nGod said, \u201cBehold, Adam has become as one of us, to know good and\nevil.\u201d We have to deal with this unity of subjective principle and of\nsubstance; it constitutes the process of Mind that this individual\none or independent existence of subject should put aside its immediate\ncharacter and bring itself forth as identical with the substantial.\nSuch an aim is pronounced to be the highest end attainable by man.\nWe see from this that religious ideas and speculation are not so far\nasunder as was at first believed, and I maintain these ideas in order\nthat we may not be ashamed of them, seeing that we still belong to\nthem, and so that if we do get beyond them, we may not be ashamed of\nour progenitors of the early Christian times, who held these ideas in\nsuch high esteem.\nThe first principle of that Philosophy which has taken its place in\nChristendom is thus found in the existence of two totalities. This\nis a reduplication of substance which now, however, is characterized\nby the fact that the two totalities are no longer external to one\nanother, but are clearly both required through their relation to one\nanother. If formerly Stoicism and Epicureanism, whose negativity was\nScepticism, came forth as independent, and if finally the implicitly\nexistent universality of both was established, these moments are now\nknown as separate totalities, and yet in their opposition they have\nto be thought of as one. We have here the true speculative Idea, the\nNotion in its determinations, each of which is brought into a totality\nand clearly relates to the other. We thus have really two Ideas, the\nsubjective Idea as knowledge, and then the substantial and concrete\nIdea; and the development and perfection of this principle and its\ncoming to the consciousness of Thought, is the subject treated by\nmodern Philosophy. Thus the determinations are in it more concrete than\nwith the ancients. This opposition in which the two sides culminate,\ngrasped in its widest significance, is the opposition between Thought\nand Being, individuality and substance, so that in the subject himself\nhis freedom stands once more within the bounds of necessity; it is the\nopposition between subject and object, and between Nature and Mind, in\nso far as this last as finite stands in opposition to Nature.\nThe Greek Philosophy is free from restraint because it does not yet\nhave regard to the opposition between Being and Thought, but proceeds\nfrom the unconscious presupposition that Thought is also Being.\nCertainly certain stages in the Greek Philosophy are laid hold of which\nseem to stand on the same platform as the Christian philosophies.\nThus when we see, for instance, in the Philosophy of the Sophists,\nthe new Academics, and the Sceptics, that they maintain the doctrine\nthat the truth is not capable of being known, they might appear to\naccord with the later subjective philosophies in asserting that all\nthought-determinations were only subjective in character, and that\nhence from these no conclusions could be arrived at as regards what is\nobjective. But there is really a difference. In the case of ancient\nphilosophies, which said that we know only the phenomenal, everything\nis confined to that; it is as regards practical life that the new\nAcademy and the Sceptics also admitted the possibility of conducting\noneself rightly, morally and rationally, when one adopts the phenomenal\nas one\u2019s rule and guide in life. But though it is the phenomenal that\nlies at the foundation of things, it is not asserted that there is\nlikewise a knowledge of the true and existent, as in the case of the\nmerely subjective idealists of a more modern day. These last still\nkeep in the background a potentiality, a beyond which cannot be known\nthrough thought or through conception. This other knowledge is an\nimmediate knowledge\u2014a faith in, a view of, and a yearning after,\nthe beyond such as was evinced by Jacobi. The ancients have no such\nyearning; on the contrary, they have perfect satisfaction and rest in\nthe certitude that only that which appears is for Knowledge. Thus it\nis necessary in this respect to keep strictly to the point of view\nfrom which we start, else through the similarity of the results, we\ncome to see in that old Philosophy all the determinate character of\nmodern subjectivity. Since in the simplicity of ancient philosophy the\nphenomenal was itself the only sphere, doubts as to objective thought\nwere not present to it.\nThe opposition defined, the two sides of which are in modern times\nreally related to one another as totalities, also has the form of an\nopposition between reason and faith, between individual perception\nand the objective truth which must be taken without reason of one\u2019s\nown, and even with a complete disregard for such reason. This is faith\nas understood by the church, or faith in the modern sense, i.e. a\nrejection of reason in favour of an inward revelation, called a direct\ncertainty or perception, or an implicit and intuitive feeling. The\nopposition between this knowledge, which has first of all to develop\nitself, and that knowledge which has already developed itself inwardly,\narouses a peculiar interest. In both cases the unity of thought or\nsubjectivity and of Truth or objectivity is manifested, only in the\nfirst form it is said that the natural man knows the Truth since\nhe intuitively believes it, while in the second form the unity of\nknowledge and Truth is shown, but in such a way that the subject raises\nitself above the immediate form of sensuous consciousness and reaches\nthe Truth first of all through Thought.\nThe final end is to think the Absolute as Mind, as the Universal, that\nwhich, when the infinite bounty of the Notion in its reality freely\nemits its determinations from itself, wholly impresses itself upon and\nimparts itself to them, so that they may be indifferently outside of\nor in conflict with one another, but so that these totalities are one\nonly, not alone implicitly, (which would simply be our reflection) but\nexplicitly identical, the determinations of their difference being thus\nexplicitly merely ideal. Hence if the starting-point of the history of\nPhilosophy can be expressed by saying that God is comprehended as the\nimmediate and not yet developed universality, and that its end\u2014the\ngrasping of the Absolute as Mind through the two and a half thousand\nyears\u2019 work of the thus far inert world-spirit\u2014is the end of our time,\nit makes it easy for us from one determination to go on through the\nmanifestation of its needs, to others. Yet in the course of history\nthis is difficult.\nWe thus have altogether two philosophies\u2014the Greek and the Teutonic.\nAs regards the latter we must distinguish the time when Philosophy made\nits formal appearance as Philosophy and the period of formation and of\npreparation for modern times. We may first begin Teutonic philosophy\nwhere it appears in proper form as Philosophy. Between the first\nperiod and those more recent, comes, as an intermediate period, that\nfermentation of a new Philosophy which on the one side keeps within the\nsubstantial and real existence and does not arrive at form, while on\nthe other side, it perfects Thought, as the bare form of a presupposed\ntruth, until it again knows itself as the free ground and source of\nTruth. Hence the history of Philosophy falls into three periods\u2014that\nof the Greek Philosophy, the Philosophy of the Middle Ages and the\nmodern Philosophy. Of these the first is speaking generally, regulated\nby Thought, the second falls into the opposition between existence and\nformal reflection, but the third has the Notion as its ground. This\nmust not be taken to mean that the first contains Thought alone; it\nalso has conceptions and ideas, just as the latter begins from abstract\nthoughts which yet constitute a duality.\n_First Period._\u2014This commences at the time of Thales, about 600 B.C.,\nand goes on to the coming to maturity of the Neo-platonic philosophy\nwith Plotinus in the third century; from thence to its further progress\nand development with Proclus in the fifth century until the time when\nall philosophy was extinguished. The Neo-platonic philosophy then made\nits entrance into Christianity later on, and many philosophies within\nChristianity have this philosophy as their only groundwork. This is a\nspace of time extending to about 1000 years, the end of which coincides\nwith the migration of the nations and the decline of the Roman Empire.\n_Second Period._\u2014The second period is that of the Middle Ages.\nThe Scholastics are included in it, and Arabians and Jews are also\nhistorically to be noticed, but this philosophy mainly falls within the\nChristian Church. This period is of something over 1000 years\u2019 duration.\n_Third Period._\u2014The Philosophy of modern times made its first\nindependent appearance after the Thirty Years\u2019 War, with Bacon, Jacob\nB\u00f6hm and Descartes; it begins with the distinction contained in:\n_cogito ergo sum_. This period is one of a couple of centuries and the\nphilosophy is consequently still somewhat modern.\n2. SOURCES OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.\nWe have to seek for sources of another kind in this than in political\nhistory. There historians are the fountainheads, which again have\nas sources the deeds and sayings of individuals; and the historians\nwho are not original have over and above performed their work at\nsecondhand. But historians always have the deeds already present\nin history, that is to say, here brought into the form of ordinary\nconception; for the name of history has two meanings: it signifies\non the one hand the deeds and events themselves, and on the other,\nit denotes them in so far as they are formed through conception for\nconception. In the history of Philosophy there are, on the contrary,\nnot any sources which can be derived from historians, but the deeds\nthemselves lie before us, and these\u2014the philosophic operations\nthemselves\u2014are the true sources. If we wish to study the history of\nPhilosophy in earnest, we must go to such springs as these. Yet these\noperations form too wide a field to permit of our keeping to it alone\nin this history. In the case of many philosophers it is absolutely\nnecessary to confine oneself to the original authors, but in many\nperiods, in which we cannot obtain original sources, seeing that they\nhave not been preserved to us, (as, for instance, in that of the older\nGreek philosophy) we must certainly confine our attention simply to\nhistorians and other writers. There are other periods, too, where it is\ndesirable that others should have read the works of the philosophers\nand that we should receive abstracts therefrom. Several schoolmen\nhave left behind them works of sixteen, twenty-four and twenty-six\nfolios, and hence we must in their case confine ourselves to the\nresearches of others. Many philosophic works are also rare and hence\ndifficult to obtain. Many philosophers are for the most part important\nfrom an historic or literary point of view only, and hence we may\nlimit ourselves to the compilations in which they are dealt with. The\nmost noteworthy works on the history of Philosophy are, however, the\nfollowing, regarding which I refer for particulars to the summary of\nTennemann\u2019s History of Philosophy, by A. Wendt, since I do not wish to\ngive any complete list.\n1. One of the first Histories of Philosophy, which is only interesting\nas an attempt, is the \u201cHistory of Philosophy,\u201d by Thomas Stanley\n(London, 1655, folio ed. III., 1701, 4. translated into Latin by\nGodofr. Olearius, Lipsi\u00e6, 1711, 4). This history is no longer much\nused, and only contains the old philosophic schools in the form of\nsects and as if no new ones had existed. That is to say, it keeps to\nthe old belief commonly held at that time, that there only were ancient\nphilosophies and that the period of philosophy came to an end with\nChristianity, as if Philosophy were something belonging to heathendom\nand the truth only could be found in Christianity. In it a distinction\nwas drawn between Truth as it is created from the natural reason in the\nancient philosophies, and the revealed truth of the Christian religion,\nin which there was consequently no longer any Philosophy. In the time\nof the Revival of Learning there certainly were no proper philosophies,\nand above all in Stanley\u2019s time systems of Philosophy proper were too\nyoung for the older generations to have the amount of respect for them\nnecessary to allow of their being esteemed as realities.\n2. _Jo. Jac. Bruckeri Historia critica philosophi\u00e6, Lipsi\u00e6_, 1742-1744,\nfour parts, or five volumes in four, for the fourth part has two\nvolumes. The second edition, unaltered, but with the addition of\na supplement, 1766-1767, four parts in six quartos, the last of\nwhich forms the supplement. This is an immense compilation which is\nnot formed straight from the original sources, but is mixed with\nreflections after the manner of the times. As we have seen from an\nexample above (p. 43) the accounts given are in the highest degree\ninaccurate. Brucker\u2019s manner of procedure is entirely unhistoric, and\nyet nowhere ought we to proceed in a more historic manner than in\nthe history of Philosophy. This work is thus simply so much useless\nballast. An epitome of the same is _Jo. Jac. Bruckeri Institutiones\nhistori\u00e6 philosophic\u00e6, usui academic\u00e6 juventutis adornat\u00e6, Lipsi\u00e6_,\n1747, 8; second edition, Leipzig, 1756; third edition prepared by Born,\nLeipzig, 1790, 8.\n3. Dietrich Tiedmann\u2019s _Geist der Speculativen Philosophie_, Marburg,\n1791-1797, 6 vols., 8. He treats of political history diffusely, but\nwithout any life, and the language is stiff and affected. The whole\nwork is a melancholy example of how a learned professor can occupy his\nwhole life with the study of speculative philosophy, and yet have no\nidea at all of speculation. His _argumenta_ to the Plato of Brucker\nare of the same description. In every history he makes abstracts from\nthe philosophers so long as they keep to mere ratiocination, but when\nthe speculative is arrived at, he becomes irate, declaring it all to\nbe composed of empty subtleties, and stops short with the words \u201cwe\nknow better.\u201d His merit is that he has supplied valuable abstracts\nfrom rare books belonging to the Middle Ages and from cabalistic and\nmystical works of that time.\n4. Joh. Gottlieb Buhle: _Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie und\neiner kritischen Literatur derselben_, G\u00f6ttingen, 1796 to 1804, eight\nparts, 8. Ancient philosophy is treated with disproportionate brevity;\nthe further Buhle went on, the more particular he became. He has many\ngood summaries of rare works, as for instance those of Giordano Bruno,\nwhich were in the G\u00f6ttingen Library.\n5. Wilh. Gottl. Tennemann\u2019s _Geschichte der Philosophie_, Leipzig,\n1798\u20141819, eleven parts, 8. The eighth part, the Scholastic\nPhilosophy, occupies two volumes. The philosophies are fully described,\nand the more modern times are better done than the ancient. The\nphilosophies of recent times are easier to describe, since it is only\nnecessary to make an abstract or to interpret straight on, for the\nthoughts contained in them lie nearer to ours. It is otherwise with\nthe ancient philosophers, because they stand in another stage of\nthe Notion, and on this account they are likewise more difficult to\ngrasp. That is to say, what is old is easily overthrown by something\nelse more familiar to us, and where Tennemann comes across such he is\nalmost useless. In Aristotle, for instance, the misinterpretation is so\ngreat, that Tennemann foists upon him what is directly opposite to his\nbeliefs, and thus from the adoption of the opposite to what Tennemann\nasserts to be Aristotle\u2019s opinion, a correct idea of Aristotelian\nphilosophy is arrived at. Tennemann is then candid enough to place the\nreference to Aristotle underneath the text, so that the original and\nthe interpretation often contradict one another. Tennemann thinks that\nit is really the case that the historian should have no philosophy, and\nhe glories in that; yet he really has a system and he is a critical\nphilosopher. He praises philosophers, their work and their genius,\nand yet the end of the lay is that all of them will be pronounced to\nbe wanting in that they have one defect, which is not to be Kantian\nphilosophers and not yet to have sought the source of knowledge. From\nthis the result is that the Truth could not be known.\nOf compendiums, three have to be noticed. 1. Frederick Aft\u2019s _Grundriss\neiner Geschichte der Philosophie_. (Landshut, 1807, 8; second edition,\n1825) is written from a better point of view; the Philosophy is that\nof Schelling for the most part, but it is somewhat confused. Aft by\nsome formal method has distinguished ideal philosophy from real. 2.\nProfessor Wendt\u2019s G\u00f6ttingen edition of Tennemann (fifth edition,\nLeipzig, 1828, 8). It is astonishing to see what is represented as\nbeing Philosophy, without any consideration as to whether it has any\nmeaning or not. Such so-called new philosophies grow like mushrooms out\nof the ground. There is nothing easier than to comprehend in harmony\nwith a principle; but it must not be thought that hence something\nnew and profound has been accomplished. 3. Rirner\u2019s _Handbuch der\nGeschichte der Philosophie_, 3 vols., Sulzbach, 1822-1823, 8 (second\namended edition, 1829) is most to be commended, and yet I will not\nassert that it answers all the requirements of a History of Philosophy.\nThere are many points which leave much to desire, but the appendices\nto each volume in which the principal original authorities are quoted,\nare particularly excellent for their purpose. Selected extracts, more\nspecially from the ancient philosophers, are needed, and these would\nnot be lengthy, since there are not very many passages to be given from\nthe philosophers before Plato.\n3. METHOD OF TREATMENT ADOPTED IN THIS HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.\nAs regards external history I shall only touch upon that which is\nthe concern of universal history, the spirit or the principle of the\ntimes, and hence I will treat of conditions of life in reference to\nthe outstanding philosophers. Of philosophies, however, only those\nare to be made mention of the principles of which have caused some\nsensation, and through which science has made an advance; hence I shall\nput aside many names which would be taken up in a learned treatise, but\nwhich are of little value in respect to Philosophy. The history of the\ndissemination of a doctrine, its fate, those who have merely taught a\nparticular doctrine, I pass over, as the deduction of the whole world\nfrom one particular principle.\nThe demand that in Philosophy an historian should have no system,\nshould put into the philosophy nothing of his own, nor assail it with\nhis ideas, seems a plausible one. The history of Philosophy should\nshow just this impartiality, and it seems in so far that to give only\nsummaries of the philosophers proves a success. He who understands\nnothing of the matter, and has no system, but merely historic\nknowledge, will certainly be impartial. But political history has to\nbe carefully distinguished from the history of Philosophy. That is\nto say, though in the former, one is not indeed at liberty to limit\noneself to representing the events chronologically only, one can yet\nkeep to what is entirely objective, as is done in the Homeric epic.\nThus Herodotus and Thucydides, as free men, let the objective world\ndo freely and independently as it would; they have added nothing of\ntheir own, neither have they taken and judged before their tribunal the\nactions which they represented. Yet even in political history there is\nalso a particular end kept in view. In Livy the main points are the\nRoman rule, its enlargement, and the perfecting of the constitution;\nwe see Rome arise, defend itself, and exercise its mastery. It is thus\nthat the self-developing reason in the history of Philosophy makes of\nitself an end, and this end is not foreign or imported, but is the\nmatter itself, which lies at the basis as universal, and with which the\nindividual forms of themselves correspond. Thus when the history of\nPhilosophy has to tell of deeds in history, we first ask, what a deed\nin Philosophy is; and whether any particular thing is philosophic or\nnot. In external history everything is in action\u2014certainly there is in\nit what is important and that which is unimportant\u2014but action is the\nidea immediately placed before us. This is not the case in Philosophy,\nand on this account the history of Philosophy cannot be treated\nthroughout without the introduction of the historian\u2019s views.\nORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY\nTHE first Philosophy in order is the so-called Oriental, which,\nhowever, does not enter into the substance or range of our subject\nas represented here. Its position is preliminary, and we only deal\nwith it at all in order to account for not treating of it at greater\nlength, and to show in what relation it stands to Thought and to true\nPhilosophy. The expression Eastern philosophy is specially employed\nin reference to the period in which this great universal Oriental\nconception aroused the East\u2014the land of circumscription and of\nlimitation, where the spirit of subjectivity reigns. More particularly\nin the first centuries of Christendom\u2014that significant period\u2014did\nthese great Oriental ideas penetrate into Italy; and in the Gnostic\nphilosophy they began to force the idea of the illimitable into the\nWestern mind, until in the Church the latter again succeeded in\nobtaining the ascendency and hence in firmly establishing the Divine.\nThat which we call Eastern Philosophy is more properly the religious\nmode of thought and the conception of the world belonging generally\nto the Orientals and approximates very closely to Philosophy; and to\nconsider the Oriental idea of religion just as if it were religious\nphilosophy, is to give the main reason why it is so like.\nWe do not similarly maintain that the Roman, Greek and Christian\nReligions constitute Philosophy. These bear all the less similarity\nthereto in that the Greek and Roman gods as also Christ and the God\nof the Jews, on account of the principle of individual freedom which\npenetrates the Greek and still more the Christian element, make their\nappearance immediately as the explicit, personal forms, which, being\nmythological or Christian, must first be themselves interpreted and\nchanged into a philosophic form. In the case of Eastern Religion, on\nthe contrary, we are much more directly reminded of the philosophic\nconception, for since in the East the element of subjectivity has\nnot come forth, religious ideas are not individualized, and we have\npredominating a kind of universal ideas, which hence present the\nappearance of being philosophic ideas and thoughts. The Orientals\ncertainly have also individual forms, such as Brahma, Vishnu and Civa,\nbut because freedom is wanting the individuality is not real, but\nmerely superficial. And so much is this the case, that when we suppose\nthat we have to deal with a human form, the same loses itself again and\nexpands into the illimitable. Just as we hear amongst the Greeks of a\nUranus and Chronos\u2014of Time individualized\u2014we find with the Persians,\nZeroane Akerene, but it is Time unlimited. We find Ormuzd and Ahriman\nto be altogether general forms and ideas; they appear to be universal\nprinciples which thus seem to bear a relationship to Philosophy or even\nseem to be themselves philosophic.\nJust as the content of the Eastern religions, God, the essentially\nexistent, the eternal, is comprehended somewhat in the light of\nuniversal, we find the relative positions of individuals to Him to be\nthe same. In the Eastern religions the first condition is that only\nthe one substance shall, as such, be the true, and that the individual\nneither can have within himself, nor can he attain to any value in as\nfar as he maintains himself as against the being in and for itself.\nHe can have true value only through an identification with this\nsubstance in which he ceases to exist as subject and disappears into\nunconsciousness. In the Greek and Christian Religion, on the other\nhand, the subject knows himself to be free and must be maintained as\nsuch; and because the individual in this way makes himself independent,\nit is undoubtedly much more difficult for Thought to free itself from\nthis individuality and to constitute itself in independence. The\nhigher point of view implicitly contained in the Greek individual\nfreedom, this happier, larger life, makes more difficult the work of\nThought, which is to give due value to the universal. In the East,\non the contrary, the substantial in Religion is certainly on its own\nview the principal matter, the essential\u2014and with it lawlessness,\nthe absence of individual consciousness is immediately connected\u2014and\nthis substance is undoubtedly a philosophic idea. The negation of\nthe finite is also present, but in such a manner that the individual\nonly reaches to its freedom in this unity with the substantial. In as\nfar as in the Eastern mind, reflection, consciousness come through\nthought to distinction and to the determination of principles, there\nexist such categories and such definite ideas not in unity with the\nsubstantial. The destruction of all that is particular either is an\nillimitable, the exaltitude of the East, or, in so far as that which\nis posited and determined for itself is known, it is a dry, dead\nunderstanding, which cannot take up the speculative Notion into itself.\nTo that which is true, this finite can exist only as immersed in\nsubstance; if kept apart from this it remains dead and arid. We thus\nfind only dry understanding amongst the Easterns, a mere enumeration\nof determinations, a logic like the Wolffian of old. It is the same as\nin their worship, which is complete immersion in devotion and then an\nendless number of ceremonials and of religious actions; and this on the\nother side is the exaltitude of that illimitable in which everything\ndisappears.\nThere are two Eastern nations with which I wish just now to deal\u2014the\nChinese and the Indian.\nA. CHINESE PHILOSOPHY.\nIt is true of the Chinese as well as of the Indians that they have a\ngreat reputation for culture; but this, as well as the amount of Indian\nliterature which exists, has largely diminished through a further\nknowledge of it. The great knowledge of these people bears upon such\nsubjects as Religion, Science, the constitution and administration\nof the state, poetry, handicrafts and commerce. But when we compare\nthe laws and constitution of China with the European, we find that\nwe can only do so in respect of what is formal, for the content is\nvery different. It is also felt, however consistently they may be\nconstituted as to form, that they cannot find their place with us, that\nwe could not allow of their giving us satisfaction, and that they take\nthe place of law, or rather that they put an end to it. It is the same\nthing when we compare Indian poetry with European; considered as a mere\nplay of the imagination it is as brilliant, rich and cultured as that\nof any other people. But in poetry we have to do with content, and that\nis the important part of it. Even the Homeric poetry is not serious for\nus, and hence such poetry cannot last. It is not the lack of genius\nin the Oriental poetry; the amount of genius is the same and the form\nmay be very much developed, but the content remains confined within\ncertain bounds and cannot satisfy us, nor can it be our content. This\nis at outset a fact applying universally to such comparisons, inasmuch\nas men let themselves be dazzled by form, making it equal with, or even\npreferring it to ours.\n1. _Confucius_. The first subject of remark with regard to the Chinese\nrespects the teaching of Confucius (500 years before Christ) which\nmade a great sensation in Liebnitz\u2019 time; this teaching is a moral\nphilosophy. Confucius has, besides, commented upon the old traditional\nprinciples of the Chinese; his high moral teaching, however, gave him\nhis great fame, and that teaching is the authority most esteemed in\nChina. Confucius\u2019 Biography has been translated by French missionaries\nfrom the original Chinese; from this he appears to have been almost\ncontemporaneous with Thales, to have been for a considerable time\nMinister, to have then fallen into disfavour, lost his place and\nlived and philosophized amongst his own friends, while still being\noften asked to give advice. We have conversations between Confucius\nand his followers in which there is nothing definite further than a\ncommonplace moral put in the form of good, sound doctrine, which may be\nfound as well expressed and better, in every place and amongst every\npeople. Cicero gives us _De Officiis_, a book of moral teaching more\ncomprehensive and better than all the books of Confucius. He is hence\nonly a man who has a certain amount of practical and worldly wisdom\u2014one\nwith whom there is no speculative philosophy. We may conclude from his\noriginal works that for their reputation it would have been better had\nthey never been translated. The treatise which the Jesuits produced[9]\nis, however, more a paraphrase than a translation.\n2. _The Philosophy of the Y-king_. A second matter of remark is\nthat the Chinese have also taken up their attention with abstract\nthoughts and with pure categories. The old book Y-king, or the Book of\nPrinciples, serves as the foundation for such; it contains the wisdom\nof the Chinese, and its origin is attributed to Fohi. That which is\nthere by him related passes into what is quite mythological, fabulous\nand even senseless. The main point in it is the ascription to him of\nthe discovery of a table with certain signs or figures (Ho-tu) which\nhe saw on the back of a horse-dragon as it rose out of the river.[10]\nThis table contains parallel lines above one another, which have a\nsymbolical signification; and the Chinese say that these lines are\nthe foundation of their characters as also of their philosophy. These\nsymbols are quite abstract categories, and consequently the most\nsuperficial determinations of the understanding. It must certainly be\nconsidered that pure thoughts are brought to consciousness, but in this\ncase we make no advance, merely remaining stationary so far as they\nare concerned. The concrete is not conceived of speculatively, but\nis simply taken from ordinary ideas, inasmuch as it is expressed in\naccordance with their forms of representation and of perception. Hence\nin this collection of concrete principles there is not to be found\nin one single instance a sensuous conception of universal natural or\nspiritual powers.\nTo satisfy the curious, I will give these principles in greater detail.\nThe two fundamental, figures are a horizontal line (\u268a, Yang) and the\none which is broken into two equal parts (\u268b, Yin). The first which is\nthe perfect, the father, the manlike, the unity, such as is represented\nby the Pythagoreans, represents the affirmative; the second is the\nimperfect, the mother, the womanly, the duality and the negation.\nThese signs are held in high esteem, for they are considered to be\nthe Principles of things. First of all they are placed in combination\nof two from which four figures result: \u268c, \u268d, \u268e, \u268f, or the great Yang,\nthe little Yang, the little Yin, and the great Yin. The signification\nof these four representations is matter as perfect and imperfect. The\ntwo Yangs are perfect matter: the first is in the category of youth\nand power; the second is the same matter, but as old and powerless.\nThe third and fourth images, where Yin constitutes the basis, are\nimperfect matter, which has again the two determinations of youth and\nage, strength and weakness. These lines are further united in sets of\nthree, and thus eight figures result, which are called Kua, \u2630, \u2631, \u2632, \u2633,\n\u2634, \u2635, \u2636, \u2637. I will give the interpretation of these Kua just to show\nhow superficial it is. The first sign, containing the great Yang and\nthe Yang is the Heavens (Tien) or the all-pervading ether. The Heavens\nto the Chinese means what is highest, and it has been a great source\nof division amongst the missionaries whether they ought to call the\nChristian God, Tien, or not. The second sign is pure water (Tui),\nthe third pure fire (Li), the fourth thunder (Tschin), the fifth wind\n(Siun), the sixth common water (Kan), the seventh mountains (Ken), the\neighth the earth (Kuen). We should not place heaven, thunder, wind\nand mountains on the same footing. We may thus obtain a philosophic\norigin for everything out of these abstract thoughts of absolute unity\nand duality. All symbols have the advantage of indicating thoughts\nand of calling up significations, and in this way such are likewise\npresent there. Thought thus forms the first beginning, but afterwards\nit goes into the clouds, and Philosophy does likewise. Therefore\nif Windischmann[11] in his commentary recognizes in this system of\nConfucius, a \u201cthorough interconnection between all Kua in the whole\nseries,\u201d it should be remembered that not a particle of the Notion is\nto be found in it.\nUnited further in sets of four, the lines produce sixty-four figures,\nwhich the Chinese consider to be the origin of their characters,\nsince there have been added to these straight lines those which are\nperpendicular and inclined in different directions.\nIn Schuking there is also a chapter on Chinese wisdom, where the five\nelements from which everything is made make their appearance. These are\nfire, water, wood, metal and earth, which exist all in confusion, and\nwhich we should no more than we did before, allow to be principles. The\nfirst canon in the law is found in the Schuking, as the naming of the\nfive elements; the second, considerations upon the last, and so it goes\non.[12] Universal abstraction with the Chinese thus goes on to what is\nconcrete, although in accordance with an external kind of order only,\nand without containing anything that is sensuous. This is the principle\nof all Chinese wisdom and of all the objects of study in China.\n3. _The Sect of the Tao-See_. There is yet another separate sect,\nthat of the Tao-See, the followers of which are not mandarins and\nattached to the state religion, nor are they Buddhists or Lamaics. The\noriginator of this philosophy and the one who was closely connected\nwith it in his life, is Lao-Ts\u00f6, who was born in the end of the seventh\ncentury before Christ and who was older than Confucius, for this\nrepresentative of the more political school went to him in order to\nask his advice. The book of the Lao-Ts\u00f6, Tao-king, is certainly not\nincluded in the proper Kings and has not their authority, but it is\nan important work amongst the Taosts or the followers of reason, who\ncall their rule in life Tao-Tao, which means the observation of the\ndictates or the laws of reason. They dedicate their lives to the study\nof reason, and maintain that he who knows reason in its source will\npossess universal science, remedies for every ill and all virtue; he\nwill also have obtained a supernatural power of being able to fly to\nheaven and of not dying.[13]\nHis followers say of Lao-Ts\u00f6 himself that he is Buddha who as man\nbecame the ever-existent God. We still have his principal writings;\nthey have been taken to Vienna, and I have seen them there myself.\nOne special passage is frequently taken from them: \u201cWithout a name\nTao[14] is the beginning of Heaven and Earth, and with a name she is\nthe Mother of the Universe. It is only in her imperfect state that she\nis considered with affection; who desires to know her must be devoid\nof passions.\u201d Abel R\u00e9musat says that taken at its best this might be\nexpressed by the Greek in _\u03cc\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_. The celebrated passage which is\noften quoted by the ancients is this,[15] \u201cReason has brought forth\nthe one; the one has brought forth the two; the two have brought forth\nthe three; and the three have produced the whole world.\u201d In this men\nhave tried to find a reference to the Trinity. \u201cThe Universe rests\nupon the principle of Darkness, the universe embraces the principle of\nLight,\u201d or \u201cit is embraced by ether;\u201d it can be thus reversed, because\nthe Chinese language has no case inflection, the words merely standing\nin proximity. Another passage in the same place has this sense, \u201cHe\nwhom ye look at and do not see, is named I; thou hearkenest to him and\nhearest him not, and he is called Hi; thou seekest for him with thy\nhand and touchest him not, and his name is We\u00ef. Thou meetest him and\nseest not his head; thou goest behind him and seest not his back.\u201d\nThese contradictory expressions are called the \u201cchain of reason.\u201d One\nnaturally thinks in quoting these passages of \u05d9\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4 and of the African\nkingly name of Juba and also of _Jovis_. This I-hi-we\u00ef or I-H-W[16] is\nfurther made to signify an absolute vacuity and that which is Nothing;\nto the Chinese what is highest and the origin of things is nothing,\nemptiness, the altogether undetermined, the abstract universal, and\nthis is also called Tao or reason. When the Greeks say that the\nabsolute is one, or when men in modern times say that it is the highest\nexistence, all determinations are abolished, and by the merely abstract\nBeing nothing has been expressed excepting this same negation, only in\nan affirmative form. But if Philosophy has got no further than to such\nexpression, it still stands on its most elementary stage. What is there\nto be found in all this learning?\nB. INDIAN PHILOSOPHY.\nIf we had formerly the satisfaction of believing in the antiquity\nof the Indian wisdom and of holding it in respect, we now have\nascertained through being acquainted with the great astronomical\nworks of the Indians, the inaccuracy of all figures quoted. Nothing\ncan be more confused, nothing more imperfect than the chronology of\nthe Indians; no people which has attained to culture in astronomy,\nmathematics, &c., is as incapable for history; in it they have neither\nstability nor coherence. It was believed that such was to be had in\nthe time of Wikramaditya, who was supposed to have lived about 50\nB.C., and under whose reign the poet Kalidasa, author of Sakontala,\nlived. But further research discovered half a dozen Wikramadityas and\ncareful investigation has placed this epoch in our eleventh century.\nThe Indians have lines of kings and an enormous quantity of names, but\neverything is vague.\nWe know how the ancient glory of this land was held in the highest\nestimation even by the Greeks, just as they knew about the\nGymnosophists, who were excellent men, though people ventured to call\nthem otherwise\u2014men who having dedicated themselves to a contemplative\nlife, lived in abstraction from external life, and hence, wandering\nabout in hordes, like the Cynics renounced all ordinary desires. These\nlatter in their capacity as philosophers, were also more especially\nknown to the Greeks, inasmuch as Philosophy is also supposed to exist\nin this abstraction, in which all the relationships of ordinary life\nare set aside; and this abstraction is a feature which we wish to bring\ninto prominence and consider.\nIndian culture is developed to a high degree, and it is imposing, but\nits Philosophy is identical with its Religion, and the objects to\nwhich attention is devoted in Philosophy are the same as those which\nwe find brought forward in Religion. Hence the holy books or Vedas\nalso form the general groundwork for Philosophy. We know the Vedas\ntolerably well; they contain principally prayers addressed to the\nmany representations of God, direction as to ceremonials, offerings,\n&c. They are also of the most various periods; many parts are very\nancient, and others have taken their origin later, as, for instance,\nthat which treats of the service of Vishnu. The Vedas even constitute\nthe basis for the atheistical Indian philosophies; these, too, are not\nwanting in gods, and they pay genuine attention to the Vedas. Indian\nPhilosophy thus stands within Religion just as scholastic Philosophy\nstands within Christian dogmatism, having at its basis and presupposing\nthe doctrines of the church. Mythology takes the form of incarnation\nor individualization, from which it might be thought that it would be\nopposed to Philosophy in its universality and ideality; incarnation is\nnot, however, here taken in so definite a sense, for almost everything\nis supposed to partake of it, and the very thing that seems to define\nitself as individuality falls back directly within the mist of the\nuniversal. The idea of the Indians more appropriately expressed, is\nthat there is one universal substance which may be laid hold of in the\nabstract or in the concrete, and out of which everything takes its\norigin. The summit of man\u2019s attainment is that he as consciousness\nshould make himself identical with the substance, in Religion by means\nof worship, offerings, and rigid acts of expiation, and in Philosophy\nthrough the instrumentality of pure thought.\nIt is quite recently that we first obtained a definite knowledge of\nIndian Philosophy; in the main we understand by it religious ideas,\nbut in modern times men have learned to recognize real philosophic\nwritings. Colebrooke,[17] in particular, communicated abstracts\nto us from two Indian philosophic works, and this forms the first\ncontribution we have had in reference to Indian Philosophy. What\nFrederick von Schlegel says about the wisdom of the Indians is taken\nfrom their religious ideas only. He is one of the first Germans who\ntook up his attention with Indian philosophy, yet his work bore little\nfruit because he himself read no more than the index to the Ramayana.\nAccording to the abstract before mentioned, the Indians possess ancient\nphilosophic systems; one part of these they consider to be orthodox,\nand those which tally with the Vedas are particularly included; the\nothers are held to be heterodox and as not corresponding with the\nteaching of the holy books. The one part, which really is orthodox, has\nno other purpose than to make the deliverances of the Vedas clearer,\nor to derive from the text of these original treatises an ingeniously\nthought-out Psychology. This system is called Mimansa, and two schools\nproceed from it. Distinguished from these there are other systems,\namongst which the two chief are those of the Sanc\u2019hya and Nyaya. The\nformer again divides into two parts which are, however, different in\nform only. The Nyaya is the most developed; it more particularly gives\nthe rules for reasoning, and may be compared to the Logic of Aristotle.\nColebrooke has made abstracts from both of these systems, and he says\nthat there are many ancient treatises upon them, and that the _versus\nmemoriales_ from them are very extensive.\n1. _The Sanc\u2019hya Philosophy of Capila_. The originator of the Sanc\u2019hya\nis called Capila, and he was an ancient sage of whom it was said that\nhe was a son of Brahma, and one of the seven great Holy men; others\nsay that he was an incarnation of Vishnu, like his disciple Asuri,\nand that he was identified with fire. As to the age of the Aphorisms\n(Sutras) of Capila, Colebrooke can say nothing; he merely mentions that\nthey were already mentioned in other very ancient books, but he does\nnot feel able to say anything definite in the matter. The Sanc\u2019hya is\ndivided into different schools, of which there are two or three, which,\nhowever, differ from one another only in a few particulars. It is held\nto be partly heterodox and partly orthodox.\nThe real aim of all Indian schools and systems of Philosophy, whether\natheistic or theistic, is to teach the means whereby eternal happiness\ncan be attained before, as well as after, death. The Vedas say, \u201cWhat\nhas to be known is the Soul; it must be distinguished from nature, and\nhence it will never come again.\u201d That means that it is exempt from\nmetempsychosis and likewise from bodily form, so that it does not after\ndeath make its appearance in another body. This blessed condition\ntherefore is, according to the Sanc\u2019hya, a perfect and eternal\nrelease from every kind of ill. It reads:\u2014\u201cThrough Thought, the true\nScience, this freedom can be accomplished; the temporal and worldly\nmeans of procuring enjoyment and keeping off spiritual or bodily evil\nare insufficient; even the methods advocated by the Vedas are not\neffectual for the purpose, and these are found in the revealed form\nof worship, or in the performance of religious ceremonies as directed\nin the Vedas.\u201d The offering up of animals is specially valuable as\nsuch a means; and in this regard the Sanc\u2019hya rejects the Vedas; such\nan offering is not pure, because it is connected with the death of\nanimals, and the main tenet in the former is not to injure any animal.\nOther methods of deliverance from evil are in the excessive acts of\npenance performed by the Indians, to which a retreat within themselves\nis added. Now when the Indian thus internally collects himself, and\nretreats within his own thoughts, the moment of such pure concentration\nis called Brahma, the one and the clearly supersensuous state, which\nthe understanding calls the highest possible existence. When this is\nso with me, then am I Brahma. Such a retreat into Thought takes place\nin the Religion as well as in the Philosophy of the Indians, and they\nassert with reference to this state of bliss that it is what is highest\nof all, and that even the gods do not attain to it. Indra, for example,\nthe god of the visible heavens, is much lower than the soul in this\nlife of internal contemplation; many thousand Indras have passed away,\nbut the soul is exempt from every change. The Sanc\u2019hya only differs\nfrom Religion in that it has a complete system of thought or logic, and\nthat the abstraction is not made a reduction to what is empty, but is\nraised up into the significance of a determinate thought. This science\nis stated to subsist in the correct knowledge of the principles\u2014which\nmay be outwardly perceptible or not\u2014of the material and of the\nimmaterial world.\nThe Sanc\u2019hya system separates itself into three parts: the method of\nknowledge, the object of knowledge, and the determinate form of the\nknowledge of principles.\n_a._ As regards the methods of obtaining knowledge, the Sanc\u2019hya says\nthat there are three kinds of evidence possible: first of all, that of\nperception; secondly, that of inference; thirdly, that of affirmation,\nwhich is the origin of all others, such as reverence for authority, a\nteachable disposition, and tradition. Perception is said to require no\nexplanation. Inference is a conclusion arrived at from the operation of\ncause and effect, by which one determination merely passes over into\na second. There are three forms, because inferences are made either\nfrom cause to effect, from effect to cause, or in accordance with\ndifferent relations of cause and effect. Rain, we may say, is foretold\nwhen a cloud is seen to be gathering; fire, when a hill is seen to be\nsmoking; or the movement of the moon is inferred when, at different\ntimes, it is observed to be in different places. These are simple,\ndry relations, originating from the understanding. Under affirmation,\ntradition or revelation is understood, such as that of the orthodox\nVedas; in a wider sense, immediate certainty or the affirmation in my\nconsciousness, and in a less wide sense, an assurance through verbal\ncommunication or through tradition is so denominated.\n_b._ Of objects of knowledge or of principles, the Sanc\u2019hya gives\nfive-and-twenty; and these I will mention to show the want of order\nthat is in them.\n1. Nature, as the origin of everything, is said to be the\nuniversal, the material cause, eternal matter, undistinguished and\nundistinguishable, without parts, productive but without production,\nabsolute substance. 2. Intelligence, the first production of Nature\nand itself producing other principles, distinguishable as three gods\nthrough the efficacy of three qualities, which are Goodness, Foulness\nand Darkness. These form one person and three gods, namely, Brahma,\nVishnu, and Maheswara. 3. Consciousness, personality, the belief that\nin all perceptions and meditations I am present, that the objects of\nsense, as well as of intelligence, concern me, in short that I am I.\nIt issues from the power of intelligence, and itself brings forth the\nfollowing principles. 4-8. Five very subtle particles, rudiments or\natoms, which are only perceptible to an existence of a higher order,\nand not through the senses of men; these proceed from the principle\nof consciousness, and bring forth on their own account the five\nelements\u2014space and the first origination of earth, water, fire and\nair. 9-19. The eleven succeeding principles are the organs of feeling,\nwhich are produced by the personality. There are ten external organs,\ncomprising the five senses and five active organs\u2014the organs of the\nvoice, hands and feet, the excretory and genital organs. The eleventh\norgan is that of the inward sense. 20 to 24. These principles are the\nfive elements brought forth from the earlier-named rudiments\u2014the ether\nwhich takes possession of space, air, fire, water and earth. 25. The\nsoul. In this very unsystematic form we see only the first beginnings\nof reflection, which seem to be put together as a universal. But\nthis arrangement is, to say nothing of being unsystematic, not even\nintelligent.\nFormerly the principles were outside of and successive to one another;\ntheir unity is found in the Soul. It is said of the latter that\nit is not produced, and is not productive; it is individual, and\nhence there are many souls; it is sentient, eternal, immaterial and\nunchangeable. Colebrooke here distinguishes between the theistic and\natheistic systems of the Sanc\u2019hya, since the former not only admits\nof individual souls, but also upholds God (Iswara) as the ruler of the\nworld. The knowledge of the soul still remains the principal point. It\nis through the consideration of nature and through abstraction from\nnature that the unity of the soul with nature is brought about, just\nas the lame man and the blind are brought together for the purposes of\ntransport and of guidance\u2014the one being the bearer and being directed\n(nature?), the other being borne and guiding (soul?). Through the union\nof Soul and Nature, the creation is effected, and this consists in\nthe development of intelligence and of other principles. This unity\nis the actual support for that which is, and the means by which it is\nso maintained. It is at the same time an important consideration that\nthe negation of the object which is contained in thought, is necessary\nin order to comprehend; this reflection has far more depth than the\nordinary talk about immediate consciousness. The view is superficial\nand perverted which maintains the Easterns to have lived in unity\nwith nature; the soul in its activity, mind, is indeed undoubtedly in\nrelation with nature and in unity with the truth of nature. But this\ntrue unity essentially contains the moment of the negation of nature\nas it is in its immediacy; such an immediate unity is merely the life\nof animals, the life and perception of the senses. The idea which is\npresent to the Indians is thus indeed the unity of nature and of soul,\nbut the spiritual is only one with nature in so far as it is within\nitself, and at the same time manifests the natural as negative. As\nregards the creation, this is further signified. The soul\u2019s desire\nand end is for satisfaction and freedom, and with this view it is\nendowed with a subtle environment, in which all the above-mentioned\nprinciples are contained, but only in their elementary development.\nSomething of our ideal, or of the implicit is present in this idea; it\nis like the blossom which is ideally in the bud, and yet is not actual\nand real. The expression for this is Lingam, the generative power of\nnature, which holds a high place in the estimation of all Indians. This\nsubtle form, says the Sanc\u2019hya, also assumes a coarse bodily shape,\nand clothes itself in several garbs; and as a means of preventing\nthe descent into a coarse materiality, philosophic contemplation is\nrecommended.\nHitherto we have observed the abstract principles; the following is\nto be noticed regarding the creation of the concrete actuality of\nthe universe. The bodily creation consists of the soul habited in\na material body; it comprehends eight orders of higher beings and\nfive orders of lower beings, which constitute\u2014with men, who form\na single class\u2014fourteen orders, and these are divided into three\nworlds or classes. The first eight orders have appellations which\nappear in Indian mythology, viz. Brahma, Prajapatis, Indra, &c.;\nthere are both gods and demi-gods, and Brahma himself is represented\nhere as if he were created. The five lower orders are composed of\nanimals: the four-footed animals are in two classes, birds come third,\nreptiles, fishes, and insects fourth, and, finally, vegetable and\ninorganic nature comes fifth. The abode of the eight higher classes\nis in heaven; they are, it is said, in the enjoyment of that which is\ngood and virtuous, and consequently are happy, though still they are\nbut imperfect and transient; underneath is the seat of darkness or\ndelusion, where beings of the lower orders live; and between is the\nworld of men, where untruth or passion reigns.\nAgainst these three worlds, which have their place in the material\ncreation, the system places yet another creation, and that is the\nIntellectual, consisting of the powers of understanding and the\nsenses. These last are again divided into four classes, viz. those\ndeterminations which impede, those which incapacitate, those which\nsatisfy, and those which perfect the intelligence. 1. Sixty-two of\nthe impeding determinations are adduced; eight kinds of error, as\nmany of opinion or of illusion, ten of passion as being illusion\ncarried to extremity, eighteen of hate or sullenness, and the same of\ngrief. Here there is shown somewhat of an empirical, psychological,\nand observing mode of treatment. 2. The incapacity of intelligence\nhas again eight-and-twenty variations: injury, want of organs, &c.\n3. Satisfaction is either inward or outward. The inward satisfaction\nis fourfold; the first concerns nature, the whole universal or\nsubstantial, and is set forth in the opinion that philosophic knowledge\nis a modification of the principle of nature itself, with which there\nis immediately united the anticipation of a liberty given through\nthe act of nature; yet the true liberty is not to be expected as\nan act of nature, for it is the soul which has to bring forth that\nliberty through itself and through its thinking activity. The second\nsatisfaction is in the belief of securing liberty through ascetic\nexercises, pains, torments, and penances. The third has to do with\ntime\u2014the idea that liberty will come in the course of time and without\nstudy. The fourth satisfaction is obtained in a belief in luck\u2014in\nbelieving that liberty depends on fate. The external mode of obtaining\nsatisfaction relates to continence from enjoyment, but continence\nfrom sensuous motives, such as dislike to the unrest of acquisition,\nand fear of the evil consequences of enjoyment. 4. There are, again,\nseveral means of perfecting the intelligence adduced, and, amongst\nothers, there is the direct psychological mode of perfecting mind, as\nis seen in the act of reasoning, in friendly converse, and so on. This\nwe may find, indeed, in our applied logic.\nThere is still somewhat to be remarked as to the main points of\nthe system. The Sanc\u2019hya, and likewise the other Indian systems of\nPhilosophy, occupy themselves particularly with the three _qualities_\n(Guna) of the absolute Idea, which are represented as substances and\nas modifications of nature. It is noteworthy that in the observing\nconsciousness of the Indians it struck them that what is true and\nin and for itself contains three determinations, and the Notion of\nthe Idea is perfected in three moments. This sublime consciousness\nof the trinity, which we find again in Plato and others, then went\nastray in the region of thinking contemplation, and retains its place\nonly in Religion, and there but as a Beyond. Then the understanding\npenetrated through it, declaring it to be senseless; and it was Kant\nwho broke open the road once more to its comprehension. The reality and\ntotality of the Notion of everything, considered in its substance, is\nabsorbed by the triad of determinations; and it has become the business\nof our times to bring this to consciousness. With the Indians, this\nconsciousness proceeded from sensuous observation merely, and they now\nfurther define these qualities as follows: The first and highest is\nwith them the Good (Sattva); it is exalted and illuminating\u2014allied\nto joy and felicity\u2014and piety predominates within it. It prevails\nin fire, and therefore flames rise up and sparks fly upwards; if it\nhas ascendency in men, as it does have in the eight higher orders,\nit is the origin of virtue. This also is the universal\u2014throughout\nand in every aspect the affirmative\u2014in abstract form. The second\nand mediate quality is deceit or passion (Najas, Tejas) which for\nitself is blind; it is that which is impure, harmful, hateful; it is\nactive, vehement, and restless, allied to evil and misfortune, being\nprevalent in the air, on which account the wind moves transversely;\namongst living beings it is the cause of vice. The third and last\nquality is darkness (Tamas); it is inert and obstructive, allied to\ncare, dullness, and disappointment, predominating in earth and water,\nand hence these fall down and tend ever downwards. With living beings\nstupidity takes its origin in this. The first quality is thus the\nunity with itself; the second the manifestation or the principle of\ndifference, desire, disunion, as wickedness; the third, however, is\nmere negation, as in mythology it is concretely represented in the form\nof Siva, Mahadeva, or Maheswara, the god of change or destruction. As\nfar as we are concerned, the important distinction is that the third\nprinciple is not the return to the first which Mind and Idea demand,\nand which is effected by the removal of the negation in order to effect\na reconciliation with itself and to go back within itself. With the\nIndians the third is still change and negation.\nThese three qualities are represented as the essential being of nature.\nThe Sanc\u2019hya says, \u201cWe speak of them as we do of the trees in a wood.\u201d\nYet this is a bad simile, for the wood is but an abstract universal, in\nwhich the individuals are independent. In the religious ideas of the\nVedas, where these qualities also appear as Trimurti, they are spoken\nof as if they were successive modifications, so that \u201cEverything was\ndarkness first, then received the command to transform itself, and in\nthis manner the form\u201d\u2014which, however, is a worse one\u2014\u201cof movement and\nactivity (foulness) was assumed, until finally, by yet another command\nfrom Brahma, the form of goodness was adopted.\u201d\nFurther determinations of the intelligence in respect of these\nqualities follow. It is said that eight kinds of intelligence are\ncounted, of which four pertain to what is good:\u2014virtue first,\nscience and knowledge second, thirdly, freedom from passion, which,\nmay have either an external and sensuous motive\u2014the repugnance to\ndisturbance\u2014or be of an intellectual nature, and emanate from the\nconviction that nature is a dream, a mere jugglery and sham; the fourth\nis power. This last is eight-fold, and hence eight special qualities\nare given as being present; viz. the power to contract oneself into a\nquite small form, for which everything shall be penetrable; the power\nto expand into a gigantic body; the power to become light enough to\nbe able to mount to the sun on a sunbeam; the possession of unlimited\npower of action in the organs, so that with the finger-tips the moon\nmay be touched; irresistible will, so that, for instance, one may dive\ninto the earth as easily as in the water; mastery over all living and\nlifeless existence; the power to change the course of nature; and the\npower to perform everything that is wished. \u201cThe feeling that such\ntranscendent power,\u201d Colebrooke goes on, \u201cis within the reach of man\nin his life is not peculiar to the Sanc\u2019hya sect, but is common to all\nsystems and religious ideas, and such a power is in good faith ascribed\nto many holy men and Brahmins in dramas and popular narratives.\u201d\nSensuous evidence is of no account as opposed to this, for with the\nIndian, perception of the senses is, generally speaking, absent:\neverything adopts the form of imaginary images, every dream is esteemed\njust as much as truth and actuality. The Sanc\u2019hya ascribes this power\nto man, in so far as he elevates himself through the working of his\nthought into inward subjectivity. Colebrooke says, \u201cThe Yoga-sastra\nnames in one of its four chapters a number of acts by which such power\nmay be attained; these are exemplified by a profound meditation,\naccompanied by holding back the breath and inactivity of the senses,\nwhile a fixed position is constantly preserved. By means of such acts\nthe adept reaches the knowledge of all that is past as well as future;\nhe has learned to divine the thoughts of others, to have the strength\nof elephants, the courage of lions, the swiftness of the wind, the\npower to fly in the air, to swim in the water, to dive into the earth,\nto behold every possible world in one moment, and to accomplish other\nwonderful deeds. But the quickest mode of reaching happiness through\ndeep contemplation is that worship of God which consists in ever\nmurmuring the mystic name of God, \u2018Om.\u2019\u201d This idea is a very general\none.\nColebrooke deals more particularly with the theistic and atheistic\ndivisions of the Sanc\u2019hya as distinguished. While in the theistic\nsystem, Iswara, the chief ruler of the world, is a soul or spirit\ndistinguished from the other souls, Capila, in the atheistic Sanc\u2019hya,\ndisowns Iswara, the originator of the world by volition, alleging that\nthere is no proof of the existence of God, since it is not shown by\nperception, nor is it possible that it should be deduced from argument.\nHe recognizes, indeed, an existence proceeding from nature which is\nAbsolute Intelligence, the source of all individual intelligences and\nthe origin of all other existences, which gradually develop out of it:\nabout the Creator of the world, understanding this to be creation, he\nemphatically remarks that \u201cthe truth of such an Iswara is proved.\u201d\nBut, he says, \u201cthe existence of effects depends on the soul, on\nconsciousness, and not on Iswara. Everything proceeds from the great\nPrinciple, which is Intelligence;\u201d to this the individual soul belongs,\nand through this it is brought about.\n_c._ As to the third division of the Sanc\u2019hya, the more particular\nconsideration of the forms of knowledge as regards the principle, I\nshall make a few more remarks, which may perhaps have some interest.\nOf the various kinds of knowledge already given, that of reasoning, of\nthe connection existing with the conclusion through the relation of\ncause and effect, remains the chief, and I will show how the Indians\ncomprehend this relation. The understanding and all other principles\nderived from it are to them effects, and from these they reason to\ntheir causes; in one respect this is analogous to our inference, but\nin another different. They perceive that \u201ceffects exist even before\nthe operation of the causes; for what does not exist cannot be made\nexplicit in existence through causality.\u201d Colebrooke says, \u201cThis means\nthat effects are educts rather than products.\u201d But the question is just\nwhat products are. As an example of how the effect is already contained\nin the cause, the following is given:\u2014Oil is already existent in the\nseeds of sesamum before it is pressed out; rice is in the husk before\nit is thrashed; milk is in the udder of the cow before it is milked.\nCause and effect are in reality the same; a piece of a dress is not\nreally different from the yarn from which it is woven, for the material\nis the same. This is how this relation is understood. A consequence\nderived from it was the eternity of the world, for the saying \u201cOut\nof nothing there comes nothing,\u201d which Colebrooke also mentions, is\nopposed to the belief in a creation of the world from nothing in our\nreligious sense. As a matter of fact, it must also be said, \u201cGod\ncreates the world not out of nothing, but out of Himself; it is His\nown determination, by Him brought into existence.\u201d The distinction\nbetween cause and effect is only a formal distinction; it is the\nunderstanding that keeps them separate, and not reason. Moisture is the\nsame as rain; or again we speak in mechanics of different movements,\nwhereas motion has the same velocity before as after impact. The\nordinary consciousness cannot comprehend the fact that there is no real\ndistinction between cause and effect.\nThe Indians infer the existence of \u201ca universal cause which is\nundistinguishable, while determinate things are finite,\u201d and on\nthis account there must be a cause permeating through them. Even\nintelligence is an effect of this cause, which is the soul in so far\nas it is creative in this identity with nature after its abstraction\nfrom it. Effect proceeds from cause, yet, on the other hand, this\nlast is not independent, but goes back into universal cause. General\ndestruction is postulated along with what is called the creation of\nthe three worlds. Just as the tortoise stretches out its limbs and\nthen draws them back again within its shell, the five elements, earth,\n&c., which constitute the three worlds, are in the general ruin and\ndissolution of things which takes place within a certain time, again\ndrawn back in the reverse order to that in which they emerged from\nthe original principle, because they return, step by step, to their\nfirst cause\u2014that is, to what is highest and inseparable, which is\nNature. To this the three qualities, goodness, passion, and darkness,\nare attributed; the further attributes of these determinations may be\nvery interesting, but they are understood in a very superficial way.\nFor it is said that nature operates through the admixture of these\nthree qualities; each thing has all three within itself, like three\nstreams which flow together; it also works by means of modifications,\njust as water which is soaked in through the roots of plants and led\nup into the fruit, obtains a special flavour. There are hence only\nthe categories of admixture and of modification present. The Indians\nsay:\u2014\u201cNature has these three qualities in her own right as her forms\nand characteristics; other things have them only because they are\npresent in them as effects of the former.\u201d\nWe still have to consider the relation of nature to spirit. \u201cNature,\nalthough it is quite inanimate, performs the office of preparing\nthe soul for its freedom, just as it is the function of milk\u2014of a\nsubstance having no sensation\u2014to nourish the calf.\u201d The Sanc\u2019hya makes\nthe following simile. Nature is like a _bajadere_ showing herself to\nthe soul as to an audience; she is abused for her impudence in exposing\nherself too often to the rude gaze of the spectators. \u201cBut she retires\nwhen she has shown herself sufficiently; she does so because she\nhas been seen, and the audience retires because it has seen. Nature\nhas no further use as regards the soul, and yet the union remains a\nlasting one.\u201d With the attainment of intellectual knowledge through\nthe study of principles, the final, incontrovertible, single truth is\nlearnt, that \u201cI neither am, nor is anything mine, nor do I exist.\u201d\nThat is, the personality is still distinguished from the soul, and\nfinally personality and self-consciousness disappear for the Indian.\n\u201cEverything that comes forth in consciousness is reflected by the\nsoul, but like an image which does not dull the crystal of the soul,\nand does not belong to it. In possession of this self-knowledge\u201d\n(without personality) \u201cthe soul contemplates nature at its ease,\nthus exempt from all terrible variation, and freed from every other\nform and operation of the understanding, with the exception of this\nspiritual knowledge.\u201d This is a mediate spiritual knowledge of the\nlikewise spiritualized content\u2014a knowledge without personality and\nconsciousness. \u201cThe soul still indeed remains for some time in bodily\ngarb, but this is only so after the same manner as the potter\u2019s wheel,\nwhen the jar is perfected, still turns round from the effect of the\npreviously given impulse.\u201d The soul thus has, according to the Indians,\nnothing further to do with the body, and its connection therewith is\ntherefore a superfluous one. \u201cBut when the separation of the already\nprepared soul from its body at length comes to pass, and nature is done\nwith soul, the absolute and final liberation is accomplished.\u201d Here we\nfind the crowning moments in the Sanc\u2019hya philosophy.\n2. _The Philosophy of Gotama and Canade_. The philosophy of Gotama and\nthat of Canade belong to one another.[18] The philosophy of Gotama is\ncalled Nyaya (reasoning), and that of Canade, Vaiseshica (particular).\nThe first is a specially perfect dialectic, and the second, on the\nother hand, occupies itself with physics, that is, with particular or\nsensuous objects. Colebrooke says:\u2014\u201cNo department of science or of\nliterature has taken up the attention of the Indians more than the\nNyaya; and the fruit of this study is an infinite number of writings,\nincluded in which there may be found the works of very celebrated\nmen of learning. The system which Gotama and Canade observe is that\nindicated in one part of the Vedas as being the path which must be\ntrodden in the pursuit of learning and study; viz., enunciation,\ndefinition, and investigation. Enunciation is the specification of\na thing by its name, that is, by the expression denoting it, as\nrevelation directs; for language is considered as revealed to man.\nDefinition sets forth the particular quality which constitutes the\nreal character of a thing. Investigation consists in an inquiry into\nthe adequacy and sufficiency of the definition. In conformity with\nthis, the teachers of philosophy presuppose scientific terms, proceed\nto definitions and then come to the investigation of the thus premised\nsubjects.\u201d By the name, the ordinary conception is indicated, and with\nit what is given in definition is compared in investigation. What comes\nnext is the object to be contemplated. \u201cGotama here adduces sixteen\npoints, amongst which proof, evidence\u201d (which is formal), \u201cand what has\nto be proved, are the principal; the others are merely subsidiary and\naccessory, as contributing to the knowledge and confirmation of the\ntruth. The Nyaya concurs with the other psychological schools in this,\nthat it promises happiness, final excellence, and freedom from evil as\nthe reward of a perfect knowledge of the principles which it teaches,\nthat is to say, of the Truth, meaning the conviction of the eternal\nexistence of the soul as separable from body,\u201d which makes spirit\nindependent. Soul then is itself the object which is to be known and\nproved. This has still to be shown more particularly.\n_a._ The first point of importance, the evidence brought forth\nas proof, is said to be divided into four kinds:\u2014first of all,\nperception; secondly, inference, of which there are three kinds,\nviz. inference from result to cause, that from cause to effect, and\nthat derived from analogy. The third kind of evidence is comparison,\nthe fourth, trustworthy authority, including both tradition and the\nrevelation implied in it. These kinds of proof are much brought\nforward, both in the ancient Treatise ascribed to Gotama and in\ninnumerable commentaries.\n_b._ The second point of importance is found in the subjects which\nhave to be proved, and which have to be made evident; and of these\ntwelve are here given. The first and most important is, however, the\nsoul, as the seat, distinguished from the body and from the senses,\nof feeling and of knowledge, the existence of which is proved through\ninclination, disinclination, will, &c. It has fourteen qualities:\nnumber, size, individuality, connection, separation, intelligence,\npleasure, pain, desire, dislike, will, merit, fault, and imagination.\nWe see in this first commencement of reflection, which is quite without\norder, neither connection nor any totality of determinations. The\nsecond object of knowledge is body; the third, the organs of sensation,\nas the five outward senses are called. These are not modifications of\nconsciousness, as the Sanc\u2019hya asserts, but matter constructed out of\nthe elements, which respectively consist of earth, water, light, air,\nand ether. The pupil of the eye is not, they say, the organ of sight,\nnor the ear of hearing, but the organ of seeing is a ray of light that\nproceeds from the eye to the object; the organ of hearing is the ether\nthat in the cavity of the ear communicates with the object heard,\nthrough the ether that is found between. The ray of light is usually\ninvisible, just as a light is not seen at mid-day, but in certain\ncircumstances it is visible. In taste, a watery substance like saliva\nis the organ, and so on. We find something similar to what is here said\nabout sight in Plato\u2019s Tim\u00e6us (pp. 45, 46, Steph.; pp. 50-53, Bekk.);\nthere are interesting remarks upon the phosphorus of the eyes in a\npaper by Schultz, contained in Goethe\u2019s Morphology. Examples of men\nseeing at night, so that their eyes lighted up the object, are brought\nforward in numbers, but the demonstration certainly demands particular\nconditions. The objects of sense form the fourth subject. Here Cesava,\na commentator, inserts the categories of Canade, of which there are\nsix. The first of these is substance, and of this there are nine kinds:\nearth, water, light, air, ether, time, space, soul, understanding. The\nfundamental elements of material substances are by Canade regarded as\nif they were original atoms, and afterwards aggregates of the same; he\nmaintains the everlasting nature of atoms, and thus much is adduced\nabout the union of atoms, by which means motes are also produced. The\nsecond category is that of Quality, and of it there are twenty-four\nkinds, viz. 1, colour; 2, taste; 3, smell; 4, tangibility; 5, numbers;\n6, size; 7, individuality; 8, conjunction; 9, separation; 10,\npriority; 11, posteriority; 12, weight; 13, fluidity; 14, viscidity;\n15, sound; 16, intelligence; 17, pleasure; 18, pain; 19, desire; 20,\ndislike; 21, will; 22, virtue; 23, vice; 24, a capacity which includes\nthree different qualities, viz. celerity, elasticity, and power of\nimagination. The third category is action; the fourth, association of\nqualities; the fifth, distinction; the sixth, is aggregation, and,\naccording to Canade, this is the last; other writers add negation as\nthe seventh. This is the manner in which philosophy is regarded by the\nIndians.\n_c._ The philosophy of Gotama makes doubt the third topic, succeeding\nthose of the evidence of knowledge, and the subjects of interest to\nknowledge. Another topic is regular proof, formal reasoning, or the\nperfect syllogism (Nyaya), which consists of five propositions:\u20141, the\nproposition; 2, the reason; 3, the instance; 4, the application; 5, the\nconclusion. To take examples:\u20141. This hill is burning; 2, because it\nsmokes; 3, what smokes is burning, like a kitchen fire; 4, accordingly\nthe hill smokes; 5, therefore it is on fire. This is propounded as\nsyllogisms are with us, but in the manner adopted, the matter which is\nin point is propounded first. We should, on the contrary, begin with\nthe general. This is the ordinary form, and these examples may satisfy\nus, yet we shall recapitulate the matter once more.\nWe have seen that in India the point of main importance is the\nsoul\u2019s drawing itself within itself, raising itself up into liberty,\nor thought, which constitutes itself for itself. This becoming\nexplicit of soul in the most abstract mode may be called intellectual\nsubstantiality, but here it is not the unity of mind and nature that\nis present, but directly the opposite. To mind, the consideration of\nnature is only the vehicle of thought or its exercise, which has as\nits aim the liberation of mind. Intellectual substantiality is in India\nthe end, while in Philosophy it is in general the true commencement;\nto philosophize is the idealism of making thought, in its own right,\nthe principle of truth. Intellectual substantiality is the opposite\nof the reflection, understanding, and the subjective individuality of\nthe European. With us it is of importance that I will, know, believe,\nthink this particular thing according to the grounds that I have for\nso doing, and in accordance with my own free will; and upon this\nan infinite value is set. Intellectual substantiality is the other\nextreme from this; it is that in which all the subjectivity of the \u201cI\u201d\nis lost; for it everything objective has become vanity, there is for\nit no objective truth, duty or right, and thus subjective vanity is\nthe only thing left. The point of interest is to reach intellectual\nsubstantiality in order to drown in it that subjective vanity with all\nits cleverness and reflection. This is the advantage of arriving at\nthis point of view.\nThe defect in such a view is that because intellectual substantiality,\nwhile represented as end and aim for the subject, as a condition that\nhas to be produced in the interest of the subject, even though it be\nmost objective, is yet only quite abstractly objective; and hence the\nessential form of objectivity is wanting to it. That intellectual\nsubstantiality that thus remaining in abstraction, has as its\nexistence the subjective soul alone. Just as in empty vanity, where\nthe subjective power of negation alone remains, everything disappears,\nthis abstraction of intellectual substantiality only signifies\nan escape into what is empty and without determination, wherein\neverything vanishes. Therefore what remains to be done is to force\nforward the real ground of the inwardly self-forming and determining\nobjectivity\u2014the eternal form within itself, which is what men call\nThought. Just as this Thought in the first place, as subjective, is\nmine, because I think, but in the second place is universality which\ncomprehends intellectual substantiality, it is likewise in the third\nplace forming activity, the principle of determination. This higher\nkind of objectivity that unfolds itself, alone gives a place to the\nparticular content, allows it to have free scope and receives it\ninto itself. If in the Oriental view, the particular shakes and is\ndestined to fall, it still has its place grounded on thought. It is\nable to root itself in itself, it is able to stand firm, and this is\nthe hard European understanding. Such Eastern ideas tend to destroy\nit, but it is preserved active in the soil of thought; it cannot exist\nwhen regarded as independent, but must exist only as a moment in the\nwhole system. In the Eastern Philosophy we have also discovered a\ndefinite content, which is brought under our consideration; but the\nconsideration is destitute of thought or system because it comes\nfrom above and is outside of the unity. On that side there stands\nintellectual substantiality, on this side it appears dry and barren;\nthe particular thus only has the dead form of simple reason and\nconclusion, such as we find in the Scholastics. Based on the ground of\nthought, on the other hand, the particular may receive its dues; it may\nbe regarded and grasped as a moment in the whole organization. The Idea\nhas not become objective in the Indian Philosophy; hence the external\nand objective has not been comprehended in accordance with the Idea.\nThis is the deficiency in Orientalism.\nThe true, objective ground of thought finds its basis in the real\nfreedom of the subject; the universal or substantial must itself have\nobjectivity. Because thought is this universal, the ground of the\nsubstantial and likewise \u201cI\u201d\u2014thought is the implicit and exists as\nthe free subject\u2014the universal has immediate existence and actual\npresence; it is not only an end or condition to be arrived at, but the\nabsolute character is objective. It is this principle that we find in\nthe Greek world, and the object of our further consideration is its\ndevelopment. The universal first appears as quite abstract, and as such\nit confronts the concrete world; but its value is both for the ground\nof the concrete world and for that which is implicit. It is not a\nbeyond, for the value of the present lies in the fact that it exists in\nthe implicit; or that which is implicit, the universal, is the truth of\npresent objects.\nPART ONE\nGREEK PHILOSOPHY\nINTRODUCTION\nTHE name of Greece strikes home to the hearts of men of education in\nEurope, and more particularly is this so with us Germans. Europeans\nhave taken their religion, the life to come, the far-off land, from a\npoint somewhat further off than Greece\u2014they took it from the East, and\nmore especially from Syria. But the here, the present, art and science,\nthat which in giving liberty to our spiritual life, gives it dignity as\nit likewise bestows upon it ornament, we know to have proceeded from\nGreece either directly or indirectly\u2014through the circuitous road of\nRome. The latter of these two ways was the earlier form in which this\nculture came to us; it also came from the formerly universal church\nwhich derived its origin as such from Rome, and has retained its speech\neven until now. The sources of authority in addition to the Latin\nGospels have been the Fathers. Our law, too, boasts of deriving its\nmost perfect forms from Rome. Teutonic strength of mind has required\nto pass through the hard discipline of the church and law which came\nto us from Rome, and to be kept in check; it is in this way that the\nEuropean character first obtained its pliability and capacity for\nfreedom. Thus it was after European manhood came to be at home with\nitself and to look upon the present, that the historical and that which\nis of foreign derivation was given. When man began to be at home with\nhimself, he turned to the Greeks to find enjoyment in it. Let us leave\nthe Latin and the Roman to the church and to jurisprudence. Higher,\nfreer philosophic science, as also the beauty of our untrammelled art,\nthe taste for, and love of the same, we know to have taken their root\nin Greek life and to have created therefrom their spirit. If we were to\nhave an aspiration, it would be for such a land and such conditions.\nBut what makes us specially at home with the Greeks is that they\nmade their world their home; the common spirit of homeliness unites\nus both. In ordinary life we like best the men and families that are\nhomely and contented in themselves, not desiring what is outside and\nabove them, and so it is with the Greeks. They certainly received the\nsubstantial beginnings of their religion, culture, their common bonds\nof fellowship, more or less from Asia, Syria and Egypt; but they have\nso greatly obliterated the foreign nature of this origin, and it is\nso much changed, worked upon, turned round, and altogether made so\ndifferent, that what they, as we, prize, know, and love in it, is\nessentially their own. For this reason, in the history of Greek life,\nwhen we go further back and seem constrained so to go back, we find\nwe may do without this retrogression and follow within the world and\nmanners of the Greeks, the beginnings, the germination and the progress\nof art and science up to their maturity, even seeing the origin of\ntheir decay\u2014and this completely comprehended within their own range.\nFor their spiritual development requires that which is received or\nforeign, as matter or stimulus only; in such they have known and borne\nthemselves as men that were free. The form which they have given to the\nforeign principle is this characteristic breath of spirituality, the\nspirit of freedom and of beauty which can in the one aspect be regarded\nas form, but which in another and higher sense is simply substance.\nThey have thus not only themselves created the substantial in their\nculture and made their existence their own, but they have also held\nin reverence this their spiritual rebirth, which is their real birth.\nThe foreign origin they have so to speak thanklessly forgotten,\nputting it in the background\u2014perhaps burying it in the darkness of\nthe mysteries which they have kept secret from themselves. They have\nnot only done this, that is they have not only used and enjoyed all\nthat they have brought forth and formed, but they have become aware of\nand thankfully and joyfully placed before themselves this at-homeness\n[Heimathlichkeit] in their whole existence, the ground and origin of\nthemselves, not merely existing in it, possessing and making use of\nit. For their mind, when transformed in this spiritual new birth, is\njust the living in their life, and also the becoming conscious of that\nlife as it has become actual. They represent their existence as an\nobject apart from themselves, which manifests itself independently and\nwhich in its independence is of value to them; hence they have made for\nthemselves a history of everything which they have possessed and have\nbeen. Not only have they represented the beginning of the world\u2014that\nis, of gods and men, the earth, the heavens, the wind, mountains\nand rivers\u2014but also of all aspects of their existence, such as the\nintroduction of fire and the offerings connected with it, the crops,\nagriculture, the olive, the horse, marriage, property, laws, arts,\nworship, the sciences, towns, princely races, &c. Of all these it is\npleasingly represented through tales how they have arisen in history as\ntheir own work.\nIt is in this veritable homeliness, or, more accurately, in the spirit\nof homeliness, in this spirit of ideally being-at-home-with-themselves\nin their physical, corporate, legal, moral and political existence; it\nis in the beauty and the freedom of their character in history, making\nwhat they are to be also a sort of Mnemosyne with them, that the kernel\nof thinking liberty rests; and hence it was requisite that Philosophy\nshould arise amongst them. Philosophy is being at home with self, just\nlike the homeliness of the Greek; it is man\u2019s being at home in his\nmind, at home with himself. If we are at home with the Greeks, we must\nbe at home more particularly in their Philosophy; not, however, simply\nas it is with them, for Philosophy is at home with itself, and we have\nto do with Thought, with what is most specially ours, and with what is\nfree from all particularity. The development and unfolding of thought\nhas taken place with them from its earliest beginning, and in order to\ncomprehend their Philosophy we may remain with them without requiring\nto seek for further and external influences.\nBut we must specify more particularly their character and point of\nview. The Greeks have a starting-point in history as truly as they have\narisen from out of themselves: this starting-point, comprehended in\nthought, is the oriental substantiality of the natural unity between\nthe spiritual and the natural. To start from the self, to live in the\nself, is the other extreme of abstract subjectivity, when it is still\nempty, or rather has made itself to be empty; such is pure formalism,\nthe abstract principle of the modern world. The Greeks stand between\nboth these extremes in the happy medium; this therefore is the medium\nof beauty, seeing that it is both natural and spiritual, but yet\nthat the spiritual still remains the governing, determining subject.\nMind immersed in nature is in substantial unity with it, and in so\nfar as it is consciousness, it is essentially sensuous perception:\nas subjective consciousness it is certainly form-giving though it is\ndevoid of measure. For the Greeks, the substantial unity of nature and\nspirit was a fundamental principle, and thus being in the possession\nand knowledge of this, yet not being overwhelmed in it, but having\nretired into themselves, they have avoided the extreme of formal\nsubjectivity, and are still in unity with themselves. Thus it is a\nfree subject which still possesses that original unity in content,\nessence and substratum, and fashions its object into beauty. The stage\nreached by Greek consciousness is the stage of beauty. For beauty is\nthe ideal; it is the thought which is derived from Mind, but in such a\nway that the spiritual individuality is not yet explicit as abstract\nsubjectivity that has then in itself to perfect its existence into a\nworld of thought. What is natural and sensuous still pertains to this\nsubjectivity, but yet the natural form has not equal dignity and rank\nwith the other, nor is it predominant as is the case in the East.\nThe principle of the spiritual now stands first in rank, and natural\nexistence has no further value for itself, in its existent forms,\nbeing the mere expression of the Mind shining through, and having been\nreduced to be the vehicle and form of its existence. Mind, however,\nhas not yet got itself as a medium whereby it can represent itself in\nitself, and from which it can form its world.\nThus free morality could and necessarily did find a place in Greece,\nfor the spiritual substance of freedom was here the principle of\nmorals, laws and constitutions. Because the natural element is,\nhowever, still contained in it, the form taken by the morality of\nthe state is still affected by what is natural; the states are\nsmall individuals in their natural condition, which could not unite\nthemselves into one whole. Since the universal does not exist in\nindependent freedom, that which is spiritual still is limited. In\nthe Greek world what is potentially and actually eternal is realized\nand brought to consciousness through Thought; but in such a way that\nsubjectivity confronts it in a determination which is still accidental,\nbecause it is still essentially related to what is natural; and in this\nwe find the reason as promised above, for the fact that in Greece the\nfew alone are free.\nThe measureless quality of substance in the East is brought, by\nmeans of the Greek mind, into what is measurable and limited; it\nis clearness, aim, limitation of forms, the reduction of what is\nmeasureless, and of infinite splendour and riches, to determinateness\nand individuality. The riches of the Greek world consist only of an\ninfinite quantity of beautiful, lovely and pleasing individualities\nin the serenity which pervades all existence; those who are greatest\namongst the Greeks are the individualities, the connoisseurs in art,\npoetry, song, science, integrity and virtue. If the serenity of the\nGreeks, their beautiful gods, statues, and temples, as well as their\nserious work, their institutions and acts, may seem\u2014compared to the\nsplendour and sublimity, the colossal forms of oriental imagination,\nthe Egyptian buildings of Eastern kingdoms\u2014to be like child\u2019s play,\nthis is the case yet more with the thought that comes into existence\nhere. Such thought puts a limit on this wealth of individualities as on\nthe oriental greatness, and reduces it into its one simple soul, which,\nhowever, is in itself the first source of the opulence of a higher\nideal world, of the world of Thought.\n\u201cFrom out of thy passions, oh, man,\u201d exclaimed an ancient, \u201cthou\nhast derived the materials for thy gods,\u201d just as the Easterns, and\nespecially the Indians, did from the elements, powers and forms of\nNature. One may add, \u201cout of Thought thou takest the element and\nmaterial for God.\u201d Thus Thought is the ground from which God comes\nforth, but it is not Thought in its commencement that constitutes the\nfirst principle from which all culture must be grasped. It is quite the\nother way. In the beginning, thought comes forth as altogether poor,\nabstract, and of a content which is meagre in comparison to that given\nto his subject by the oriental; for as immediate, the beginning is\njust in the form of nature, and this it shares with what is oriental.\nBecause it thus reduces the content of the East to determinations which\nare altogether poor, these thoughts are scarcely worth observation on\nour part, since they are not yet proper thoughts, neither being in the\nform of, or determined as thought, but belonging really to Nature.\nThus Thought is the Absolute, though not as Thought. That is, we have\nalways two things to distinguish, the universal or the Notion, and\nthe reality of this universal, for the question here arises as to\nwhether the reality is itself Thought or Nature. We find in the fact\nthat reality at first has still the immediate form and is only Thought\npotentially, the reason for commencing with the Greeks and from the\nnatural philosophy of the Ionic school.\nAs regards the external and historical condition of Greece at this\ntime, Greek philosophy commences in the sixth century before Christ in\nthe time of Cyrus, and in the period of decline in the Ionic republics\nin Asia Minor. Just because this world of beauty which raised itself\ninto a higher kind of culture went to pieces, Philosophy arose. Cr\u0153sus\nand the Lydians first brought Ionic freedom into jeopardy; later on the\nPersians were those who destroyed it altogether, so that the greater\npart of the inhabitants sought other spots and created colonies, more\nparticularly in the West. At the time of the decline in Ionic towns,\nthe other Greece ceased to be under its ancient lines of kings; the\nPelopideans and the other, and for the most part foreign, princely\nraces had passed away. Greece had in many ways come into touch with\nthe outside world and the Greek inhabitants likewise sought within\nthemselves for a bond of fellowship. The patriarchal life was past, and\nin many states it came to be a necessity that they should constitute\nthemselves as free, organized and regulated by law. Many individuals\ncome into prominence who were no more rulers of their fellow-citizens\nby descent, but who were by means of talent, power of imagination and\nscientific knowledge, marked out and reverenced, and such individuals\ncame into many different relations with their fellows. Part of them\nbecame advisers, but their advice was frequently not followed; part\nof them were hated and despised by their fellow-citizens, and they\ndrew back from public affairs; others became violent, if not fierce\ngovernors of the other citizens, and others again finally became the\nadministrators of liberty.\n_The Seven Sages_. Amongst these men just characterized, the seven\nsages\u2014in modern times excluded from the history of Philosophy\u2014take\ntheir place. In as far as they may be reckoned as milestones in the\nhistory of Philosophy, something about their character should, in the\ncommencement of Philosophy, be shortly said. They came into prominence,\npartly as taking part in the battles of the Ionic towns, partly as\nexpatriated, and partly as individuals of distinction in Greece. The\nnames of the seven are given differently: usually, however, as Thales,\nSolon, Periander, Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias, Pittacus. Hermippus in\nDiogenes Laertius (1, 42) specifies seventeen, and, amongst these,\nvarious people pick out seven in various ways. According to Diogenes\nLaertius (1, 41) Dic\u00e6archus, who came still earlier in history, only\nnames four, and these are placed amongst the seven by all; they are\nThales, Bias, Pittacus and Solon. Besides these, Myson, Anacharsis,\nAcusilaus, Epimenides, Pherecydes, &c., are mentioned. Dic\u00e6archus\nin Diogenes (1, 40), says of them that they are neither wise men\n(_\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2_) nor philosophers, but men of understanding (_\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03be\u03cd\u03c2_) and\nlaw-givers; this judgment has become the universal one and is held\nto be just. They come in a period of transition amongst the Greeks\u2014a\ntransition from a patriarchal system of kings into one of law or force.\nThe fame of the wisdom of these men depends, on the one hand, on the\nfact that they grasped the practical essence of consciousness, or the\nconsciousness of universal morality as it is in and for itself, giving\nexpression to it in the form of moral maxims and in part in civil laws,\nmaking these actual in the state; on the other hand it depends on\ntheir having, in theoretic form, expressed the same in witty sayings.\nSome of these sayings could not merely be regarded as thoughtful or\ngood reflections, but in so far, as philosophic and speculative; they\nhave a comprehensive, universal significance ascribed to them, which,\nhowever, does not explain them. These men have not really made science\nand Philosophy their aim; it is expressly said of Thales that it was\nin the latter part of his life that he first took to Philosophy. What\nhad relation to politics appeared most frequently; they were practical\nmen, men of affairs, but not in our sense of the word; with us\npractical activity devotes itself to a special line of administration\nor to a particular business, or to economics, &c. They lived in\ndemocratic states and thus shared the responsibilities of the general\nadministration and rule. They were not statesmen like the great Greek\npersonalities, like Miltiades, Themistocles, Pericles and Demosthenes,\nbut they were statesmen in a time when safety, preservation and,\nindeed, the whole well-being, disposition and well nigh the very\nfoundation of civic life were in question; and certainly when this was\nso with the foundations of legally established institutions.\nThales and Bias thus appear as the representatives of the Ionic\ntowns. Herodotus (I. 169-171) speaks of both, and says of Thales\nthat he advised even before the overthrow of the Ionians (apparently\nthrough Cr\u0153sus), that they should constitute a supreme council (_\u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_) in Teos, in the centre of the Ionian people, and thus\nmake a federal state with a capital and principal federal town, so that\nthey might still remain separate nations (_\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9_) as before. However,\nthey did not follow this advice, and this isolated and weakened them,\nand the result was their conquest; it has always been a difficult thing\nfor the Greeks to give up their individuality. Later on, when Harpagus,\nthe general of Cyrus who accomplished their overthrow, pressed in upon\nthem, the Ionians took no better the most excellent advice of Bias of\nPriene, given them at the decisive moment when they were assembled at\nPanionium, \u201cto go in a common fleet to Sardinia, there to found an\nIonic state. By so doing they would escape servitude, be happy, and,\ninhabiting the largest island, subdue the others. But if they remained\nin Ionia there was no hope of liberty to be seen for them.\u201d Herodotus\ngives his corroboration to this advice\u2014\u201cIf they had followed him they\nwould have been the happiest of Greeks.\u201d Such things take place, but\nthrough force and not voluntarily.\nWe find the other sages under similar conditions. Solon was an\nadministrator in Athens, and thereby became famous; few men have\nattained the honourable position of being a law-giver. Solon shares it\nwith Moses, Lycurgus, Zaleucus, Numa, &c., alone. No individuals can be\nfound amongst Teutonic peoples who possess the distinction of being the\nlaw-givers of their people. Nowadays there can be law-givers no longer;\nlegal institutions and regulations are in modern times always ready to\nhand, and the little that can still be done by means of the law-giver\nand by law-making assemblies is simply the further modification of\ndetails or making very insignificant additions. What is dealt with is\nthe compilation, wording and perfecting of the particular only; and\nyet neither Solon and Lycurgus did more than respectively bring the\nIonic mind and the Doric character\u2014being that which had been given\nthem and which was implicitly present\u2014into the form of consciousness,\nand obviate the temporary inconvenience of disorder through effective\nlaws. Solon was thus not a perfect statesman; this is manifest from\nthe sequel of his history. A constitution which allowed Pisistratus\nin Solon\u2019s own time to raise himself into the Tyranny, showing itself\nto be so destitute of strength and organization that it could not\nprevent its own overthrow, (and by what a power!) manifests some inward\nwant. This may seem strange, for a constitution must be able to afford\nresistance to such an attack. But let us see what Pisistratus did.\nWhat the so-called tyrants really were, is most clearly shown by the\nrelation borne by Solon to Pisistratus. When orderly institutions and\nlaws were necessary to the Greeks, we find law-givers and regents of\nstates appearing, who laid down laws, and ruled accordingly. The law,\nas universal, seemed and still seems now to the individual to be\nforce, inasmuch as he does not have regard to or comprehend the law:\nit applies first to all the people, and then only, to the individual;\nit is essential first of all to use constraint until the individual\nattains discernment, and law to him becomes his law, and ceases to be\nsomething foreign. Most of the law-givers and administrators of states\nundertook themselves to constrain the people and to be their tyrants.\nIn states where they did not undertake it, it had to be done by other\nindividuals, for it was essential. According to Diogenes Laertius\u2019\naccount (I. 48-50), we find Solon\u2014whom his friends advised to secure\nthe mastery for himself since the people held to him (_\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd_), and\nwould have liked to see him become tyrant\u2014repulse them, and try to\nprevent any such occurrence, when he became suspicious of Pisistratus\u2019\nintentions. What he did when he remarked upon the attitude of\nPisistratus, was to come into the assembly of the people, and tell them\nthe design of Pisistratus, accoutred in armour and shield; this was\nthen unusual, for Thucydides (1, 6) makes it a distinguishing feature\nbetween Greeks and Barbarians, that the former, and pre-eminently the\nAthenians, put aside their arms in time of peace. He said, \u201cMen of\nAthens, I am wiser than some and braver than others: I am wiser than\nthose who do not see the deceit of Pisistratus, braver than those\nwho certainly see it, but say nothing from fear.\u201d As he could not do\nanything, he left Athens. Pisistratus is said to have then written a\nmost honourable letter to Solon in his absence, which Diogenes (I.\n53, 54) has preserved for us, inviting him to return to Athens, and\nlive with him as a free citizen. \u201cNot only am I not the only one of\nthe Greeks to have seized the tyranny, but I have not taken anything\nwhich was not my due, for I am of the race of Codrus. I have only taken\nback to myself what the Athenians swore they would preserve to Codrus\nand his race, and yet took from them. Moreover I am doing no evil\ntoward gods and men, but as thou hast given laws to the Athenians, I\ntake care (_\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u1ff6_) that in civil life they shall carry them out\n(_\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd_.) His son Hippias did the same. And these relations are\ncarried out better than they would be in a democracy, for I allow\nnobody to do evil (_\u1f51\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd_), and as Tyrant, I lay claim to no more\n(_\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9_) than such consideration and respect and specified\ngifts (_\u03c4\u1f70 \u1fe5\u03b7\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1_) as would have been offered to the kings in\nearlier times. Every Athenian gives the tenth part of his revenue,\nnot to me, but towards the cost of the public offering, and besides\nfor the commonwealth, and for use in case of war. I am not angry that\nthou hast disclosed my project. For thou didst it more out of love to\nthe people than hate against me, and because thou didst not know how I\nwould conduct my rule. For if thou hadst known this, thou wouldst have\nsubmitted to it willingly, and wouldst not have taken flight;\u201d and so\nhe goes on. Solon, in the answer given by Diogenes, (I. 66, 67) says,\nthat he \u201chas not a personal grudge against Pisistratus, and he must\ncall him the best of tyrants; but to turn back does not befit him. For\nhe made equality of rights essential in the Athenian constitution, and\nhimself refused the tyranny. By his return he would condone what was\ndone by Pisistratus.\u201d The rule of Pisistratus accustomed the Athenians\nto the laws of Solon, and brought them into usage, so that after this\nusage came to be general, supremacy was superfluous; his sons were\nhence driven out of Athens, and for the first time the constitution of\nSolon upheld itself. Solon undoubtedly gave the laws, but it is another\nthing to make such regulations effectual in the manners, habits and\nlife of a people. What was separate in Solon and Pisistratus, we find\nunited in Periander in Corinth, and Pittacus in Mitilene.\nThis may be enough about the outward life of the seven sages. They are\nalso famed for the wisdom of the sayings which have been preserved to\nus; these sayings seem in great measure, however, to be superficial\nand hackneyed. The reason for this is found in the fact that, to\nour reflection, general propositions are quite usual; much in the\nProverbs of Solomon seems to us to be superficial and commonplace\nfor the same reason. But it is quite another thing to bring to the\nordinary conception for the first time this same universal in the\nform of universality. Many distichs are ascribed to Solon which we\nstill retain; their object is to express in maxims general obligations\ntowards the gods, the family and the country. Diogenes (I. 58) tells us\nthat Solon said: \u201cLaws are like a spider\u2019s web; the small are caught,\nthe great tear it up: speech is the image of action,\u201d &c. Such sayings\nare not philosophy, but general reflections, the expression of moral\nduties, maxims, necessary determinations. The wisdom of the sages is\nof this kind; many sayings are insignificant, but many seem to be more\ninsignificant than they are. For instance, Chilon says: \u201cStand surety,\nand evil awaits thee\u201d (_\u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03cd\u03b1, \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u0313 \u1f04\u03c4\u03b1_). On the one hand this is\nquite a common rule of life and prudence, but the sceptics gave to\nthis proposition a much higher universal significance, which is also\naccredited to Chilon. This sense is, \u201cAlly thyself closely to any\nparticular thing, and unhappiness will fall upon thee.\u201d The sceptics\nadduced this proposition independently, as demonstrating the principle\nof scepticism, which is that nothing is finite and definite in and for\nitself, being only a fleeting, vacillating phase which does not last.\nCleobulus says, _\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd_, another _\u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f04\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd_, and this has\nlikewise a universal significance which is that limitation, the _\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2_\nof Plato as opposed to the _\u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_\u2014-the self-determined as opposed\nto undetermined\u2014is what is best; and thus it is that in Being limit or\nmeasure is the highest determination.\nOne of the most celebrated sayings is that of Solon in his conversation\nwith Cr\u0153sus, which Herodotus (I. 30-33) has in his own way given us\nvery fully. The result arrived at is this:\u2014\u201cNobody is to be esteemed\nhappy before his death.\u201d But the noteworthy point in this narrative\nis that from it we can get a better idea of the standpoint of Greek\nreflection in the time of Solon. We see that happiness is put forward\nas the highest aim, that which is most to be desired and which is the\nend of man; before Kant, morality, as eud\u00e6monism, was based on the\ndetermination of happiness. In Solon\u2019s sayings there is an advance over\nthe sensuous enjoyment which is merely pleasant to the feelings. Let us\nask what happiness is and what there is within it for reflection, and\nwe find that it certainly carries with it a certain satisfaction to the\nindividual, of whatever sort it be\u2014whether obtained through physical\nenjoyment or spiritual\u2014the means of obtaining which lie in men\u2019s own\nhands. But the fact is further to be observed that not every sensuous,\nimmediate pleasure can be laid hold of, for happiness contains a\nreflection on the circumstances as a whole, in which we have the\nprinciple to which the principle of isolated enjoyment must give way.\nEud\u00e6monism signifies happiness as a condition for the whole of life;\nit sets up a totality of enjoyment which is a universal and a rule\nfor individual enjoyment, in that it does not allow it to give way to\nwhat is momentary, but restrains desires and sets a universal standard\nbefore one\u2019s eyes. If we contrast it with Indian philosophy, we find\neud\u00e6monism to be antagonistic to it. There the liberation of the soul\nfrom what is corporeal, the perfect abstraction, the necessity that the\nsoul shall, in its simplicity, be at home with itself, is the final\nend of man. With the Greeks the opposite is the case; the satisfaction\nthere is also satisfaction of the soul, but it is not attained through\nflight, abstraction, withdrawal within self, but through satisfaction\nin the present, concrete satisfaction in relation to the surroundings.\nThe stage of reflection that we reach in happiness, stands midway\nbetween mere desire and the other extreme, which is right as right and\nduty as duty. In happiness, the individual enjoyment has disappeared;\nthe form of universality is there, but the universal does not yet come\nforth on its own account, and this is the issue of the conversation\nbetween Cr\u0153sus and Solon. Man as thinking, is not solely engrossed\nwith present enjoyment, but also with the means for obtaining that to\ncome. Cr\u0153sus points out to him these means, but Solon still objects\nto the statement of the question of Cr\u0153sus. For in order that any one\nshould be conceived of as happy, we must await his death, for happiness\ndepends upon his condition to the end, and upon the fact that his\ndeath should be a pious one and be consistent with his higher destiny.\nBecause the life of Cr\u0153sus had not yet expired, Solon could not deem\nhim happy. And the history of Cr\u0153sus bears evidence that no momentary\nstate deserves the name of happiness. This edifying history holds in\nits embrace the whole standpoint of the reflection of that time.\n_Division of the Subject_. In the consideration of Greek philosophy we\nhave now to distinguish further three important periods:\u2014in the first\nplace the period from Thales to Aristotle; secondly, Greek philosophy\nin the Roman world; thirdly, the Neo-platonic philosophy.\n1. We begin with thought, as it is in a quite abstract, natural or\nsensuous form, and we proceed from this to the Idea as determined. This\nfirst period shows the beginning of philosophic thought, and goes on to\nits development and perfection as a totality of knowledge in itself;\nthis takes place in Aristotle as representing the unity of what has\ncome before. In Plato there is just such a union of what came earlier,\nbut it is not worked out, for he only represents the Idea generally.\nThe Neo-platonists have been called eclectics, and Plato was said to\nhave brought about the unity; they were not, however, eclectics, but\nthey had a conscious insight into the necessity for uniting these\nphilosophies.\n2. After the concrete Idea was reached, it came forth as if in\nopposites, perfecting and developing itself. The second period is that\nin which science breaks itself up into different systems. A one-sided\nprinciple is carried through the whole conception of the world; each\nside is in itself formed into a totality, and stands in the relation\nof one extreme to another. The philosophical systems of Stoicism\nand Epicureanism are such; scepticism forms the negative to their\ndogmatism, while the other philosophies disappear.\n3. The third period is the affirmative, the withdrawal of the\nopposition into an ideal world or a world of thought, a divine world.\nThis is the Idea developed into totality, which yet lacks subjectivity\nas the infinite being-for-self.\nSECTION ONE\nFIRST PERIOD, FROM THALES TO ARISTOTLE\nIN this first period we shall again make three divisions:\u2014\n1. The first extends from Thales to Anaxagoras, from abstract\nthought which is in immediate determinateness to the thought of the\nself-determining Thought. Here a beginning is made with the absolutely\nsimple, in which the earliest methods of determination manifest\nthemselves as attempts, until the time of Anaxagoras; he determines\nthe true as the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, and as active thought which no longer is in a\ndeterminate character, but which is self-determining.\n2. The second division comprises the Sophists, Socrates, and the\nfollowers of Socrates. Here the self-determining thought is conceived\nof as present and concrete in me; that constitutes the principle of\nsubjectivity if not also of infinite subjectivity, for thought first\nshows itself here only partly as abstract principle and partly as\ncontingent subjectivity.\n3. The third division, which deals with Plato and Aristotle, is found\nin Greek science where objective thought, the Idea, forms itself into\na whole. The concrete, in itself determining Thought, is, with Plato,\nthe still abstract Idea, but in the form of universality; while with\nAristotle that Idea was conceived of as the self-determining, or in the\ndetermination of its efficacy or activity.\nCHAPTER I\nPERIOD I.\u2014DIVISION I.\u2014THALES TO ANAXAGORAS\nSINCE we possess only traditions and fragments of this epoch, we may\nspeak here of the sources of these.\n1. The first source is found in Plato, who makes copious reference to\nthe older philosophers. For the reason that he makes the earlier and\napparently independent philosophies, which are not so far apart when\nonce their Notion is definitely grasped, into concrete moments of one\nIdea, Plato\u2019s philosophy often seems to be merely a clearer statement\nof the doctrines of the older philosophers, and hence it draws upon\nitself the reproach of plagiarism. Plato was willing to spend much\nmoney in procuring the writings of the older philosophers, and, from\nhis profound study of these, his conclusions have much weight. But\nbecause in his writings he never himself appeared as teacher, but\nalways represented other people in his dialogues as the philosophers, a\ndistinction never has been made between what really belonged to them in\nhistory and what was added by him through the further development which\nhe effected in their thoughts. In the Parmenides, for instance, we\nhave the Eleatic philosophy, and yet the working out of this doctrine\nbelongs peculiarly to Plato.\n2. Aristotle is our most abundant authority; he studied the older\nphilosophers expressly and most thoroughly, and he has, in the\nbeginning of his Metaphysics especially, and also to a large extent\nelsewhere, dealt with them, in historical order: he is as philosophic\nas erudite, and we may rely upon him. We can do no better in Greek\nphilosophy than study the first book of his Metaphysics. When the\nwould-be-wise man depreciates Aristotle, and asserts that he has not\ncorrectly apprehended Plato, it may be retorted that as he associated\nwith Plato himself, with his deep and comprehensive mind, perhaps no\none knew him better.\n3. Cicero\u2019s name may also occur to us here\u2014although he certainly is\nbut a troubled spring\u2014since he undoubtedly gives us much information;\nyet because he was lacking in philosophic spirit, he understood\nPhilosophy rather as if it were a matter of history merely. He does\nnot seem to have himself studied its first sources, and even avows\nthat, for instance, he never understood Heraclitus; and because\nthis old and deep philosophy did not interest him, he did not give\nhimself the trouble to study it. His information bears principally\non later philosophers\u2014the Stoics, Epicureans, the new Academy, and\nthe Peripatetics. He saw what was ancient through their medium,\nand, generally speaking, through a medium of reasoning and not of\nspeculation.\n4. Sextus Empiricus, a later sceptic, has importance through his\nwritings, _Hypotyposes Pyrrhonic\u00e6_ and _adversus Mathematicos_.\nBecause, as a sceptic, he both combated the dogmatic philosophy and\nalso adduced other philosophers as testifying to scepticism (so that\nthe greater part of his writings is filled with the tenets of other\nphilosophers), he is the most abundant source we have for the history\nof ancient philosophy, and he has retained for our use many valuable\nfragments.\n5. The book of Diogenes Laertius (_De vitis_, &c., Philoss. lib.\nx., ed. Meibom. c. notis Menagii, Amstel. 1692) is an important\ncompilation, and yet it brings forward copious evidence without much\ndiscrimination. A philosophic spirit cannot be ascribed to it; it\nrambles about amongst bad anecdotes extraneous to the matter in hand.\nFor the lives of philosophers, and here and there for their tenets, it\nis useful.\n6. Finally, we must speak of Simplicius, a later Greek, from Cilicia,\nliving under Justinian, in the middle of the sixth century. He is the\nmost learned and acute of the Greek commentators of Aristotle, and of\nhis writings there is much still unpublished: to him we certainly owe\nour thanks.\nI need give no more references, for they may be found without trouble\nin any compendium. In the progress of Greek philosophy men were\nformerly accustomed to follow the order that showed, according to\nordinary ideas, an external connection, and which is found in one\nphilosopher having had another as his teacher\u2014this connection is one\nwhich might show him to be partly derived from Thales and partly from\nPythagoras. But such a connection is in part defective in itself, and\nin part it is merely external. The one set of philosophic sects, or\nof philosophers classed together, which is considered as belonging to\na system\u2014that which proceeds from Thales\u2014pursues its course in time\nand mind far separate from the other. But, in truth, no such series\never does exist in this isolation, nor would it do so even though the\nindividuals were consecutive and had been externally connected as\nteacher and taught, which never is the case; mind follows quite another\norder. These successive series are interwoven in spirit just as much as\nin their particular content.\nWe come across Thales first amongst the Ionic people, to whom the\nAthenians belonged, or from whom the Ionians of Asia Minor, as a whole,\nderived their origin. The Ionic race appears earlier in Peloponnesus,\nbut seems to have been removed from thence. It is, however, not known\nwhat nations belonged to it, for, according to Herodotus (I. 143), the\nother Ionians, and even the Athenians, laid aside the name. According\nto Thucydides (I. 2 and 12), the Ionic colonies in Asia Minor and the\nislands proceeded principally from Athens, because the Athenians,\non account of the over-population of Attica, migrated there. We find\nthe greatest activity in Greek life on the coasts of Asia Minor, in\nthe Greek islands, and then towards the west of Magna Gr\u00e6cia; we see\namongst these people, through their internal political activity and\ntheir intercourse with foreigners, the existence of a diversity and\nvariety in their relations, whereby narrowness of vision is done away\nwith, and the universal rises in its place. These two places, Ionia and\nGreater Greece, are thus the two localities where this first period\nin the history of Philosophy plays its part until the time when, that\nperiod being ended, Philosophy plants itself in Greece proper, and\nthere makes its home. Those spots were also the seat of early commerce\nand of an early culture, while Greece itself, so far as these are\nconcerned, followed later.\nWe must thus remark that the character of the two sides into which\nthese philosophies divide, the philosophy of Asia Minor in the east\nand that of Grecian Italy in the west, partakes of the character of\nthe geographical distinction. On the Asia Minor side, and also in\nthe islands, we find Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus,\nLeucippus, Democritus, Anaxagoras, and Diogenes from Crete. On the\nother side are the inhabitants of Italy: Pythagoras from Samos, who\nlived in Italy, however; Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles;\nand several of the Sophists also lived in Italy. Anaxagoras was the\nfirst to come to Athens, and thus his science takes a middle place\nbetween both extremes, and Athens was made its centre. The geographical\ndistinction makes its appearance in the manifestation of Thought,\nin the fact that, with the Orientals a sensuous, material side is\ndominant, and in the west, Thought, on the contrary, prevails, because\nit is constituted into the principle in the form of thought. Those\nphilosophers who turned to the east knew the absolute in a real\ndetermination of nature, while towards Italy there is the ideal\ndetermination of the absolute. These explanations will be sufficient\nfor us here; but Empedocles, whom we find in Sicily, is somewhat of\na natural philosopher, while Gorgias, the Sicilian sophist, remains\nfaithful to the ideal side.\nWe now have to consider further:\u20141, The Ionians, viz. Thales,\nAnaximander, Anaximenes; 2, Pythagoras and his followers; 3, the\nEleatics, viz. Xenophanes, Parmenides, &c.; 4, Heraclitus; 5,\nEmpedocles, Leucippus and Democritus; 6, Anaxagoras. We have to trace\nand point out the progression of this philosophy also. The first and\naltogether abstract determinations are found with Thales and the\nother Ionians; they grasped the universal in the form of a natural\ndetermination, as water and air. Progression must thus take place by\nleaving behind the merely natural determination; and we find that this\nis so with the Pythagoreans. They say that number is the substance or\nthe essence of things; number is not sensuous, nor is it pure thought,\nbut it is a non-sensuous object of sense. It was with the Eleatics\nthat pure thought appeared, and that its forcible liberation from the\nsensuous form and the form of number came to pass; and thus from them\nproceeds the dialectic movement of thought, which negates the definite\nparticular in order to show that it is not the many but only the one\nthat is true. Heraclitus declares the Absolute to be this very process,\nwhich, according to the Eleatics, was still subjective; he arrived at\nobjective consciousness, since in it the Absolute is that which moves\nor changes. Empedocles, Leucippus, and Democritus, on the contrary,\nrather go to the opposite extreme, to the simple, material, stationary\nprinciple, to the substratum which underlies the process; and thus this\nlast, as being movement, is distinguished from it. With Anaxagoras it\nis the moving, self-determining thought itself that is then known as\nexistence, and this is a great step forward.\nA. THE IONIC PHILOSOPHY.\nHere we have the earlier Ionic philosophy, which we desire to treat as\nshortly as possible; and this is so much the easier, that the thought\ncontained in it is very abstract and barren. Other philosophers than\nThales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, only come under our consideration\nas names. We have no more than half a dozen passages in the whole\nof the early Ionic philosophy, and that makes it an easy study. Yet\nlearning prides itself most upon the ancients, for we may be most\nlearned about that of which we know the least.\n1. _Thales._\nWith Thales we, properly speaking, first begin the history of\nPhilosophy. The life of Thales occurred at the time when the Ionic\ntowns were under the dominion of Cr\u0153sus. Through his overthrow (Ol.\n58, 1; 548 B.C.), an appearance of freedom was produced, yet the most\nof these towns were conquered by the Persians, and Thales survived the\ncatastrophe only a few years. He was born at Miletus; his family is,\nby Diogenes (I. 22, 37), stated to be the Ph\u0153nician one of Thelides,\nand the date of his birth, according to the best calculation, is placed\nin the first year of the 35th Olympiad (640 B.C.), but according to\nMeiners it was a couple of Olympiads later (38th Olympiad, 629 B.C.).\nThales lived as a statesman partly with Cr\u0153sus and partly in Miletus.\nHerodotus quotes him several times, and tells (I. 75) that, according\nto the narratives of the Greeks, when Cr\u0153sus went to battle against\nCyrus and had difficulty in passing over the river Halys, Thales, who\naccompanied the army, diverted the river by a trench, which he made\nin the form of a crescent behind the camp, so that it could then be\nforded. Diogenes (I. 25) says further of him as regards his relations\nto his country, that he restrained the men of Miletus from allying\nthemselves with Cr\u0153sus when he went against Cyrus, and that hence,\nafter the conquest of Cr\u0153sus, when the other Ionic States were subdued\nby the Persians, the inhabitants of Miletus alone remained undisturbed.\nDiogenes records, moreover (I. 23), that he soon withdrew his attention\nfrom the affairs of the State and devoted himself entirely to science.\nVoyages to Ph\u0153nicia are recorded of him, which, however, rest on vague\ntradition; but that he was in Egypt in his old age seems undoubted.[19]\nThere he was said to have learned geometry, but this would appear\nnot to have been much, judging from the anecdote, which Diogenes (I.\n24, 27) retails from a certain Hieronymus. It was to the effect that\nThales taught the Egyptians to measure the height of their pyramids\nby shadow\u2014by taking the relation borne by the height of a man to his\nshadow. The terms of the proportion are: as the shadow of a man is to\nthe height of a man, so is the shadow of a pyramid to its height. If\nthis were something new to the Egyptians, they must have been very far\nback in the theory of geometry. Herodotus tells (I. 74), moreover,\nthat Thales foretold an eclipse of the sun that happened exactly on\nthe day of the battle between the Medians and Lydians, and that he\nascribed the rising of the Nile to the contrary Etesian winds, which\ndrove back the waters.[20] We have some further isolated instances\nof, and anecdotes about his astronomical knowledge and works.[21] \u201cIn\ngazing at and making observations on the stars, he fell into a ditch,\nand the people mocked him as one who had knowledge of heavenly objects\nand yet could not see what lay at his own feet.\u201d The people laugh at\nsuch things, and boast that philosophers cannot tell them about such\nmatters; but they do not understand that philosophers laugh at them,\nfor they do not fall into a ditch just because they lie in one for\nall time, and because they cannot see what exists above them. He also\nshowed, according to Diogenes (I. 26), that a wise man, if he wishes,\ncan easily acquire riches. It is more important that he fixed that the\nyear, as solar year, should have 365 days. The anecdote of the golden\ntripod to be given to the wisest man, is recorded by Diogenes (I.\n27-33); and it carries with it considerable weight, because he combines\nall the different versions of the story. The tripod was given to Thales\nor to Bias; Thales gave it to some one else, and thus it went through\na circle until it again came to Thales; the latter, or else Solon,\ndecided that Apollo was wisest, and sent it to Didyma or to Delphi.\nThales died, according to Diogenes (I. 38), aged seventy-eight or\nninety, in the 58th Olympiad; according to Tennemann (vol. i. p. 414),\nit was in Olympiad 59, 2 (543 B.C.), when Pythagoras came to Crotona.\nDiogenes relates that he died at one of the games, overcome by heat and\nthirst.\nWe have no writings by Thales, and we do not know whether he was in\nthe habit of writing. Diogenes Laertius (I. 23, 34, 35) speaks of two\nhundred verses on astronomy, and some maxims, such as \u201cIt is not the\nmany words that have most meaning.\u201d\nAs to his philosophy, he is universally recognized as the first natural\nphilosopher, but all one knows of him is little, and yet we seem to\nknow the most of what there is. For since we find that the further\nphilosophic progress of which his speculative idea was capable, and the\nunderstanding of his propositions, which they alone could have, make\ntheir first appearance and form particular epochs with the philosophers\nsucceeding him, who may be recognized thereby, this development\nascribed to Thales never took place with him at all. Thus if it is the\ncase that a number of his other reflections have been lost, they cannot\nhave had any particular speculative value; and his philosophy does not\nshow itself to be an imperfect system from want of information about\nit, but because the first philosophy cannot be a system.\nWe must listen to Aristotle as regards these ancient philosophers,\nfor he speaks most sympathetically of them. In the passage of most\nimportance (Metaph. I. 3), he says: \u201cSince it is clear that we must\nacquire the science of first causes (_\u1f10\u03be \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03bd_), seeing that\nwe say that a person knows a thing when he becomes acquainted with\nits cause, there are, we must recollect, four causes\u2014Being and Form\nfirst (for the \u2018why\u2019 is finally led back to the Notion, but yet the\nfirst \u2018why\u2019 is a cause and principle); matter and substratum, second;\nthe cause whence comes the beginning of movement, third; and fourth\nthe cause which is opposed to this, the aim in view and the good (for\nthat is the end of every origination). Hence we would make mention of\nthose who have undertaken the investigation of Being before us, and\nhave speculated regarding the Truth, for they openly advance certain\nprinciples and first causes. If we take them under our consideration,\nit will be of this advantage, so far as our present investigation\ngoes, that we shall either find other kinds of causes or be enabled\nto have so much the more confidence in those just named. Most of the\nearliest philosophers have placed the principles of everything in\nsomething in the form of matter (_\u1f10\u03bd \u1f55\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9_), for, that from which\neverything existent comes, and out of which it takes its origin as its\nfirst source, and into which it finally sinks, as substance (_\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1_),\never remains the same and only changes in its particular qualities\n(_\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9_); and this is called the element (_\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd_) and this the\nprinciple of all that exists\u201d (the absolute prius). \u201cOn this account\nthey maintain that nothing arises or passes away, because the same\nnature always remains. For instance, we say that, absolutely speaking,\nSocrates neither originates if he becomes beautiful or musical, nor\ndoes he pass away if he loses these qualities, because the subject (_\u03c4\u1f78\n\u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd_), Socrates, remains the same. And so it is with all else.\nFor there must be one nature, or more than one, from which all else\narises, because it maintains its existence\u201d (_\u03c3\u03c9\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2_),\nthat means that in its change there is no reality or truth. \u201cAll do not\ncoincide as to the number of this principle or as to its description\n(_\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2_); Thales, the founder of this philosophy,\u201d (which recognizes\nsomething material as the principle and substance of all that is),\n\u201csays that it is water. Hence he likewise asserts the earth to be\nfounded on water.\u201d Water is thus the _\u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd_, the first ground,\nand, according to Seneca\u2019s statement (Qu\u00e6st. Nat. vi. 6), it seems to\nhim to be not so much the inside of the earth, as what encloses it\nwhich is the universal existence; for \u201cThales considered that the whole\nearth has water as its support (_subjecto humore_), and that it swims\nthereon.\u201d\nWe might first of all expect some explanation of the application of\nthese principles, as, for example, how it is to be proved that water is\nthe universal substance, and in what way particular forms are deduced\nfrom it. But as to this we must say that of Thales in particular,\nwe know nothing more than his principle, which is that water is the\ngod over all. No more do we know anything further of Anaximander,\nAnaximenes and Diogenes than their principles. Aristotle brings forward\na conjecture as to how Thales derived everything directly out of water,\n\u201cPerhaps (_\u1f34\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2_) the conclusions of Thales have been brought about\nfrom the reflection that it was evident that all nourishment is moist,\nand warmth itself comes out of moisture and thereby life continues.\nBut that from which anything generates is the principle of all things.\nThis was one reason for holding this theory, and another reason is\ncontained in the fact that all germs are moist in character, and water\nis the principle of what is moist.\u201d It is necessary to remark that\nthe circumstances introduced by Aristotle with a \u201cperhaps\u201d which are\nsupposed to have brought about the conclusions of Thales, making water\nthe absolute essence of everything, are not adduced as the grounds\nacknowledged by Thales. And furthermore, they can hardly be called\ngrounds, for what Aristotle does is rather to establish, as we would\nsay from actuality, that the latter corresponds to the universal\nidea of water. His successors, as for instance Pseudo-Plutarch (De\nplac. phil. I. 3), have taken Thales\u2019 assertion as positive and not\nhypothetical; Tiedmann (_Geist der spec. Phil._ vol. I. p. 36) remarks\nwith great reason that Plutarch omits the \u201cperhaps.\u201d For Plutarch\nsays, \u201cThales suggests (_\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9_) that everything takes its origin\nfrom water and resolves itself into the same, because as the germs of\nall that live have moisture as the principle of life, all else might\nlikewise (_\u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2_) take its principle from moisture; for all plants\ndraw their nourishment, and thus bear fruit, from water, and if they\nare without it, fade away; and even the fires of sun, and stars and\nworld are fed through the evaporation of water.\u201d Aristotle is contented\nwith simply showing in regard to moisture that, at least, it is\neverywhere to be found. Since Plutarch gives more definite grounds for\nholding that water is the simple essence of things, we must see whether\nthings, in so far as they are simple essence, are water, (_\u03b1_) The germ\nof the animal, of moist nature, is undoubtedly the animal as the simple\nactual, or as the essence of its actuality, or undeveloped actuality.\n(_\u03b2_) If, with plants, water may be regarded as for their nourishment,\nnourishment is still only the being of a thing as formless substance\nthat first becomes individualized by individuality, and thus succeeds\nin obtaining form. (_\u03b3_) To make sun, moon and the whole world arise\nthrough evaporation, like the food of plants, certainly approximates to\nthe idea of the ancients, who did not allow the sun and moon to have\nobtained independence as we do.\n\u201cThere are also some,\u201d continues Aristotle, \u201cwho hold that all the\nancients who, at the first and long before the present generation,\nmade theology their study, understood Nature thus. They made Oceanus\nand Tethys the producers of all origination (_\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2_), and\nwater, which by the poets is called Styx, the oath of the gods. For\nwhat is most ancient is most revered, and the oath is that most held in\nreverence.\u201d This old tradition has within it speculative significance.\nIf anything cannot be proved or is devoid of objective form, such as\nwe have in respect of payment in a discharge, or in witnesses who have\nseen the transaction, the oath, the confirmation of myself as object,\nexpresses the fact that my assurance is absolute truth. Now since, by\nway of confirmation, men swear by what is best, by what is absolutely\ncertain, and the gods swore by the subterranean water, it follows that\nthe essence of pure thought, the inmost being, the reality in which\nconsciousness finds its truth, is water; I, so to speak, express this\nclear certainty of myself as object, as God.\n1. The closer consideration of this principle in its bearings would\nhave no interest. For since the whole philosophy of Thales lies in\nthe fact that water is this principle, the only point of interest can\nbe to ask how far that principle is important and speculative. Thales\ncomprehends essence as devoid of form. While the sensuous certitude\nof each thing in its individuality is not questioned, this objective\nactuality is now to be raised into the Notion that reflects itself\ninto itself and is itself to be set forth as Notion; in commencement\nthis is seen in the world\u2019s being manifested as water, or as a simple\nuniversal. Fluid is, in its Notion, life, and hence it is water itself,\nspiritually expressed; in the so-called grounds or reasons, on the\ncontrary, water has the form of existent universal. We certainly\ngrant this universal activity of water, and for that reason call it\nan element, a physical universal power; but while we find it thus to\nbe the universal of activity, we also find it to be this actual, not\neverywhere, but in proximity to other elements\u2014earth, air and fire.\nWater thus has not got a sensuous universality, but a speculative one\nmerely; to be speculative universality, however, would necessitate its\nbeing Notion and having what is sensuous removed. Here we have the\nstrife between sensuous universality and universality of the Notion.\nThe real essence of nature has to be defined, that is, nature has to\nbe expressed as the simple essence of thought. Now simple essence, the\nNotion of the universal, is that which is devoid of form, but this\nwater as it is, comes into the determination of form, and is thus, in\nrelation to others, a particular existence just like everything that\nis natural. Yet as regards the other elements, water is determined as\nformless and simple, while the earth is that which has points, air is\nthe element of all change, and fire evidently changes into itself.\nNow if the need of unity impels us to recognize for separate things a\nuniversal, water, although it has the drawback of being a particular\nthing, can easily be utilized as the One, both on account of its\nneutrality, and because it is more material than air.\nThe proposition of Thales, that water is the Absolute, or as the\nancients say, the principle, is the beginning of Philosophy, because\nwith it the consciousness is arrived at that essence, truth, that which\nis alone in and for itself, are one. A departure from what is in our\nsensuous perception here takes place; man recedes from this immediate\nexistence. We must be able to forget that we are accustomed to a rich\nconcrete world of thought; with us the very child learns, \u201cThere is\none God in Heaven, invisible.\u201d Such determinations are not yet present\nhere; the world of Thought must first be formed and there is as yet no\npure unity. Man has nature before him as water, air, stars, the arch\nof the heavens; and the horizon of his ideas is limited to this. The\nimagination has, indeed, its gods, but its content still is natural;\nthe Greeks had considered sun, mountains, earth, sea, rivers, &c.,\nas independent powers, revered them as gods, and elevated them by\nthe imagination to activity, movement, consciousness and will. What\nthere is besides, like the conceptions of Homer, for instance, is\nsomething in which thought could not find satisfaction; it produces\nmere images of the imagination, endlessly endowed with animation and\nform, but destitute of simple unity. It must undoubtedly be said that\nin this unconsciousness of an intellectual world, one must acknowledge\nthat there is a great robustness of mind evinced in not granting this\nplenitude of existence to the natural world, but in reducing it to\na simple substance, which, as the ever enduring principle, neither\noriginates nor disappears, while the gods have a Theogony and are\nmanifold and changing. This wild, endlessly varied imagination of\nHomer is set at rest by the proposition that existence is water; this\nconflict of an endless quantity of principles, all these ideas that\na particular object is an independent truth, a self-sufficient power\nover others existing in its own right, are taken away, and it is shown\nlikewise that there is only one universal, the universal self-existent,\nthe simple unimaginative perception, the thought that is one and one\nalone.\nThis universal stands in direct relationship to the particular\nand to the existence of the world as manifested. The first thing\nimplied in what has been said, is that the particular existence\nhas no independence, is not true in and for itself, but is only an\naccidental modification. But the affirmative point of view is that all\nother things proceed from the one, that the one remains thereby the\nsubstance from which all other things proceed, and it is only through\na determination which is accidental and external that the particular\nexistence has its being. It is similarly the case that all particular\nexistence is transient, that is, it loses the form of particular and\nagain becomes the universal, water. The simple proposition of Thales\ntherefore, is Philosophy, because in it water, though sensuous, is not\nlooked at in its particularity as opposed to other natural things, but\nas Thought in which everything is resolved and comprehended. Thus we\napproach the divorce of the absolute from the finite; but it is not\nto be thought that the unity stands above, and that down here we have\nthe finite world. This idea is often found in the common conception\nof God\u2014where permanence is attributed to the world and where men\noften represent two kinds of actuality to themselves, a sensuous and a\nsupersensuous world of equal standing. The philosophic point of view is\nthat the one is alone the truly actual, and here we must take actual in\nits higher significance, because we call everything actual in common\nlife. The second circumstance to be remembered is that with the ancient\nphilosophers, the principle has a definite and, at first, a physical\nform. To us this does not appear to be philosophic but only physical;\nin this case, however, matter has philosophic significance. Thales\u2019\ntheory is thus a natural philosophy, because this universal essence\nis determined as real; consequently the Absolute is determined as the\nunity of thought and Being.\n2. Now if we have this undifferentiated principle predominating, the\nquestion arises as to the determination of this first principle. The\ntransition from universal to particular at once becomes essential, and\nit begins with the determination of activity; the necessity for such\narises here. That which is to be a veritable principle must not have\na one-sided, particular form, but in it the difference must itself\nbe absolute, while other principles are only special kinds of forms.\nThe fact that the Absolute is what determines itself is already more\nconcrete; we have the activity and the higher self-consciousness of the\nspiritual principle, by which the form has worked itself into being\nabsolute form, the totality of form. Since it is most profound, this\ncomes latest; what has first to be done is merely to look at things as\ndetermined.\nForm is lacking to water as conceived by Thales. How is this accorded\nto it? The method is stated (and stated by Aristotle, but not directly\nof Thales), in which particular forms have arisen out of water; it\nis said to be through a process of condensation and rarefaction\n(_\u03c0\u03c5\u03ba\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9_), or, as it may be better put, through\ngreater or less intensity. Tennemann (vol. I. p. 59) in reference to\nthis, cites from Aristotle, _De gen. et corrupt._ I. 1, where there\nis no mention of condensation and rarefaction as regards Thales, and\nfurther, _De c\u00e6lo_, III. 5, where it is only said that those who uphold\nwater or air, or something finer than water or coarser than air, define\ndifference as density and rarity, but nothing is said of its being\nThales who gave expression to this distinction. Tiedmann (vol. I. p.\n38) quotes yet other authorities; it was, however, later on, that this\ndistinction was first ascribed to Thales.[22] Thus much is made out,\nthat for the first time in this natural philosophy as in the modern,\nthat which is essential in form is really the quantitative difference\nin its existence. This merely quantitative difference, however, which,\nas the increasing and decreasing density of water, constitutes its\nonly form-determination, is an external expression of the absolute\ndifference; it is an unessential distinction set up through another and\nis not the inner difference of the Notion in itself; it is therefore\nnot worth while to spend more time over it.\nDifference as regards the Notion has no physical significance,\nbut differences or the simple duality of form in the sides of its\nopposition, must be comprehended as universally in the Notion. On this\naccount a sensuous interpretation must not be given to the material,\nthat is to particular determinations, as when it is definitely said\nthat rare water is air, rare air, fiery ether, thick water, mud, which\nthen becomes earth; according to this, air would be the rarefaction of\nthe first water, ether the rarefaction of air, and earth and mud the\nsediment of water. As sensuous difference or change, the division here\nappears as something manifested for consciousness; the moderns have\nexperimented in making thicker and thinner what to the senses is the\nsame.\nChange has consequently a double sense; one with reference to existence\nand another with reference to the Notion. When change is considered\nby the ancients, it is usually supposed to have to do with a change\nin what exists, and thus, for instance, inquiry would be made as to\nwhether water can be changed through chemical action, such as heat,\ndistillation, &c., into earth; finite chemistry is confined to this.\nBut what is meant in all ancient philosophies is change as regards\nthe Notion. That is to say, water does not become converted into air\nor space and time in retorts, &c. But in every philosophic idea, this\ntransition of one quality into another takes place, _i.e._ this inward\nconnection is shown in the Notion, according to which no one thing can\nsubsist independently and without the other, for the life of nature\nhas its subsistence in the fact that one thing is necessarily related\nto the other. We certainly are accustomed to believe that if water\nwere taken away, it would indeed fare badly with plants and animals,\nbut that stones would still remain; or that of colours, blue could\nbe abstracted without harming in the least yellow or red. As regards\nmerely empirical existence, it may easily be shown that each quality\nexists on its own account, but in the Notion they only are, through one\nanother, and by virtue of an inward necessity. We certainly see this\nalso in living matter, where things happen in another way, for here\nthe Notion comes into existence; thus if, for example, we abstract the\nheart, the lungs and all else collapse. And in the same way all nature\nexists only in the unity of all its parts, just as the brain can exist\nonly in unity with the other organs.\n3. If the form is, however, only expressed in both its sides as\ncondensation and rarefaction, it is not in and for itself, for to be\nthis it must be grasped as the _absolute Notion_, and as an endlessly\nforming unity. What is said on this point by Aristotle (De Anima, I.\n2, also 5) is this: \u201cThales seems, according to what is said of him,\nto consider the soul as something having movement, for he says of\nthe loadstone that it has a soul, since it moves the iron.\u201d Diogenes\nLaertius (I. 24) adds amber to this, from which we see that even Thales\nknew about electricity, although another explanation of it is that\n_\u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_ was besides a metal. Aldobrandini says of this passage in\nDiogenes, that it is a stone which is so hostile to poison that when\ntouched by such it immediately hisses. The above remark by Aristotle\nis perverted by Diogenes to such an extent that he says: \u201cThales has\nlikewise ascribed a soul to what is lifeless.\u201d However, this is not the\nquestion, for the point is how he thought of absolute form, and whether\nhe expressed the Idea generally as soul so that absolute essence should\nbe the unity of simple essence and form.\nDiogenes certainly says further of Thales (I. 27), \u201cThe world is\nanimated and full of demons,\u201d and Plutarch (De plac. phil. I. 7)\nsays, \u201cHe called God the Intelligence (_\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_) of the world.\u201d But all\nthe ancients, and particularly Aristotle, ascribe this expression\nunanimously to Anaxagoras as the one who first said that the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_\nis the principle of things. Thus it does not conduce to the further\ndetermination of form according to Thales, to find in Cicero (De Nat.\nDeor. I. 10) this passage: \u201cThales says that water is the beginning\nof everything, but God is the Mind which forms all that is, out of\nwater.\u201d Thales may certainly have spoken of God, but Cicero has\nadded the statement that he comprehended him as the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ which\nformed everything out of water. Tiedmann (vol. I. p. 42) declares the\npassage to be possibly corrupt, since Cicero later on (c. 11) says\nof Anaxagoras that \u201che first maintained the order of things to have\nbeen brought about through the infinite power of Mind.\u201d However, the\nEpicurean, in whose mouth these words are put, speaks \u201cwith confidence\nonly fearing that he should appear to have any doubts\u201d (c. 8) both\npreviously and subsequently of other philosophers rather foolishly, so\nthat this description is given merely as a jest. Aristotle understands\nhistoric accuracy better, and therefore we must follow him. But to\nthose who make it their business to find everywhere the conception of\nthe creation of the world by God, that passage in Cicero is a great\nsource of delight, and it is a much disputed point whether Thales is\nto be counted amongst those who accepted the existence of a God. The\nTheism of Thales is maintained by Plouquet, whilst others would have\nhim to be an atheist or polytheist, because he says that everything is\nfull of demons. However, this question as to whether Thales believed\nin God does not concern us here, for acceptation, faith, popular\nreligion are not in question; we only have to do with the philosophic\ndetermination of absolute existence. And if Thales did speak of God as\nconstituting everything out of this same water, that would not give us\nany further information about this existence; we should have spoken\nunphilosophically of Thales because we should have used an empty word\nwithout inquiring about its speculative significance. Similarly the\nword world-soul is useless, because its being is not thereby expressed.\nThus all these further, as also later, assertions do not justify us in\nmaintaining that Thales comprehended form in the absolute in a definite\nmanner; on the contrary, the rest of the history of philosophical\ndevelopment refutes this view. We see that form certainly seems to\nbe shown forth in existence, but as yet this unity is no further\ndeveloped. The idea that the magnet has a soul is indeed always better\nthan saying that it has the power of attraction; for power is a quality\nwhich is considered as a predicate separable from matter, while soul\nis movement in unison with matter in its essence. An idea such as\nthis of Thales stands isolated, however, and has no further relation\nto his absolute thought. Thus, in fact, the philosophy of Thales is\ncomprised in the following simple elements: (_a_) It has constituted\nan abstraction in order to comprehend nature in a simple sensuous\nessence. (_b_) It has brought forth the Notion of ground or principle;\nthat is, it has defined water to be the infinite Notion, the simple\nessence of thought, without determining it further as the difference of\nquantity. That is the limited significance of this principle of Thales.\n2. _Anaximander._\nAnaximander was also of Miletus, and he was a friend of Thales. \u201cThe\nlatter,\u201d says Cicero (Acad. Quaest. IV. 37), \u201ccould not convince him\nthat everything consisted of water.\u201d Anaximander\u2019s father was called\nPraxiades; the date of his birth is not quite certain; according to\nTennemann (vol. I. p. 413), it is put in Olympiad 42, 3 (610 B.C.),\nwhile Diogenes Laertius (II. I, 2) says, taking his information\nfrom Apollodorus, an Athenian, that in Ol. 58, 2 (547 B.C.), he was\nsixty-four years old, and that he died soon after, that is to say about\nthe date of Thales\u2019 death. And taking for granted that he died in his\nninetieth year, Thales must have been nearly twenty-eight years older\nthan Anaximander. It is related of Anaximander that he lived in Samos\nwith the tyrant Polycrates, where were Pythagoras and Anacreon also.\nThemistius, according to Brucker (Pt. I. p. 478), says of him that\nhe first put his philosophic thoughts into writing, but this is also\nrecorded of others, as for example, of Pherecydes, who was older than\nhe. Anaximander is said to have written about nature, the fixed stars,\nthe sphere, besides other matters; he further produced something like a\nmap, showing the boundary (_\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_) of land and sea; he also made\nother mathematical inventions, such as a sun-dial that he put up in\nLaced\u00e6mon, and instruments by which the course of the sun was shown,\nand the equinox determined; a chart of the heavens was likewise made by\nhim.\nHis philosophical reflections are not comprehensive, and do not extend\nas far as to determination. Diogenes says in the passage quoted\nbefore: \u201cHe adduced the Infinite\u201d (_\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_, the undetermined),\n\u201cas principle and element; he neither determined it as air or water or\nany such thing.\u201d There are, however, few attributes of this Infinite\ngiven. (_\u03b1_.) \u201cIt is the principle of all becoming and passing away;\nat long intervals infinite worlds or gods rise out of it, and again\nthey pass away into the same.\u201d This has quite an oriental tone. \u201cHe\ngives as a reason that the principle is to be determined as the\nInfinite, the fact that it does not need material for continuous\norigination. It contains everything in itself and rules over all: it\nis divine, immortal, and never passes away.\u201d[23] (_\u03b2_.) Out of the\none, Anaximander separates the opposites which are contained in it,\nas do Empedocles and Anaxagoras; thus everything in this medley is\ncertainly there, but undetermined.[24] That is, everything is really\ncontained therein in possibility (_\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9_), \u201cso that,\u201d says Aristotle\n(Metaphys. XI. 2), \u201cit is not only that everything arises accidentally\nout of what is not, but everything also arises from what is, although\nit is from incipient being which is not yet in actuality.\u201d Diogenes\nLaertius adds (II. 1): \u201cThe parts of the Infinite change, but it itself\nis unchangeable.\u201d (_\u03b3_.) Lastly, it is said that the infinitude is in\nsize and not in number, and Anaximander differs thus from Anaxagoras,\nEmpedocles and the other atomists, who maintain the absolute discretion\nof the infinite, while Anaximander upholds its absolute continuity.[25]\nAristotle (Metaphys. I. 8) speaks also of a principle which is neither\nwater nor air, but is \u201cthicker than air and thinner than water.\u201d Many\nhave connected this idea with Anaximander, and it is possible that it\nbelongs to him.\nThe advance made by the determination of the principle as infinite in\ncomprehensiveness rests in the fact that absolute essence no longer is\na simple universal, but one which negates the finite. At the same time,\nviewed from the material side, Anaximander removes the individuality\nof the element of water; his objective principle does not appear to\nbe material, and it may be understood as Thought. But it is clear\nthat he did not mean anything else than matter generally, universal\nmatter.[26] Plutarch reproaches Anaximander \u201cfor not saying what (_\u03c4\u03b9_)\nhis infinite is, whether air, water or earth.\u201d But a definite quality\nsuch as one of these is transient; matter determined as infinitude\nmeans the motion of positing definite forms, and again abolishing the\nseparation. True and infinite Being is to be shown in this and not in\nnegative absence of limit. This universality and negation of the finite\nis, however, our operation only: in describing matter as infinite,\nAnaximander does not seem to have said that this is its infinitude.\nHe has said further (and in this, according to Theophrastus, he agrees\nwith Anaxagoras), \u201cIn the infinite the like separates itself from the\nunlike and allies itself to the like; thus what in the whole was gold\nbecomes gold, what was earth, earth, &c., so that properly nothing\noriginates, seeing that it was already there.\u201d[27] These, however, are\npoor determinations, which only show the necessity of the transition\nfrom the undetermined to the determined; for this still takes place\nhere in an unsatisfying way. As to the further question of how the\ninfinite determines the opposite in its separation, it seems that the\ntheory of the quantitative distinction of condensation and rarefaction\nwas held by Anaximander as well as by Thales. Those who come later\ndesignate the process of separation from the Infinite as development.\nAnaximander supposes man to develop from a fish, which abandoned water\nfor the land.[28] Development comes also into prominence in recent\ntimes, but as a mere succession in time\u2014a formula in the use of which\nmen often imagine that they are saying something brilliant; but there\nis no real necessity, no thought, and above all, no Notion contained in\nit.\nBut in later records the idea of warmth, as being the disintegration of\nform, and that of cold, is ascribed to Anaximander by Stob\u00e6us (Eclog.\nPhys. c. 24, p. 500); this Aristotle (Metaphys. I. 5) first ascribed\nto Parmenides. Eusebius (De pr\u00e6p. Evang. I. 8), out of a lost work of\nPlutarch, gives us something from Anaximander\u2019s Cosmogony which is\ndark, and which, indeed, Eusebius himself did not rightly understand.\nIts sense is approximately this: \u201cOut of the Infinite, infinite\nheavenly spheres and infinite worlds have been set apart; but they\ncarry within them their own destruction, because they only are through\nconstant dividing off.\u201d That is, since the Infinite is the principle,\nseparation is the positing of a difference, i.e. of a determination or\nsomething finite. \u201cThe earth has the form of a cylinder, the height\nof which is the third part of the breadth. Both of the eternally\nproductive principles of warmth and cold separate themselves in the\ncreation of this earth, and a fiery sphere is formed round the air\nencircling the earth, like the bark around a tree. As this broke up,\nand the pieces were compressed into circles, sun, moon, and stars\nwere formed.\u201d Hence Anaximander, according to Stob\u00e6us (Ecl. Phys. 25,\np. 510), likewise called the stars \u201cwheel-shaped with fire-filled\nwrappings of air.\u201d This Cosmogony is as good as the geological\nhypothesis of the earth-crust which burst open, or as Buffon\u2019s\nexplosion of the sun, which beginning, on the other hand, with the sun,\nmakes the planets to be stones projected from it. While the ancients\nconfined the stars to our atmosphere, and made the sun first proceed\nfrom the earth, we make the sun to be the substance and birthplace of\nthe earth, and separate the stars entirely from any further connection\nwith us, because for us, like the gods worshipped by the Epicureans,\nthey are at rest. In the process of origination, the sun, indeed,\ndescends as the universal, but in nature it is that which comes later;\nthus in truth the earth is the totality, and the sun but an abstract\nmoment.\n3. _Anaximenes._\nAnaximenes still remains as having made his appearance between the\n55th and 58th Olympiads (560-548 B.C.). He was likewise of Miletus, a\ncontemporary and friend of Anaximander; he has little to distinguish\nhim, and very little is known about him. Diogenes Laertius says neither\nwith consideration nor consistency (II. 3): \u201cHe was born, according\nto Apollodorus in the 63rd Olympiad, and died in the year Sardis was\nconquered\u201d (by Cyrus, Olympiad 58th).\nIn place of the undetermined matter of Anaximander, he brings forward\na definite natural element; hence the absolute is in a real form,\nbut instead of the water of Thales, that form is air. He found that\nfor matter a sensuous being was indeed essential, and air has the\nadditional advantage of being more devoid of form; it is less corporeal\nthan water, for we do not see it, but feel it first in movement.\nPlutarch (De plac. phil. I. 3) says: \u201cOut of it everything comes forth,\nand into it everything is again resolved.\u201d According to Cicero (De Nat.\nDeor. I. 10), \u201che defined it as immeasurable, infinite, and in constant\nmotion.\u201d Diogenes Laertius expresses this in the passage already\nquoted: \u201cThe principle is air and the infinite\u201d (_\u03bf\u1f56\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b5\u1f36\u03c0\u03b5\n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_) as if there were two principles; however, _\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_ may be taken together as subject, and _\u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1_ regarded as the\npredicate in the statement. For Simplicius, in dealing with the Physics\nof Aristotle, expressly says (p. 6, a) \u201cthat the first principle was to\nhim one and infinite in nature as it was to Anaximander, but it was not\nindefinite as with the latter, but determined, that is, it was air,\u201d\nwhich, however, he seems to have understood as endowed with soul.\nPlutarch characterizes Anaximenes\u2019 mode of representation which makes\neverything proceed from air\u2014later on it was called ether\u2014and resolve\nitself therein, better thus: \u201cAs our soul, which is air, holds us\ntogether (_\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6_), one spirit (_\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1_) and air together likewise\nhold (_\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9_) the whole world together; spirit and air are\nsynonymous.\u201d Anaximenes shows very clearly the nature of his essence\nin the soul, and he thus points out what may be called the transition\nof natural philosophy into the philosophy of consciousness, or the\nsurrender of the objective form of principle. The nature of this\nprinciple has hitherto been determined in a manner which is foreign\nand negative to consciousness; both its reality, water or air, and the\ninfinite are a \u201cbeyond\u201d to consciousness. But soul is the universal\nmedium; it is a collection of conceptions which pass away and come\nforth, while the unity and continuity never cease. It is active as\nwell as passive, from its unity severing asunder the conceptions and\nsublating them, and it is present to itself in its infinitude, so that\nnegative signification and positive come into unison. Speaking more\nprecisely, this idea of the nature of the origin of things is that of\nAnaxagoras, the pupil of Anaximenes.\nPherecydes has also to be mentioned as the teacher of Pythagoras; he\nis of Syros, one of the Cyclades islands. He is said to have drawn\nwater from a spring, and to have learned therefrom that an earthquake\nwould take place in three days; he is also said to have predicted of\na ship in full sail that it would go down, and it sank in a moment.\nTheopompus in Diogenes Laertius (I. 116), relates of this Pherecydes\nthat \u201che first wrote to the Greeks about Nature and the gods\u201d (which\nwas before said of Anaximander). His writings are said to have been in\nprose, and from what is related of them it is clear that it must have\nbeen a theogony of which he wrote. The first words, still preserved\nto us, are: \u201cJupiter and Time and what is terrestrial (_\u03c7\u03b8\u03ce\u03bd_) were\nfrom eternity (_\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b5\u03af_); the name of earthly (_\u03c7\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u1fc3_) was given\nto the terrestrial sphere when Zeus granted to it gifts.\u201d[29] How it\ngoes on is not known, but this cannot be deemed a great loss. Hermias\ntells us only this besides:[30] \u201cHe maintained Zeus or Fire (_\u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1_),\nEarth and Chronos or Time as principles\u2014fire as active, earth as\npassive, and time as that in which everything originates.\u201d Diogenes of\nApollonia, Hippasus, and Archelaus are also called Ionic philosophers,\nbut we know nothing more of them than their names, and that they gave\ntheir adherence to one principle or the other.\nWe shall leave these now and go on to Pythagoras, who was a\ncontemporary of Anaximander; but the continuity of the development of\nthe principle of physical philosophy necessitated our taking Anaximenes\nwith him. We see that, as Aristotle said, they placed the first\nprinciple in a form of matter\u2014in air and water first, and then, if\nwe may so define Anaximander\u2019s matter, in an essence finer than water\nand coarser than air. Heraclitus, of whom we have soon to speak, first\ncalled it fire. \u201cBut no one,\u201d as Aristotle (Metaph. I. 8) remarks,\n\u201ccalled earth the principle, because it appears to be the most complex\nelement\u201d (_\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd_); for it seems to be an aggregate of\nmany units. Water, on the contrary, is the one, and it is transparent;\nit manifests in sensuous guise the form of unity with itself, and this\nis also so with air, fire, matter, &c. The principle has to be one,\nand hence must have inherent unity with itself; if it shows a manifold\nnature as does the earth, it is not one with itself, but manifold. This\nis what we have to say about the early Ionic Philosophy. The importance\nof these poor abstract thoughts lies (_a_) in the comprehension of a\nuniversal substance in everything, and (_b_) in the fact that it is\nformless, and not encumbered by sensuous ideas.\nNo one recognized better the deficiencies in this philosophy than\ndid Aristotle in the work already quoted. Two points appear in his\ncriticism of these three modes of determining the absolute: \u201cThose who\nmaintain the original principle to be matter fall short in many ways.\nIn the first place, they merely give the corporeal element and not the\nincorporeal, for there also is such.\u201d In treating of nature in order\nto show its essence, it is necessary to deal with it in its entirety,\nand everything found in it must be considered. That is certainly but an\nempirical instance. Aristotle maintains the incorporeal to be a form of\nthings opposed to the material, and indicates that the absolute must\nnot be determined in a one-sided manner; because the principle of these\nphilosophers is material only, they do not manifest the incorporeal\nside, nor is the object shown to be Notion. Matter is indeed itself\nimmaterial as this reflection into consciousness; but such philosophers\ndo not know that what they express is an existence of consciousness.\nThus the first great defect here rests in the fact that the universal\nis expressed in a particular form.\nSecondly, Aristotle says (Metaph. I. 3): \u201cFrom this it may be seen\nthat first cause has only been by all these expressed in the form of\nmatter. But because they proceeded thus, the thing itself opened out\ntheir way for them, and forced them into further investigation. For\nwhether origin and decay are derived from one or more, the question\nalike arises, \u2018How does it happen and what is the cause of it?\u2019 For\nthe fundamental substance (_\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd_) does not make itself to\nchange, just as neither wood nor metal are themselves the cause of\nchange; wood neither forms a bed nor does brass a statue, but something\nelse is the cause of the change. To investigate this, however, is\nto investigate the other principle, which, as we would say, is the\nPrinciple of Motion.\u201d This criticism holds good even now, where the\nAbsolute is represented as the one fixed substance. Aristotle says\nthat change is not conceivable out of matter as such, or out of water\nnot itself having motion; he reproaches the older philosophers for\nthe fact that they have not investigated the principle of motion for\nwhich men care most. Further, object is altogether absent; there is no\ndetermination of activity. Hence Aristotle says in the former passage:\n\u201cIn that they undertake to give the cause of origin and decay, they in\nfact remove the cause of movement. Because they make the principle to\nbe a simple body (earth being excepted), they do not comprehend the\nmutual origination and decay whereby the one arises out of the other:\nI am here referring to water, air, fire, and earth. This origination\nis to be shown as separation or as union, and hence the contradiction\ncomes about that one in time comes earlier than the other. That is,\nbecause this kind of origination is the method which they have adopted,\nthe way taken is from the simple universal, through the particular, to\nthe individual as what comes latest. Water, air, and fire are, however,\nuniversal. Fire seems to be most suitable for this element, seeing that\nit is the most subtle. Thus those who made it to be the principle, most\nadequately gave expression to this method (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u1ff3_) of origination; and\nothers thought very similarly. For else why should no one have made the\nearth an element, in conformity with the popular idea? Hesiod says that\nit was the original body\u2014so ancient and so common was this idea. But\nwhat in Becoming comes later, is the first in nature.\u201d However, these\nphilosophers did not understand this so, because they were ruled by the\nprocess of Becoming only, without again sublating it, or knowing that\nfirst formal universal as such, and manifesting the third, the totality\nor unity of matter and form, as essence. Here, we see, the Absolute is\nnot yet the self-determining, the Notion turned back into itself, but\nonly a dead abstraction; the moderns were the first, says Aristotle,\n(Metaph. I. 6; III. 3) to understand the fundamental principle more in\nthe form of genus.\nWe are able to follow the three moments in the Ionic philosophy:\n(_\u03b1_) The original essence is water; (_\u03b2_) Anaximander\u2019s infinite is\ndescriptive of movement, simple going out of and coming back into the\nsimple, universal aspects of form\u2014condensation and rarefaction; (_\u03b3_)\nthe air is compared to the soul. It is now requisite that what is\nviewed as reality should be brought into the Notion; in so doing we see\nthat the moments of division, condensation, and rarefaction are not in\nany way antagonistic to the Notion. This transition to Pythagoras, or\nthe manifestation of the real side as the ideal, is Thought breaking\nfree from what is sensuous, and, therefore, it is a separation between\nthe intelligible and the real.\nB. PYTHAGORAS AND THE PYTHAGOREANS.\nThe later Neo-Pythagoreans have written many extensive biographies\nof Pythagoras, and are especially diffuse as regards the Pythagorean\nbrotherhood. But it must be taken into consideration that these often\ndistorted statements must not be regarded as historical. The life of\nPythagoras thus first comes to us in history through the medium of the\nideas belonging to the first centuries after Christ, and more or less\nin the style in which the life of Christ is written, on the ground of\nordinary actuality, and not in a poetic atmosphere; it appears to be\nthe intermingling of many marvellous and extravagant tales, and to\ntake its origin in part from eastern ideas and in part from western.\nIn acknowledging the remarkable nature of his life and genius and of\nthe life which he inculcated on his followers, it was added that his\ndealings were not with right things, and that he was a magician and\none who had intercourse with higher beings. All the ideas of magic,\nthat medley of unnatural and natural, the mysteries which pervade\na clouded, miserable imagination, and the wild ideas of distorted\nbrains, have attached themselves to him.\nHowever corrupt the history of his life, his philosophy is as much so.\nEverything engendered by Christian melancholy and love of allegory\nhas been identified with it. The treatment of Plato in Christian\ntimes has quite a different character. Numbers have been much used\nas the expression of ideas, and this on the one hand has a semblance\nof profundity. For the fact that another significance than that\nimmediately presented is implied in them, is evident at once; but how\nmuch there is within them is neither known by him who speaks nor by\nhim, who seeks to understand; it is like the witches\u2019 rhyme (one time\none) in Goethe\u2019s \u201cFaust.\u201d The less clear the thoughts, the deeper they\nappear; what is most essential, but most difficult, the expression\nof oneself in definite conceptions, is omitted. Thus Pythagoras\u2019\nphilosophy, since much has been added to it by those who wrote of it,\nmay similarly appear as the mysterious product of minds as shallow\nand empty as they are dark. Fortunately, however, we have a special\nknowledge of the theoretic, speculative side of it, and that, indeed,\nfrom Aristotle and Sextus Empiricus, who have taken considerable\ntrouble with it. Although later Pythagoreans disparage Aristotle on\naccount of his exposition, he has a place above any such disparagement,\nand therefore to them no attention must be given.\nIn later times a quantity of writings were disseminated and foisted\nupon Pythagoras. Diogenes Laertius (VIII. 6, 7) mentions many which\nwere by him, and others which were set down to him in order to obtain\nauthority for them. But in the first place we have no writings by\nPythagoras, and secondly it is doubtful whether any ever did exist.\nWe have quotations from these in unsatisfactory fragments, not from\nPythagoras, but from Pythagoreans. It cannot be decisively determined\nwhich developments and interpretations belonged to the ancients and\nwhich to the moderns; yet with Pythagoras and the ancient Pythagoreans\nthe determinations were not worked out in so concrete a way as later.\nAs to the life of Pythagoras, we hear from Diogenes Laertius (VIII.\n1-3, 45) that he flourished about the 60th Olympiad (540 B.C.). His\nbirth is usually placed in the 49th or 50th Olympiad (584 B.C.); by\nLarcher in Tennemann (Vol. I., pp. 413, 414), much earlier\u2014in the\n43rd Olympiad (43, 1, i.e. 608 B.C.). He was thus contemporaneous with\nThales and Anaximander. If Thales\u2019 birth were in the 38th Olympiad\nand that of Pythagoras in the 43rd, Pythagoras was only twenty-one\nyears younger than he; he either only differed by a couple of years\nfrom Anaximander (Ol. 42, 3) in age, or the latter was twenty-six\nyears older. Anaximenes was from twenty to twenty-five years younger\nthan Pythagoras. His birthplace was the Island of Samos, and hence he\nbelonged to the Greeks of Asia Minor, which place we have hitherto\nfound to be the seat of philosophy. Pythagoras is said by Herodotus\n(IV., 93 to 96) to have been the son of Mnesarchus, with whom Zalmoxis\nserved as slave in Samos; Zalmoxis obtained freedom and riches, became\nruler of the Get\u00e6, and asserted that he and his people would not die.\nHe built a subterranean habitation and there withdrew himself from\nhis subjects; after four years he re-appeared;[31] hence the Getans\nbelieved in immortality. Herodotus thinks, however, that Zalmoxis was\nundoubtedly much older than Pythagoras.\nHis youth was spent at the court of Polycrates, under whose rule Samos\nwas brought, not only to wealth, but also to the possession of culture\nand art. In this prosperous period, according to Herodotus (III., 39),\nit possessed a fleet of a hundred ships. His father was an artist or\nengraver, but reports vary as to this, as also as to his country, some\nsaying that his family was of Tyrrhenian origin and did not go to Samos\ntill after Pythagoras\u2019 birth. That may be as it will, for his youth\nwas spent in Samos and he must hence have been naturalized there, and\nto it he belongs. He soon journeyed to the main land of Asia Minor\nand is said there to have become acquainted with Thales. From thence\nhe travelled to Ph\u0153nicia and Egypt, as Iamblichus (III., 13, 14) says\nin his biography of Pythagoras. With both countries Asia Minor had\nmany links, commercial and political, and it is related that he was\nrecommended by Polycrates to King Amasis, who, according to Herodotus\n(II. 154), attracted many Greeks to the country, and had Greek troops\nand colonies. The narratives of further journeys into the interior\nof Asia, to the Persian magicians and Indians, seem to be altogether\nfabulous, although travelling, then as now, was considered to be a\nmeans of culture. As Pythagoras travelled with a scientific purpose, it\nis said that he had himself initiated into nearly all the mysteries of\nGreeks and of Barbarians, and thus he obtained admission into the order\nor caste of the Egyptian priesthood.\nThese mysteries that we meet with amongst the Greeks, and which are\nheld to be the sources of much wisdom, appear in their religion to have\nstood in the relationship of doctrine to worship. This last existed in\nofferings and solemn festivals only, but to ordinary conceptions, to\na consciousness of these conceptions, there is no transition visible\nunless they were preserved in poems as traditions. The doctrines\nthemselves, or the act of bringing the actual home to the conception,\nseems to have been confined to the mysteries; we find it to be the\ncase, however, that it is not only the ideas as in our teaching, but\nalso the body that is laid claim to\u2014that there was brought home to man\nby sending him to wander amongst his fellow-men, both the abandonment\nof his sensuous consciousness and the purification and sanctification\nof the body. Of philosophic matter, however, there is as little openly\ndeclared as possible, and just as we know the system of freemasonry,\nthere is no secret in those mysteries.\nHis alliance with the Egyptian priesthood had a most important\ninfluence upon Pythagoras, not through the derivation of profound\nspeculative wisdom therefrom, but by the idea obtained through it of\nthe realization of the moral consciousness of man; the individual, he\nlearned, must attend to himself, if inwardly and to the outer world\nhe is to be meritorious and to bring himself, morally formed and\nfashioned, into actuality. This is a conception which he subsequently\ncarried out, and it is as interesting a matter as his speculative\nphilosophy. Just as the priests constituted a particular rank and\nwere educated for it, they also had a special rule, which was binding\nthroughout the whole moral life. From Egypt Pythagoras thus without\ndoubt brought the idea of his Order, which was a regular community\nbrought together for purposes of scientific and moral culture, which\nendured during the whole of life. Egypt at that time was regarded as\na highly cultured country, and it was so when compared with Greece;\nthis is shown even in the differences of caste which assumes a division\namongst the great branches of life and work, such as the industrial,\nscientific and religious. But beyond this, we need not seek great\nscientific knowledge amongst the Egyptians, nor think that Pythagoras\ngot his science there. Aristotle (Metaph. I.) only says that \u201cin Egypt\nmathematical sciences first commenced, for there the nation of priests\nhad leisure.\u201d[32]\nPythagoras stayed a long time in Egypt, and returned from thence\nto Samos; but he found the internal affairs of his own country in\nconfusion, and left it soon after. According to Herodotus\u2019 account\n(III. 45-47), Polycrates had\u2014not as tyrant\u2014banished many citizens\nfrom Samos, who sought and found support amongst the Laced\u00e6monians, and\na civil war had broken out. The Spartans had, at an earlier period,\ngiven assistance to the others, for, as Thucydides says (I. 18), to\nthem thanks were generally ascribed for having abolished the rule of\nthe few, and caused a reversion to the system of giving public power to\nthe people; later on they did the opposite, abolishing democracy and\nintroducing aristocracy. Pythagoras\u2019 family was necessarily involved in\nthese unpleasant relations, and a condition of internal strife was not\ncongenial to Pythagoras, seeing that he no longer took an interest in\npolitical life, and that he saw in it an unsuitable soil for carrying\nout his plans. He traversed Greece, and betook himself from thence to\nItaly, in the lower parts of which Greek colonies from various states\nand for various motives had settled, and there flourished as important\ntrading towns, rich in people and possessions.\nIn Crotona he settled down, and lived in independence, neither as\na statesman, warrior, nor political law-giver to the people, so\nfar as external life was concerned, but as a public teacher, with\nthe provision that his teaching should not be taken up with mere\nconviction, but should also regulate the whole moral life of the\nindividual. Diogenes Laertius says that he first gave himself the name\n_\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2_, instead of _\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2_; and men called this modesty, as if he\nthereby expressed, not the possession of wisdom, but only the struggle\ntowards it, as towards an end which cannot be attained.[33] But _\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2_\nat the same time means a wise man, who is also practical, and that\nnot in his own interest only, for that requires no wisdom, seeing\nthat every sincere and moral man does what is best from his own point\nof view. Thus _\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2_ signifies more particularly the opposite\nto participation in practical matters, that is in public affairs.\nPhilosophy is thus not the love of wisdom, as of something which one\nsets oneself to acquire; it is no unfulfilled desire. _\u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2_\nmeans a man whose relation to wisdom is that of making it his object;\nthis relationship is contemplation, and not mere Being; but it must\nbe consciously that men apply themselves to this. The man who likes\nwine (_\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2_) is certainly to be distinguished from the man who is\nfull of wine, or a drunkard. Then does _\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2_ signify only a futile\naspiration for wine?\nWhat Pythagoras contrived and effected in Italy is told us by later\neulogists, rather than by historians. In the history of Pythagoras by\nMalchus (this was the Syrian name of Porphyry) many strange things\nare related, and with the Neo-Platonists the contrast between their\ndeep insight and their belief in the miraculous is surprising. For\ninstance, seeing that the later biographers of Pythagoras had already\nrelated a quantity of marvels, they now proceeded to add yet more to\nthese with reference to his appearance in Italy. It appears that they\nwere exerting themselves to place him, as they afterwards did with\nApollonius of Tyana, in opposition to Christ. For the wonders which\nthey tell of him seem partly to be an amplification of those in the\nNew Testament, and in part they are altogether absurd. For instance,\nthey make Pythagoras begin his career in Italy with a miracle. When he\nlanded in the Bay of Tarentum, at Crotona, he encountered fishermen on\nthe way to the town who had caught nothing. He called upon them to draw\ntheir nets once more, and foretold the number of fishes that would be\nfound in them. The fishermen, marvelling at this prophecy, promised\nhim that if it came true they would do whatever he desired. It came to\npass as he said, and Pythagoras then desired them to throw the fishes\nalive back into the sea, for the Pythagoreans ate no flesh. And it is\nfurther related as a miracle which then took place, that none of the\nfishes whilst they were out of the water died during the counting. This\nis the kind of miracle that is recorded, and the stories with which\nhis biographers fill his life are of the same silly nature. They then\nmake him effect such a general impression upon the mind of Italy, that\nall the towns reformed upon their luxurious and depraved customs, and\nthe tyrants partly gave up their powers voluntarily, and partly they\nwere driven out. They thereby, however, commit such historical errors\nas to make Charondas and Zaleucus, who lived long before Pythagoras,\nhis disciples; and similarly to ascribe the expulsion and death of the\ntyrant Phalaris to him, and to his action.[34]\nApart from these fables, there remains as an historic fact, the great\nwork which he accomplished, and this he did chiefly by establishing\na school, and by the great influence of his order upon the principal\npart of the Greco-Italian states, or rather by means of the rule\nwhich was exercised in these states through this order, which lasted\nfor a very long period of time. It is related of him that he was a\nvery handsome man, and of a majestic appearance, which captivated as\nmuch as it commanded respect. With this natural dignity, nobility of\nmanners, and the calm propriety of his demeanour, he united external\npeculiarities, through which he seemed a remarkable and mysterious\nbeing. He wore a white linen garment, and refrained from partaking of\ncertain foods.[35] Particular personality, as also the externalities of\ndress and the like, are no longer of importance; men let themselves be\nguided by general custom and fashion, since it is a matter outside of\nand indifferent to them not to have their own will here; for we hand\nover the contingent to the contingent, and only follow the external\nrationality that consists in identity and universality. To this outward\npersonality there was added great eloquence and profound perception;\nnot only did he undertake to impart this to his individual friends, but\nhe proceeded to bring a general influence to bear on public culture,\nboth in regard to understanding and to the whole manner of life and\nmorals. He not merely instructed his friends, but associated them in a\nparticular life in order to constitute them into persons and make them\nskilful in business and eminent in morals. The Institute of Pythagoras\ngrew into a league, which included all men and all life in its embrace;\nfor it was an elaborately fashioned piece of work, and excellently\nplastic in design.\nOf the regulations of Pythagoras\u2019 league, we have descriptions from\nhis successors, more especially from the Neo-Platonists, who are\nparticularly diffuse as regards its laws. The league had, on the\nwhole, the character of a voluntary priesthood, or a monastic order\nof modern times. Whoever wished to be received was proved in respect\nof his education and obedience, and information was collected about\nhis conduct, inclinations, and occupations. The members were subject\nto a special training, in which a difference was made amongst those\nreceived, in that some were exoteric and some esoteric. These last were\ninitiated into the highest branches of science, and since political\noperations were not excluded from the order, they were also engaged\nin active politics; the former had to go through a novitiate of five\nyears. Each member must have surrendered his means to the order, but he\nreceived them again on retiring, and in the probationary period silence\nwas enjoined (_\u1f10\u03c7\u03b5\u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03b1_).[36]\nThis obligation to cease from idle talk may be called an essential\ncondition for all culture and learning; with it men must begin if\nthey wish to comprehend the thoughts of others and relinquish their\nown ideas. We are in the habit of saying that the understanding is\ncultivated through questioning, objecting and replying, &c., but, in\nfact, it is not thus formed, but made from without. What is inward\nin man is by culture got at and developed; hence though he remains\nsilent, he is none the poorer in thought or denser of mind. He rather\nacquires thereby the power of apprehension, and comes to know that his\nideas and objections are valueless; and as he learns that such ideas\nare valueless, he ceases to have them. Now the fact that in Pythagoras\nthere is a separation between those in the course of preparation and\nthose initiated, as also that silence is particularly enjoined, seems\nmost certainly to indicate that in his brotherhood both were formal\nelements and not merely as present in the nature of things, as might\noccur spontaneously in the individual without any special law or the\napplication of any particular consideration. But here it is important\nto remark that Pythagoras may be regarded as the first instructor\nin Greece who introduced the teachings of science; neither Thales,\nwho was earlier than he, nor his contemporary Anaximander taught\nscientifically, but only imparted their ideas to their friends. There\nwere, generally speaking, no sciences at that time; there was neither a\nscience of philosophy, mathematics, jurisprudence or anything else, but\nmerely isolated propositions and facts respecting these subjects. What\nwas taught was the use of arms, theorems, music, the singing of Homer\u2019s\nor Hesiod\u2019s songs, tripod chants, &c., or other arts. This teaching\nis accomplished in quite another way. Now if we said that Pythagoras\nhad introduced the teaching of science amongst a people who, though\nlike the Greeks, untaught therein, were not stupid but most lively,\ncultured and loquacious, the external conditions of such teaching might\nin so far be given as follows:\u2014(_\u03b1_) He would distinguish amongst\nthose who as yet had no idea of the process of learning a science, so\nthat those who first began should be excluded from that which was to\nbe imparted to those further on; and (_\u03b2_) he would make them leave\nthe unscientific mode of speaking of such matters, or their idle\nprattle, alone, and for the first time study science. But the fact\nthat this action both appeared to be formal and likewise required to\nbe made such, was, on account of its unwonted character, a necessary\none, just because the followers of Pythagoras were not only numerous,\nnecessitating a definite form and order, but also, generally speaking,\nthey lived continually together. Thus a particular form was natural to\nPythagoras, because it was the very first time that a teacher in Greece\narrived at a totality, or a new principle, through the cultivation of\nthe intelligence, mind and will. This common life had not only the\neducational side and that founded on the exercise of physical ingenuity\nor skill, but included also that of the moral culture of practical men.\nBut even now everything relating to morality appears and is or becomes\naltogether formal, or rather this is so in as far as it is consciously\nthought of as in this relation, for to be formal is to be universal,\nthat which is opposed to the individual. It appears so particularly\nto him who compares the universal and the individual and consciously\nreflects over both, but this difference disappears for those living\ntherein, to whom it is ordinary habit.\nFinally, we have sufficient and full accounts of the outward forms\nobserved by the Pythagoreans in their common life and also of their\ndiscipline. For much of this, however, we are indebted to the\nimpressions of later writers. In the league, a life regulated in\nall respects was advocated. First of all, it is told us, that the\nmembers made themselves known by a similar dress\u2014the white linen of\nPythagoras. They had a very strict order for each day, of which each\nhour had its work. The morning, directly after rising, was set aside\nfor recalling to memory the history of the previous day, because what\nis to be done in the day depends chiefly on the previous day; similarly\nthe most constant self-examination was made the duty of the evening\nin order to find whether the deeds done in the day were right or\nwrong. True culture is not the vanity of directing so much attention to\noneself and occupying oneself with oneself as an individual, but the\nself-oblivion that absorbs oneself in the matter in hand and in the\nuniversal; it is this consideration of the thing in hand that is alone\nessential, while that dangerous, useless, anxious state does away with\nfreedom. They had also to learn by heart from Homer and from Hesiod;\nand all through the day they occupied themselves much with music\u2014one\nof the principal parts of Greek education and culture.[37] Gymnastic\nexercises in wrestling, racing, throwing, and so on, were with them\nalso enforced by rule. They dined together, and here, too, they had\npeculiar customs, but of these the accounts are different. Honey and\nbread were made their principal food, and water the principal, and\nindeed only, drink; they must thus have entirely refrained from eating\nmeat as being associated with metempsychosis. A distinction was also\nmade regarding vegetables\u2014beans, for example, being forbidden. On\naccount of this respect for beans, they were much derided, yet in the\nsubsequent destruction of the political league, several Pythagoreans,\nbeing pursued, preferred to die than to damage a field of beans.[38]\nThe order, the moral discipline which characterized them, the common\nintercourse of men, did not, however, endure long; for even in\nPythagoras\u2019 life-time the affairs of his league must have become\ninvolved, since he found enemies who forcibly overthrew him. He drew\ndown upon him, it is said, the envy of others, and was accused of\nthinking differently from what he seemed to indicate, and thus of\nhaving an _arri\u00e8re pens\u00e9e_. The real fact of the case was that the\nindividual belonged, not entirely to his town, but also to another.\nIn this catastrophe, Pythagoras himself, according to Tennemann (Vol.\nI. p. 414), met his death in the 69th Olympiad (504, B.C.) in a\nrising of the people against these aristocrats; but it is uncertain\nwhether it happened in Crotona or in Metapontum, or in a war between\nthe Syracusans and the Agrigentines. There is also much difference of\nopinion about the age of Pythagoras, for it is given sometimes as 80,\nand sometimes as 104.[39] For the rest, the unity of the Pythagorean\nschool, the friendship of the members, and the connecting bond of\nculture have even in later times remained, but not in the formal\ncharacter of a league, because what is external must pass away. The\nhistory of Magna Gr\u00e6cia is in general little known, but even in\nPlato\u2019s[40] time we find Pythagoreans appearing at the head of states\nor as a political power.\nThe Pythagorean brotherhood had no relation with Greek public and\nreligious life, and therefore could not endure for long: in Egypt and\nin Asia exclusiveness and priestly influence have their home, but\nGreece, in its freedom, could not let the Eastern separation of caste\nexist. Freedom here is the principle of civic life, but still it is\nnot yet determined as principle in the relations of public and private\nlaw. With us the individual is free since all are alike before the law;\ndiversity in customs, in political relations and opinions may thus\nexist, and must indeed so do in organic states. In democratic Greece,\non the contrary, manners, the external mode of life, necessarily\npreserved a certain similarity, and the stamp of similarity remained\nimpressed on these wider spheres; for the exceptional condition of the\nPythagoreans, who could not take their part as free citizens, but were\ndependent on the plans and ends of a combination and led an exclusive\nreligious life, there was no place in Greece. The preservation of the\nmysteries certainly belonged to the Eumolpid\u00e6, and other special forms\nof worship to other particular families, but they were not regarded\nin a political sense as of fixed and definite castes, but as priests\nusually are, politicians, citizens, men like their fellows; nor, as\nwith the Christians, was the separation of religious persons driven to\nthe extreme of monastic rule. In ordinary civic life in Greece, no one\ncould prosper or maintain his position who held peculiar principles,\nor even secrets, and differed in outward modes of life and clothing;\nfor what evidently united and distinguished them was their community\nof principles and life\u2014whether anything was good for the commonwealth\nor not, was by them publicly and openly discussed. The Greeks are\nabove having particular clothing, maintaining special customs of\nwashing, rising, practising music, and distinguishing between pure and\nimpure foods. This, they say, is partly the affair of the particular\nindividual and of his personal freedom, and has no common end in view,\nand partly it is a general custom and usage for everybody alike.\nWhat is most important to us is the Pythagorean philosophy\u2014not\nthe philosophy of Pythagoras so much as that of the Pythagoreans,\nas Aristotle and Sextus express it. The two must certainly be\ndistinguished, and from comparing what is given out as Pythagorean\ndoctrine, many anomalies and discrepancies become evident, as we shall\nsee. Plato bears the blame of having destroyed Pythagorean philosophy\nthrough absorbing what is Pythagorean in it into his own. But the\nPythagorean philosophy itself developed to a point which left it\nquite other than what at first it was. We hear of many followers of\nPythagoras in history who have arrived at this or that conclusion,\nsuch as Alcm\u00e6on and Philolaus; and we see in many cases the simple\nundeveloped form contrasted with the further stages of development in\nwhich thought comes forth in definiteness and power. We need, however,\ngo no further into the historical side of the distinction, for we\ncan only consider the Pythagorean philosophy generally; similarly\nwe must separate what is known to belong to the Neo-Platonists and\nNeo-Pythagoreans, and for this end we have sources to draw from which\nare earlier than this period, namely the express statements found in\nAristotle and Sextus.\nThe Pythagorean philosophy forms the transition from realistic to\nintellectual philosophy. The Ionic school said that essence or\nprinciple is a definite material. The next conclusion is (_\u03b1_)\nthat the absolute is not grasped in natural form, but as a thought\ndetermination. (_\u03b2_) Then it follows that determinations must\nbe posited while the beginning was altogether undetermined. The\nPythagorean philosophy has done both.\n1. _The System of Numbers_. Thus the original and simple proposition\nof the Pythagorean philosophy is, according to Aristotle (Metaph. I.\n5), \u201cthat number is the reality of things, and the constitution of the\nwhole universe in its determinations is an harmonious system of numbers\nand of their relations.\u201d In what sense is this statement to be taken?\nThe fundamental determination of number is its being a measure; if we\nsay that everything is quantitatively or qualitatively determined,\nthe size and measure is only one aspect or characteristic which is\npresent in everything, but the meaning here is that number itself is\nthe essence and the substance of things, and not alone their form.\nWhat first strikes us as surprising is the boldness of such language,\nwhich at once sets aside everything which to the ordinary idea is real\nand true, doing away with sensuous existence and making it to be the\ncreation of thought. Existence is expressed as something which is not\nsensuous, and thus what to the senses and to old ideas is altogether\nforeign, is raised into and expressed as substance and as true Being.\nBut at the same time the necessity is shown for making number to be\nlikewise Notion, to manifest it as the activity of its unity with\nBeing, for to us number does not seem to be in immediate unity with the\nNotion.\nNow although this principle appears to us to be fanciful and wild, we\nfind in it that number is not merely something sensuous, therefore it\nbrings determination with it, universal distinctions and antitheses.\nThe ancients had a very good knowledge of these. Aristotle (Metaph.\nI. 6) says of Plato: \u201cHe maintained that the mathematical elements in\nthings are found outside of what is merely sensuous, and of ideas,\nbeing between both; it differs from what is sensuous in that it\nis eternal and unchangeable, and from ideas, in that it possesses\nmultiplicity, and hence each can resemble and be similar to another,\nwhile each idea is for itself one alone.\u201d That is, number can be\nrepeated; thus it is not sensuous, and still not yet thought. In\nthe life of Pythagoras, this is further said by Malchus (46, 47):\n\u201cPythagoras propounded philosophy in this wise in order to loose\nthought from its fetters. Without thought nothing true can be discerned\nor known; thought hears and sees everything in itself, the rest is lame\nand blind. To obtain his end, Pythagoras makes use of mathematics,\nsince this stands midway between what is sensuous and thought, as a\nkind of preliminary to what is in and for itself.\u201d Malchus quotes\nfurther (48, 53) a passage from an early writer, Moderatus: \u201cBecause\nthe Pythagoreans could not clearly express the absolute and the first\nprinciples through thought, they made use of numbers, of mathematics,\nbecause in this form determinations could be easily expressed.\u201d For\ninstance, similarity could be expressed as one, dissimilarity as two.\n\u201cThis mode of teaching through the use of numbers, whilst it was the\nfirst philosophy, is superseded on account of its mysterious nature.\nPlato, Speusippus, Aristotle, &c., have stolen the fruits of their work\nfrom the Pythagoreans by making a simple use of their principle.\u201d In\nthis passage a perfect knowledge of numbers is evident.\nThe enigmatic character of the determination through number is what\nmost engages our attention. The numbers of arithmetic answers to\nthought-determinations, for number has the \u201cone\u201d as element and\nprinciple; the one, however, is a category of being-for-self, and\nthus of identity with self, in that it excludes all else and is\nindifferent to what is \u201cother.\u201d The further determinations of number\nare only further combinations and repetitions of the one, which all\nthrough remains fixed and external; number, thus, is the most utterly\ndead, notionless continuity possible; it is an entirely external and\nmechanical process, which is without necessity. Hence number is not\nimmediate Notion, but only a beginning of thought, and a beginning in\nthe worst possible way; it is the Notion in its extremest externality,\nin quantitative form, and in that of indifferent distinction. In so\nfar, the one has within itself both the principle of thought and\nthat of materiality, or the determination of the sensuous. In order\nthat anything should have the form of Notion, it must immediately in\nitself, as determined, relate itself to its opposite, just as positive\nis related to negative; and in this simple movement of the Notion we\nfind the ideality of differences and negation of independence to be\nthe chief determination. On the other hand, in the number three, for\ninstance, there are always three units, of which each is independent;\nand this is what constitutes both their defect and their enigmatic\ncharacter. For since the essence of the Notion is innate, numbers are\nthe most worthless instruments for expressing Notion-determinations.\nNow the Pythagoreans did not accept numbers in this indifferent way,\nbut as Notion. \u201cAt least they say that phenomena must be composed of\nsimple elements, and it would be contrary to the nature of things if\nthe principle of the universe pertained to sensuous phenomena. The\nelements and principles are thus not only intangible and invisible, but\naltogether incorporeal.\u201d[41] But how they have come to make numbers\nthe original principle or the absolute Notion, is better shown from\nwhat Aristotle says in his Metaphysics (I. 5), although he is shorter\nthan he would have been, because he alleges that elsewhere (infra., p.\n214) he has spoken of it. \u201cIn numbers they thought that they perceived\nmuch greater similitude to what is and what takes place than in fire,\nwater, or earth; since a certain property of numbers (_\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2_)\nis justice, so is it with (_\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u1f76_) the soul and understanding;\nanother property is opportunity, and so on. Since they further saw the\nconditions and relations of what is harmonious present in numbers, and\nsince numbers are at the basis of all natural things, they considered\nnumbers to be the elements of everything, and the whole heavens to\nbe a harmony and number.\u201d In the Pythagoreans we see the necessity\nfor one enduring universal idea as a thought-determination. Aristotle\n(Met. XII. 4), speaking of ideas, says: \u201cAccording to Heraclitus,\neverything sensuous flows on, and thus there cannot be a science of the\nsensuous; from this conviction the doctrine of ideas sprang. Socrates\nis the first to define the universal through inductive methods; the\nPythagoreans formerly concerned themselves merely with a few matters\nof which they derived the notions from numbers\u2014as, for example, with\nwhat opportuneness, or right, or marriage are.\u201d It is impossible to\ndiscern what interest this in itself can have; the only thing which\nis necessary for us as regards the Pythagoreans, is to recognize any\nindications of the Idea, in which there may be a progressive principle.\nThis is the whole of the Pythagorean philosophy taken generally. We now\nhave to come to closer quarters, and to consider the determinations,\nor universal significance. In the Pythagorean system numbers seem\npartly to be themselves allied to categories\u2014that is, to be at\nonce the thought-determinations of unity, of opposition and of the\nunity of these two moments. In part, the Pythagoreans from the\nvery first gave forth universal ideal determinations of numbers as\nprinciples, and recognized, as Aristotle remarks (Metaph. I. 5), as\nthe absolute principles of things, not so much immediate numbers in\ntheir arithmetic differences, as the principles of number, _i.e._ their\nrational differences. The first determination is unity generally, the\nnext duality or opposition. It is most important to trace back the\ninfinitely manifold nature of the forms and determinations of finality\nto their universal thoughts as the most simple principles of all\ndetermination. These are not differences of one thing from another,\nbut universal and essential differences within themselves. Empirical\nobjects distinguish themselves by outward form; this piece of paper\ncan be distinguished from another, shades are different in colour,\nmen are separated by differences of temperament and individuality.\nBut these determinations are not essential differences; they are\ncertainly essential for the definite particularity of the things,\nbut the whole particularity defined is not an existence which is in\nand for itself essential, for it is the universal alone which is the\nself-contained and the substantial. Pythagoras began to seek these\nfirst determinations of unity, multiplicity, opposition, &c. With him\nthey are for the most part numbers; but the Pythagoreans did not remain\ncontent with this, for they gave them the more concrete determinations,\nwhich really belong to their successors. Necessary progression and\nproof are not to be sought for here; comprehension, the development\nof duality out of unity are wanting. Universal determinations are\nonly found and established in a quite dogmatic form, and hence the\ndeterminations are dry, destitute of process or dialectic, and\nstationary.\na. The Pythagoreans say that the first simple Notion is unity\n(_\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c2_); not the discrete, multifarious, arithmetic one, but identity\nas continuity and positivity, the entirely universal essence. They\nfurther say, according to Sextus (adv. Math. X. 260, 261): \u201cAll\nnumbers come under the Notion of the one; for duality is one duality\nand triplicity is equally a \u2018one,\u2019 but the number ten is the one chief\nnumber. This moved Pythagoras to assert unity to be the principle of\nthings, because, through partaking of it, each is called one.\u201d That\nis to say, the pure contemplation of the implicit being of a thing\nis the one, the being like self; to all else it is not implicit,\nbut a relationship to what is other. Things, however, are much more\ndetermined than being merely this dry \u201cone.\u201d The Pythagoreans have\nexpressed this remarkable relationship of the entirely abstract one\nto the concrete existence of things through \u201csimulation\u201d (_\u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2_).\nThe same difficulty which they here encounter is also found in Plato\u2019s\nIdeas; since they stand over against the concrete as species, the\nrelation of concrete to universal is naturally an important point.\nAristotle (Metaph. I. 6) ascribes the expression \u201cparticipation\u201d\n(_\u03bc\u03ad\u03b8\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c2_) to Plato, who took it in place of the Pythagorean\nexpression \u201csimulation.\u201d Simulation is a figurative, childish way of\nputting the relationship; participation is undoubtedly more definite.\nBut Aristotle says, with justice, that both are insufficient; that\nPlato has not here arrived at any further development, but has only\nsubstituted another name. \u201cTo say that ideas are prototypes and that\nother things participate in them is empty talk and a poetic metaphor;\nfor what is the active principle that looks upon the ideas?\u201d (Metaph.\nI. 9). Simulation and participation are nothing more than other names\nfor relation; to give names is easy, but it is another thing to\ncomprehend.\nb. What comes next is the opposition, the duality (_\u03b4\u03c5\u03ac\u03c2_), the\ndistinction, the particular; such determinations have value even now in\nPhilosophy; Pythagoras merely brought them first to consciousness. Now,\nas this unity relates to multiplicity, or this being-like-self to being\nanother, different applications are possible, and the Pythagoreans\nhave expressed themselves variously as to the forms which this first\nopposition takes.\n(_\u03b1_) They said, according to Aristotle (Metaph. I. 5): \u201cThe elements\nof number are the even and the odd; the latter is the finite\u201d (or\nprinciple of limitation) \u201cand the former is the infinite; thus the\nunity proceeds from both and out of this again comes number.\u201d The\nelements of immediate number are not yet themselves numbers: the\nopposition of these elements first appears in arithmetical form rather\nthan as thought. But the one is as yet no number, because as yet it is\nnot quantity; unity and quantity belong to number. Theon of Smyrna[42]\nsays: \u201cAristotle gives, in his writings on the Pythagoreans, the reason\nwhy, in their view, the one partakes of the nature of even and odd;\nthat is, one, posited as even, makes odd; as odd, it makes even. This\nis what it could not do unless it partook of both natures, for which\nreason they also called the one, even-odd\u201d (_\u1f00\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd_).\n(_\u03b2_) If we follow the absolute Idea in this first mode, the opposition\nwill also be called the undetermined duality (_\u1f00\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c5\u03ac\u03c2_). Sextus\nspeaks more definitely (adv. Math. X. 261, 262) as follows: \u201cUnity,\nthought of in its identity with itself (_\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u0313 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2_), is\nunity; if this adds itself to itself as something different (_\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u0313\n\u1f11\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1_), undetermined duality results, because no one of the\ndetermined or otherwise limited numbers is this duality, but all are\nknown through their participation in it, as has been said of unity.\nThere are, according to this, two principles in things; the first\nunity, through participation in which all number-units are units,\nand also undetermined duality through participation in which all\ndetermined dualities are dualities.\u201d Duality is just as essential a\nmoment in the Notion as is unity. Comparing them with one another, we\nmay either consider the unity to be form and duality matter, or the\nother way; and both appear in different modes. (_\u03b1\u03b1_) Unity, as the\nbeing-like-self, is the formless; but in duality, as the unlike, there\ncomes division or form. (_\u03b2\u03b2_) If, on the other hand, we take form\nas the simple activity of absolute form, the one is what determines;\nand duality as the potentiality of multiplicity, or as multiplicity\nnot posited, is matter. Aristotle (Met. I. 6) says that it is\ncharacteristic of Plato that \u201che makes out of matter many, but with him\nthe form originates only once; whereas out of one matter only one table\nproceeds, whoever brings form to matter, in spite of its unity, makes\nmany tables.\u201d He also ascribes this to Plato, that \u201cinstead of showing\nthe undetermined to be simple (_\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f11\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2_), he made of\nit a duality\u2014the great and small.\u201d\n(_\u03b3_) Further consideration of this opposition, in which Pythagoreans\ndiffer from one another, shows us the imperfect beginning of a table\nof categories which were then brought forward by them, as later on by\nAristotle. Hence the latter was reproached for having borrowed these\nthought-determinations from them; and it certainly was the case that\nthe Pythagoreans first made the opposite to be an essential moment in\nthe absolute. They further determined the abstract and simple Notions,\nalthough it was in an inadequate way, since their table presents a\nmixture of antitheses in the ordinary idea and the Notion, without\nfollowing these up more fully. Aristotle (Met. I. 5) ascribes these\ndeterminations either to Pythagoras himself, or else to Alcm\u00e6on \u201cwho\nflourished in the time of Pythagoras\u2019 old age,\u201d so that \u201ceither Alcm\u00e6on\ntook them from the Pythagoreans or the latter took them from him.\u201d Of\nthese antitheses or co-ordinates to which all things are traced, ten\nare given, for, according to the Pythagoreans, ten is a number of great\nsignificance:\u2014\n1. The finite and the infinite.\n2. The odd and the even.\n3. The one and the many.\n4. The right and the left.\n5. The male and the female.\n6. The quiescent and the moving.\n7. The straight and the crooked.\n8. Light and darkness.\n9. Good and evil.\n10. The square and the parallelogram.\nThis is certainly an attempt towards a development of the Idea of\nspeculative philosophy in itself, _i.e._ in Notions; but the attempt\ndoes not seem to have gone further than this simple enumeration.\nIt is very important that at first only a collection of general\nthought-determinations should be made, as was done by Aristotle; but\nwhat we here see with the Pythagoreans is only a rude beginning of the\nfurther determination of antitheses, without order and sense, and very\nsimilar to the Indian enumeration of principles and substances.\n(_\u03b4_) We find the further progress of these determinations in Sextus\n(adv. Math. X. 262-277), when he speaks about an exposition of the\nlater Pythagoreans. It is a very good and well considered account of\nthe Pythagorean theories, which has some thought in it. The exposition\nfollows these lines: \u201cThe fact that these two principles are the\nprinciples of the whole, is shown by the Pythagoreans in manifold ways.\u201d\n\u05d0. \u201cThere are three methods of thinking things; firstly, in accordance\nwith diversity, secondly, with opposition, and thirdly, according\nto relation. (_\u03b1\u03b1_) What is considered in its mere diversity, is\nconsidered for itself; this is the case with those subjects in which\neach relates only to itself, such as horse, plant, earth, air, water\nand fire. Such matters are thought of as detached and not in relation\nto others.\u201d This is the determination of identity with self or of\nindependence. (_\u03b2\u03b2_) \u201cIn reference to opposition, the one is determined\nas evidently contrasting with the other; we have examples of this in\ngood and evil, right and wrong, sacred and profane, rest and movement,\n&c. (_\u03b3\u03b3_) According to relation (_\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9_), we have the object\nwhich is determined in accordance with its relationship to others,\nsuch as right and left, over and under, double and half. One is only\ncomprehensible from the other; for I cannot tell which is my left\nexcepting by my right.\u201d Each of these relations in its opposition,\nis likewise set up for itself in a position of independence. \u201cThe\ndifference between relationship and opposition is that in opposition\nthe coming into existence of the \u2018one\u2019 is at the expense of the\n\u2018other,\u2019 and conversely. If motion is taken away, rest commences; if\nmotion begins, rest ceases; if health is taken away, sickness begins,\nand conversely. In a condition of relationship, on the contrary, both\ntake their rise, and both similarly cease together; if the right\nis removed, so also is the left; the double goes and the half is\ndestroyed.\u201d What is here taken away is taken not only as regards its\nopposition, but also in its existence. \u201cA second difference is that\nwhat is in opposition has no middle; for example, between sickness and\nhealth, life and death, rest and motion, there is no third. Relativity,\non the contrary, has a middle, for between larger and smaller there\nis the like; and between too large and too small the right size is\nthe medium.\u201d Pure opposition passes through nullity to opposition;\nimmediate extremes, on the other hand, subsist in a third or middle\nstate, but in such a case no longer as opposed. This exposition shows\na certain regard for universal, logical determinations, which now and\nalways have the greatest possible importance, and are moments in all\nconceptions and in everything that is. The nature of these opposites\nis, indeed, not considered here, but it is of importance that they\nshould be brought to consciousness.\n\u05d1. \u201cNow since these three represent three different genera, the\nsubjects and the two-fold opposite, there must be a higher genus over\neach of them which takes the first place, since the genus comes before\nits subordinate kinds. If the universal is taken away, so is the kind;\non the other hand, if the kind, not the genus, for the former depends\non the latter, but not the contrary way.\u201d (_\u03b1\u03b1_) \u201cThe Pythagoreans have\ndeclared the one to be the highest genus of what is considered as in\nand for itself\u201d (of subjects in their diversity); this is, properly\nspeaking, nothing more than translating the determinations of the\nNotion into numbers. (_\u03b2\u03b2_) \u201cWhat is in opposition has, they say, as\nits genus the like and the unlike; rest is the like, for it is capable\nof nothing more and nothing less; but movement is the unlike. Thus\nwhat is according to nature is like itself; it is a point which is not\ncapable of being intensified (_\u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2_); what is opposed to it is\nunlike. Health is like, sickness is unlike. (_\u03b3\u03b3_) The genus of that\nwhich is in an indifferent relationship is excess and want, the more\nand the less;\u201d in this we have the quantitative relation just as we\nformerly had the qualitative.\n\u05d2. We now come for the first time to the two opposites: \u201cThese three\ngenera of what is for itself, in opposition and in relationship,\nmust now come under\u201d\u2014yet simpler, higher\u2014\u201cgenera,\u201d _i.e._\nthought-determinations. \u201cSimilarity reduces itself to the determination\nof unity.\u201d The genus of the subjects is the very being on its own\naccount. \u201cDissimilarity, however, consists of excess and want, but both\nof these come under undetermined duality;\u201d they are the undetermined\nopposition, opposition generally. \u201cThus from all these relationships\nthe first unity and the undetermined duality proceed;\u201d the Pythagoreans\nsaid that such are found to be the universal modes of things. \u201cFrom\nthese, there first comes the \u2018one\u2019 of numbers and the \u2018two\u2019 of numbers;\nfrom the first unity, the one; from the unity and the undetermined\nduality the two; for twice the one is two. The other numbers take their\norigin in a similar way, for the unity over moves forward, and the\nundetermined duality generates the two.\u201d This transition of qualitative\ninto quantitative opposition is not clear. \u201cHence underlying these\nprinciples, unity is the active principle\u201d or form, \u201cbut the two is\nthe passive matter; and just as they make numbers arise from them, so\ndo they make the system of the world and that which is contained in\nit.\u201d The nature of these determinations is to be found in transition\nand in movement. The deeper significance of this reflection rests in\nthe connection of universal thought-determinations with arithmetic\nnumbers\u2014in subordinating these and making the universal genus first.\nBefore I say anything of the further sequence of these numbers, it\nmust be remarked that they, as we see them represented here, are pure\nNotions. (_\u03b1_) The absolute, simple essence divides itself into unity\nand multiplicity, of which the one sublates the other, and at the same\ntime it has its existence in the opposition. (_\u03b2_) The opposition has\nat the same time subsistence, and in this is found the manifold nature\nof equivalent things. (_\u03b3_) The return of absolute essence into itself\nis the negative unity of the individual subject and of the universal\nor positive. This is, in fact, the pure speculative Idea of absolute\nexistence; it is this movement: with Plato the Idea is nothing else.\nThe speculative makes its appearance here as speculative; whoever does\nnot know the speculative, does not believe that in indicating simple\nNotions such as these, absolute essence is expressed. One, many, like,\nunlike, more or less, are trivial, empty, dry moments; that there\nshould be contained in them absolute essence, the riches and the\norganization of the natural, as of the spiritual world, does not seem\npossible to him who, accustomed to ordinary ideas, has not gone back\nfrom sensuous existence into thought. It does not seem to such a one\nthat God is, in a speculative sense, expressed thereby\u2014that what is\nmost sublime can be put in those common words, what is deepest, in\nwhat is so well known, self-evident and open, and what is richest, in\nthe poverty of these abstractions.\nIt is at first in opposition to common reality that this idea of\nreality as the manifold of simple essence, has in itself its opposition\nand the subsistence of the same; this essential, simple Notion of\nreality is elevation into thought, but it is not flight from what is\nreal, but the expression of the real itself in its essence. We here\nfind the Reason which expresses its essence; and absolute reality is\nunity immediately in itself. Thus it is pre-eminently in relation\nto this reality that the difficulties of those who do not think\nspeculatively have become so intense. What is its relation to common\nreality? What has taken place is just what happens with the Platonic\nIdeas, which approximate very closely to these numbers, or rather\nto pure Notions. That is to say, the first question is, \u201cNumbers,\nwhere are they? Dispersed through space, dwelling in independence in\nthe heaven of ideas? They are not things immediately in themselves,\nfor a thing, a substance, is something quite other than a number:\na body bears no similarity to it.\u201d To this we may answer that the\nPythagoreans did not signify anything like that which we understand\nby prototypes\u2014as if ideas, as the laws and relations of things,\nwere present in a creative consciousness as thoughts in the divine\nunderstanding, separated from things as are the thoughts of an artist\nfrom his work. Still less did they mean only subjective thoughts in our\nconsciousness, for we use the absolute antithesis as the explanation of\nthe existence of qualities in things, but what determines is the real\nsubstance of what exists, so that each thing is essentially just its\nhaving in it unity, duality, as also their antithesis and connection.\nAristotle (Met. I. 5, 6) puts it clearly thus: \u201cIt is characteristic of\nthe Pythagoreans that they did not maintain the finite and the infinite\nand the One, to be, like fire, earth, &c., different natures or to have\nanother reality than things; for the Infinite and the abstract One\nare to them, the substance of the things of which they are predicated.\nHence too, they said, Number is the essence of all things. Thus they\ndo not separate numbers from things, but consider them to be things\nthemselves. Number to them is the principle and matter of things, as\nalso their qualities and forces;\u201d hence it is thought as substance, or\nthe thing as it is in the reality of thought.\nThese abstract determinations then became more concretely determined,\nespecially by the later philosophers, in their speculations regarding\nGod. We may instance Iamblichus, for example, in the work _\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\n\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2_, ascribed to him by Porphyry and Nicomachus. Those\nphilosophers sought to raise the character of popular religion, for\nthey inserted such thought-determinations as these into religious\nconceptions. By Monas they understood nothing other than God; they also\ncall it Mind, the Hermaphrodite (which contains both determinations,\nodd as well as even), and likewise substance, reason, chaos (because it\nis undetermined), Tartarus, Jupiter, and Form. They called the duad by\nsimilar names, such as matter, and then the principle of the unlike,\nstrife, that which begets, Isis, &c.\nc. The triad (_\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2_) has now become a most important number,\nseeing that in it the monad has reached reality and perfection. The\nmonad proceeds through the duad, and again brought into unity with\nthis undetermined manifold, it is the triad. Unity and multiplicity\nare present in the triad in the worst possible way\u2014as an external\ncombination; but however abstractly this is understood, the triad\nis still a profound form. The triad then is held to be the first\nperfect form in the universal. Aristotle (De C\u0153lo I. 1) puts this\nvery clearly: \u201cThe corporeal has no dimension outside of the Three;\nhence the Pythagoreans also say that the all and everything is\ndetermined through triplicity,\u201d that is, it has absolute form. \u201cFor\nthe number of the whole has end, middle, and beginning; and this\nis the triad.\u201d Nevertheless there is something superficial in the\nwish to bring everything under it, as is done in the systematization\nof the more modern natural philosophy. \u201cTherefore we, too, taking\nthis determination from nature, make use of it in the worship of the\ngods, so that we believe them to have been properly apostrophized\nonly when we have called upon them three times in prayer. Two we call\nboth, but not all; we speak first of three as all. What is determined\nthrough three is the first totality (_\u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd_); what is in triple form\nis perfectly divided. Some is merely in one, other is only in two,\nbut this is All.\u201d What is perfect, or has reality, is its identity,\nopposition and unity, like number generally; but in triplicity this\nis actual, because it has beginning, middle, and end. Each thing is\nsimple as beginning; it is other or manifold as middle, and its end\nis the return of its other nature into unity or mind; if we take this\ntriplicity from a thing, we negate it and make of it an abstract\nconstruction of thought.\nIt is now comprehensible that Christians sought and found the Trinity\nin this threefold nature. It has often been made a superficial reason\nfor objecting to them; sometimes the idea of the Trinity as it was\npresent to the ancients, was considered as above reason, as a secret,\nand hence, too high; sometimes it was deemed too absurd. But from the\none cause or from the other, they did not wish to bring it into closer\nrelation to reason. If there is a meaning in this Trinity, we must try\nto understand it. It would be an anomalous thing if there were nothing\nin what has for two thousand years been the holiest Christian idea; if\nit were too holy to be brought down to the level of reason, or were\nsomething now quite obsolete, so that it would be contrary to good\ntaste and sense to try to find a meaning in it. It is the Notion of the\nTrinity alone of which we can speak, and not of the idea of Father and\nSon, for we am not dealing with these natural relationships.\nd. The Four (_\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2_) is the triad but more developed, and hence with\nthe Pythagoreans it held a high position. That the tetrad should be\nconsidered to be thus complete, reminds one of the four elements, the\nphysical and the chemical, the four continents, &c. In nature four\nis found to be present everywhere, and hence this number is even now\nequally esteemed in natural philosophy. As the square of two, the\nfourfold is the perfection of the two-fold in as far as it\u2014only having\nitself as determination, i.e. being multiplied with itself\u2014returns\ninto identity with itself. But in the triad the tetrad is in so far\ncontained, as that the former is the unity, the other-being, and\nthe union of both these moments, and thus, since the difference, as\nposited, is a double, if we count it, four moments result. To make this\nclearer, the tetrad is comprehended as the _\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03cd\u03c2_, the efficient,\nactive four (from _\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1_ and _\u1f04\u03b3\u03c9_); and afterwards this is by the\nPythagoreans made the most notable number. In the fragments of a poem\nof Empedocles, who originally was a Pythagorean, it is shown in what\nhigh regard this tetraktus, as represented by Pythagoras, was held:\n\u201cIf thou dost this,\nIt will lead thee in the path of holy piety. I swear it\nBy the one who to our spirit has given the Tetraktus,\nWhich has in it eternal nature\u2019s source and root.\u201d[43]\ne. From this the Pythagoreans proceed to the ten, another form of this\ntetrad. As the four is the perfect form of three, this fourfold, thus\nperfected and developed so that all its moments shall be accepted as\nreal differences, is the number ten (_\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03c2_), the real tetrad. Sextus\n(adv. Math. IV. 3; VII. 94, 95) says: \u201cTetraktus means the number\nwhich, comprising within itself the four first numbers, forms the most\nperfect number, that is the number ten; for one and two and three and\nfour make ten. When we come to ten, we again consider it as a unity\nand begin once more from the beginning. The tetraktus, it is said,\nhas the source and root of eternal nature within itself, because it\nis the Logos of the universe, of the spiritual and of the corporeal.\u201d\nIt is an important work of thought to show the moments not merely to\nbe four units, but complete numbers; but the reality in which the\ndeterminations are laid hold of, is here, however, only the external\nand superficial one of number; there is no Notion present although\nthe tetraktus does not mean number so much as idea. One of the later\nphilosophers, Proclus, (in Tim\u00e6um, p. 269) says, in a Pythagorean\nhymn:\u2014\n\u201cThe divine number goes on,\u201d...\n\u201cTill from the still unprofaned sanctuary of the Monad\nIt reaches to the holy Tetrad, which creates the mother of all that\nis;\nWhich received all within itself, or formed the ancient bounds of all,\nIncapable of turning or of wearying; men call it the holy Dekad.\u201d\nWhat we find about the progression of the other numbers is more\nindefinite and unsatisfying, and the Notion loses itself in them. Up to\nfive there may certainly be a kind of thought in numbers, but from six\nonwards they are merely arbitrary determinations.\n2. _Application of the System to the Universe_. This simple idea and\nthe simple reality contained therein, must now, however, be further\ndeveloped in order to come to reality as it is when put together and\nexpanded. The question now meets us as to how, in this relation, the\nPythagoreans passed from abstract logical determinations to forms which\nindicate the concrete use of numbers. In what pertains to space or\nmusic, determinations of objects formed by the Pythagoreans through\nnumbers, still bear a somewhat closer relation to the thing, but when\nthey enter the region of the concrete in nature and in mind, numbers\nbecome purely formal and empty.\na. To show how the Pythagoreans constructed out of numbers the\nsystem of the world, Sextus instances (adv. Math. X. 277-283), space\nrelations, and undoubtedly we have in them to do with such ideal\nprinciples, for numbers are, in fact, perfect determinations of\nabstract space. That is to say, if we begin with the point, the first\nnegation of vacuity, \u201cthe point corresponds to unity; it is indivisible\nand the principle of lines, as the unity is that of numbers. While\nthe point exists as the monad or One, the line expresses the duad or\nTwo, for both become comprehensible through transition; the line is\nthe pure relationship of two points and is without breadth. Surface\nresults from the threefold; but the solid figure or body belongs to\nthe fourfold, and in it there are three dimensions present. Others say\nthat body consists of one point\u201d (_i.e._ its essence is one point),\n\u201cfor the flowing point makes the line, the flowing line, however, makes\nsurface, and this surface makes body. They distinguish themselves from\nthe first mentioned, in that the former make numbers primarily proceed\nfrom the monad and the undetermined duad, and then points and lines,\nplane surfaces and solid figures, from numbers, while they construct\nall from one point.\u201d To the first, distinction is opposition or form\nset forth as duality; the others have form as activity. \u201cThus what is\ncorporeal is formed under the directing influence of numbers, but from\nthem also proceed the definite bodies, water, air, fire, and the whole\nuniverse generally, which they declare to be harmonious. This harmony\nis one which again consists of numeral relations only, which constitute\nthe various concords of the absolute harmony.\u201d\nWe must here remark that the progression from the point to actual space\nalso has the signification of occupation of space, for \u201caccording to\ntheir fundamental tenets and teaching,\u201d says Aristotle (Metaph. I. 8),\n\u201cthey speak of sensuously perceptible bodies in nowise differently\nfrom those which are mathematical.\u201d Since lines and surfaces are only\nabstract moments in space, external construction likewise proceeds from\nhere very well. On the other hand, the transition from the occupation\nof space generally to what is determined, to water, earth, &c., is\nquite another thing and is more difficult; or rather the Pythagoreans\nhave not taken this step, for the universe itself has, with them,\nthe speculative, simple form, which is found in the fact of being\nrepresented as a system of number-relations. But with all this, the\nphysical is not yet determined.\nb. Another application or exhibition of the essential nature of the\ndetermination of numbers is to be found in the relations of music,\nand it is more especially in their case that number constitutes\nthe determining factor. The differences here show themselves as\nvarious relations of numbers, and this mode of determining what is\nmusical is the only one. The relation borne by tones to one another\nis founded on quantitative differences whereby harmonies may be\nformed, in distinction to others by which discords are constituted.\nThe Pythagoreans, according to Porphyry (De vita Pyth. 30), treated\nmusic as something soul-instructing and scholastic [Psychagogisches\nund P\u00e4dagogisches]. Pythagoras was the first to discern that musical\nrelations, these audible differences, are mathematically determinable,\nthat what we hear as consonance and dissonance is a mathematical\narrangement. The subjective, and, in the case of hearing, simple\nfeeling which, however, exists inherently in relation, Pythagoras has\njustified to the understanding, and he attained his object by means\nof fixed determinations. For to him the discovery of the fundamental\ntones of harmony are ascribed, and these rest on the most simple\nnumber-relations. Iamblichus (De vita Pyth. XXVI. 115) says that\nPythagoras, in passing by the workshop of a smith, observed the strokes\nthat gave forth a particular chord; he then took into consideration\nthe weight of the hammer giving forth a certain harmony, and from that\ndetermined mathematically the tone as related thereto.[44] And finally\nhe applied the same, and experimented in strings, by which means there\nwere three different relations presented to him\u2014Diapason, Diapente,\nand Diatessaron. It is known that the tone of a string, or, in the wind\ninstrument, of its equivalent, the column of air in a reed, depends on\nthree conditions; on its length, on its thickness, and on the amount\nof tension. Now if we have two strings of equal thickness and length,\na difference in tension brings about a difference in sound. If we want\nto know what tone any string has, we have only to consider its tension,\nand this may be measured by the weight depending from the string,\nby means of which it is extended. Pythagoras here found that if one\nstring were weighted with twelve pounds, and another with six (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2\n\u03b4\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2_, 1 : 2) it would produce the musical chord of the octave\n(_\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bd_); the proportion of 8 : 12, or of 2 : 3 (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u03b9\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2_)\nwould give the chord of the fifth (_\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5_); the proportion of 9\n: 12, or 3 : 4 (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2_), the fourth (_\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd_).[45]\nA different number of vibrations in like times determines the height\nand depth of the tone, and this number is likewise proportionate to\nthe weight, if thickness and length are equal. In the first case, the\nmore distended string makes as many vibrations again as the other;\nin the second case, it makes three vibrations for the other\u2019s two,\nand so it goes on. Here number is the real factor which determines\nthe difference, for tone, as the vibration of a body, is only a\nquantitatively determined quiver or movement, that is, a determination\nmade through space and time. For there can be no determination for the\ndifference excepting that of number or the amount of vibrations in one\ntime; and hence a determination made through numbers is nowhere more\nin place than here. There certainly are also qualitative differences,\nsuch as those existing between the tones of metals and catgut strings,\nand between the human voice and wind instruments; but the peculiar\nmusical relation borne by the tone of one instrument to another, in\nwhich harmony is to be found, is a relationship of numbers.\nFrom this point the Pythagoreans enter into further applications of\nthe theory of music, in which we cannot follow them. The _\u00e0 priori_\nlaw of progression, and the necessity of movement in number-relations,\nis a matter which is entirely dark; minds confused may wander about at\nwill, for everywhere ideas are hinted at, and superficial harmonies\npresent themselves and disappear again. But in all that treats of the\nfurther construction of the universe as a numerical system, we have\nthe whole extent of the confusion and turbidity of thought belonging\nto the later Pythagoreans. We cannot say how much pains they took\nto express philosophic thought in a system of numbers, and also to\nunderstand the expressions given utterance to by others, and to put in\nthem all the meaning possible. When they determined the physical and\nthe moral universe by means of numbers, everything came into indefinite\nand insipid relationships in which the Notion disappeared. In this\nmatter, however, so far as the older Pythagoreans are concerned, we\nare acquainted with the main principles only. Plato exemplifies to us\nthe conception of the universe as a system of numbers, but Cicero and\nthe ancients always call these numbers the Platonic, and it does not\nappear that they were ascribed to the Pythagoreans. It was thus later\non that this came to be said; even in Cicero\u2019s time they had become\nproverbially dark, and there is but little after all that is really old.\nc. The Pythagoreans further constructed the heavenly bodies of the\nvisible universe by means of numbers, and here we see at once the\nbarrenness and abstraction present in the determination of numbers.\nAristotle says (Met. I. 5), \u201cBecause they defined numbers to be\nthe principles of all nature, they brought under numbers and their\nrelationships all determinations and all sections, both of the heavens\nand of all nature; and where anything did not altogether conform, they\nsought to supply the deficiency in order to bring about a harmony.\nFor instance, as the Ten or dekad appeared to them to be the perfect\nnumber, or that which embraces the whole essence of numbers, they\nsaid that the spheres moving in the heavens must be ten; but as only\nnine of these are visible, they made out a tenth, the Antichthone\n(_\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1_).\u201d These nine are, first the milky way, or the fixed\nstars, and after that the seven stars which were then all held to be\nplanets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Sun, Moon, and in\nthe last and ninth place, the Earth. The tenth is thus the Antichthone,\nand in regard to this it must remain uncertain whether the Pythagoreans\nconsidered it to be the side of the Earth which is turned away, or as\nquite another body.\nAristotle says, in reference to the specially physical character of\nthese spheres (De c\u0153lo II. 13 and 9), \u201cFire was by the Pythagoreans\nplaced in the middle, but the Earth was made a star that moved around\nthis central body in a circle.\u201d This circle is, then, a sphere, which,\nas the most perfect of figures, corresponds to the dekad. We here\nfind a certain similarity to our ideas of the solar system, but the\nPythagoreans did not believe the fire to be the sun. \u201cThey thus,\u201d says\nAristotle, \u201crely, not on sensuous appearance, but on reasons,\u201d just as\nwe form conclusions in accordance with reasons as opposed to sensuous\nappearances; and indeed this comes to us still as the first example of\nthings being in themselves different from what they appear. \u201cThis fire,\nthat which is in the centre, they called Jupiter\u2019s place of watch.\nNow these ten spheres make, like all that is in motion, a tone; but\neach makes a different one, according to the difference in its size\nand velocity. This is determined by means of the different distances,\nwhich bear an harmonious relationship to one another, in accordance\nwith musical intervals; by this means an harmonious sound arises in the\nmoving spheres\u201d\u2014a universal chorus.\nWe must acknowledge the grandeur of this idea of determining everything\nin the system of the heavenly spheres through number-relations which\nhave a necessary connection amongst themselves, and have to be\nconceived of as thus necessarily related; it is a system of relations\nwhich must also form the basis and essence of what can be heard, or\nmusic. We have, comprehended here in thought, a system of the universe;\nthe solar system is alone rational to us, for the other stars are\ndevoid of interest. To say that there is music in the spheres, and\nthat these movements are tones, may seem just as comprehensible to us\nas to say that the sun is still and the earth moves, although both are\nopposed to the dictates of sense. For, seeing that we do not see the\nmovement, it may be that we do not hear the notes. And there is little\ndifficulty in imagining a universal silence in these vast spheres,\nsince we do not hear the chorus, but it is more difficult to give a\nreason for not hearing this music. The Pythagoreans say, according to\nthe last quoted passage of Aristotle, that we do not hear it because\nwe live in it, like the smith who gets accustomed to the blows of\nhis hammer. Since it belongs to our substance and is identical with\nourselves, nothing else, such as silence, by which we might know\nthe other, comes into relationship with us, for we are conceived of\nas entirely within the movement. But the movement does not become a\ntone, in the first place, because pure space and time, the elements in\nmovement, can only raise themselves into a proper voice, unstimulated\nfrom without, in an animate body, and movement first reaches this\ndefinite, characteristic individuality in the animal proper; and, in\nthe next place, because the heavenly bodies are not related to one\nanother as bodies whose sound requires for its production, contact,\nfriction, or shock, in response to which, and as the negation of its\nparticularity its own momentary individuality resounds in elasticity;\nfor heavenly bodies are independent of one another, and have only a\ngeneral, non-individual, free motion.\nWe may thus set aside sound; the music of the spheres is indeed a\nwonderful conception, but it is devoid of any real interest for us.\nIf we retain the conception that motion, as measure, is a necessarily\nconnected system of numbers, as the only rational part of the theory,\nwe must maintain that nothing further has transpired to the present\nday. In a certain way, indeed, we have made an advance upon Pythagoras.\nWe have learned from Kepler about laws, about eccentricity, and the\nrelation of distances to the times of revolution, but no amount of\nmathematics has as yet been able to give us the laws of progression\nin the harmony through which the distances are determined. We know\nempirical numbers well enough, but everything has the semblance of\naccident and not of necessity. We are acquainted with an approximate\nrule of distances, and thus have correctly foretold the existence\nof planets where Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, &c., were afterwards\ndiscovered\u2014that is, between Mars and Jupiter. But astronomy has not as\nyet found in it a consistent sequence in which there is rationality;\non the other hand, it even looks with disdain on the appearance of\nregularity presented by this sequence, which is, however, on its own\naccount, a most important matter, and one which should not be forgotten.\nd. The Pythagoreans also applied their principle to the Soul, and\nthus determined what is spiritual as number. Aristotle (De anim. I.\n2) goes on to tell that they thought that solar corpuscles are soul,\nothers, that it is what moves them; they adopted this idea because\nthe corpuscles are ever moving, even in perfect stillness, and hence\nthey must have motion of their own. This does not signify much, but\nit is evident from it that the determination of self-movement was\nsought for in the soul. The Pythagoreans made a further application\nof number-conceptions to the soul after another form, which Aristotle\ndescribes in the same place as follows:\u2014\u201cThought is the one, knowledge\nor science is the two, for it comes alone out of the one. The number\nof the plane is popular idea, opinion; the number of the corporeal\nis sensuous feeling. Everything is judged of either by thought, or\nscience, or opinion, or feeling.\u201d In these ideas, which we must,\nhowever, ascribe to later Pythagoreans, we may undoubtedly find some\nadequacy, for while thought is pure universality, knowledge deals with\nsomething \u201cother,\u201d since it gives itself a determination and a content;\nbut feeling is the most developed in its determinateness. \u201cNow because\nthe soul moves itself, it is the self-moving number,\u201d yet we never find\nit said that it is connected with the monad.\nThis is a simple relationship to number-determinations. Aristotle\ninstances (De anim. I. 3) one more intricate from Tim\u00e6us: \u201cThe soul\nmoves itself, and hence also the body because it is bound up with body;\nit consists of elements and is divided according to harmonic numbers,\nand hence it has feeling and an immediately indwelling (_\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd_)\nharmony. In order that the whole may have an harmonious movement,\nTim\u00e6us has bent the straight line of harmony (_\u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u03c5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd_) into a\ncircle, and again divided off from the whole circle two circles,\nwhich are doubly connected; and the one of these circles is again\ndivided into seven circles, so that the movements of the soul may\nresemble those of the heavens.\u201d The more definite significance of these\nideas Aristotle unfortunately has not given; they contain a profound\nknowledge of the harmony of the whole, but yet they are forms which\nthemselves remain dark, because they are clumsy and unsuitable. There\nis always a forcible turning and twisting, a struggle with the material\npart of the representation, as there is in mythical and distorted\nforms: nothing has the pliability of thought but thought itself. It\nis remarkable that the Pythagoreans have grasped the soul as a system\nwhich is a counterpart of the system of the heavens. In Plato\u2019s Tim\u00e6us\nthis same idea is more definitely brought forward. Plato also gives\nfurther number-relations, but not their significance as well; even to\nthe present day no one has been able to make any particular sense out\nof them. An arrangement of numbers such as this is easy, but to give to\nit a real significance is difficult, and, when done, it always must be\narbitrary.\nThere is still something worthy of attention in what is said by the\nPythagoreans in reference to the soul, and this is their doctrine\nof the transmigration of souls. Cicero (Tusc. Qu\u00e6st. I. 16) says:\n\u201cPherecydes, the teacher of Pythagoras, first said that the souls\nof men were immortal.\u201d The doctrine of the transmigration of souls\nextends even to India, and, without doubt, Pythagoras took it from\nthe Egyptians; indeed Herodotus (II. 123) expressly says so. After he\nspeaks of the mythical ideas of the Egyptians as to the lower world,\nhe continues: \u201cThe Egyptians were the first to say that the soul of\nman is immortal, and that, when the body disappears, it goes into\nanother living being; and when it has gone through all the animals of\nland and sea, and likewise birds, it again takes the body of a man,\nthe period being completed in 3000 years.\u201d Diogenes Laertius says in\nthis connection (VIII. 14) that the soul, according to Pythagoras, goes\nthrough a circle. \u201cThese ideas,\u201d proceeds Herodotus, \u201care also found\namongst the Greeks; there are some who, earlier or later, have made\nuse of this particular doctrine, and have spoken of it as if it were\ntheir own; I know their names very well, but I will not mention them.\u201d\nHe undoubtedly meant Pythagoras and his followers. In the sequel,\nmuch that is given utterance to is fictitious: \u201cPythagoras himself\nis said to have stated that his former personality was known to him.\nHermes granted him a knowledge of his circumstances before his birth.\nHe lived as the son of Hermes, \u00c6thalides, and then in the Trojan\nwar as Euphorbus, the son of Panthous, who killed Patroclus, and was\nkilled by Menelaus; in the third place he was Hermotimus; fourthly,\nPyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos; in all he lived 207 years. Euphorbus\u2019\nshield was offered up to Apollo by Menelaus, and Pythagoras went to the\ntemple and, from the mouldering shield, showed the existence of signs,\nhitherto not known of, by which it was recognized.\u201d[46] We shall not\ntreat further of these very various and foolish stories.\nAs in the case of the brotherhood copied from the Egyptian priesthood,\nso must we here set aside this oriental and un-Greek idea of the\ntransmigration of souls. Both were too far removed from the Greek\nspirit to have had a place and a development there. With the Greeks,\nthe consciousness of a higher, freer individuality has become too\nstrong to allow any permanence to the idea of metempsychosis, according\nto which, man, this independent and self-sufficing Being, takes the\nform of a beast. They have, indeed, the conception of men as becoming\nsprings of water, trees, animals, &c., but the idea of degradation\nwhich comes as a consequence of sin, lies at its root. Aristotle (De\nanim. I. 3) shortly and in his own manner deals with and annihilates\nthis idea of the Pythagoreans. \u201cThey do not say for what reason soul\ndwells in body, nor how the latter is related to it. For owing to\ntheir unity of nature when one acts the other suffers: one moves and\nthe other is moved, but none of this happens in what is mutually\ncontingent. According to the Pythagorean myths any soul takes to any\nbody, which is much like making architects take to flutes. For crafts\nmust necessarily have tools and soul body; but each tool must have\nits proper form and kind.\u201d It is implied in the transmigration of\nsouls that the organization of the body is something accidental to\nthe human soul; this refutation by Aristotle is complete. The eternal\nidea of metempsychosis had philosophic interest only as the inner\nNotion permeating all these forms, the oriental unity which appears in\neverything; we have not got this signification here, or at best we have\nbut a glimmering of it. If we say that the particular soul is, as a\ndefinite thing, to wander about throughout all, we find firstly, that\nthe soul is not a thing such as Leibnitz\u2019 Monad, which, like a bubble\nin the cup of coffee, is possibly a sentient, thinking soul; in the\nsecond place an empty identity of the soul-thing such as this has no\ninterest in relation to immortality.\n3. _Practical Philosophy_. As regards the practical philosophy of\nPythagoras, which is closely connected with what has gone before, there\nis but little that is philosophic known to us. Aristotle (Magn. Moral.\nI. 1) says of him that \u201che first sought to speak of virtue, but not in\nthe right way, for, because he deduced the virtues from numbers, he\ncould not form of them any proper theory.\u201d The Pythagoreans adopted ten\nvirtues as well as ten heavenly spheres. Justice, amongst others, is\ndescribed as the number which is like itself in like manner (_\u1f34\u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2\n\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2_); it is an even number, which remains even when multiplied with\nitself. Justice is pre-eminently what remains like itself; but this\nis an altogether abstract determination, which applies to much that\nis, and which does not exhaust the concrete, thus remaining quite\nindeterminate.\nUnder the name of the \u201cGolden words,\u201d we have a collection of\nhexameters which are a succession of moral reflections, but which are\nrightly ascribed to later Pythagoreans. They are old, well-known, moral\nmaxims, which are expressed in a simple and dignified way, but which\ndo not contain anything remarkable. They begin with the direction \u201cto\nhonour the immortal gods as they are by law established,\u201d and further,\n\u201cHonour the oath and then the illustrious heroes;\u201d elsewhere they go\non to direct \u201chonour to be paid to parents and to relatives,\u201d &c.[47]\nSuch matter does not deserve to be regarded as philosophy, although it\nis of importance in the process of development.\nThe transition from the form of outward morals to morality as existent,\nis more important. As in Thales\u2019 time, law-givers and administrators\nof states were preeminent in possessing a physical philosophy, so we\nsee that with Pythagoras practical philosophy is advocated as the means\nof constituting a moral life. There we have the speculative Idea,\nthe absolute essence, in its reality, and in a definite, sensuous\nexistence; and similarly the moral life is submerged in actuality\nas the universal spirit of a people, and as their laws and rule. In\nPythagoras, on the contrary, we have the reality of absolute essence\nraised, in speculation, out of sensuous reality, and expressed, though\nstill imperfectly, as the essence of thought. Morality is likewise\npartly raised out of actuality as ordinarily known; it is certainly a\nmoral disposition of all actuality, but as a brotherhood, and not as\nthe life of a people. The Pythagorean League is an arbitrary existence\nand not a part of the constitution recognized by public sanction; and\nin his person Pythagoras isolated himself as teacher, as he also did\nhis followers. The universal consciousness, the spirit of a people, is\nthe substance of which the accident is the individual consciousness;\nthe speculative is thus the fact that pure, universal law is absolute,\nindividual consciousness, so that this last, because it draws therefrom\nits growth and nourishment, becomes universal self-consciousness. These\ntwo sides do not, however, come to us in the form of the opposition;\nit is first of all in morality that there is properly this Notion of\nthe absolute individuality of consciousness which does everything on\nits own account. But we see that it was really present to the mind\nof Pythagoras that the substance of morality is the universal, from\nan example in Diogenes Laertius (VIII. 16). \u201cA Pythagorean answered\nto the question of a father who inquired as to the best education he\ncould give his son, that it should be that which would make him the\ncitizen of a well-regulated State.\u201d This answer is great and true; to\nthe great principle of living in the spirit of one\u2019s people, all other\ncircumstances are subordinate. Nowadays men try to keep education free\nfrom the spirit of the times, but they cannot withdraw themselves\nfrom this supreme power, the State, for even if they try to separate\nthemselves, they unconsciously remain beneath this universal. The\nspeculative meaning of the practical philosophy of Pythagoras thus is,\nthat in this signification, the individual consciousness shall obtain\na moral reality in the brotherhood. But as number is a middle thing\nbetween the sensuous and Notion, the Pythagorean brotherhood is a\nmiddle between universal, actual morality and maintaining that in true\nmorality the individual, as an individual, is responsible for his own\nbehaviour; this morality ceases to be universal spirit. If we wish to\nsee practical philosophy reappear, we shall find it; but, on the whole,\nwe shall not see it become really speculative until very recent times.\nWe may satisfy ourselves with this as giving us an idea of the\nPythagorean system. I will, however, shortly give the principal\npoints of the criticism which Aristotle (Met. I. 8) makes upon the\nPythagorean number-form. He says justly, in the first place: \u201cIf only\nthe limited and the unlimited, the even and odd are made fundamental\nideas, the Pythagoreans do not explain how movement arises, and how,\nwithout movement and change there can be coming into being and passing\naway, or the conditions and activities of heavenly objects.\u201d This\ndefect is significant; arithmetical numbers are dry forms and barren\nprinciples in which life and movement are deficient. Aristotle says\nsecondly, \u201cFrom number no other corporeal determinations, such as\nweight and lightness, are conceivable;\u201d or number thus cannot pass\ninto what is concrete. \u201cThey say that there is no number outside of\nthose in the heavenly spheres.\u201d For instance, a heavenly sphere and\na virtue, or a natural manifestation in the earth, are determined as\none and the same number. Each of the first numbers may be exhibited\nin each thing or quality; but in so far as number is made to express\na further determination, this quite abstract, quantitative difference\nbecomes altogether formal; it is as if the plant were five because it\nhas five stamens. This is just as superficial as are determination\nthrough elements or through particular portions of the globe; it is a\nmethod as formal as that by which men now try to apply the categories\nof electricity, magnetism, galvanism, compression and expansion, of\nmanly and of womanly, to everything. It is a purely empty system of\ndetermination where reality should be dealt with.\nTo Pythagoras and his disciples there are, moreover, many scientific\nconclusions and discoveries ascribed, which, however, do not concern us\nat all. Thus, according to Diogenes Laertius (VIII. 14, 27), he is said\nto have known that the morning and evening star is the same, and that\nthe moon derives her light from the sun. We have already mentioned what\nhe says of music. But what is best known is the Pythagorean Theorem;\nit really is the main proposition in geometry, and cannot be regarded\nlike any other theorem. According to Diogenes, (VIII. 12), Pythagoras,\non discovering the theorem, sacrificed a hecatomb, so important did he\nthink it; and it may indeed seem remarkable that his joy should have\ngone so far as to ordain a great feast to which rich men and all the\npeople were invited. It was worth the trouble; it was a rejoicing, a\nfeast of spiritual cognition\u2014at the cost of the oxen.\nOther ideas which are brought forward by the Pythagoreans casually and\nwithout any connection, have no philosophic interest, and need only\nbe mentioned. Aristotle, for instance, says (Phys. IV. 6) that \u201cthe\nPythagoreans believed in an empty space which the heavens inspire, and\nan empty space which separates natural things and brings about the\ndistinction between continuous and discrete; it first exists in numbers\nand makes them to be different.\u201d Diogenes Laertius (VIII. 26-28) says\nmuch more, all of which is dull; this is like the later writers,\nwho, generally speaking, take up what is external and devoid of any\nintellectual meaning. \u201cThe air which encircles the earth is immovable\u201d\n(_\u1f04\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd_, at least through itself) \u201cand diseased, and all that is\nin it is mortal; but what is highest is in continual movement, pure\nand healthy, and in it everything is immortal\u2014divine. Sun, moon and\nthe other stars are gods, for in them warmth has predominance and is\nthe cause of life. Man is related to the gods because he participates\nin warmth, and hence God cares for us. A ray penetrates from the sun\nthrough the thick and cold ether and gives life to everything; they\ncall air, cold ether, the sea and moisture, thick ether. The soul is a\ndetached portion of ether.\u201d\nC. THE ELEATIC SCHOOL.\nThe Pythagorean philosophy has not yet got the speculative form of\nexpression for the Notion. Numbers are not pure Notion, but Notion in\nthe form of ordinary idea or sensuous perception, and hence a mixture\nof both. This expression of absolute essence in what is a pure Notion\nor something thought, and the movement of the Notion or of Thought,\nis that which we find must come next, and this we discover in the\nEleatic school. In it we see thought becoming free for itself; and in\nthat which the Eleatics express as absolute essence, we see Thought\ngrasp itself in purity, and the movement of Thought in Notions. In\nthe physical philosophy we saw movement represented as an objective\nmovement, as an origination and passing away. The Pythagoreans\nsimilarly did not reflect upon these Notions, and also treated their\nessence, Number, as fleeting. But since alteration is now grasped in\nits highest abstraction as Nothing, this objective movement changes\ninto a subjective one, comes over to the side of consciousness, and\nexistence becomes the unmoved. We here find the beginning of dialectic,\n_i.e._ simply the pure movement of thought in Notions; likewise we\nsee the opposition of thought to outward appearance or sensuous\nBeing, or of that which is implicit to the being-for-another of this\nimplicitness, and in the objective existence we see the contradiction\nwhich it has in itself, or dialectic proper. When we reflect in\nanticipation on how the course of pure thought must be formed, we\nfind (_\u03b1_) that pure thought (pure Being, the One) manifests itself\nimmediately in its rigid isolation and self-identity, and everything\nelse as null; (_\u03b2_) that the hitherto timid thought\u2014which after it\nis strengthened, ascribes value to the \u201cother\u201d and constitutes itself\ntherefrom\u2014shows that it then grasps the other in its simplicity and\neven in so doing shows its nullity; (_\u03b3_) finally, Thought manifests\nthe other in the manifold nature of its determinations. We shall see\nthis in the development and culture of the Eleatics in history. These\nEleatic propositions still have interest for Philosophy, and are\nmoments which must necessarily there appear.\nXenophanes, Parmenides, Melissus and Zeno are to be reckoned as\nbelonging to this school. Xenophanes may be regarded as the founder\nof it; Parmenides is supposed to have been his pupil, and Melissus,\nand especially Zeno, are called the pupils of Parmenides. In fact,\nthey are to be taken together as forming the Eleatic school; later on\nit lost the name, being then called Sophistic, and its locality was\ntransferred to Greece proper. What Xenophanes began, Parmenides and\nMelissus developed further, and similarly Zeno perfected what these\ntwo taught. Aristotle (Metaph. I. 5) characterizes the first three\nthus: \u201cParmenides seems to comprehend the one as Notion (_\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd\n\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd_), Melissus as matter (_\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f55\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd_); hence the former says\nthat it is limited (_\u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd_) and the latter that it is unlimited\n(_\u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_). But Xenophanes, who was the first of them to express the\ntheory of the One, made the matter no plainer (_\u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd_), nor did\nhe deal with either of these aspects (_\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2_), but looking into the\nheavens\u201d\u2014as we say, into the blue\u2014\u201csaid, God is the One. Xenophanes\nand Melissus are on the whole less civilized (_\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9_);\nParmenides, however, is more acute (_\u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd_).\u201d There is less to\nsay of Xenophanes and Melissus, and what has come to us from the latter\nin particular\u2014in fragments and derived from the sayings of others\u2014is\nstill in a state of ferment, and in his case there is least knowledge\nobtainable. On the whole, philosophic utterances and Notions are still\npoor, and it was in Zeno that Philosophy first attained to a purer\nexpression of itself.\n1. XENOPHANES.\nThe period at which he lived is clear enough, and as this suffices,\nit is a matter of indifference that the year of his birth and of his\ndeath is unknown. According to Diogenes Laertius (IX. 18), he was\ncontemporary with Anaximander and Pythagoras. Of his circumstances\nfurther than this, it is only known that he, for reasons which are\nunknown, escaped from his native town, Colophon, in Asia Minor, to\nMagna Gr\u00e6cia, and resided for the most part at Zancle, (now Messina)\nand Catana (still called Catania) in Sicily. I find it nowhere said\nby the ancients that he lived at Elea, although all recent writers on\nthe history of Philosophy repeat it, one after the other. Tennemann,\nin particular, says (Vol. I. pp. 151 and 414), that about the 61st\nOlympiad (536 B.C.), he repaired from Colophon to Elea. Diogenes\nLaertius (IX. 20), however, only says that he flourished about the 60th\nOlympiad and that he made two thousand verses on the colonization of\nElea, from which it might be easily concluded that he was also born\nat Elea. Strabo says this in the beginning of his sixth book\u2014when\ndescribing Elea\u2014of Parmenides and Zeno only, and these he called\nPythagoreans; hence, according to Cicero (Acad. Qu\u00e6st. IV. 42) the\nEleatic school took its name from these two. Xenophanes was nearly a\nhundred years old, and lived to see the Median wars: it is said that he\nbecame so poor that he had not the means of having his children buried,\nand was obliged to do so with his own hands. Some say that he had no\nteacher; others name Archelaus, which is a chronological error.\nHe wrote a book \u201cOn Nature,\u201d the general subject and title of\nPhilosophy at that time; some verses have been preserved to us which so\nfar show no powers of reasoning. Professor Brandis of Bonn collected\nthem together, with the fragments of Parmenides and Melissus, under\nthe title \u201cCommentationum Eleaticarum, P. 1,\u201d Alton\u00e6, 1813. The older\nphilosophers wrote in verse, for prose comes much later on; on account\nof the awkward and confused mode of expression in Xenophanes\u2019 poems,\nCicero calls them (Acad. Qu\u00e6st. IV. 23): _minus boni versus_.\nAs to his philosophy, Xenophanes in the first place maintained absolute\nexistence to be the one, and likewise called this God. \u201cThe all is\nOne and God is implanted in all things; He is unchangeable, without\nbeginning, middle or end.\u201d[48] In some verses by Xenophanes found in\nClemens of Alexandria (Strom. V. 14, p. 714, ed. Potter), it is said:\n\u201cOne God is greatest amongst gods and men.\nNeither like unto mortals in spirit or in form;\u201d\nand in Sextus Empiricus (adv. Math. IX. 144):\n\u201cHe sees everywhere, thinks everywhere, and hears everywhere,\u201d\nto which words Diogenes Laertius (IX, 19) adds: \u201cThought and reason\nare everything and eternal.\u201d By this Xenophanes denied the truth of the\nconceptions of origination and of passing away, of change, movement,\n&c., seeing that they merely belong to sensuous perception. \u201cHe found,\u201d\nsays Tennemann (Vol. I. p. 156) \u201call origination to be inconceivable:\u201d\nthe One as the immediate product of pure thought, is, in its immediacy,\nBeing.\nFor us the determination of Being is already known and trivial, but\nif we know about Being, the One, we place this, as a particular\ndetermination, in a line with all the rest. Here, on the contrary, it\nsignifies that all else has no reality and is only a semblance. We\nmust forget our own ideas; we know of God as Spirit. But, because the\nGreeks only had before them the sensuous world, these gods of their\nimagination, and found in them no satisfaction, they rejected all\nas being untrue, and thus came to pure thought. This is a wonderful\nadvance, and thought thus becomes for the first time free for itself in\nthe Eleatic school. Being, the One of the Eleatic school, is just this\nimmersion in the abyss of the abstract identity of the understanding.\nJust as this comes first, so it also comes last, as that to which the\nunderstanding comes back, and this is proved in recent times when God\nis grasped only as the highest Being. If we say of God that this the\nhighest Being is outside of and over us, we can know nothing more of\nit but that it is, and thus it is the undetermined; for if we knew of\ndeterminations, this would be to possess knowledge. The truth then\nsimply is that God is the One, not in the sense that there is one God\n(this is another determination), but only that He is identical with\nHimself; in this there is no other determination, any more than in the\nutterance of the Eleatic school. Modern thought has, indeed, passed\nthrough a longer path, not only through what is sensuous, but also\nthrough philosophic ideas and predicates of God, to this all negating\nabstraction; but the content, the result arrived at is the same.\nWith this the dialectic reasoning of the Eleatics is closely connected\nin respect that they have also proved that nothing can originate or\npass away. This deduction is to be found in Aristotle\u2019s work, De\nXenophane, Zenone et Gorgia, c. 3. \u201cIt is impossible, he says,[49] that\nif anything is, it arises (and he even applies this to the Godhead);\nfor it must arise either from the like or from the unlike. But both are\nequally impossible: for it is no more probable that the like should be\nengendered from the like, than that it should engender it, for the like\nmust have determinations identical with one another.\u201d In acknowledging\nsimilarity, the distinction between begetting and begotten falls away.\n\u201cJust as little can unlike arise from unlike, for if from the weaker\nthe stronger takes its rise; or from the smaller, the greater; or from\nthe worse, the better: or if, conversely, the worse proceeds from the\nbetter, non-being would result from Being: this is impossible, and thus\nGod is eternal.\u201d The same thing has been expressed as Pantheism or\nSpinozaism, which rests on the proposition _ex nihilo fit nihil_. The\nunity of God is further proved by Xenophanes: \u201cIf God is the mightiest,\nHe must be One; for were He two or more, He would not have dominion\nover the others, but, not having dominion over the others, He could not\nbe God. Thus were there several, they would be relatively more powerful\nor weaker, and thus they would not be gods, for God\u2019s nature is to have\nnothing mightier than He. Were they equal, God would no longer possess\nthe quality of being the mightiest, for the like is neither worse nor\nbetter than the like\u201d\u2014or it does not differ therefrom. \u201cHence if\nGod is, and is such as this, He is only one; He could not, were there\nseveral, do what He willed. Since He is one, He is everywhere alike.\nHe hears, sees and has also the other senses everywhere, for were this\nnot the case, the parts of God would be one more powerful than the\nother, which is impossible. Since God is everywhere alike, He has a\nspherical form, for He is not here thus and elsewhere different, but is\neverywhere the same. Since He is eternal and one and spherical in form,\nHe is neither unlimited nor limited. To be unlimited is non-being;\nfor that has neither middle, beginning, end, nor part; and what is\nunlimited corresponds to this description. But whatever non-being is,\nBeing is not. Mutual limitation would take place if there were several,\nbut since there is only One, it is not limited. The one does not move\nitself, nor is it unmoved; to be unmoved is non-being, for to it none\nother comes, nor does it go into another; but to be moved must mean to\nbe several, for one must move into another. Thus the One neither rests\nnor is it moved, for it is neither non-being nor is it many. In all\nthis God is thus indicated; He is eternal and One, like Himself and\nspherical, neither unlimited nor limited, neither at rest nor moved.\u201d\nFrom this result, that nothing can arise from the like or from the\nunlike, Aristotle (De Xenophane, Zenone et Gorgia c. 4) draws this\nconclusion: \u201cthat either there is nothing excepting God, or all else is\neternal.\u201d\nWe here see a dialectic which may be called metaphysical reasoning, in\nwhich the principle of identity is fundamental. \u201cThe nothing is like\nnothing and does not pass into Being or conversely; thus nothing can\noriginate from like.\u201d This, the oldest mode of argument, holds its\nplace even to the present day, as, for example, in the so-called proof\nof the unity of God. This proceeding consists of making presuppositions\nsuch as the power of God, and from them drawing conclusions and denying\nthe existence of predicates; that is the usual course in our mode of\nreasoning. In respect of determinations, it must be remarked that\nthey, as being negative, are all kept apart from the positive and\nmerely real being. We reach this abstraction by a more ordinary way,\nand do not require a dialectic such as that of the Eleatic school: we\nsay God is unchangeable, change concerns finite things alone (which\nwe represent as an empirical proposition); on the one hand we thus\nhave finite things and change, and on the other, unchangeableness in\nthis abstract absolute unity with itself. It is the same separation,\nonly that we also allow the finite to be Being, which the Eleatics\ndeny. Or else we too proceed from finite things to kinds and genera,\nleaving the negative out bit by bit; and the highest order of all is\nGod, who, as the highest Being, is affirmative only, but devoid of any\ndetermination. Or we pass from what is finite to the infinite, for we\nsay that the finite as limited must have its basis in the infinite.\nIn all these different forms which are quite familiar to us, there is\nthe same difficult question which exists in reference to the Eleatic\nthought. Whence comes determination and how is it to be grasped\u2014how\nis it in the one, leaving the finite aside, and also how does the\ninfinite pass out into the finite? The Eleatics in their reflections\nwere distinguished from this our ordinary reflecting thought, in that\nthey went speculatively to work (the speculative element being that\nchange does not exist at all) and that they thus showed that, as Being\nwas presupposed, change in itself is contradictory and inconceivable.\nFor from the one, from Being, the determination of the negative, of\nthe manifold, is withdrawn. Thus while we, in our conception, allow\nthe actuality of the finite world, the Eleatics are more consistent,\nin that they proceeded to say that only the One exists and that the\nnegative does not exist at all;\u2014a consequence which, if it necessarily\narouses in us surprise, still none the less remains a great abstraction.\nSceptics saw in this the point of view of the uncertainty of all\nthings, and Sextus several times[50] quotes verses such as these:\u2014\n\u201cNo man at any time knew clearly and truly; nor will he ever know\nWhat of the gods I say, as also of the universe.\nFor what he thinks to speak most perfectly\nHe knows that not at all; his own opinions cleave to all.\u201d\nSextus, generalizing, explains this in the first passage thus: \u201cLet us\nimagine that in a house in which are many valuables, there were those\nwho sought for gold by night; in such a case everyone would think that\nhe had found the gold, but would not know certainly whether he actually\nhad found it. Thus philosophers come into this world as into a great\nhouse to seek the truth, but were they to reach it, they could not tell\nwhether they really had attained to it.\u201d The indefinite expressions\nof Xenophanes might also merely mean that none knows that which he\n(Xenophanes) here makes known. In the second passage Sextus puts it\nthus: \u201cXenophanes does not make all knowledge void, but only the\nscientific and infallible; opinionative knowledge is, however, left. He\nexpresses this in saying that opinion cleaves to all. So that with him\nthe criterion is made to be opinion, i.e. the apparent, and not that\nwhich is firm and sure; Parmenides, on the contrary, condemns opinion.\u201d\nBut from his doctrine of the One, there follows the annihilation of\nordinary ideas, which is what he did in the foregoing dialectic; it\nis evident, however, that nobody could know the truth which he hereby\nutters. If a thought such as this passed through one\u2019s head, one could\nnot tell that it was true, and in such a case it would only be an\nopinion.\nWe here find in Xenophanes a double consciousness; a pure consciousness\nand consciousness of Being, and a consciousness of opinion. The former\nwas to him the consciousness of the divine, and it is the pure\ndialectic, which is negatively related to all that is determined and\nwhich annuls it. The manner in which he expresses himself towards the\nsensuous world and finite thought-determinations is seen most clearly\nin his allusions to the Greek mythological conceptions of the gods. He\nsays, amongst other things, according to Brandis (Comment. Eleat. P. I.\np. 68):\u2014\n\u201cDid beasts and lions only have hands,\nWorks of art thereby to bring forth, as do men,\nThey would, in creating divine forms, give to them\nWhat in image and size belongs to themselves.\u201d\nHe also animadverts on the ideas of the gods held by Homer and Hesiod\nin verses which Sextus (adv. Math. IX. 193) has preserved to us:\u2014\n\u201cHesiod and Homer have attached to the gods\nAll that which brings shame and censure to men;\nStealing, adultery, and mutual deceit.\u201d\nAs, on the one hand, he defined absolute Being to be simple, making\nthat which is, however, break through and be immediately present in\nit, on the other hand he philosophizes on appearances; in reference to\nthis certain fragments only are transmitted to us, and such physical\nopinions as these can have no great interest. They are meant to have no\nspeculative significance any more than are those of our own physicists.\nWhen he says in this connection\n\u201cOut of the earth comes all, and returns to it again,\nWe all have come from earth and water alike,\nThus all that grows and takes its rise is only earth and water,\u201d[51]\nthis does not signify existence, physical principles, as did the water\nof Thales. For Aristotle expressly says, that no one regarded the earth\nas the absolute principle.\n2. PARMINIDES.\nParmenides is a striking figure in the Eleatic school, and he arrives\nat more definite conceptions than does Xenophanes. He was, according\nto Diogenes (IX. 21), born at Elea of a rich and honourable race. Of\nhis life, however, little is known; Aristotle only says (Met. I. 5)\nfrom tradition that he was a scholar of Xenophanes. Sextus Empiricus\n(adv. Math. VII. 111) calls him a friend (_\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2_) of Xenophanes.\nDiogenes Laertius further states: \u201cHe heard Anaximander and Xenophanes\nalso, but did not follow the latter\u201d (which seems only to refer to\nhis place of abode), \u201cbut he lived with Aminias and Diochartes the\nPythagorean, attached himself to the latter, and by the former, and\nnot by Xenophanes, was prevailed upon to lead a quiet life.\u201d That the\nperiod in which his life falls comes between Xenophanes and Zeno\u2014so\nthat he is contemporaneous with them, though younger than the former\nand older than the latter\u2014is ascertained. According to Diogenes (IX.\n23) he flourished about the 69th Olympiad (504-501 B.C.). What is\nmost important is his journey to Athens with Zeno, where Plato makes\nthem talk with Socrates. This may be accepted generally, but what is\nstrictly historical in it cannot be ascertained. In the Th\u00e6tetus Plato\nmakes Socrates reply to the invitation to examine the Eleatic system:\n\u201cFor Melissus and the others who assert the All to be One at rest,\nI have a certain respect; I have even more for Parmenides. For, to\nspeak in Homeric language, he seems to me both venerable and strong.\nI knew him when he was an old man and I was still quite young, and I\nheard wonderful things from him.\u201d[52] And in the Platonic Dialogue\nParmenides (p. 127. Steph. p. 4. Bekk.) where, as is well known, the\nconversation is carried on by Parmenides and Socrates, the historic\ncircumstances of this interview are related in detail. \u201cParmenides was\nvery old, had hair which was quite grey, was beautiful in countenance,\nabout sixty-five years old, and Zeno almost forty.\u201d Tennemann (Vol. I.\np. 415) places the journey in the 80th Olympiad (460-457 B.C.). Thus\nSocrates, since he was born in Olympiad 77, 4 (469 B.C.), would seem to\nhave been still too young to have carried on a dialogue such as Plato\ndescribes, and the principal matter of this dialogue, which is written\nin the spirit of the Eleatic school, belongs to Plato himself. Besides,\nwe know from Parmenides\u2019 life, that he stood in high respect with his\nfellow-citizens at Elea, whose prosperity must be chiefly ascribed to\nthe laws which Parmenides gave them.[53] We also find in the _\u03c0\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03be_ of\nCebes (towards the beginning) \u201ca Parmenidian life\u201d used synonymously\nwith a moral life.\nIt must be remarked that here, where the Eleatic school is definitely\ntreated of, Plato does not speak of Xenophanes at all, but only of\nMelissus and Parmenides. The fact that Plato, in one of his dialogues,\nlikewise accords the chief part to Parmenides, and puts in his mouth\nthe most lofty dialectic that ever was given, does not concern us here.\nIf with Xenophanes, by the proposition that out of nothing nothing\ncomes, origination and what depends upon or can be traced back to it is\ndenied, the opposition between Being and non-being makes its appearance\nstill more clearly with Parmenides, though still unconsciously. Sextus\nEmpiricus and Simplicius have preserved to us the most important\nfragments from the poems of Parmenides; for Parmenides also propounded\nhis philosophy as a poem. The first long fragment in Sextus (adv. Math.\nVII. 111) is an allegorical preface to his poem on Nature. This preface\nis majestic; it is written after the manner of the times, and in it all\nthere is an energetic, impetuous soul which strives with Being to grasp\nand to express it. We can show Parmenides\u2019 philosophy best in his own\nwords. The introduction runs thus:\u2014\n\u201cHorses that bore me, impelled by their courage,\nBrought me to the much-famed streets of the goddess\nWho leads the wise man to every kind of knowledge.\nMaidens point out the way.\nThe axle sings hot as the daughters of Helios quickly approach,\nLeaving the dwelling of night, pressing on to the light,\nWith mighty hands raising the sheltering veil.\u201d\nThe maidens are, according to Sextus (adv. Math. VII. 112, 113), the\nsenses, and Helios\u2019 daughters are more especially the eyes:\u2014\n\u201cThese are the gates of the pathways of night and of day.\nNow the heavenly maidens approach the great doors,\nWhose lock double-turned the punishing Dice protects.\nTo this one soft words were by the maidens addressed\nSubtly persuading her the barriers of oak from the gates,\nNow to withdraw. Yet these,\nDirectly the yawning breadth of the doors was revealed,\nDrove the horses and waggon, on through the gate.\nThe goddess received me in friendship, seized with her one hand my\nright,\nAnd turning towards me, she said:\n\u2018Oh, thou, who with guides all immortal and horses,\nCamest here in my palace,\u2014be welcome, young man.\nFor no evil fate has led thee into this path,\n(Indeed it lies far from the ways of a man)\nBut Themis and Dice. Now shalt thou all things explore,\nThe heart never-flinching of the truth that persuades,\nThe transient opinions which are not to be trusted.\nBut from such paths keep the inquiring soul far away.\nOn this way let not the much followed custom\nCause thee to take the rash eye as thy guide,\nOr the confused sounding ear and the tongue. Ponder considerately\nWith thy reason alone, the doctrine much and often examined,\nWhich I will proclaim. For there lacks but desire on your way.\u2019\u201d\nThe goddess develops everything from the double knowledge (_\u03b1_)\nof thought, of the truth, and (_\u03b2_) of opinion; these make up the\ntwo parts of the poem. In another fragment taken from Simplicius\u2019\nCommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics (p. 25; 19 a) and from Proclus\non the Tim\u00e6us (p. 29 b), we have the principal part of what is here\nrelated preserved to us. \u201cUnderstand,\u201d says the goddess, \u201cwhich are the\ntwo roads of knowledge. The one which is only Being, and which is not\nnon-being, is the path of conviction, the truth is in it. The other\nthat is not Being, and which is necessarily non-being, is, I must tell\nyou, a path quite devoid of reason, for thou canst neither know, or\nattain to, or express, non-being.\u201d The nothing, in fact, turns into\nsomething, since it is thought or is said: we say something, think\nsomething, if we wish to think and say the nothing. \u201cIt is necessary\nthat saying and thinking should be Being; for Being is, but nothing is\nnot at all.\u201d There the matter is stated in brief; and in this nothing,\nfalls negation generally, or in more concrete form, limitation, the\nfinite, restriction: _determinatio est negatio_ is Spinoza\u2019s great\nsaying. Parmenides says, whatever form the negation may take, it\ndoes not exist at all. To consider the nothing as the true is \u201cthe\nway of error in which the ignorant and double-minded mortals wander.\nPerplexity of mind sways the erring sense. Those who believe Being\nand non-being to be the same, and then again not the same, are like\ndeaf and blind men surprised, like hordes confusedly driven.\u201d The\nerror is to confuse them and to ascribe the same value to each, or to\ndistinguish them as if non-being were the limited generally. \u201cWhichever\nway is taken, it leads back to the point from which it started.\u201d It is\na constantly self-contradictory and disintegrating movement. To human\nideas, now this is held to be reality and now its opposite, and then\nagain a mixture of both.\nSimplicius quotes further, in writing on Aristotle\u2019s Physics (p.\n17 a; 31, 19): \u201cBut the truth is only the \u2018is\u2019; this is neither\nbegotten of anything else, nor transient, entire, alone in its class\n(_\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2_), unmoved and without end; it neither was, nor will be,\nbut is at once the all. For what birth wouldst thou seek for it? How\nand whence should it be augmented? That it should be from that which\nis not, I shall allow thee neither to say nor to think, for neither\ncan it be said or thought that the \u2018is\u2019 is not. What necessity had\neither later or earlier made it begin from the nothing? Thus must it\nthroughout only be or not be; nor will any force of conviction ever\nmake something else arise out of that which is not. Thus origination\nhas disappeared, and decease is incredible. Being is not separable,\nfor it is entirely like itself; it is nowhere more, else would it not\nhold together, nor is it less, for everything is full of Being. The all\nis one coherent whole, for Being flows into unison with Being: it is\nunchangeable and rests securely in itself; the force of necessity holds\nit within the bounds of limitation. It cannot hence be said that it is\nimperfect; for it is without defect, while non-existence is wanting in\nall.\u201d This Being is not the undetermined (_\u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_) for it is kept\nwithin the limits of necessity; we similarly find in Aristotle that\nlimitation is ascribed to Parmenides. The sense in which the expression\n\u201climit\u201d is to be taken is uncertain. According to Parmenides, however,\nthis absolute limitation is as _\u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03b7_, absolute necessity clearly\ndetermined in itself; and it is an important fact that he went beyond\nthe uncultured conception of the infinite. \u201cThought, and that on\naccount of which thought is, are the same. For not without that which\nis, in which it expresses itself (_\u1f10\u03bd \u1fa6 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd_), wilt thou\nfind Thought, seeing that it is nothing and will be nothing outside of\nthat which is.\u201d That is the main point. Thought produces itself, and\nwhat is produced is a Thought. Thought is thus identical with Being,\nfor there is nothing beside Being, this great affirmation. Plotinus,\nin quoting (V. Ennead. I. 8) this last fragment says: \u201cParmenides\nadopted this point of view, inasmuch as he did not place Being in\nsensuous things; identifying Being with Thought, he maintained it to be\nunchangeable.\u201d The Sophists concluded from this: \u201cAll is truth; there\nis no error, for error is the non-existent, that which is not to be\nthought.\u201d\nSince in this an advance into the region of the ideal is observable,\nParmenides began Philosophy proper. A man now constitutes himself free\nfrom all ideas and opinions, denies their truth, and says necessity\nalone, Being, is the truth. This beginning is certainly still dim and\nindefinite, and we cannot say much of what it involves; but to take\nup this position certainly is to develop Philosophy proper, which has\nnot hitherto existed. The dialectic that the transient has no truth,\nis implied in it, for if these determinations are taken as they are\nusually understood, contradictions ensue. In Simplicius (in Arist.\nPhys. p. 27 b.; 31 b.) we have further metaphorical images from\nParmenides. \u201cSince the utmost limit of Being is perfect, it resembles\non every side the form of a well rounded sphere, which from its centre\nextends in all directions equally, for it can be neither larger or\nsmaller in one part or another. There is no non-being which prevents it\nfrom attaining to the like\u201d\u2014from coming into unity with itself\u2014\u201cand\nthere is no Being where it was devoid of Being, here more and there\nless. Because the all is without defect, it is in all places in the\nsame way like itself in its determinations.\u201d Plotinus in the passage\nquoted says: \u201cHe compares Being with the spherical form, because it\ncomprehends all in itself, and Thought is not outside of this, but is\ncontained in it.\u201d And Simplicius says: \u201cWe must not wonder at him,\nfor on account of the poetic form, he adopts a mythological fiction\n(_\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2_).\u201d It immediately strikes us that the sphere is limited,\nand furthermore in space, and hence another must be above it; but\nthen the Notion of the sphere is the similarity of withholding the\ndifferent, notwithstanding that even the undifferentiated must be\nexpressed; hence this image is inconsistent.\nParmenides adds to this doctrine of the truth, the doctrine of human\nopinions, the illusive system of the world. Simplicius, writing on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics (p. 7 b; 39 a), tells us that he says: \u201cMen have\ntwo forms of opinion, one of which should not be, and in it they\nare mistaken; they set them in opposition to one another in form\nand symbol. The one, the ethereal fire of the flame, is quite fine,\nidentical with itself throughout, but not identical with the other,\nfor that is also for itself; on the other hand there is what belongs\nto night, or thick and ponderous existence.\u201d By the former, warmth,\nsoftness, lightness is expressed, and by the latter, cold. \u201cBut since\neverything is called light and night, and their qualities are suited\nboth to the one kind of things and the other, everything alike is\nfilled with light and dark night; both are alike since nothing exists\nwithout both.\u201d Aristotle (Met. I. 3 and 5), and the other historians,\nlikewise unanimously attribute to Parmenides the fact that he sets\nforth two principles for the system of manifest things, warmth and\ncold, through the union of which everything is. Light, fire, is the\nactive and animate; night, cold, is called the passive.\nParmenides also speaks like a Pythagorean\u2014he was called _\u1f00\u03bd\u1f72\u03c1\n\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2_ by Strabo\u2014in the following, and likewise mythological\nconception: \u201cThere are circlets wound round one another, one of which\nis of the rare element and the other of the dense, between which others\nare to be found, composed of light and darkness mingled. Those which\nare less are of impure fire, but those over them of night, through\nwhich proceed the forces of the flames. That which holds this all\ntogether, however, is something fixed, like a wall, under which there\nis a fiery wreath, and the most central of the rare spheres again is\nfiery. The most central of those mixed is the goddess that reigns over\nall, the Divider (_\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2_), Dice and Necessity. For she is the\nprinciple of all earthly produce and intermingling, which impels the\nmale to mix with the female, and conversely; she took Love to help\nher, creating him first amongst the gods. The air is an exhalation\n(_\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03ae_) of the earth; the sun and the milky way, the breath of\nfire; and the moon is air and fire mingled, &c.\u201d[54]\nIt still remains to us to explain the manner in which Parmenides\nregarded sensation and thought, which may undoubtedly at first sight\nseem to be materialistic. Theophrastus,[55] for example, remarks in\nthis regard: \u201cParmenides said nothing more than that there are two\nelements. Knowledge is determined according to the preponderance of\nthe one or of the other; for, according as warmth or cold predominate,\nthought varies; it becomes better and purer through warmth, and yet it\nrequires also a certain balance.\u201d\n\u201cFor as in each man there still is in his dispersive limbs an\nintermingling,\nSo is the understanding of man; for that\nWhich is thought by men, is the nature of the limbs,\nBoth in one and all; for thought is indeed the most.\u201d[56]\nHe thus takes sensation and thought to be the same, and makes\nremembrance and oblivion to arise from these through mingling them,\nbut whether in the intermingling they take an equal place, whether\nthis is thought or not, and what condition this is, he leaves quite\nundetermined. But that he ascribes sensation to the opposites in and\nfor themselves is clear, because he says: \u201cThe dead do not feel\nlight or warmth or hear voices, because the fire is out of them;\nthey feel cold, stillness and the opposite, however, and, speaking\ngenerally, each existence has a certain knowledge.\u201d In fact, this view\nof Parmenides is really the opposite of materialism, for materialism\nconsists in putting together the soul from parts, or independent forces\n(the wooden horse of the senses).\n3. MELISSUS.\nThere is little to tell about the life of Melissus. Diogenes Laertius\n(IX. 24) calls him a disciple of Parmenides, but the discipleship is\nuncertain; it is also said of him that he associated with Heraclitus.\nHe was born in Samos, like Pythagoras, and was besides a distinguished\nstatesman amongst his people. It is said by Plutarch (in Pericle, 26)\nthat, as admiral of the Samians, he gained in battle a victory over the\nAthenians. He flourished about the 84th Olympiad (444 B.C.).\nIn regard to his philosophy, too, there is little to say. Aristotle,\nwhere he mentions him, places him always with Parmenides, as resembling\nhim in mode of thought. Simplicius, writing on Aristotle\u2019s Physics\n(p. 7 sqq.), has preserved several fragments of his prose writings on\nNature, which show the same kind of thoughts and arguments as we find\nin Parmenides, but, in part, somewhat more developed. It was a question\nwhether the reasoning in which it is shown that change does not exist,\nor contradicts itself, which, by Aristotle in his incomplete, and, in\nsome parts, most corrupt work on Xenophanes, Zeno, and Gorgias (c. 2.),\nwas ascribed to Xenophanes, did not really belong to Melissus.[57]\nSince the beginning, in which we are told whose reasoning it is, is\nwanting, conjecture only applies it to Xenophanes. The writing begins\nwith the words \u201cHe says,\u201d without any name being given. It thus depends\non the superscription alone whether Aristotle speaks of the philosophy\nof Xenophanes or not, and it must be noticed that different hands have\nput different superscriptions. Indeed, there is in this work (c. 2) an\nopinion of Xenophanes mentioned in such a way that it appears as though\nhad what was previously quoted by Aristotle been by him ascribed to\nXenophanes, the expression would have been different. It is possible\nthat Zeno is meant, as the internal evidence abundantly shows. There\nis in it a dialectic more developed in form, more real reflexion, than\nfrom the verses could be expected, not from Xenophanes alone, but even\nfrom Parmenides. For Aristotle expressly says that Xenophanes does not\nyet determine with precision; thus the cultured reasoning contained in\nAristotle must certainly be denied to Xenophanes; at least, it is so\nfar certain that Xenophanes himself did not know how to express his\nthoughts in a manner so orderly and precise as that found here. We find\nit said:\u2014\n\u201cIf anything is, it is eternal (_\u1f00\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_).\u201d Eternity is an awkward\nword, for it immediately makes us think of time and mingle past and\nfuture as an infinite length of time; but what is meant is that\n_\u1f00\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_ is the self-identical, supersensuous, unchangeable, pure\npresent, which is without any time-conception. It is, origination and\nchange are shut out; if it commences, it does so out of nothing or\nout of Being. \u201cIt is impossible that anything should arise from the\nnothing. If everything could have arisen, or could it merely not have\nbeen everything eternally, it would equally have arisen out of nothing.\nFor, if everything had arisen, nothing would once have existed. If some\nwere alone the existent out of which the rest sprang, the one would be\nmore and greater. But the more and greater would thus have arisen out\nof the nothing of itself, for in the less there is not its more, nor in\nthe smaller its greater.\u201d\nSimplicius makes this note to the Physics of Aristotle (p. 22 b): \u201cNo\nmore can anything arise out of the existent, for the existent already\nis, and thus does not first arise from the existent.\u201d\n\u201cAs eternal, the existent also is unlimited, since it has no beginning\nfrom which it came, nor end in which it ceases. The infinite all is\none, for, if there were two or more, they would limit one another,\u201d\nand thus have a beginning and end. The one would be the nothing of the\nother and come forth from this nothing. \u201cThis one is like itself; for\nif it were unlike it would no longer be the one that was posited, but\nmany. This one is likewise immovable, inasmuch as it does not move\nitself, since it does not pass out into anything. In passing out, it\nwould require to do so into what is full or what is empty; it could\nnot be into the full, for that is an impossibility, and just as little\ncould it be into what is empty, for that is the nothing. The one,\ntherefore, is in this way devoid of pain or suffering, not changing in\nposition or form, or mingling with what is different. For all these\ndeterminations involve the origination of non-being and passing away\nof Being, which is impossible.\u201d Thus here again the contradiction\nwhich takes place when origination and passing away are spoken of, is\nrevealed.\nNow Melissus places opinion in opposition to this truth. The change\nand multiplicity extinguished in Being appears on the other side, in\nconsciousness, as in what is opinionative; it is necessary to say this\nif only the negative side, the removal of these moments, the Absolute\nas destitute of predicate, is laid hold of. \u201cIn sensuous perception the\nopposite is present for us; that is to say, a number of things, their\nchange, their origination and passing away, and their intermingling.\nThus that first knowledge must take its place beside this second,\nwhich has as much certainty for ordinary consciousness as the first.\u201d\nMelissus does not seem to have decided for the one or the other, but,\noscillating between both, to have limited the knowledge of the truth to\nthe statement that, speaking generally, between two opposite modes of\npresentation, the more probable opinion is to be preferred, but that\nwhat is so preferred is only to be regarded as the stronger opinion,\nand not as truth. This is what Aristotle says of him.\nSince Aristotle, in distinguishing his philosophy from the philosophy\nof Parmenides, maintains that in the first place Parmenides seems\nto understand the One as the principle of thought, and Melissus as\nmatter, we must remark that this distinction falls away in pure\nexistence, Being, or the One. Pure matter, as also pure thought (if\nI am to speak of such a distinction), are not present to Parmenides\nand Melissus, since they are abrogated; and it must only be in the\nmanner of his expression that one of them\u2014according to Aristotle\n(Phys. I. 2), on account of his clumsier mode of treatment (_\u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\n\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2_)\u2014could seem to have conceived of the other sense. If the\ndifference consisted secondly in the fact that Parmenides regarded the\none as limited and Melissus as unlimited, this limitation of the one\nwould, in effect, immediately contradict the philosophy of Parmenides;\nfor since limit is the non-being of Being, non-being would thus be\nposited. But when Parmenides speaks of limit, we see that his poetic\nlanguage is not altogether exact; limit, however, as pure limit, is\njust simple Being and absolute negativity, in which all else said and\nset forth is sublated. Necessity, as this pure negativity and movement\nwithin itself, although impassive thought, is absolutely bound to\nits opposite. In the third place it may be said that Parmenides set\nforth a concomitant philosophy of opinion or reality, to which Being\nas existence for thought was thus more opposed than was the case with\nMelissus.\n4. ZENO.\nWhat specially characterizes Zeno is the dialectic which, properly\nspeaking, begins with him; he is the master of the Eleatic school in\nwhom its pure thought arrives at the movement of the Notion in itself\nand becomes the pure soul of science. That is to say, in the Eleatics\nhitherto considered, we only have the proposition: \u201cThe nothing has\nno reality and is not at all, and thus what is called origin and\ndecease disappears.\u201d With Zeno, on the contrary, we certainly see just\nsuch an assertion of the one and removal of what contradicts it, but\nwe also see that this assertion is not made the starting point; for\nreason begins by calmly demonstrating in that which is established as\nexistent, its negation. Parmenides asserts that \u201cThe all is immutable,\nfor, in change, the non-being of that which is would be asserted,\nbut Being only is; in saying that non-being is, the subject and the\npredicate contradict themselves.\u201d Zeno, on the other hand, says:\n\u201cAssert your change; in it as change there is the negation to it, or\nit is nothing.\u201d To the former change existed as motion, definite and\ncomplete. Zeno protested against motion as such, or pure motion. \u201cPure\nBeing is not motion; it is rather the negation of motion.\u201d We find it\nspecially interesting that there is in Zeno the higher consciousness,\nthe consciousness that when one determination is denied, this negation\nis itself again a determination, and then in the absolute negation\nnot one determination, but both the opposites must be negated. Zeno\nanticipated this, and because he foresaw that Being is the opposite\nof nothing, he denied of the One what must be said of the nothing.\nBut the same thing must occur with all the rest. We find this higher\ndialectic in Plato\u2019s Parmenides; here it only breaks forth in respect\nto some determinations, and not to the determination of the One and of\nBeing. The higher consciousness is the consciousness of the nullity of\nBeing as of what is determined as against the nothing, partly found in\nHeraclitus and then in the Sophists; with them it never has any truth,\nit has no existence in itself, but is only the for-another, or the\nassurance of the individual consciousness, and assurance as refutation,\ni.e. the negative side of dialectic.\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, (IX. 25) Zeno was likewise an Eleat;\nhe is the youngest, and lived most in company with Parmenides. The\nlatter became very fond of him and adopted him as a son; his own\nfather was called Telentagoras. Not in his State alone was his conduct\nheld in high respect, for his fame was universal, and he was esteemed\nparticularly as a teacher. Plato mentions that men came to him from\nAthens and other places, in order to profit from his learning.[58]\nProud self-sufficiency is ascribed to him by Diogenes (IX. 28) because\nhe\u2014with the exception of a journey made to Athens\u2014continued to reside\nin Elea, and did not stay a longer time in the great, mighty Athens,\nand there attain to fame. In very various narratives his death was made\nfor ever celebrated for the strength of his mind evinced in it; it was\nsaid that he freed a State (whether his own home at Elea or in Sicily,\nis not known) from its Tyrant (the name is given differently, but an\nexact historical account has not been recorded) in the following way,\nand by the sacrifice of his life. He entered into a plot to overthrow\nthe Tyrant, but this was betrayed. When the Tyrant now, in face of the\npeople, caused him to be tortured in every possible way to get from him\nan avowal of his confederates, and when he questioned him about the\nenemies of the State, Zeno first named to the Tyrant all his friends as\nparticipators in the plot, and then spoke of the Tyrant himself as the\npest of the State. The powerful remonstrances or the horrible tortures\nand death of Zeno aroused the citizens, inspired them with courage to\nfall upon the Tyrant, kill him, and liberate themselves. The manner of\nthe end, and his violent and furious state of mind, is very variously\ndepicted. He is said to have pretended to wish to say something into\nthe Tyrant\u2019s ear, and then to have bitten his ear, and thus held him\nfast until he was slain by the others. Others say that he seized him by\nthe nose between his teeth; others that as on his reply great tortures\nwere applied, he bit off his tongue and spat it into the Tyrant\u2019s face,\nto show him that he could get nothing from him, and that he then was\npounded in a mortar.[59]\nIt has just been noticed that Zeno had the very important character\nof being the originator of the true objective dialectic. Xenophanes,\nParmenides, and Melissus, start with the proposition: \u201cNothing is\nnothing; the nothing does not exist at all, or the like is real\nexistence,\u201d that is, they make one of the opposed predicates to be\nexistence. Now when they encounter the opposite in a determination,\nthey demolish this determination, but it is only demolished through\nanother, through my assertion, through the distinction that I form, by\nwhich one side is made to be the true, and the other the null. We have\nproceeded from a definite proposition; the nullity of the opposite does\nnot appear in itself; it is not that it abrogates itself, i.e. that it\ncontains a contradiction in itself. For instance, I assert of something\nthat it is the null; then I show this by hypothesis in motion, and\nit follows that it is the null. But another consciousness does not\nassert this; I declare one thing to be directly true; another has the\nright of asserting something else as directly true, that is to say,\nmotion. Similarly what seems to be the case when one philosophic system\ncontradicts another, is that the first is pre-established, and that men\nstarting from this point of view, combat the other. The matter is thus\neasily settled by saying: \u201cThe other has no truth, because it does not\nagree with me,\u201d and the other has the right to say the same. It does\nnot help if I prove my system or my proposition and then conclude that\nthus the opposite is false; to this other proposition the first always\nseems to be foreign and external. Falsity must not be demonstrated\nthrough another, and as untrue because the opposite is true, but in\nitself; we find this rational perception in Zeno.\nIn Plato\u2019s Parmenides (pp. 127, 128, Steph., pp. 6, 7, Bekk.) this\ndialectic is very well described, for Plato makes Socrates say of\nit: \u201cZeno in his writings asserts fundamentally the same as does\nParmenides, that All is One, but he would feign delude us into\nbelieving that he was telling something new. Parmenides thus shows in\nhis poems that All is One; Zeno, on the contrary, shows that the Many\ncannot be.\u201d Zeno replies, that \u201cHe wrote thus really against those who\ntry to make Parmenides\u2019 position ridiculous, for they try to show what\nabsurdities and self-contradictions can be derived from his statements;\nhe thus combats those who deduce Being from the many, in order to show\nthat far more absurdities arise from this than from the statements of\nParmenides.\u201d That is the special aim of objective dialectic, in which\nwe no longer maintain simple thought for itself, but see the battle\nfought with new vigour within the enemy\u2019s camp. Dialectic has in Zeno\nthis negative side, but it has also to be considered from its positive\nside.\nAccording to the ordinary ideas of science, where propositions result\nfrom proof, proof is the movement of intelligence, a connection brought\nabout by mediation. Dialectic is either (_\u03b1_) external dialectic,\nin which this movement is different from the comprehension of the\nmovement, or (_\u03b2_) not a movement of our intelligence only, but what\nproceeds from the nature of the thing itself, i.e. from the pure Notion\nof the content. The former is a manner of regarding objects in such a\nway that reasons are revealed and new light thrown, by means of which\nall that was supposed to be firmly fixed, is made to totter; there\nmay be reasons which are altogether external too, and we shall speak\nfurther of this dialectic when dealing with the Sophists. The other\ndialectic, however, is the immanent contemplation of the object; it is\ntaken for itself, without previous hypothesis, idea or obligation, not\nunder any outward conditions, laws or causes; we have to put ourselves\nright into the thing, to consider the object in itself, and to take it\nin the determinations which it has. In regarding it thus, it shows from\nitself that it contains opposed determinations, and thus breaks up;\nthis dialectic we more especially find in the ancients. The subjective\ndialectic, which reasons from external grounds, is moderate, for it\ngrants that: \u201cIn the right there is what is not right, and in the false\nthe true.\u201d True dialectic leaves nothing whatever to its object, as if\nthe latter were deficient on one side only; for it disintegrates itself\nin the entirety of its nature. The result of this dialectic is null,\nthe negative; the affirmative in it does not yet appear. This true\ndialectic may be associated with the work of the Eleatics. But in their\ncase the real meaning and quality of philosophic understanding was not\ngreat, for they got no further than the fact that through contradiction\nthe object is a nothing.\nZeno\u2019s dialectic of matter has not been refuted to the present\nday; even now we have not got beyond it, and the matter is left in\nuncertainty. Simplicius, writing on the Physics of Aristotle (p. 30),\nsays: \u201cZeno proves that if the many is, it must be great and small; if\ngreat, the many must be infinite in number\u201d (it must have gone beyond\nthe manifold, as indifferent limit, into the infinite; but what is\ninfinite is no longer large and no longer many, for it is the negation\nof the many). \u201cIf small, it must be so small as to have no size,\u201d\nlike atoms. \u201cHere he shows that what has neither size, thickness nor\nmass, cannot be. For if it were added to another, it would not cause\nits increase; were it, that is to say, to have no size and be added\nthereto, it could not supplement the size of the other and consequently\nthat which is added is nothing. Similarly were it taken away, the other\nwould not be made less, and thus it is nothing. If what has being is,\neach existence necessarily has size and thickness, is outside of one\nanother, and one is separate from the other; the same applies to all\nelse (_\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u1f54\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2_), for it, too, has size, and in it there is\nwhat mutually differs (_\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ad\u03be\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03b9_). But it is the same thing\nto say something once and to say it over and over again; in it nothing\ncan be a last, nor will there not be another to the other. Thus if many\nare, they are small and great; small, so that they have no size; great,\nso that they are infinite.\u201d\nAristotle (Phys. VI. 9) explains this dialectic further; Zeno\u2019s\ntreatment of motion was above all objectively dialectical. But the\nparticulars which we find in the Parmenides of Plato are not his.\nFor Zeno\u2019s consciousness we see simple unmoved thought disappear,\nbut become thinking movement; in that he combats sensuous movement,\nhe concedes it. The reason that dialectic first fell on movement is\nthat the dialectic is itself this movement, or movement itself the\ndialectic of all that is. The thing, as self-moving, has its dialectic\nin itself, and movement is the becoming another, self-abrogation. If\nAristotle says that Zeno denied movement because it contains an inner\ncontradiction, it is not to be understood to mean that movement did not\nexist at all. The point is not that there is movement and that this\nphenomenon exists; the fact that there is movement is as sensuously\ncertain as that there are elephants; it is not in this sense that Zeno\nmeant to deny movement. The point in question concerns its truth.\nMovement, however, is held to be untrue, because the conception of it\ninvolves a contradiction; by that he meant to say that no true Being\ncan be predicated of it.\nZeno\u2019s utterances are to be looked at from this point of view, not as\nbeing directed against the reality of motion, as would at first appear,\nbut as pointing out how movement must necessarily be determined, and\nshowing the course which must be taken. Zeno now brings forward four\ndifferent arguments against motion; the proofs rest on the infinite\ndivisibility of space and time.\n(a) This is his first form of argument:\u2014\u201cMovement has no truth,\nbecause what is in motion must first reach the middle of the space\nbefore arriving at the end.\u201d Aristotle expresses this thus shortly,\nbecause he had earlier treated of and worked out the subject at length.\nThis is to be taken as indicating generally that the continuity of\nspace is presupposed. What moves itself must reach a certain end, this\nway is a whole. In order to traverse the whole, what is in motion must\nfirst pass over the half, and now the end of this half is considered as\nbeing the end; but this half of space is again a whole, that which also\nhas a half, and the half of this half must first have been reached, and\nso on into infinity. Zeno here arrives at the infinite divisibility of\nspace; because space and time are absolutely continuous, there is no\npoint at which the division can stop. Every dimension (and every time\nand space always have a dimension) is again divisible into two halves,\nwhich must be measured off; and however small a space we have, the\nsame conditions reappear. Movement would be the act of passing through\nthese infinite moments, and would therefore never end; thus what is in\nmotion cannot reach its end. It is known how Diogenes of Sinope, the\nCynic, quite simply refuted these arguments against movement; without\nspeaking he rose and walked about, contradicting them by action.[60]\nBut when reasons are disputed, the only valid refutation is one derived\nfrom reasons; men have not merely to satisfy themselves by sensuous\nassurance, but also to understand. To refute objections is to prove\ntheir non-existence, as when they are made to fall away and can hence\nbe adduced no longer; but it is necessary to think of motion as Zeno\nthought of it, and yet to carry this theory of motion further still.\nWe have here the spurious infinite or pure appearance, whose simple\nprinciple Philosophy demonstrates as universal Notion, for the first\ntime making its appearance as developed in its contradiction; in the\nhistory of Philosophy a consciousness of this contradiction is also\nattained. Movement, this pure phenomenon, appears as something thought\nand shown forth in its real being\u2014that is, in its distinction of pure\nself-identity and pure negativity, the point as distinguished from\ncontinuity. To us there is no contradiction in the idea that the here\nof space and the now of time are considered as a continuity and length;\nbut their Notion is self-contradictory. Self-identity or continuity is\nabsolute cohesion, the destruction of all difference, of all negation,\nof being for self; the point, on the contrary, is pure being-for-self,\nabsolute self-distinction and the destruction of all identity and\nall connection with what is different. Both of these, however,\nare, in space and time, placed in one; space and time are thus the\ncontradiction; it is necessary, first of all, to show the contradiction\nin movement, for in movement that which is opposed is, to ordinary\nconceptions, inevitably manifested. Movement is just the reality of\ntime and space, and because this appears and is made manifest, the\napparent contradiction is demonstrated, and it is this contradiction\nthat Zeno notices. The limitation of bisection which is involved in\nthe continuity of space, is not absolute limitation, for that which\nis limited is again continuity; however, this continuity is again not\nabsolute, for the opposite has to be exhibited in it, the limitation\nof bisection; but the limitation of continuity is still not thereby\nestablished, the half is still continuous, and so on into infinity.\nIn that we say \u201cinto infinity,\u201d we place before ourselves a beyond,\noutside of the ordinary conception, which cannot reach so far. It is\ncertainly an endless going forth, but in the Notion it is present,\nit is a progression from one opposed determination to others, from\ncontinuity to negativity, from negativity to continuity; but both of\nthese are before us. Of these moments one in the process may be called\nthe true one; Zeno first asserts continuous progression in such a way\nthat no limited space can be arrived at as ultimate, or Zeno upholds\nprogression in this limitation.\nThe general explanation which Aristotle gives to this contradiction, is\nthat space and time are not infinitely divided, but are only divisible.\nBut it now appears that, because they are divisible\u2014that is, in\npotentiality\u2014they must actually be infinitely divided, for else they\ncould not be divided into infinity. That is the general answer of the\nordinary man in endeavouring to refute the explanation of Aristotle.\nBayle (Tom. IV. art. Z\u00e9non, not. E.) hence says of Aristotle\u2019s answer\nthat it is \u201cpitoyable: C\u2019est se moquer du monde que de se servir de\ncette doctrine; car si la mati\u00e8re est divisible \u00e0 l\u2019infini, elle\ncontient un nombre infini de parties. Ce n\u2019est donc point un infini en\npuissance, c\u2019est un infini, qui existe r\u00e9ellement, actuellement. Mais\nquand-m\u00eame on accorderait cet infini en puissance, qui deviendrait\nun infini par la division actuelle de ses parties, on ne perdrait\npas ses avantages; car le mouvement est une chose, qui a la m\u00eame\nvertu, que la division. Il touche une partie de l\u2019espace sans toucher\nl\u2019autre, et il les touche toutes les unes apr\u00e8s les autres. N\u2019est-ce\npas les distinguer actuellement? N\u2019est-ce pas faire ce que ferait un\ng\u00e9om\u00e8tre sur une table en tirant des lignes, qui d\u00e9signassent tous les\ndemi-pouces? Il ne brise pas la table en demi-pouces, mais il y fait\nn\u00e9anmoins une division, qui marque la distinction actuelle des parties;\net je ne crois pas qu\u2019Aristote eut voulu nier, que _si_ l\u2019on tirait une\ninfinit\u00e9 de lignes sur un pouce de mati\u00e8re, on n\u2019y introduis\u00eet une\ndivision, qui r\u00e9duirait en infini actuel ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait selon lui qu\u2019un\ninfini virtual.\u201d This _si_ is good! Divisibility is, as potentiality,\nthe universal; there is continuity as well as negativity or the point\nposited in it\u2014but posited as moment, and not as existent in and for\nitself. I can divide matter into infinitude, but I only can do so; I\ndo not really divide it into infinitude. This is the infinite, that no\none of its moments has reality. It never does happen that, in itself,\none or other\u2014that absolute limitation or absolute continuity\u2014actually\ncomes into existence in such a way that the other moment disappears.\nThere are two absolute opposites, but they are moments, i.e. in the\nsimple Notion or in the universal, in thought, if you will; for in\nthought, in ordinary conception, what is set forth both is and is not\nat the same time. What is represented either as such, or as an image\nof the conception, is not a thing; it has no Being, and yet it is not\nnothing.\nSpace and time furthermore, as _quantum_, form a limited extension,\nand thus can be measured off; just as I do not actually divide space,\nneither does the body which is in motion. The partition of space as\ndivided, is not absolute discontinuity [Punktualit\u00e4t], nor is pure\ncontinuity the undivided and indivisible; likewise time is not pure\nnegativity or discontinuity, but also continuity. Both are manifested\nin motion, in which the Notions have their reality for ordinary\nconception\u2014pure negativity as time, continuity as space. Motion itself\nis just this actual unity in the opposition, and the sequence of both\nmoments in this unity. To comprehend motion is to express its essence\nin the form of Notion, _i.e._, as unity of negativity and continuity;\nbut in them neither continuity nor discreteness can be exhibited as\nthe true existence. If we represent space or time to ourselves as\ninfinitely divided, we have an infinitude of points, but continuity is\npresent therein as a space which comprehends them: as Notion, however,\ncontinuity is the fact that all these are alike, and thus in reality\nthey do not appear one out of the other like points. But both these\nmoments make their appearance as existent; if they are manifested\nindifferently, their Notion is no longer posited, but their existence.\nIn them as existent, negativity is a limited size, and they exist as\nlimited space and time; actual motion is progression through a limited\nspace and a limited time and not through infinite space and infinite\ntime.\nThat what is in motion must reach the half is the assertion of\ncontinuity, i.e. the possibility of division as mere possibility; it is\nthus always possible in every space, however small. It is said that it\nis plain that the half must be reached, but in so saying, everything\nis allowed, including the fact that it never will be reached; for to\nsay so in one case, is the same as saying it an infinite number of\ntimes. We mean, on the contrary, that in a larger space the half can be\nallowed, but we conceive that we must somewhere attain to a space so\nsmall that no halving is possible, or an indivisible, non-continuous\nspace which is no space. This, however, is false, for continuity is a\nnecessary determination; there is undoubtedly a smallest in space, i.e.\na negation of continuity, but the negation is something quite abstract.\nAbstract adherence to the subdivision indicated, that is, to continuous\nbisection into infinitude, is likewise false, for in the conception of\na half, the interruption of continuity is involved. We must say that\nthere is no half of space, for space is continuous; a piece of wood\nmay be broken into two halves, but not space, and space only exists in\nmovement. It might equally be said that space consists of an endless\nnumber of points, i.e. of infinitely many limits and thus cannot be\ntraversed. Men think themselves able to go from one indivisible point\nto another, but they do not thereby get any further, for of these there\nis an unlimited number. Continuity is split up into its opposite,\na number which is indefinite; that is to say, if continuity is not\nadmitted, there is no motion. It is false to assert that it is possible\nwhen one is reached, or that which is not continuous; for motion is\nconnection. Thus when it was said that continuity is the presupposed\npossibility of infinite division, continuity is only the hypothesis;\nbut what is exhibited in this continuity is the being of infinitely\nmany, abstractly absolute limits.\n(b) The second proof, which is also the presupposition of continuity\nand the manifestation of division, is called \u201cAchilles, the Swift.\u201d\nThe ancients loved to clothe difficulties in sensuous representations.\nOf two bodies moving in one direction, one of which is in front and\nthe other following at a fixed distance and moving quicker than the\nfirst, we know that the second will overtake the first. But Zeno says,\n\u201cThe slower can never be overtaken by the quicker.\u201d And he proves it\nthus: \u201cThe second one requires a certain space of time to reach the\nplace from which the one pursued started at the beginning of the given\nperiod.\u201d Thus during the time in which the second reached the point\nwhere the first was, the latter went over a new space which the second\nhas again to pass through in a part of this period; and in this way it\ngoes into infinity.\nc                                d                e        f    g\nB                                A\nB, for instance, traverses two miles (c d) in an hour, A in the same\ntime, one mile (d e); if they are two miles (c d) removed from one\nanother, B has in one hour come to where A was at the beginning of the\nhour. While B, in the next half hour, goes over the distance crossed\nby A of one mile (d e), A has got half a mile (e f) further, and so\non into infinity. Quicker motion does not help the second body at all\nin passing over the interval of space by which he is behind: the time\nwhich he requires, the slower body always has at its avail in order to\naccomplish some, although an ever shorter advance; and this, because of\nthe continual division, never quite disappears.\nAristotle, in speaking of this, puts it shortly thus. \u201cThis proof\nasserts the same endless divisibility, but it is untrue, for the quick\nwill overtake the slow body if the limits to be traversed be granted to\nit.\u201d This answer is correct and contains all that can be said; that is,\nthere are in this representation two periods of time and two distances,\nwhich are separated from one another, i.e. they are limited in relation\nto one another; when, on the contrary, we admit that time and space\nare continuous, so that two periods of time or points of space are\nrelated to one another as continuous, they are, while being two, not\ntwo, but identical. In ordinary language we solve the matter in the\neasiest way, for we say: \u201cBecause the second is quicker, it covers a\ngreater distance in the same time as the slow; it can therefore come to\nthe place from which the first started and get further still.\u201d After\nB, at the end of the first hour, arrives at d and A at e, A in one and\nthe same period, that is, in the second hour, goes over the distance\ne g, and B the distance d g. But this period of time which should be\none, is divisible into that in which B accomplishes d e and that in\nwhich B passes through e g. A has a start of the first, by which it\ngets over the distance e f, so that A is at f at the same period as\nB is at e. The limitation which, according to Aristotle, is to be\novercome, which must be penetrated, is thus that of time; since it is\ncontinuous, it must, for the solution of the difficulty, be said that\nwhat is divisible into two spaces of time is to be conceived of as one,\nin which B gets from d to e and from e to g, while A passes over the\ndistance e g. In motion two periods, as well as two points in space,\nare indeed one.\nIf we wish to make motion clear to ourselves, we say that the body is\nin one place and then it goes to another; because it moves, it is no\nlonger in the first, but yet not in the second; were it in either it\nwould be at rest. Where then is it? If we say that it is between both,\nthis is to convey nothing at all, for were it between both, it would\nbe in a place, and this presents the same difficulty. But movement\nmeans to be in this place and not to be in it, and thus to be in both\nalike; this is the continuity of space and time which first makes\nmotion possible. Zeno, in the deduction made by him, brought both these\npoints into forcible opposition. The discretion of space and time we\nalso uphold, but there must also be granted to them the overstepping of\nlimits, i.e. the exhibition of limits as not being, or as being divided\nperiods of time, which are also not divided. In our ordinary ideas we\nfind the same determinations as those on which the dialectic of Zeno\nrests; we arrive at saying, though unwillingly, that in one period two\ndistances of space are traversed, but we do not say that the quicker\ncomprehends two moments of time in one; for that we fix a definite\nspace. But in order that the slower may lose its precedence, it must be\nsaid that it loses its advantage of a moment of time, and indirectly\nthe moment of space.\nZeno makes limit, division, the moment of discretion in space and time,\nthe only element which is enforced in the whole of his conclusions, and\nhence results the contradiction. The difficulty is to overcome thought,\nfor what makes the difficulty is always thought alone, since it keeps\napart the moments of an object which in their separation are really\nunited. It brought about the Fall, for man ate of the tree of the\nknowledge of good and evil; but it also remedies these evils.\n(c) The third form, according to Aristotle, is as follows:\u2014Zeno\nsays: \u201cThe flying arrow rests, and for the reason that what is in\nmotion is always in the self-same Now and the self-same Here, in the\nindistinguishable;\u201d it is here and here and here. It can be said of the\narrow that it is always the same, for it is always in the same space\nand the same time; it does not get beyond its space, does not take in\nanother, that is, a greater or smaller space. That, however, is what\nwe call rest and not motion. In the Here and Now, the becoming \u201cother\u201d\nis abrogated, limitation indeed being established, but only as moment;\nsince in the Here and Now as such, there is no difference, continuity\nis here made to prevail against the mere belief in diversity. Each\nplace is a different place, and thus the same; true, objective\ndifference does not come forth in these sensuous relations, but in the\nspiritual.\nThis is also apparent in mechanics; of two bodies the question as\nto which moves presents itself before us. It requires more than two\nplaces\u2014three at least\u2014to determine which of them moves. But it is\ncorrect to say this, that motion is plainly relative; whether in\nabsolute space the eye, for instance, rests, or whether it moves,\nis all the same. Or, according to a proposition brought forward by\nNewton, if two bodies move round one another in a circle, it may be\nasked whether the one rests or both move. Newton tries to decide this\nby means of an external circumstance, the strain on the string. When I\nwalk on a ship in a direction opposed to the motion of the ship, this\nis in relation to the ship, motion, and in relation to all else, rest.\nIn both the first proofs, continuity in progression has the\npredominance; there is no absolute limit, but an overstepping of all\nlimits. Here the opposite is established; absolute limitation, the\ninterruption of continuity, without however passing into something\nelse; while discretion is presupposed, continuity is maintained.\nAristotle says of this proof: \u201cIt arises from the fact that it is taken\nfor granted that time consists of the Now; for if this is not conceded,\nthe conclusions will not follow.\u201d\n(d) \u201cThe fourth proof,\u201d Aristotle continues, \u201cis derived from similar\nbodies which move in opposite directions in the space beside a similar\nbody, and with equal velocity, one from one end of the space, the other\nfrom the middle. It necessarily results from this that half the time\nis equal to the double of it. The fallacy rests in this, that Zeno\nsupposes that what is beside the moving body, and what is beside the\nbody at rest, move through an equal distance in equal time with equal\nvelocity, which, however, is untrue.\u201d\n1\n_E_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_F_\n_k_         _i_       _m_\n_C_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_D_\n_g_  _n_  _h_\n_A_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_B_\nIn a definite space such as a table (A B) let us suppose two bodies\nof equal length with it and with one another, one of which (C D) lies\nwith one end (C) on the middle (g) of the table, and the other (E F),\nbeing in the same direction, has the point (E) only touching the end\nof the table (h); and supposing they move in opposite directions, and\nthe former (C D) reaches in an hour the end (h) of the table; we have\nthe result ensuing that the one (E F) passes in the half of the time\nthrough the same space (i k) which the other does in the double (g h);\nhence the half is equal to the double. That is to say, this second\npasses (let us say, in the point l) by the whole of the first C D. In\nthe first half-hour l goes from m to i, while k only goes from g to n.\n1\n_E_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_F_\n_k_  _o_  _i_       _m_\n_C_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_D_\n_g_  _n_  _h_\n_A_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_B_\nIn the second half-hour l goes past o to k, and altogether passes from\nm to k, or the double of the distance.\n1\n_E_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_F_\n_k_  _o_  _i_       _m_\n_C_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_D_\n_g_ _n_  _h_\n_A_|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|_B_\nThis fourth form deals with the contradiction presented in opposite\nmotion; that which is common is given entirely to one body, while it\nonly does part for itself. Here the distance travelled by one body\nis the sum of the distance travelled by both, just as when I go two\nfeet east, and from the same point another goes two feet west, we are\nfour feet removed from one another; in the distance moved both are\npositive, and hence have to be added together. Or if I have gone two\nfeet forwards and two feet backwards, although I have walked four feet,\nI have not moved from the spot; the motion is then nil, for by going\nforwards and backwards an opposition ensues which annuls itself.\nThis is the dialectic of Zeno; he had a knowledge of the determinations\nwhich our ideas of space and time contain, and showed in them their\ncontradiction; Kant\u2019s antinomies do no more than Zeno did here. The\ngeneral result of the Eleatic dialectic has thus become, \u201cthe truth is\nthe one, all else is untrue,\u201d just as the Kantian philosophy resulted\nin \u201cwe know appearances only.\u201d On the whole the principle is the same;\n\u201cthe content of knowledge is only an appearance and not truth,\u201d but\nthere is also a great difference present. That is to say, Zeno and\nthe Eleatics in their proposition signified \u201cthat the sensuous world,\nwith its multitudinous forms, is in itself appearance only, and has\nno truth.\u201d But Kant does not mean this, for he asserts: \u201cBecause we\napply the activity of our thought to the outer world, we constitute\nit appearance; what is without, first becomes an untruth by the fact\nthat we put therein a mass of determinations. Only our knowledge, the\nspiritual, is thus appearance; the world is in itself absolute truth;\nit is our action alone that ruins it, our work is good for nothing.\u201d\nIt shows excessive humility of mind to believe that knowledge has no\nvalue; but Christ says, \u201cAre ye not better than the sparrows?\u201d and we\nare so inasmuch as we are thinking; as sensuous we are as good or as\nbad as sparrows. Zeno\u2019s dialectic has greater objectivity than this\nmodern dialectic.\nZeno\u2019s dialectic is limited to Metaphysics; later, with the Sophists,\nit became general. We here leave the Eleatic school, which perpetuates\nitself in Leucippus and, on the other side, in the Sophists, in such\na way that these last extended the Eleatic conceptions to all reality,\nand gave to it the relation of consciousness; the former, however, as\none who later on worked out the Notion in its abstraction, makes a\nphysical application of it, and one which is opposed to consciousness.\nThere are several other Eleatics mentioned, to Tennemann\u2019s surprise,\nwho, however, cannot interest us. \u201cIt is so unexpected,\u201d he says (Vol.\nI., p. 190), \u201cthat the Eleatic system should find disciples; and yet\nSextus mentions a certain Xeniades.\u201d\nD. HERACLITUS.\nIf we put aside the Ionics, who did not understand the Absolute as\nThought, and the Pythagoreans likewise, we have the pure Being of the\nEleatics, and the dialectic which denies all finite relationships.\nThought to the latter is the process of such manifestations; the world\nin itself is the apparent, and pure Being alone the true. The dialectic\nof Zeno thus lays hold of the determinations which rest in the content\nitself, but it may, in so far, also be called subjective dialectic,\ninasmuch as it rests in the contemplative subject, and the one, without\nthis movement of the dialectic, is abstract identity. The next step\nfrom the existence of the dialectic as movement in the subject, is that\nit must necessarily itself become objective. If Aristotle blames Thales\nfor doing away with motion, because change cannot be understood from\nBeing, and likewise misses the actual in the Pythagorean numbers and\nPlatonic Ideas, taken as the substances of the things which participate\nin them, Heraclitus at least understands the absolute as just this\nprocess of the dialectic. The dialectic is thus thre-fold: (_\u03b1_)\nthe external dialectic, a reasoning which goes over and over again\nwithout ever reaching the soul of the thing; (_\u03b2_) immanent dialectic\nof the object, but falling within the contemplation of the subject;\n(_\u03b3_) the objectivity of Heraclitus which takes the dialectic itself\nas principle. The advance requisite and made by Heraclitus is the\nprogression from Being as the first immediate thought, to the category\nof Becoming as the second. This is the first concrete, the Absolute, as\nin it the unity of opposites. Thus with Heraclitus the philosophic Idea\nis to be met with in its speculative form; the reasoning of Parmenides\nand Zeno is abstract understanding. Heraclitus was thus universally\nesteemed a deep philosopher and even was decried as such. Here we see\nland; there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in\nmy Logic.\nDiogenes Laertius says (IX. 1) that Heraclitus flourished about the\n69th Olympiad (500 B.C.), and that he was of Ephesus and in part\ncontemporaneous with Parmenides: he began the separation and withdrawal\nof philosophers from public affairs and the interests of the country,\nand devoted himself in his isolation entirely to Philosophy. We\nhave thus three stages: (_\u03b1_) the seven sages as statesmen, regents\nand law-givers; (_\u03b2_) the Pythagorean aristocratic league; (_\u03b3_)\nan interest in science for its own sake. Little more is known of\nHeraclitus\u2019 life than his relations to his countrymen the Ephesians,\nand according to Diogenes Laertius (IX. 15, 3), these were for the\nmost part found in the fact that they despised him and were yet more\nprofoundly despised by him\u2014a relationship such as we have now-a-days,\nwhen each man exists for himself, and despises everyone else. In the\ncase of this noble character, the disdain and sense of separation\nfrom the crowd emanates from the deep sense of the perversity of\nthe ordinary ideas and life of his people: in reference to this,\nisolated expressions used on various occasions are still preserved.\nCicero (Tusc. Qu\u00e6st. V. 36) and Diogenes Laertius (IX. 2) relate that\nHeraclitus said: \u201cThe Ephesians all deserve to have their necks broken\nas they grow up, so that the town should be left to minors\u201d (people now\nsay that only youth knows how to govern), \u201cbecause they drove away his\nfriend Hermodorus, the best of them all, and gave as their reason for\nso doing that amongst them none should be more excellent than the rest;\nand if any one were so, it should be elsewhere and amongst others.\u201d It\nwas for the same reason that in the Athenian Democracy great men were\nbanished. Diogenes adds: \u201cHis fellow-citizens asked him to take part in\nthe administration of public affairs, but he declined, because he did\nnot like their constitution, laws and administration.\u201d Proclus (T. III.\npp. 115, 116, ed. Cousin) says: \u201cThe noble Heraclitus blamed the people\nfor being devoid of understanding or thought. \u2018What is,\u2019 he says,\n\u2018their understanding or their prudence? Most of them are bad, and few\nare good.\u2019\u201d Diogenes Laertius (IX. 6) furthermore says: \u201cAntisthenes\ncites, as a proof of Heraclitus\u2019 greatness, that he left his kingdom\nto his brother.\u201d He expresses in the strongest manner his contempt\nfor what is esteemed to be truth and right, in the letter preserved\nto us by Diogenes (IX. 13, 14), in which, to the invitation of Darius\nHystaspes, \u201cto make him acquainted with Greek wisdom\u2014for his work\non Nature contains a very forcible theory of the world, but it is in\nmany passages obscure\u2014to come to him and explain to him what required\nexplanation\u201d (this is certainly not very probable if Heraclitus\u2019 turn\nof mind was also Oriental), he is said to have replied: \u201cAll mortal men\ndepart from truth and justice and are given over to excess and vain\nopinions according to their evil understandings. But I, since I have\nattained to an oblivion of all evil, and shun the overpowering envy\nthat follows me, and the vanity of high position, shall not come to\nPersia. I am content with little and live in my own way.\u201d\nThe only work that he wrote, and the title of which, Diogenes tells\nus, was by some stated to be \u201cThe Muses\u201d and by others \u201cOn Nature,\u201d\nhe deposited in the temple of Diana at Ephesus. It seems to have been\npreserved until modern times; the fragments which have come down to\nus are collected together in Stephanus\u2019 _Po\u00ebsis philosophica_ (p.\n129, seq.). Schleiermacher also collected them and arranged them in a\ncharacteristic way. The title is \u201cHeraclitus, the Dark, of Ephesus,\nas represented in fragments of his work and by the testimony of the\nancients,\u201d and it is to be found in Wolf and Buttmann\u2019s \u201cMuseum of\nancient Learning,\u201d vol. I. (Berlin, 1807) pp. 315-533. Seventy-three\npassages are given. Kreuzer made one hope that he would work at\nHeraclitus more critically and with a knowledge of the language.\nHe made a more complete collection, particularly from grammarians;\nhowever, as, for lack of time, he left it to be worked up by a younger\nscholar, and as the latter died, it never came before the public.\nCompilations of the kind are as a rule too copious: they contain a\nmass of learning and are more easily written than read. Heraclitus\nhas been considered obscure, and is indeed celebrated for this; it\nalso drew upon him the name of _\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2_. Cicero (De Nat. Deor. I.\n26; III. 14; De Finib. II. 5) takes up a wrong idea, as often happens\nto him; he thinks that Heraclitus purposely wrote obscurely. Any\nsuch design would, however, be a very shallow one, and it is really\nnothing but the shallowness of Cicero himself ascribed by him to\nHeraclitus. Heraclitus\u2019 obscurity is rather a result of neglecting\nproper composition and of imperfect language; this is what was thought\nby Aristotle (Rhet. III. 5), who, from a grammatical point of view,\nascribed it to a want of punctuation: \u201cWe do not know whether a word\nbelongs to what precedes or what succeeds.\u201d Demetrius is of the same\nopinion (De Elocutione, \u00a7 192, p. 78, ed. Schneider). Socrates, as\nDiogenes Laertius relates (II. 22; IX. 11-12), said of this book: \u201cWhat\nhe understood of it was excellent, and what he did not understand he\nbelieved to be as good, but it requires a vigorous (_\u0394\u03b7\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5_) swimmer\nto make his way through it.\u201d The obscurity of this philosophy, however,\nchiefly consists in there being profound speculative thought contained\nin it; the Notion, the Idea, is foreign to the understanding and\ncannot be grasped by it, though it may find mathematics quite simple.\nPlato studied the philosophy of Heraclitus with special diligence; we\nfind much of it quoted in his works, and he got his earlier philosophic\neducation most indubitably from this source, so that Heraclitus may\nbe called Plato\u2019s teacher. Hippocrates, likewise, is a philosopher of\nHeraclitus\u2019 school. What is preserved to us of Heraclitus\u2019 philosophy\nat first seems very contradictory, but we find the Notion making its\nappearance, and a man of profound reflection revealed. Zeno began\nto abrogate the opposed predicates, and he shows the opposition in\nmovement, an assertion of limitation and an abrogation of the same;\nZeno expressed the infinite, but on its negative side only, in\nreference to its contradiction as being the untrue. In Heraclitus we\nsee the perfection of knowledge so far as it has gone, a perfecting of\nthe Idea into a totality, which is the beginning of Philosophy, since\nit expresses the essence of the Idea, the Notion of the infinite, the\npotentially and actively existent, as that which it is, i.e. as the\nunity of opposites. From Heraclitus dates the ever-remaining Idea which\nis the same in all philosophers to the present day, as it was the Idea\nof Plato and of Aristotle.\n1. _The Logical Principle._ Concerning the universal principle, this\nbold mind, Aristotle tells us (Metaph. IV. 3 and 7), first uttered the\ngreat saying: \u201cBeing and non-being are the same; everything is and yet\nis not.\u201d The truth only is as the unity of distinct opposites and,\nindeed, of the pure opposition of being and non-being; but with the\nEleatics we have the abstract understanding that Being is alone the\ntruth. We say, in place of using the expression of Heraclitus, that\nthe Absolute is the unity of being and non-being. When we understand\nthat proposition as that \u201cBeing is and yet is not,\u201d this does not seem\nto make much sense, but only to imply complete negation and want of\nthought. But we have another sentence that gives the meaning of the\nprinciple better. For Heraclitus says: \u201cEverything is in a state of\nflux; nothing subsists nor does it ever remain the same.\u201d And Plato\nfurther says of Heraclitus: \u201cHe compares things to the current of a\nriver: no one can go twice into the same stream,\u201d[61] for it flows on\nand other water is disturbed. Aristotle tells us (Met. IV. 5) that his\nsuccessors even said \u201cit could not once be entered,\u201d for it changed\ndirectly; what is, is not again. Aristotle (De C\u0153lo, III. 1) goes on\nto say that Heraclitus declares that \u201cthere is only one that remains,\nand from out of this all else is formed; all except this one is not\nenduring (_\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03c2_).\u201d\nThis universal principle is better characterized as Becoming, the truth\nof Being; since everything is and is not, Heraclitus hereby expressed\nthat everything is Becoming. Not merely does origination belong to it,\nbut passing away as well; both are not independent, but identical.\nIt is a great advance in thought to pass from Being to Becoming,\neven if, as the first unity of opposite determinations, it is still\nabstract. Because in this relationship both must be unrestful and\ntherefore contain within themselves the principle of life, the lack of\nmotion which Aristotle has demonstrated in the earlier philosophies\nis supplied, and this last is even made to be the principle. This\nphilosophy is thus not one past and gone; its principle is essential,\nand is to be found in the beginning of my Logic, immediately after\nBeing and Nothing. The recognition of the fact that Being and non-being\nare abstractions devoid of truth, that the first truth is to be found\nin Becoming, forms a great advance. The understanding comprehends\nboth as having truth and value in isolation; reason, on the other\nhand, recognizes the one in the other, and sees that in the one its\n\u201cother\u201d is contained. If we do not take the conception of existence\nas complete, the pure Being of simple thought in which everything\ndefinite is denied, is the absolute negative; but nothing is the\nsame, or just this self-identity. We here have an absolute transition\ninto the opposite which Zeno did not reach, for he remained at the\nproposition, \u201cFrom nothing, comes nothing.\u201d With Heraclitus, however,\nthe moment of negativity is immanent, and the Notion of Philosophy as\ncomplete is therefore dealt with.\nIn the first place we have here the abstract idea of Being and\nnon-being in a form altogether immediate and general; but when we look\ncloser, we find that Heraclitus also conceived of the opposites and\ntheir unification in a more definite manner. He says: \u201cThe opposites\nare combined in the self-same one, just as honey is both sweet and\nbitter.\u201d Sextus remarks of this (Pyrrh. Hyp. I. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 210, 211; II. 6,\n\u00a7 63): \u201cHeraclitus, like the Sceptics, proceeds from ordinary ideas; no\none will deny that healthy men call honey sweet, while those who are\nsick will say it is bitter.\u201d If it is only sweet, it cannot alter its\nnature in another individual; it would in all places and even to the\njaundiced patient be sweet. Aristotle (De mundo, 5) quotes this from\nHeraclitus: \u201cJoin together the complete whole and the incomplete\u201d (the\nwhole makes itself the part, and the meaning of the part is to become\nthe whole), \u201cwhat coincides and what conflicts, what is harmonious and\nwhat discordant, and from out of them all comes one, and from one,\nall.\u201d This one is not an abstraction, but the activity of dividing\nitself into opposites; the dead infinite is a poor abstraction as\ncompared with the depths of Heraclitus. All that is concrete, as that\nGod created the world, divided Himself, begot a Son, is contained in\nthis determination. Sextus Empiricus mentions (adv. Math. IX. 337) that\nHeraclitus said: \u201cThe part is something different from the whole and\nis yet the same as the whole; substance is the whole and the part, the\nwhole in the universe and the part in this living being.\u201d Plato says in\nhis Symposium (p. 187, Steph.; p. 397, Bekk.) of Heraclitus\u2019 principle:\n\u201cThe one, separated from itself, makes itself one with itself like the\nharmony of the bow and the lyre.\u201d He then makes Eryximachus, who speaks\nin the Symposium, criticize this thus: \u201cIn harmony there is discord, or\nit arises from opposites; for harmony does not arise from height and\ndepth in that they are different, but from their union through the art\nof music.\u201d But this does not contradict Heraclitus, who means the same\nthing. That which is simple, the repetition of a tone, is no harmony;\ndifference is clearly necessary to harmony, or a definite antithesis;\nfor it is the absolute becoming and not mere change. The real fact is\nthat each particular tone is different from another\u2014not abstractly so\nfrom any other, but from _its_ other\u2014and thus it also can be one. Each\nparticular only is, in so far as its opposite is implicitly contained\nin its Notion. Subjectivity is thus the \u201cother\u201d of objectivity and not\nof a piece of paper, which would be meaningless; since each is the\n\u201cother\u201d of the \u201cother\u201d as its \u201cother,\u201d we here have their identity.\nThis is Heraclitus\u2019 great principle; it may seem obscure, but it\nis speculative. And this to the understanding which maintains the\nindependence of Being and non-being, the subjective and objective, the\nreal and the ideal, is always difficult and dim.\n2. _Natural Philosophy._ In his system Heraclitus did not rest content\nwith thus expressing himself in Notions, or with what is purely\nlogical. But in addition to this universal form in which he advanced\nhis principle, he gave his idea a real and more natural form, and\nhence he is still reckoned as belonging to the Ionic school of natural\nphilosophers. However, as regards this form of reality, historians are\nat variance; most of them, and amongst others, Aristotle (Met. I. 3,\n8), say that he maintained fire to be the existent principle; others,\naccording to Sextus (adv. Math. IX. 360; X. 233), say it was air, and\nothers again assert that he made vapour to be the principle rather\nthan air;[62] even time is, in Sextus (adv. Math. X. 216), given as\nthe primary existence. The question arises as to how this diversity is\nto be comprehended. It must not be believed that all these accounts\nare to be ascribed to the inaccuracy of historians, for the witnesses\nare of the best, like Aristotle and Sextus Empiricus, who do not speak\ncasually of these forms, but definitely, without, however, remarking\nupon any such differences and contradictions. We seem to have a better\nreason in the obscurity of the writing of Heraclitus, which might, by\nthe confusion of its expression, give occasion to misunderstanding.\nBut when regarded closer, this difficulty, which is evident when\nmerely looked at superficially, disappears; it is in the profoundly\nsignificant conceptions of Heraclitus that the true way out of this\ndifficulty manifests itself. Heraclitus could no longer, like Thales,\nexpress water, air or anything similar as an absolute principle\u2014he\ncould no longer do so in the form of a primeval element from which the\nrest proceeds\u2014because he thought of Being as identical with non-being,\nor the infinite Notion; thus the existent, absolute principle cannot\nwith him come forth as a definite and actual thing such as water, but\nmust be water in alteration, or as process only.\n_a._ Understanding the abstract process as time, Heraclitus said:\n\u201cTime is the first corporeal existence,\u201d as Sextus (adv. Math. X. 231,\n232) puts it. Corporeal is an unfortunate expression; the Sceptics\nfrequently pick out the crudest expressions or make thoughts crude\nin the first place so that they may afterwards dispense with them.\nCorporeal here means abstract sensuousness; time, as the first sensuous\nexistence, is the abstract representation of process. It is because\nHeraclitus did not rest at the logical expression of Becoming, but gave\nto his principle the form of the existent, that it was necessary that\ntime should first present itself to him as such; for in the sensuously\nperceptible it is the first form of Becoming. Time is pure Becoming\nas perceived, the pure Notion, that which is simple, and the harmony\nissuing from absolute opposites; its essential nature is to be and not\nto be in one unity, and besides this, it has no other character. It is\nnot that time _is_ or _is not_, for time _is_ non-being immediately in\nBeing and Being immediately in non-being: it is the transition out of\nBeing into non-being, the abstract Notion, but in an objective form,\ni.e. in so far as it is for us. In time there is no past and future,\nbut only the now, and this is, but is not as regards the past; and this\nnon-being, as future, turns round into Being. If we were to say how\nthat which Heraclitus recognized as principle, might, in the pure form\nin which he recognized it, exist for consciousness, we could mention\nnothing else but time; and it quite accords with the principle of\nthought in Heraclitus to define time as the first form of Becoming.\n_b._ But this pure, objective Notion must realize itself more fully,\nand thus we find in fact, that Heraclitus determined the process in a\nmore markedly physical manner. In time we have the moments of Being and\nnon-being manifested as negative only, or as vanishing immediately;\nif we wish to express both these moments as one independent totality,\nthe question is asked, which physical existence corresponds to this\ndetermination. To Heraclitus the truth is to have grasped the essential\nbeing of nature, i.e. to have represented it as implicitly infinite,\nas process in itself; and consequently it is evident to us that\nHeraclitus could not say that the primary principle is air, water, or\nany such thing. They are not themselves process, but fire is process;\nand thus he maintains fire to be the elementary principle, and this is\nthe real form of the Heraclitean principle, the soul and substance of\nthe nature-process. Fire is physical time, absolute unrest, absolute\ndisintegration of existence, the passing away of the \u201cother,\u201d but also\nof itself; and hence we can understand how Heraclitus, proceeding from\nhis fundamental determination, could quite logically call fire the\nNotion of the process.\n_c._ He further made this fire to be a real process; because its\nreality is for itself the whole process, the moments have become\nconcretely determined. Fire, as the metamorphosis of bodily things, is\nthe transformation and exhalation of the determinate; for this process\nHeraclitus used a particular word\u2014evaporation (_\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2_)\u2014but it\nis rather transition. Aristotle (De anim. I. 2) says of Heraclitus in\nthis regard, that, according to his view, \u201cthe soul is the principle\nbecause it is evaporation, the origination of everything; it is what\nis most incorporeal and always in a state of flux.\u201d This is quite\napplicable to the primary principle of Heraclitus.\nFurthermore he determined the real process in its abstract moments\nby separating two sides in it\u2014\u201cthe way upwards (_\u1f41\u03b4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03c9_) and the\nway downwards (_\u1f41\u03b4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9_)\u201d\u2014the one being division, in that it is\nthe existence of opposites, and the other the unification of these\nexistent opposites. Corresponding to these, he had, according to\nDiogenes (IX. 8), the further determinations \u201cof enmity and strife\n(_\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2_, _\u1f14\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2_), and friendship and harmony (_\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1_, _\u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7_);\nof these two, enmity and strife is that which is the principle of\nthe origination of differences; but what leads to combustion is\nharmony and peace.\u201d In enmity amongst men, the one sets himself up\nindependently of the other, or is for himself and realizes himself; but\nunity and peace is sinking out of independence into indivisibility or\nnon-reality. Everything is thre-fold and thereby real unity; nature is\nthe never-resting, and the all is the transition out of the one into\nthe other, from division into unity, and from unity into division.\nThe more detailed accounts of this real process are, in great measure,\ndeficient and contradictory. In this connection, it is in some\naccounts[63] said of Heraclitus that he defined it thus: \u201cOf the forms\ntaken by fire there is first of all the sea, and then of it half is\nthe earth and the other half the lightning flash (_\u03c0\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1_),\u201d the fire\nwhich springs up. This is general and very obscure. Diogenes Laertius\n(IX. 9) says: \u201cFire is condensed into moisture, and when concrete it\nbecomes water; water hardens into earth and this is the way downwards.\nThe earth then again becomes fluid, and from it moisture supervenes,\nand from this the evaporation of the sea, from which all else arises;\nthis is the way upwards. Water divides into a dark evaporation,\nbecoming earth, and into what is pure, sparkling, becoming fire and\nburning in the solar sphere; what is fiery becomes meteors, planets and\nstars.\u201d These are thus not still, dead stars, but are regarded as in\nBecoming, as being eternally productive. We thus have, on the whole, a\nmetamorphosis of fire. These oriental, metaphorical expressions are,\nhowever, in Heraclitus not to be taken in their strictly sensuous\nsignification, and as if these changes were present to the outward\nobservation; but they depict the nature of these elements by which the\nearth eternally creates its suns and comets.\nNature is thus a circle. With this in view, we find Heraclitus,\naccording to Clement of Alexandria (Strom. V. 14, p. 711), saying:\n\u201cThe universe was made neither by God nor man, but it ever was and is,\nand will be, a living fire, that which, in accordance with its laws,\n(_\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1ff3_) kindles and goes out.\u201d We now understand what Aristotle says\nof the principle being the soul, since the latter is evaporation; that\nis to say, fire, as this self-moving process of the world, is the\nsoul. Another statement follows, which is also found in Clement of\nAlexandria (Strom. VI. 2, p. 746): \u201cTo souls (to the living) death is\nthe becoming water; to water death is the becoming earth; on the other\nhand from earth, water arises, and from water, the soul.\u201d Thus, on the\nwhole, this process is one of extinction, of going back from opposition\ninto unity, of the re-awakening of the former, and of issuing forth\nfrom one. The extinction of the soul, of the fire in water, the\nconflagration that finally results, some, and amongst others, Diogenes\nLaertius (IX. 8), Eusebius (Pr\u00e6p. Evang. XIV. 3) and Tennemann (Vol.\nI. p. 218), falsely assert to be a conflagration of the world. What\nHeraclitus is said to have spoken of as a conflagration of this world,\nwas thought to be an imaginary idea that after a certain time\u2014as,\naccording to our ideas, at the end of the world\u2014the world would\ndisappear in flames. But we see at once from passages which are most\nclear,[64] that this conflagration is not meant, but that it is the\nperpetual burning up as the Becoming of friendship, the universal life\nand the universal process of the universe. In respect of the fact that,\naccording to Heraclitus, fire is the animating, or the soul, we find\nin Plutarch (De esu. carn. I. p. 995, ed. Xyl.) an expression which\nmay seem odd, namely, that \u201cthe driest soul is the best.\u201d We certainly\ndo not esteem the most moist the best, but, on the other hand, the one\nwhich is most alive; however dry here signifies fiery and thus the\ndriest soul is pure fire, and this is not lifeless but life itself.\nThese are the principal moments of the real life-process; I will stop\nhere a moment because we here find expressed the whole Notion of\nspeculative reflection regarding Nature. In this Notion, one moment\nand one element goes over into the other; fire becomes water, water\nearth and fire. The contention about the transmutation and immutability\nof the elements is an old one; in this conception the ordinary,\nsensuous science of nature separates itself from natural philosophy.\nIn the speculative point of view, which is that of Heraclitus, the\nsimple substance in fire and the other elements in itself becomes\nmetamorphosed; in the other, all transition is abolished and only an\nexternal separation of what is already there is maintained. Water is\njust water, fire is fire, &c. If the former point of view upholds\ntransmutation, the latter believes in the possibility of demonstrating\nthe opposite; it no longer, indeed, maintains water, fire, &c., to\nbe simple realities, for it resolves them into hydrogen, oxygen,\n&c., but it asserts their immutability. It justly asserts that what\nis asserted and implied in the speculative point of view, must also\nhave the truth of actuality; for if to be the speculative means to be\nthe very nature and principle of its elements, this must likewise be\npresent. We are wrong in representing the speculative to be something\nexistent only in thought or inwardly, which is no one knows where. It\nis really present, but men of learning shut their eyes to it because\nof their limited point of view. If we listen to their account, they\nonly observe and say what they see; but their observation is not true,\nfor unconsciously they transform what is seen through their limited\nand stereotyped conception; the strife is not due to the opposition\nbetween observation and the absolute Notion, but between the one Notion\nand the other. They show that changes\u2014such as that of water into\nearth\u2014are non-existent. Even in modern times this transformation was\nindeed maintained, for when water was distilled, a residuum of earth\nwas found. On this subject, however, Lavoisier carried on a number\nof very conclusive researches; he weighed all the receptacles, and\nit was shown that the residuum proceeded from the vessels. There is\na superficial process that does not carry us beyond the determinate\nnature of substance. They say in reference to it, \u201cwater does not\nchange into air but only into moisture, and moisture always condenses\nback into water again.\u201d But in this they merely fix on a one-sided,\ninsufficient process, and give it out to be the absolute process. In\nthe real process of nature they, however, found by experience that the\ncrystal dissolved gives water, and in the crystal, water is lost and\nsolidifies, or becomes the so-called water of crystallization; they\nfound that the evaporation of the earth is not to be found as moisture,\nin outward form in the air, for air remains quite pure, or hydrogen\nentirely disappears in pure air; they have sought in vain to find\nhydrogen in the atmospheric air. Similarly they discovered that quite\ndry air in which they can show neither moisture nor hydrogen, passes\ninto mist, rain, &c. These are their observations, but they spoilt all\ntheir perceptions of changes by the fixed conception which they brought\nwith them of whole and part, and of consistence out of parts, and of\nthe previous presence as such, of what manifests itself in coming into\nexistence. When the crystal dissolved reveals water, they say, \u201cit is\nnot that water has arisen, for it was already present there.\u201d When\nwater in its decomposition reveals hydrogen and oxygen, that means,\naccording to them, \u201cthese last have not arisen for they were already\nthere as such, as the parts of which the water subsists.\u201d But they can\nneither demonstrate water in crystal nor oxygen and hydrogen in water,\nand the same is true of \u201clatent heat.\u201d As we find in all expression\nof perception and experience, as soon as men speak, there is a Notion\npresent; it cannot be withheld, for in consciousness there always is a\ntouch of universality and truth. For the Notion is the real principle,\nbut it is only to cultured reason that it is absolute Notion, and not\nif it remains, as here, confined in a determinate form. Hence these\nmen necessarily attain to their limits, and they are troubled because\nthey do not find hydrogen in air; hygrometers, flasks full of air\nbrought down from heights by an air-balloon, do not show it to exist.\nAnd similarly the water of crystallization is no longer water, but is\nchanged into earth.\nTo come back to Heraclitus, there is only one thing wanting to the\nprocess, which is that its simple principle should be recognized as\nuniversal Notion. The permanence and rest which Aristotle gives, may be\nmissed. Heraclitus, indeed, says that everything flows on, that nothing\nis existent and only the one remains; but that is the Notion of the\nunity which only exists in opposition and not of that reflected within\nitself. This one, in its unity with the movement of the individuals,\nis the genus, or in its infinitude the simple Notion as thought; as\nsuch, the Idea has still to be determined, and we shall thus find it\nagain as the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras. The universal is the immediate\nsimple unity in opposition which goes back into itself as a process of\ndifferences; but this is also found in Heraclitus; he called this unity\nin opposition Fate (_\u03b5\u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7_) or Necessity.[65] And the Notion of\nnecessity is none other than this, that determinateness constitutes the\nprinciple of the existent as individual, but in that very way, relates\nit to its opposite: this is the absolute \u201cconnection (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_) that\npermeates the Being of the whole.\u201d He calls this \u201cthe ethereal body,\nthe seed of the Becoming of everything\u201d;[66] that to him is the Idea,\nthe universal as reality, as process at rest.\n3. _Relation of the Principle to Consciousness._ There is still\nsomething else to consider, and that is what position in this principle\nHeraclitus gives to consciousness; his philosophy has, on the whole,\na bent towards a philosophy of nature, for the principle, although\nlogical, is apprehended as the universal nature-process. How does this\n_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_ come to consciousness? How is it related to the individual\nsoul? I shall explain this here in greater detail: it is a beautiful,\nnatural, childlike manner of speaking truth of the truth. The universal\nand the unity of the principle of consciousness and of the object,\nand the necessity of objectivity, make their first appearance here.\nSeveral passages from Heraclitus are preserved respecting his views of\nknowledge. From his principle that everything that is, at the same time\nis not, it immediately follows that he holds that sensuous certainty\nhas no truth; for it is the certainty for which something exists as\nactual, which is not so in fact. Not this immediate Being, but absolute\nmediation, Being as thought of, Thought itself, is the true Being.\nHeraclitus in this relation says of sensuous perception\u2014according to\nClement of Alexandria\u2014(Strom. III. 3, p. 520): \u201cWhat we see waking\nis dead, but what we see sleeping, a dream,\u201d and in Sextus (adv.\nMath. VII. 126, 127), \u201cMen\u2019s eyes and ears are bad witnesses, for\nthey have barbarous souls. Reason (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_) is the judge of truth,\nnot the arbitrary, but the only divine and universal judge\u201d\u2014this is\nthe measure, the rhythm, that runs through the Being of everything.\nAbsolute necessity is just the having the truth in consciousness; but\nevery thought, or what proceeds from the individual, every relation\nin which there is only form and which has the content of the ordinary\nidea, is not such; what is so is the universal understanding, the\ndeveloped consciousness of necessity, the identity of subjective and\nobjective. Heraclitus says in this connection, according to Diogenes\n(IX. 1): \u201cMuch learning (_\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03af\u03bd_) does not instruct the mind, else\nit had instructed Hesiod, Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hecat\u00e6us. The only\nwisdom is to know the reason that reigns over all.\u201d\nSextus (adv. Math. VII. 127-133), further describes the attitude of\nthe subjective consciousness, of particular reason, to the universal,\nto this nature-process. That attitude has still a very physical\nappearance, resembling the state of mind we suppose in men who are\nmad or asleep. The waking man is related to things in a universal\nway, which is in conformity with the relation of the things and is\nthe way in which others also regard them, and yet he still retains\nhis independence. If, and in so far as I stand in the objectively\nintelligent connection of this state of mind, I am, just because of\nthis externality, in finitude; but waking, I have the knowledge of the\nnecessity of a connection in the form of objectivity, the knowledge\nof the universal existence, and thus the Idea in finite form. Sextus\nputs this in definite form: \u201cEverything that surrounds us is logical\nand intelligent\u201d\u2014yet not therefore accompanied by consciousness.\n\u201cIf we draw this universal reality through our breath, we shall be\nintelligent, but we are so waking only, sleeping we are in oblivion.\u201d\nThe waking consciousness of the outer world, what belongs to the sphere\nof the understanding, is rather what may be called a condition; but\nhere it is taken as the whole of rational consciousness. \u201cFor in sleep\nthe channels of feeling are closed and the understanding that is in\nus is prevented from uniting (_\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c5\u0390\u03b1\u03c2_) with the surroundings; the\nbreath is the only connection (_\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2_) maintained, and it may\nbe compared to a root.\u201d This breath is thus distinguished from the\nuniversal breath, i.e. from the being of another for us. Reason is this\nprocess with the objective: when we are not in connection with the\nwhole, we only dream. \u201cSeparated, the understanding loses the power of\nconsciousness (_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd_) that it formerly had.\u201d The mind\nas individual unity only, loses objectivity, is not in individuality\nuniversal, is not the Thought which has itself as object. \u201cIn a waking\ncondition, however, the understanding\u2014gazing through the channels of\nsense as though it were through a window, and forming a relationship\nwith the surroundings\u2014maintains the logical power.\u201d We here have the\nideal in its native simplicity. \u201cIn the same way as coals which come\nnear fire, themselves take fire, but apart from it, go out, the part\nwhich is cut off from the surroundings in our bodies becomes, through\nthe separation, almost irrational.\u201d This confutes those who think that\nGod gives wisdom in sleep or in somnambulism. But in connection with\nthe many channels it becomes similar to the whole. This whole, the\nuniversal and divine understanding, in unity with which we are logical,\nis, according to Heraclitus, the essence of truth. Hence that which\nappears as the universal to all, carries with it conviction, for it has\npart in the universal and divine Logos, while what is subscribed to by\nan individual carries with it no conviction from the opposite cause. He\nsays in the beginning of his book on Nature: \u201cSince the surroundings\nare reason, men are irrational both before they hear and when they\nfirst hear. For since what happens, happens according to this reason,\nthey are still inexperienced when they search the sayings and the works\nwhich I expound, distinguishing the nature of everything and explaining\nits relations. But other men do not know what they do awake, just as\nthey forget what they do in sleep.\u201d Heraclitus says further: \u201cWe do and\nthink everything in that we participate in the divine understanding\n(_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_). Hence we must follow the universal understanding. But\nmany live as if they had an understanding (_\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd_) of their own;\nthe understanding is, however, nothing but interpretation\u201d (being\nconscious) \u201cof the manner in which all is ordered. Hence in so far\nas we participate in the knowledge (_\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2_) of it, we are in the\ntruth; but in so far as we are singular (_\u1f30\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd_) we are in error.\u201d\nGreat and important words! We cannot speak of truth in a truer or less\nprejudiced way. Consciousness as consciousness of the universal, is\nalone consciousness of truth; but consciousness of individuality and\naction as individual, an originality which becomes a singularity of\ncontent or of form, is the untrue and bad. Wickedness and error thus\nare constituted by isolating thought and thereby bringing about a\nseparation from the universal. Men usually consider, when they speak of\nthinking something, that it must be something particular, but this is\nquite a delusion.\nHowever much Heraclitus may maintain that there is no truth in sensuous\nknowledge because all that exists is in a state of flux, and that\nthe existence of sensuous certainty is not while it is, he maintains\nthe objective method in knowledge to be none the less necessary. The\nrational, the true, that which I know, is indeed a withdrawal from the\nobjective as from what is sensuous, individual, definite and existent;\nbut what reason knows within itself is necessity or the universal\nof being; it is the principle of thought, as it is the principle of\nthe world. It is this contemplation of truth that Spinoza in his\nEthics (P. II. propos. XLIV., coroll. II. p. 118, ed. Paul), calls \u201ca\ncontemplation of things in the guise of eternity.\u201d The being-for-self\nof reason is not an objectless consciousness, or a dream, but a\nknowledge, that which is for itself; but this being-for-self is\nawake, or is objective and universal, _i.e._ is the same for all. The\ndream is a knowledge of something of which I alone know; fancy may\nbe instanced as just such a dream. Similarly it is by feeling that\nsomething is for me alone, and that I have something in me as in this\nsubject; the feeling may profess to be ever so elevated, yet it really\nis the case that for me as this subject, it is what I feel, and not an\nobject independent of me. But in truth, the object is for me something\nessentially free, and I am for myself devoid of subjectivity; similarly\nthis object is no imaginary one made an object by me alone, but is in\nitself a universal.\nThere are, besides, many other fragments of Heraclitus, solitary\nexpressions, such as his saying, \u201cmen are mortal gods, and gods\nimmortal men; living is death to the former and dying is their\nlife.\u201d[67] Life is the death of the gods, death is the life of the\ngods; the divine is the rising through thought above mere nature which\nbelongs to death. Hence Heraclitus also says, according to Sextus (adv.\nMath. VII., 349): \u201cthe power of thinking is outside the body,\u201d which,\nin a remarkable way, Tennemann makes into: \u201coutside of men.\u201d In Sextus\n(Pyrrh. Hyp. III. 24, \u00a7 230) we further read: \u201cHeraclitus says that\nboth life and death are united in our life as in our death; for if we\nlive, our souls are dead and buried in us, but if we die, our souls\narise and live.\u201d We may, in fact, say of Heraclitus what Socrates said:\n\u201cWhat remains to us of Heraclitus is excellent, and we must conjecture\nof what is lost, that it was as excellent.\u201d Or if we wish to consider\nfate so just as always to preserve to posterity what is best, we must\nat least say of what we have of Heraclitus, that it is worthy of this\npreservation.\nE. EMPEDOCLES, LEUCIPPUS AND DEMOCRITUS.\nWe shall take Leucippus and Democritus with Empedocles; in them\nthere is manifested the ideality of the sensuous and also universal\ndeterminateness or a transition to the universal. Empedocles was\na Pythagorean Italian, whose tendencies were Ionic; Leucippus and\nDemocritus, who incline to the Italians, in that they carried on the\nEleatic school, are more interesting. Both these philosophers belong\nto the same philosophic system; they must be taken together as regards\ntheir philosophic thought and considered thus.[68] Leucippus is the\nolder, and Democritus perfected what the former began, but it is\ndifficult to say what properly speaking belongs to him historically.\nIt is certainly recorded that he developed Leucippus\u2019 thought, and\nthere is, too, some of his work preserved, but it is not worthy of\nquotation. In Empedocles we see the commencement of the determination\nand separation of principles. The becoming conscious of difference is\nan essential moment, but the principles here have in part the character\nof physical Being, and though partaking also of ideal Being, this form\nis not yet thought-form. On the other hand we find in Leucippus and\nDemocritus the more ideal principles, the atom and the Nothing, and we\nalso find thought-determination more immersed in the objective\u2014that\nis, the beginning of a metaphysics of body; or pure Notions possess the\nsignificance of the material, and thus pass over thought into objective\nform. But the teaching is, on the whole, immature, and is incapable of\ngiving satisfaction.\n1. LEUCIPPUS AND DEMOCRITUS.\nNothing is accurately known of the circumstances of Leucippus\u2019 life,\nnot even where he was born. Some, like Diogenes Laertius (IX. 30), make\nhim out to be an Eleatic; others to have belonged to Abdera (because he\nwas with Democritus), or to Melos\u2014Melos is an island not far from the\nPeloponnesian coast\u2014or else, as is asserted by Simplicius in writing\non Aristotle\u2019s Physics (p. 7), to Miletus. It is definitely stated\nthat he was a disciple and a friend of Zeno; yet he seems to have been\nalmost contemporaneous with him as well as with Heraclitus.\nIt is less doubtful that Democritus belonged to Abdera in Thrace, on\nthe Aegean Sea, a town that in later times became so notorious on\naccount of foolish actions. He was born, it would appear, about the\n80th Olympiad (460 B.C.), or Olympiad 77, 3 (470 B.C.); the first date\nis given by Apollodorus (Diog. Laert. IX. 41), the other by Thrasyllus;\nTennemann (Vol. I. p. 415) makes his birth to fall about the 71st\nOlympiad (494 B.C.). According to Diogenes Laertius (IX. 34), he was\nforty years younger than Anaxagoras, lived to the time of Socrates, and\nwas even younger than he\u2014that is supposing him to have been born, not\nin Olympiad 71, but in Olympiad 80. His connection with the Abderites\nhas been much discussed, and many bad anecdotes are told regarding it\nby Diogenes Laertius. That he was very rich, Valerius Maximus (VIII.\n7, ext. 4) judges from the fact that his father entertained the whole\nof Xerxes\u2019 army on its passage to Greece. Diogenes tells (IX. 35, 36)\nthat he expended his means, which were considerable, on journeys to\nEgypt and in penetrating into the East, but this last is not authentic.\nHis possessions are stated to have amounted to a hundred talents, and\nif an Attic talent was worth about from 1000 to 1200 thalers, he must\nundoubtedly have been able to get far enough with that. It is always\nsaid that he was a friend and disciple of Leucippus, as Aristotle\nrelates (Met. I. 4), but where they met is not told. Diogenes (IX. 39)\ngoes on: \u201cAfter he returned from his journeys into his own country,\nhe lived very quietly, for he had consumed all his substance, but\nhe was supported by his brother and attained to high honour amongst\nhis countrymen\u201d\u2014not through his philosophy, but\u2014\u201cby some prophetic\nutterances. According to the law, however, he who ran through his\nfather\u2019s means could not have a place in the paternal burial-place. To\ngive no place to the calumniator or evil speaker\u201d\u2014as though he had\nspent his means through extravagance\u2014\u201che read his work _\u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2_ to\nthe Abderites, and the latter gave him a present of 500 talents, had\nhis statue publicly erected, and buried him with great pomp when, at\n100 years old, he died.\u201d That this was also an Abderite jest, those who\nleft us this narrative, at least, did not see.\nLeucippus is the originator of the famous atomic system which, as\nrecently revived, is held to be the principle of rational science.\nIf we take this system on its own account, it is certainly very\nbarren, and there is not much to be looked for in it; but it must be\nallowed that we are greatly indebted to Leucippus, because, as it is\nexpressed in our ordinary physics, he separated the universal and\nthe sensuous, or the primary and the secondary, or the essential and\nthe nonessential qualities of body. The universal quality means, in\nspeculative language, the fact that the corporeal is really universally\ndetermined through the Notion or the principle of body: Leucippus\nunderstood the determinate nature of Being, not in a superficial\nmanner, but in a speculative. When it is said that body has those\nuniversal qualities, such as form, impenetrability and weight, we think\nthat the indeterminate conception of body is the essence, and that its\nessence is something other than these qualities. But speculatively,\nessential existence is just universal determinations; they are existent\nin themselves, or the abstract content and the reality of existence.\nTo body as such, there is nothing left for the determination of reality\nbut pure singularity; but it is the unity of opposites, and the unity\nof these predicates constitutes its reality.\nLet us recollect that in the Eleatic philosophy Being and non-being\nwere looked at as in opposition; that only Being is, and non-being, in\nwhich category we find motion, change, &c., is not. Being is not as yet\nthe unity turning back, and turned back into itself, like Heraclitus\u2019\nmotion and the universal. It may be said of the point of view that\ndifference, change, motion, &c., fall within sensuous, immediate\nperception, that the assertion that only Being is, is as contradictory\nto appearances as to thought; for the nothing, that which the Eleatics\nabolished, is. Or within the Heraclitean Idea, Being and non-being\nare the same; Being is, but non-being, since it is one with Being, is\nas well, or Being is both the predicate of Being and of non-being.\nBut Being and non-being are both expressed as having the qualities of\nobjectivity, or as they are for sensuous perception, and hence they are\nthe opposition of full and empty. Leucippus says this; he expresses as\nexistent what was really present to the Eleatics. Aristotle says (Met.\nI. 4): \u201cLeucippus and his friend Democritus maintain that the full and\nthe empty are the elements, and they call the one the existent, and the\nother the non-existent; that is, the full and solid are the existent,\nthe empty and rare, the non-existent. Hence they also say that Being\nis no more than non-being because the empty is as well as the bodily;\nand these form the material sources of everything.\u201d The full has the\natom as its principle. The Absolute, what exists in and for itself,\nis thus the atom and the empty (_\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd_): this is an\nimportant, if at the same time, an insufficient explanation. It is not\natoms as we should speak of them, such, for example, as we represent\nto ourselves as floating in the air, that are alone the principle, for\nthe intervening nothing is just as essential. Thus here we have the\nfirst appearance of the atomic system. We must now give the further\nsignification and determination of this principle.\n_a. The Logical Principle_\nThe principal point of consideration is the One, existent for\nitself: this determination is a great principle and one which we\nhave not hitherto had. Parmenides establishes Being or the abstract\nuniversal; Heraclitus, process; the determination of being-for-self\nbelongs to Leucippus. Parmenides says that the nothing does not exist\nat all; with Heraclitus Becoming existed only as the transition of\nBeing into nothing where each is negated; but the view that each is\nsimply at home with itself, the positive as the self-existent one and\nthe negative as empty, is what came to consciousness in Leucippus, and\nbecame the absolute determination. The atomic principle in this manner\nhas not passed away, for it must from this point of view always exist;\nthe being-for-self must in every logical philosophy[69] be an essential\nmoment and yet it must not be put forward as ultimate. In the logical\nprogression from Being and Becoming to this thought-determination,\nBeing as existent here and now[70] certainly first appears, but\nthis last belongs to the sphere of finality and hence cannot be the\nprinciple of Philosophy. Thus, though the development of Philosophy\nin history must correspond to the development of logical philosophy,\nthere will still be passages in it which are absent in historical\ndevelopment. For instance, if we wished to make Being as existent here\nthe principle, it would be what we have in consciousness\u2014there are\nthings, these things are finite and bear a relation to one another\u2014but\nthis is the category of our unthinking knowledge, of appearance.\nBeing-for-self, on the other hand, is, as Being, simple relation to\nitself, but through negation of the other-Being. If I say I am for\nmyself, I not only am, but I negate in me all else, exclude it from\nme, in so far as it seems to me to be external. As negation of other\nbeing, which is just negation in relation to me, being-for-self is\nthe negation of negation and thus affirmation; and this is, as I call\nit, absolute negativity in which mediation indeed is present, but a\nmediation which is just as really taken away.\nThe principle of the One is altogether ideal and belongs entirely to\nthought, even though we wish to say that atoms exist. The atom may be\ntaken materially, but it is supersensuous, purely intellectual. In our\ntimes, too, more especially through the instrumentality of Gassendi,\nthis conception of atoms has been renewed. The atoms of Leucippus are,\nhowever, not molecules, the small particles of Physics. In Leucippus,\naccording to Aristotle, (De gen. et corr. I. 8) there is to be found\nthe idea that \u201catoms are invisible because of the smallness of their\nbody,\u201d which is much like the way in which molecules are now-a-days\nspoken of: but this is merely a way of speaking of them. The One can\nneither be seen nor shown with magnifying glasses or measures, because\nit is an abstraction of thought; what is shown is always matter that is\nput together. It is just as futile when, as in modern times, men try\nby the microscope to investigate the inmost part of the organism, the\nsoul, and think they can discover it by means of sight and feeling.\nThus the principle of the One is altogether ideal, but not in the\nsense of being in thought or in the head alone, but in such a way that\nthought is made the true essence of things. Leucippus understood it\nso, and his philosophy is consequently not at all empirical. Tennemann\n(Vol. 1, p. 261), on the other hand, says, quite wrongly, \u201cThe system\nof Leucippus is opposed to that of the Eleatics; he recognizes the\nempirical world as the only objective reality, and body as the only\nkind of existence.\u201d But the atom and the vacuum are not things of\nexperience; Leucippus says that it is not the senses through which\nwe become conscious of the truth, and thereby he has established an\nidealism in the higher sense and not one which is merely subjective.\n_b. The Constitution of the World_\nHowever abstract this principle might be to Leucippus, he was\nanxious to make it concrete. The meaning of atom is the individual,\nthe indivisible; in another form the One is thus individuality,\nthe determination of subjectivity. The universal and, on the other\nside, the individual, are great determinations which are involved\nin everything, and men first know what they have in these abstract\ndeterminations, when they recognize in the concrete that even there\nthey are predominant. To Leucippus and Democritus this principle, which\nafterwards came to light with Epicurus, remained physical; but it also\nappears in what is intellectual. Mind indeed, is also an atom and one;\nbut as one within itself, it is at the same time infinitely full. In\nfreedom, right and law, in exercising will, our only concern is with\nthis opposition of universality and individuality. In the sphere of\nthe state the point of view that the single will is, as an atom, the\nabsolute, may be maintained; the more modern theories of the state\nwhich also made themselves of practical effect, are of this kind. The\nstate must rest on the universal, that is, on the will that exists\nin and for itself; if it rests on that of the individual, it becomes\natomic and is comprehended in accordance with the thought-determination\nof the one, as is the case in Rousseau\u2019s _Contrat Social_. From what\nAristotle tells us in the passage last quoted, Leucippus\u2019 idea of all\nthat is concrete and actual is further this: \u201cThe full is nothing\nsimple, for it is an infinitely manifold. These infinitely many, move\nin the vacuum, for the vacuum exists; their conglomeration brings\nabout origination\u201d (that is, of an existing thing, or what is for the\nsenses), \u201cdisintegration and separation result in passing away.\u201d All\nother categories are included here. \u201cActivity and passivity subsist in\nthe fact, that they are contiguous; but their contiguity is not their\nbecoming one, for from that which is truly\u201d (abstractly) \u201cone there\ndoes not come a number, nor from that which is truly many, one.\u201d Or,\nit may be said, they are in fact neither passive nor active, \u201cfor they\nmerely abide through the vacuum\u201d without having as their principle,\nprocess. Atoms thus are, even in their apparent union in that which\nwe call things, separated from one another through the vacuum which\nis purely negative and foreign to them, _i.e._ their relation is not\ninherent in themselves, but is with something other than them, in which\nthey remain what they are. This vacuum, the negative in relation to the\naffirmative, is also the principle of the movement of atoms; they are\nso to speak solicited by the vacuum to fill up and to negate it.\nThese are the doctrines of the atomists. We see that we have reached\nthe extreme limits of these thoughts, for when relation comes into\nquestion, we step beyond them. Being and non-being, as something\nthought, which, when represented for consciousness as differing in\nregard to one another, are the plenum and the vacuum, have no diversity\nin themselves; for the plenum has likewise negativity in itself; as\nindependent, it excludes what is different; it is one and infinitely\nmany ones, while the vacuum is not exclusive, but pure continuity. Both\nthese opposites, the one and continuity, being now settled, nothing is\neasier to imagine than that atoms should float in existent continuity,\nnow being separated and now united; and thus that their union should\nbe only a superficial relation, or a synthesis that is not determined\nthrough the inherent nature of what is united, but in which these\nself-existent beings really remain separated still. But this is an\naltogether external relationship; the purely independent is united to\nthe independent, and thus a mechanical combination alone results. All\nthat is living, spiritual, &c., is then merely thrown together; and\nchange, origination, creation, are simple union.\nHowever highly these principles are to be esteemed as a forward step,\nthey at once reveal to us their total inadequacy, as is also the\ncase when we enter with them on further concrete determinations.\nNevertheless, we need not add what is in great measure added by the\nconception of a later date, that once upon a time, there was a chaos, a\nvoid filled with atoms, which afterwards became united and orderly, and\nthat the world thereby arose; it is now and ever that what implicitly\nexists is the plenum and the vacuum. The satisfying point of view which\nnatural science found in such thoughts, is just the simple fact that in\nthese the existent is in its antithesis as what is thought and what is\nopposed to thought, and is hereby what exists in and for itself. The\nAtomists are therefore, generally speaking, opposed to the idea of the\ncreation and maintenance of this world by means of a foreign principle.\nIt is in the theory of atoms that science first feels released from\nthe sense of having no foundation for the world. For if nature is\nrepresented as created and held together by another, it is conceived\nof as not existent in itself, and thus as having its Notion outside\nitself, _i.e._ its principle or origin is foreign to it and it has no\nprinciple as such, only being conceivable from the will of another; as\nit is, it is contingent, devoid of necessity and Notion in itself. In\nthe conception of the atomist, however, we have the conception of the\ninherency of nature, that is to say, thought finds itself in it, or\nits principle is in itself something thought, and the Notion finds its\nsatisfaction in conceiving and establishing it as Notion. In abstract\nexistence, nature has its ground in itself and is simply for itself;\nthe atom and the vacuum are just such simple Notions. But we cannot\nhere see or find more than the formal fact that quite general and\nsimple principles, the antithesis between the one and continuity, are\nrepresented.\nIf we proceed from a wider, richer point of view in nature, and demand\nthat from the atomic theory, it, too, must be made comprehensible, the\nsatisfaction at once disappears and we see the impossibility of getting\nany further. Hence we must get beyond these pure thoughts of continuity\nand discontinuity. For these negations, the units, are not in and for\nthemselves; the atoms are indivisible and like themselves, or their\nprinciple is made pure continuity, so that they may be said to come\ndirectly into one clump. The conception certainly keeps them separate\nand gives them a sensuously represented Being; but if they are alike,\nthey are, as pure continuity, the same as what is empty. But that which\nis, is concrete and determined. How then can diversity be conceived\nof from these principles? Whence comes the determinate character of\nplants, colour, form? The point is, that though these atoms as small\nparticles may be allowed to subsist as independent, their union becomes\nmerely a combination which is altogether external and accidental. The\ndeterminate difference is missed; the one, as that which is for itself,\nloses all its determinateness. If various matters, electrical, magnetic\nand luminous, are assumed, and, at the same time, a mechanical shifting\nabout of molecules, on the one hand unity is quite disregarded, and, on\nthe other, no rational word is uttered in regard to the transition of\nphenomena, but only what is tautological.\nSince Leucippus and Democritus wished to go further, the necessity of\na more definite distinction than this superficial one of union and\nseparation was introduced, and they sought to bring this about by\nascribing diversity to atoms, and, indeed, by making their diversity\ninfinite. Aristotle (Met. I. 4) says: \u201cThis diversity they sought to\ndetermine in three ways. They say that atoms differ in figure, as A\ndoes from N; in order\u201d (place) \u201cas AN from NA; in position\u201d\u2014as to\nwhether they stand upright or lie\u2014\u201cas Z from N. From these all other\ndifferences must come.\u201d We see that figure, order and posture are again\nexternal relationships, indifferent determinations, _i.e._ unessential\nrelations which do not affect the nature of the thing in itself nor its\nimmanent determinateness, for their unity is only in another. Taken on\nits own account, this difference is indeed inconsistent, for as the\nentirely simple one, the atoms are perfectly alike, and thus any such\ndiversity cannot come into question.\nWe here have an endeavour to lead the sensuous back into few\ndeterminations. Aristotle (De gen. et corr. I. 8) says in this\nconnection of Leucippus: \u201cHe wished to bring the conception of the\nphenomenal and sensuous perception nearer, and thereby represented\nmovement, origination and decease, as existent in themselves.\u201d In\nthis we see no more than that actuality from him receives its rights,\nwhile others speak only of deception. But when Leucippus in the end\nrepresents the atom as also fashioned in itself, he brings existence\ncertainly so much nearer to sensuous perception, but not to the Notion;\nwe must, indeed, go on to fashioning, but so far we are still a long\nway off from the determination of continuity and discretion. Aristotle\n(De sensu, 4) therefore says: \u201cDemocritus, and most of the other\nancient philosophers are, when they speak of what is sensuous, very\nawkward, because they wish to make all that is felt into something\ntangible; they reduce everything to what is evident to the sense of\ntouch, black being rough, and white smooth.\u201d All sensuous qualities are\nthus only led back to form, to the various ways of uniting molecules\nwhich make any particular thing capable of being tasted or smelt; and\nthis endeavour is one which is also made by the atomists of modern\ntimes. The French particularly, from Descartes onward, stand in this\ncategory. It is the instinct of reason to understand the phenomenal\nand the perceptible, only the way is false; it is a quite unmeaning,\nundetermined universality. Since figure, order, posture and form,\nconstitute the only determination of what is in itself, nothing is said\nas to how these moments are experienced as colour, and indeed variety\nof colour, &c.; the transition to other than mechanical determinations\nis not made, or it shows itself to be shallow and barren.\nHow it was that Leucippus, from these poor principles of atoms and\nof the vacuum, which he never got beyond, because he took them to be\nthe absolute, hazarded a construction of the whole world (which may\nappear to us as strange as it is empty), Diogenes Laertius tells us\n(IX. 31-33) in an account which seems meaningless enough. But the\nnature of the subject allows of little better, and we can do no more\nthan observe from it the barrenness of this conception. It runs thus:\n\u201cAtoms, divergent in form, propel themselves through their separation\nfrom the infinite, into the great vacuum.\u201d (Democritus adds to this,\n\u201cby means of their mutual resistance (_\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03af\u03b1_) and a tremulous,\nswinging motion (_\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2_).\u201d)[71] \u201cHere gathered, they form one vortex\n(_\u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd_) where, by dashing together and revolving round in all sorts\nof ways, the like are separated off with the like. But since they are\nof equal weight, when they cannot, on account of their number, move\nin any way, the finer go into outer vacuum, being so to speak forced\nout; and the others remain together and, being entangled, run one\nagainst another, and form the first round system. But this stands apart\nlike a husk that holds within it all sorts of bodies; since these, in\npressing towards the middle, make a vortex movement, this encircling\nskin becomes thin, because from the action of the vortex, they are\ncontinually running together. The earth arises in this way, because\nthese bodies, collected in the middle, remain together. That which\nencircles and which is like a husk, again becomes increased by means of\nthe adherence of external bodies, and since it also moves within the\nvortex, it draws everything with which it comes in contact to itself.\nThe union of some of these bodies again forms a system, first the moist\nand slimy, and then the dry, and that which circles in the vortex of\nthe whole; after that, being ignited, they constitute the substance of\nthe stars. The outer circle is the sun, the inner the moon,\u201d &c. This\nis an empty representation; there is no interest in these dry, confused\nideas of circle-motion, and of what is later on called attraction\nand repulsion, beyond the fact that the different kinds of motion are\nlooked at as the principle of matter.\n_c. The Soul_\nFinally Aristotle relates (De anim. I. 2) that in regard to the\nsoul, Leucippus and Democritus said that \u201cit is spherical atoms.\u201d We\nfind further from Plutarch (De plac. phil. IV. 8) that Democritus\napplied himself to the relation borne by consciousness to the\nexplanation, amongst other things, of the origin of feelings, because\nwith him, the conceptions that from things fine surfaces, so to speak,\nfree themselves, and fly into the eyes, ears, &c., first began. We see\nthat, thus far, Democritus expressed the difference between the moments\nof implicit Being and Being-for-another more distinctly. For he said,\nas Sextus tells us (adv. Math. VII. 135): \u201cWarmth exists according\nto opinion (_\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u1ff3_), and so do cold and colour, sweet and bitter:\nonly the indivisible and void are truthful (_\u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u1fc7_).\u201d That is to say,\nonly the void and indivisible and their determinations are implicit;\nunessential, different Being, such as warmth, &c., is for another. But\nby this the way is at once opened up to the false idealism that means\nto be done with what is objective by bringing it into relation with\nconsciousness, merely saying of it that it is _my_ feeling. Thereby\nsensuous individuality is, indeed, annulled in the form of Being, but\nit still remains the same sensuous manifold; a sensuously notionless\nmanifold of feeling is established, in which there is no reason, and\nwith which this idealism has no further concern.\n2. EMPEDOCLES.\nThe fragments of Empedocles left, have several times been collected.\nSturz of Leipzig collected above 400 verses.[72] Peyron arranged a\ncollection of fragments of Empedocles and Parmenides,[73] which was put\ninto print in Leipzig in 1810. In Wolff\u2019s Analects, a treatise is to be\nfound on Empedocles by Ritter.\nEmpedocles\u2019 birthplace was Agrigentum in Sicily, while Heraclitus\nbelonged to Asia Minor. We thus come back to Italy, for our history\nchanges about between these two sides; from Greece proper, as the\nmiddle point, we have as yet had no philosophies at all. Empedocles,\naccording to Tennemann (Vol. I. p. 415), flourished about the 80th\nOlympiad (460 B.C.). Sturz (pp. 9, 10) quotes Dodwell\u2019s words: (De\n\u00e6tate Pythag. p. 220), which indicate that Empedocles was born in\nOlympiad 77, 1 (472 B.C.). They are as follows: \u201cIn the second year of\nthe 85th Olympiad Parmenides had reached his 65th year, so that Zeno\nwas born in the second year of the 75th Olympiad;[74] thus he was six\nyears older than his fellow-student Empedocles, for the latter was\nonly one year old when Pythagoras died in the first or second year of\nthe 77th Olympiad.\u201d Aristotle says (Met. I. 3): \u201cIn age Empedocles is\nsubsequent to Anaxagoras, but his works are earlier.\u201d But not only did\nhe philosophize earlier as regards time, that is, at a younger age,\nbut in reference to the stage reached by the Notion, his philosophy is\nearlier and less mature than that of Anaxagoras.\nFrom Diogenes\u2019 accounts of his life (VIII. 59, 60-73), he also seems\nto have been a kind of magician and sorcerer, like Pythagoras. During\nhis life he was much respected by his fellow-citizens, and, after\nhis death, a statue was erected to him in his native town; his fame\nextended very far. He did not live apart, like Heraclitus, but in the\nexercise of great influence on the affairs of the town of Agrigentum,\nlike Parmenides in Elea. He acquired the credit, after the death of\nMeton, the ruler of Agrigentum, of bringing about a free constitution\nand equal rights to all citizens. He likewise frustrated several\nattempts which were made by people of Agrigentum to seize upon the\nrulership of their city; and when the esteem of his fellow-citizens\nrose so high that they offered him the crown, he rejected their offers,\nand lived ever after amongst them as a respected private individual.\nBoth of his life and death much which was fabulous was told. Seeing\nthat he was famous in life, we are told that he wished not to appear\nto die an ordinary death, as a proof that he was not a mortal man, but\nhad merely passed out of sight. After a feast he is said either to have\nsuddenly disappeared, or else to have been on Etna with his friends,\nand suddenly to have been seen of them no more. But what became of him\nwas revealed by the fact that one of his shoes was thrown up by Etna,\nand found by one of his friends; this made it clear that he threw\nhimself into Etna, thereby to withdraw himself from the notice of\nmankind, and to give rise to the idea that he did not really die, but\nthat he was taken up amongst the gods.\nThe origin and occasion for this fable seems to lie in a poem in which\nthere are several verses that, taken alone, make great professions.\nHe says, according to Sturz, (p. 530: Reliqui\u00e6 _\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd_, v.\n364-376):\u2014\n\u201cFriends who dwell within the fort on yellow Acragas\nAnd who in the best of works are busy, I greet you!\nTo you I am an immortal god, no more a mortal man,\nDo ye not see how that where\u2019er I go, all honour me,\nMy head being \u2018circled round with diadems and crowns of green?\nWhen so decked out, I show myself in towns of wealth,\nMen and women pray to me. And thousands follow\nMy steps, to seek from me the way to bliss,\nOthers ask for prophecies; others again,\nHealing words for ailments manifold beseech.\nBut what is this to me\u2014as though \u2018twere anything\nBy art to conquer much corrupted man.\u201d\nBut, taken in the context, this laudation means that I am highly\nhonoured, but what is the value of that to me; it expresses weariness\nof the honour given him by men.\nEmpedocles had Pythagoreans as pupils, and went about with them; he\nis sometimes considered to have been a Pythagorean like Parmenides\nand Zeno, but this is the only ground for such a statement. It is a\nquestion whether he belonged to the League; his philosophy has no\nresemblance to the Pythagorean. According to Diogenes Laertius (VIII.\n56), he was also called Zeno\u2019s fellow-pupil. There have, indeed, been\nmany isolated reflections of a physical kind preserved to us, as also\nsome words of exhortation, and in him thought as penetrating within\nreality, and the knowledge of nature seem to have attained to greater\nbreadth and compass; we find in him, however, less speculative depth\nthan in Heraclitus, but a Notion more imbued with the point of view\nof reality, and a culture derived from natural philosophy or the\ncontemplation of nature. Empedocles is more poetic than definitely\nphilosophical; he is not very interesting, and much cannot be made of\nhis philosophy.\nAs to the particular Notion which governs it, and which really begins\nin it to appear, we may call it Combination or Synthesis. It is as\ncombination that the unity of opposites first presents itself; this\nNotion, first opening up with Heraclitus, is, while in a condition\nof rest, conceived of as combination, before thought grasps the\nuniversal in Anaxagoras. Empedocles\u2019 synthesis, as a completion of\nthe relationship, thus belongs to Heraclitus, whose speculative Idea,\nthough in reality, is process, but this is so without the individual\nmoments in reality being mutually related as Notions. Empedocles\u2019\nconception of synthesis holds good to the present day. He also is\nthe originator of the common idea that has even come down to us, of\nregarding the four known physical elements of fire, air, water, and\nearth, as fundamental; by chemists they are certainly no longer held\nto be elements, because they understand by elements a simple chemical\nsubstance. I will now give Empedocles\u2019 ideas shortly, and draw the many\nunits mentioned into the connection of a whole.\nHis general ideas Aristotle[75] shortly sums up thus: \u201cTo the three\nelements, fire, air, and water, each of which was in turn considered\nas the principle from which everything proceeded, Empedocles added\nthe Earth as the fourth corporeal element, saying that it is these\nwhich always remain the same, never becoming, but being united and\nseparated as the more or the less, combining into one and coming\nout of one.\u201d Carbon, metal, &c., are not something existing in and\nfor itself which remains constant and never becomes; thus nothing\nmetaphysical is signified by them. But with Empedocles this undoubtedly\nis the case: every particular thing arises through some kind of union\nof the four. These four elements, to our ordinary idea, are not so\nmany sensuous things if we consider them as universal elements; for,\nlooked at sensuously, there are various other sensuous things. All\nthat is organic, for example, is of another kind; and, further, earth\nas one, as simple, pure earth, does not exist, for it is in manifold\ndeterminateness. In the idea of four elements we have the elevation of\nsensuous ideas into thought.\nAristotle further says in reference to the abstract Notion of their\nrelation to one another (Met. I. 4), that Empedocles did not only\nrequire the four elements as principles, but also Friendship and\nStrife, which we have already met with in Heraclitus; it is at once\nevident that these are of another kind, because they are, properly\nspeaking, universal. He has the four natural elements as the real, and\nfriendship and strife as the ideal principles, so that six elements,\nof which Sextus[76] often speaks, make their appearance in lines\nthat Aristotle (Met. II. 4) and Sextus (adv. Math. VII. 92) have\npreserved:\u2014\n\u201cWith the earth, we see the earth, with water, water,\nWith air, heavenly air, with fire, eternal fire,\nWith love, love is seen, and strife with sorrowful strife.\u201d\nThrough our participation in them they become for us. There we have the\nidea that spirit, the soul, is itself the unity, the very totality of\nelements, in which the principle of earth relates to earth, water to\nwater, love to love, &c.[77] In seeing fire, the fire is in us for whom\nobjective fire is, and so on.\nEmpedocles also speaks of the process of these elements, but he did not\ncomprehend it further; the point to be remarked is that he represented\ntheir unity as a combination. In this synthetic union, which is a\nsuperficial relation devoid of Notion, being partly related and partly\nunrelated, the contradiction necessarily results that at one time the\nunity of elements is established and at another, their separation:\nthe unity is not the universal unity in which they are moments,\nbeing even in their diversity one, and in their unity different, for\nthese two moments, unity and diversity, fall asunder, and union and\nseparation are quite indeterminate relationships. Empedocles says in\nthe first book of his poem on Nature, as given by Sturz (p. 517, v.\n106-109): \u201cThere is no such thing as a Nature, only a combination and\nseparation of what is combined; it is merely called Nature by men.\u201d\nThat is to say, that which constitutes anything, as being its elements\nor parts, is not as yet called its nature, but only its determinate\nunity. For example, the nature of an animal is its constant and real\ndeterminateness, its kind, its universality, which is simple. But\nEmpedocles does away with nature in this sense, for every thing,\naccording to him, is the combination of simple elements, and thus\nnot in itself the universal, simple and true: this is not what is\nsignified by us when we speak of nature. Now this nature in which a\nthing moves in accordance with its own end, Aristotle (De gen. et\ncorr. II. 6) misses in Empedocles; in later times this conception was\nstill further lost. Because the elements were thus existent simply in\nthemselves, there was, properly speaking, no process established in\nthem, for in process they are only vanishing moments, and not existent\nin themselves. Being thus implicit, they must have been unchangeable,\nor they could not constitute themselves into a unity; for in the one\ntheir subsistence, or their implicit existence would be destroyed. But\nbecause Empedocles says that things subsist from these elements, he\nimmediately establishes their unity.\nThese are the principal points in Empedocles\u2019 philosophy. I will quote\nthe remarks that Aristotle (Met. I. 4) makes in this regard.\n(_\u03b1_) \u201cIf we wish to follow this up, and do so in accordance with\nthe understanding, not merely stumbling over it like Empedocles, we\nshould say that friendship is the principle of good and strife the\nprinciple of evil, so that in a measure we may assert that Empedocles\nmaintained\u2014and was the first to do so\u2014that the evil and the good\nare the absolute principles, because the good is the principle of all\ngood, and the bad the principle of all evil.\u201d Aristotle shows the trace\nof universality present here; for to him it may be termed essential\nin dealing with the Notion of the principle, that which is in and for\nitself. But this is only the Notion, or the thought which is present\nin and for itself; we have not yet seen such a principle, for we find\nit first in Anaxagoras. If Aristotle found the principle of motion\nmissed in ancient philosophers, in the Becoming of Heraclitus, he again\nmissed in Heraclitus the still deeper principle of the Good, and hence\nwished to discover it in Empedocles. By the good the \u201cwhy\u201d is to be\nunderstood, that which is an end in and for itself, which is clearly\nestablished in itself, which is on its own account, and through which\nall else is; the end has the determination of activity, the bringing\nforth of itself, so that it, as end to itself, is the Idea, the Notion\nthat makes itself objective and, in its objectivity, is identical with\nitself. Aristotle thus entirely controverts Heraclitus, because his\nprinciple is change alone, without remaining like self, maintaining\nself, and going back within self.\n(_\u03b2_) Aristotle also says in criticizing further the relationship\nand determination of these two universal principles of Friendship\nand Strife, as of union and separation, that \u201cEmpedocles neither\nadequately made use of them nor discovered in them what they involved\n(_\u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd_); for with him friendship frequently\ndivides and strife unites. That is, when the All falls asunder through\nstrife amongst the elements, fire is thereby united into one, and\nso is each of the other elements.\u201d The separation of the elements\nwhich are comprised within the All, is just as necessarily the union\namongst themselves of the parts of each element; that which, on the\none hand, is the coming into separation, as independent, is at the\nsame time something united within itself. \u201cBut when everything through\nfriendship goes back into one, it is necessary that the parts of\neach element undergo separation again.\u201d The being in one is itself a\nmanifold, a diverse relation of the four diversities, and thus the\ngoing together is likewise a separation. This is the case generally\nwith all determinateness, that it must in itself be the opposite, and\nmust manifest itself as such. The remark that, speaking generally,\nthere is no union without separation, no separation without union, is\na profound one; identity and non-identity are thought-determinations\nof this kind which cannot be separated. The reproach made by Aristotle\nis one that lies in the nature of the thing. And when Aristotle says\nthat Empedocles, although younger than Heraclitus, \u201cwas the first to\nmaintain such principles, because he did not assert that the principle\nof motion is one, but that it is different and opposed,\u201d this certainly\nrelates to the fact that he thought it was in Empedocles that he first\nfound design, although his utterances on the subject were dubious.\n(_\u03b3_) As to the real moments in which this ideal realizes\nitself, Aristotle further says, \u201cHe does not speak of them as\nfour\u201d\u2014equivalents in juxtaposition\u2014\u201cbut on the contrary as two;\nfire he puts by itself on the one side, and the three others, earth,\nair, and water, on the other.\u201d What would be most interesting is the\ndetermination of their relationship.\n(_\u03b4_) In what deals with the relationship of the two ideal moments,\nfriendship and strife, and of the four real elements, there is thus\nnothing rational, for Empedocles, according to Aristotle (Met. XII.\n10), did not properly separate, but co-ordinated them, so that we often\nsee them in proximity and counted as having equal value; but it is\nself-evident that Empedocles also separated these two sides, the real\nand the ideal, and expressed thought as their relation.\n(_\u03b5_) Aristotle says with justice (De gen. et corr. I. 1) that\n\u201cEmpedocles contradicts both himself and appearances. For at one time\nhe maintains that none of the elements springs out of the other, but\nall else comes from them; and, at another time, he makes them into a\nwhole through friendship, and again destroys this unity through strife.\nThus through particular differences and qualities, one becomes water,\nthe other fire, &c. Now if the particular differences are taken away\n(and they can be taken away since they have arisen), it is evident\nthat water arises from earth, and the reverse. The All was not yet\nfire, earth, water, and air, when these were still one, so that it\nis not clear whether he made the one or the many to be, properly\nspeaking, real existence.\u201d Because the elements become one, their\nspecial character, that through which water is water, is nothing in\nitself, that is, they are passing into something different; but this\ncontradicts the statement that they are the absolute elements, or that\nthey are implicit. He considers actual things as an intermingling\nof elements, but in regard to their first origin, he thinks that\neverything springs from one through friendship and strife. This\ncustomary absence of thought is in the nature of synthetic conceptions;\nit now upholds unity, then multiplicity, and does not bring both\nthoughts together; as sublated, one is also not one.[78]\nF. ANAXAGORAS.\nWith Anaxagoras[79] a light, if still a weak one, begins to dawn,\nbecause the understanding is now recognized as the principle. Aristotle\nsays of Anaxagoras (Met. I. 3): \u201cBut he who said that reason (_\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_),\nin what lives as also in nature, is the origin of the world and of all\norder, is like a sober man as compared with those who came before and\nspoke at random (_\u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u1fc6_).\u201d As Aristotle says, hitherto philosophers may\n\u201cbe compared to the fencers who fence in an unscientific way. Just as\nthe latter often make good thrusts in their struggle, though not by any\nskill, these philosophers seem to speak without any knowledge of what\nthey say.\u201d Now if Anaxagoras, as a sober man amongst drunkards, was\nthe first to reach this consciousness\u2014for he says that pure thought\nis the actually existent universal and true\u2014he yet, to a considerable\nextent, still thrusts into space.\nThe connection of his philosophy with what precedes is as follows:\nIn Heraclitus\u2019 Idea as motion, all moments are absolutely vanishing.\nEmpedocles represents the gathering together of this motion into a\nunity, but into a synthetic unity; and with Leucippus and Democritus\nit is the same. With Empedocles, however, the moments of this\nunity are the existent elements of fire, water, &c., and with the\nothers, pure abstractions, implicit being, thoughts. But in this way\nuniversality is directly asserted, for the opposing elements have no\nlonger any sensuous support. We have had Being, Becoming, the One, as\nprinciples; they are universal thoughts and not sensuous, nor are they\nfigures of the imagination; the content and its parts are, however,\ntaken from what is sensuous, and they are thoughts in some sort of\na determination. Anaxagoras now says that it is not gods, sensuous\nprinciples, elements, or thoughts\u2014which really are determinations of\nreflection\u2014but that it is the Universal, Thought itself, in and for\nitself, without opposition, all embracing, which is the substance or\nthe principle. The unity as universal, returns from the opposition into\nitself, while in the synthesis of Empedocles, what is opposed is still\napart from it and independent, and Thought is not Being. Here, however,\nThought as pure, free process in itself, is the self-determining\nuniversal, and is not distinguished from conscious thought. In\nAnaxagoras quite new ground is thus opened up.\nAnaxagoras concludes this period, and after him a fresh one begins.\nIn accordance with the favourite idea of there being a genealogical\ndescent of principles from the teacher to the taught, because he was\nan Ionian, he is often represented as perpetuating the Ionic school,\nand as an Ionic philosopher: Hermotimus of Clazomen\u00e6, too, was his\nteacher. To support this theory Diogenes Laertius (II. 6) makes him a\ndisciple of Anaximenes, whose birth is, however, placed in Ol. 55-58,\nor about sixty years earlier than that of Anaxagoras.\nAristotle says (Met. I. 3) that Anaxagoras first began by these\ndeterminations to express absolute reality as understanding. Aristotle\nand others after him, such as Sextus (adv. Math. IX. 7), mention\nthe bare fact that Hermotimus gave rise to this conception, but it\nwas clearly due to Anaxagoras. Little is gained if such a fact were\ntrue, since we learn no more about the philosophy of Hermotimus; it\ncannot have been much. Others have made numerous historical researches\nrespecting this Hermotimus. The name we have already mentioned amongst\nthose of whom it is said that Pythagoras existed in them before he\nlived as Pythagoras. We also have a story of Hermotimus to the effect\nthat he possessed the peculiar gift of being able to make his soul quit\nhis body. But this did him bad service in the end, since his wife,\nwith whom he had a dispute, and who besides knew very well how matters\nstood, showed to their acquaintances this soul-deserted body as dead,\nand it was burnt before the soul reinstated itself\u2014which soul must\nhave been astonished.[80] It is not worth while to investigate what\nlies at the ground of these ancient stories, i.e. into how we should\nregard the matter: we may think of it as implying a state of ecstasy.\nWe must consider the life of Anaxagoras before his philosophy.\nAnaxagoras, according to Diogenes (II. 7), born in Ol. 70 (500 B.C.),\ncomes earlier than Democritus, and in age also precedes Empedocles,\nyet, on the whole, he was contemporaneous with these, as also with\nParmenides; he was as old as Zeno, and lived somewhat earlier than\nSocrates, but still they were acquainted with one another. His native\ntown was Clazomen\u00e6, in Lydia, not very far from Colophon and Ephesus,\nand situated on an isthmus by which a great peninsula is connected\nwith the mainland. His life is shortly summed up in the statement that\nhe devoted himself to the study of the sciences, withdrew from public\naffairs; according to Valerius Maximus (VIII. 7, extr. 6) he made\nnumerous journeys, and finally, according to Tennemann (Vol. I. pp.\n300, 415), in the forty-fifth year of his age, in the 81st Olympiad\n(456 B.C.), and at a propitious time, he came to Athens.\nWith him we thus find Philosophy in Greece proper, where so far there\nhad been none, and coming, indeed, as far as Athens; hitherto either\nAsia Minor or Italy had been the seat of Philosophy, though, when the\ninhabitants of Asia Minor fell under Persian rule, with their loss of\nfreedom, it expired amongst them. Anaxagoras, himself a native of Asia\nMinor, lived in the important period between the war of the Medes and\nthe age of Pericles, principally in Athens, which had now reached the\nzenith of its greatness, for it was both the head of Grecian power, and\nthe seat and centre of the arts and sciences. Athens, after the Persian\nwars, brought the greater part of the Greek islands into subjection,\nas also a number of maritime towns in Thrace, and even further into\nthe Black Sea. As the greatest artists collected in Athens, so also\ndid the most noted philosophers and sophists live there\u2014a circle\nof luminaries in the arts and sciences such as we have in \u00c6schylus,\nSophocles, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Diogenes of Apollonia, Protagoras,\nAnaxagoras, and others from Asia Minor. Pericles then ruled the State,\nand raised it to that height of splendour which may be called the\ngolden age in Athenian life; Anaxagoras, although living in the most\nflourishing time of Athenian life, touches on its decay, or rather\nreaches the first threatening of that decay, which ended in a total\nextermination of this beautiful life.\nWhat is of special interest at this time is the opposition between\nAthens and Laced\u00e6mon, the two Greek nations which contended with one\nanother for the foremost place in Greece; here we must therefore allude\nto the principles of these celebrated States. While the Laced\u00e6monians\nhad no arts or sciences, Athens had to thank the character of its\nconstitution, and of its whole spirit, for the fact that it was the\nseat of the sciences and fine arts. But the constitution of Laced\u00e6mon\nis also worthy of high esteem, for it regulated and restrained the\nhigh Doric spirit, and its principal feature was that all personal\npeculiarity was subordinated, or rather sacrificed, to the general aim\nof the life of the State, and the individual had the consciousness of\nhis honour and sufficiency only in the consciousness of working for\nthe State. A people of such genuine unity, in whom the will of the\nindividual had, properly speaking, quite disappeared, were united by\nan indestructible bond, and Laced\u00e6mon was hence placed at the head of\nGreece, and obtained the leadership, which, we find, it held among the\nArgives in the days of Troy. This is a great principle which must exist\nin every true State, but which with the Laced\u00e6monians retained its\none-sided character; this one-sidedness was avoided by the Athenians,\nand by that means they became the greater. In Laced\u00e6mon personality\nproper was so much disregarded that the individual could not have\nfree development or expression; individuality was not recognized, and\nhence not brought into harmony with the common end of the State. This\nabrogation of the rights of subjectivity, which, expressed in his own\nway, is also found in Plato\u2019s Republic, was carried very far with the\nLaced\u00e6monians. But the universal is living spirit only in so far as the\nindividual consciousness finds itself as such within it; the universal\nis not constituted of the immediate life and being of the individual,\nthe mere substance, but formed of conscious life. As individuality\nwhich separates itself from the universal is powerless and falls to\nthe ground, the one-sided universal, the morality of individuality\ncannot stand firm. The Laced\u00e6monian spirit, which had not taken into\naccount the freedom of consciousness, and whose universal had isolated\nitself therefrom, had hence to see it break forth in opposition to the\nuniversal; and though the first to come forward as the liberators of\nGreece from its tyranny were the Spartans, whom even Athens thanks for\nthe expulsion of the descendants of Pisistratus, their relationship\nto their confederates soon passes into that of common, mean, tyranny.\nWithin the State it likewise ends in a harsh aristocracy, just as the\nfixed equilibrium of property (each family retaining its inheritance,\nand through forbidding the possession of money, or trade and commerce,\npreventing the possibility of inequality in riches) passes into an\navarice which, as opposed to this universal, is brutal and mean. This\nessential moment of particularity, not being taken into the State,\nand hence not made legal and moral (moral first of all), comes forth\nas vice. In a rational organization all the elements of the Idea are\npresent; if the liver were isolated as bile it would become not more,\nand not less active, but becoming antagonistic, it would isolate itself\nfrom the corporate economy of the body. Solon, on the contrary, gave to\nthe Athenians not only equality of laws and unity of spirit in their\nconstitution (which was a purer democracy than in Sparta), but although\neach citizen had his substantial consciousness in unity with the laws\nof the State, he also gave free play to the individual mind, so that\neach might do as he would, and might find expression for himself.\nSolon entrusted the executive to the people, not to the Ephors, and\nthis became self-government after the displacement of the tyrants,\nand thus in truth a free people arose; the individual had the whole\nwithin himself, as he had his consciousness and action in the whole.\nThus we see in this principle the formation of free consciousness\nand the freedom of individuality in its greatness. The principle of\nsubjective freedom appears at first, however, still in unison with the\nuniversal principle of Greek morality as established by law, and even\nwith mythology; and thus in its promulgation, because the genius of its\nconceptions could develop freely, it brought about these masterpieces\nin the beautiful plastic arts, and the immortal works of poetry and\nhistory. The principle of subjectivity had, thus far, not taken the\nform that particularity, as such, should be set free, and that its\ncontent should be a subjectively particular, at least distinguished\nfrom the universal principle, universal morality, universal religion,\nuniversal laws. Thus we do not see the carrying out of isolated ideas,\nbut the great, moral, solid, divine content made in these works object\nfor consciousness, and generally brought before consciousness. Later\nwe shall find the form of subjectivity becoming free for itself, and\nappearing in opposition to the substantial, to morality, religion, and\nlaw.\nThe basis of this principle of subjectivity, though it is still a\nmerely general one, we now see in Anaxagoras. But amongst this noble,\nfree, and cultured people of Athens, he who had the happiness to be\nfirst, was Pericles, and this circumstance raised him in the estimation\nof the individual to a place so high that few could reach it. Of all\nthat is great amongst men, the power of ruling over the will of men who\nhave but one will, is the greatest, for this controlling individuality\nmust be both the most universal and the most living\u2014a lot for a mortal\nbeing than which hardly any better can be found. His individuality was,\naccording to Plutarch, (in Pericle 5) as deep as it was perfect; as\nserious (he never laughed), as full of energy and restfulness: Athens\nhad him the whole day long. Thucydides has preserved some of Pericles\u2019\nspeeches to the people which allow of few works being compared to them.\nUnder Pericles the highest culture of the moral commonwealth is to be\nfound, the juncture where individuality is still under and also in the\nuniversal. Presently individuality prevails, because its activity falls\ninto extremes, since the state as state, is not yet independently\norganized within itself. Because the essence of the Athenian State\nwas the common spirit, and the religious faith of individuals in this\nconstituted their essence, there disappears with the disappearance of\nthis faith, the inner Being of the people, since the spirit is not in\nthe form of the Notion as it is in our states. The speedy transition\nto this last is the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, subjectivity, as Being, self-reflection.\nWhen Anaxagoras at this time, the principle of which has just been\ngiven, came to Athens, he was sought out by Pericles, and, as his\nfriend, lived in very intimate relations with him, before the latter\noccupied himself with public affairs. But Plutarch (in Pericle 4, 16)\nalso relates that Anaxagoras came to want because Pericles neglected\nhim\u2014did not supply the illuminating lamp with oil.\nA more important matter is that Anaxagoras (as happened later with\nSocrates and many other philosophers) was accused of despising those\nwhom the people accepted as gods. The prose of the understanding\ncame into contact with the poetic, religious point of view. It\nis distinctly said by Diogenes Laertius (II. 12) that Anaxagoras\nbelieved the sun and stars to be burning stones; and he is, according\nto Plutarch, (in Pericle, 6) blamed for having explained something\nthat the prophets stated to be a marvellous omen, in a natural way;\nit quite tallies with this that he is said to have foretold that on\nthe day of \u00c6gos-Potamos, where the Athenians lost their last fleet\nagainst Lysander, a stone should fall from heaven.[81] The general\nremark might be made of Thales, Anaximander, &c., that the sun,\nmoon, earth and stars were counted as mere things, i.e. as objects\nexternal to mind, and that they no longer held them to be living\ngods, but represented them in different ways\u2014which ideas, for the\nrest, deserve no further consideration, since these matters belong\nproperly to ordinary learning. Things may be derived from thought;\nthought really brings about the result that certain objects which may\nbe called divine, and certain conceptions of these which may be called\npoetic, together with the whole range of superstitious beliefs, are\ndemolished\u2014they are brought down to being what are called natural\nthings. For in thought, as the identity of itself and of Being, mind\nknows itself as the truly actual, so that for mind in thought, the\nunspiritual and material is brought down to being mere things, to the\nnegative of mind. All the ideas of those philosophers have this in\ncommon, that nature is through them undeified; they brought the poetic\nview of nature down to the prosaic, and destroyed the poetic point of\nview which ascribes to all that is now considered to be lifeless, a\nlife proper to itself, perhaps also sensation, and, it may be, a being\nafter the usual order of consciousness. The loss of this point of view\nis not to be lamented as if unity with nature, pure faith, innocent\npurity and childlike spirit went with it. Innocent and childlike it\nmay certainly have been, but reason is just the going forth from\nsuch innocence and unity with nature. So soon as mind grasps itself,\nis for itself, it must for that very reason confront the \u2018other\u2019 of\nitself as a negation of consciousness, i.e. look on it as something\ndevoid of mind, an unconscious and lifeless thing, and it must first\ncome to itself through this opposition. There is in this a fixing of\nself-moving things such as are met with in the myths of the ancients,\nwho relate such tales as that the Argonauts secured the rocks on the\nStraits of the Hellespont which formerly moved like scissors. Similarly\nprogressive culture consolidated that which formerly was thought to\nhave its own motion and life in itself, and made it into unmoving\nmatter. This transition of the mythical point of view into the prosaic,\nhere comes to be recognized by the Athenians. A prosaic point of\nview such as this, assumes that man has requirements quite different\nfrom those he formerly had; in this we find traces of the powerful,\nnecessary conversion brought about in the ideas of man through the\nstrengthening of thought, through knowledge of himself, and through\nPhilosophy.\nThe institution of charges of atheism, which we shall touch upon\nmore fully in dealing with Socrates, is, in Anaxagoras\u2019 case, quite\ncomprehensible, from the specific reason that the Athenians, who were\nenvious of Pericles, who contended with him for the first place, and\nwho did not venture to proceed against him openly, took his favourites\nto law, and sought through charges against his friend, to injure him.\nThus his friend Aspasia was brought under accusation, and the noble\nPericles had, according to Plutarch (in Pericle, 32), in order to save\nher from condemnation, to beg the individual citizens of Athens with\ntears for her acquittal. The Athenian people in their freedom, demanded\nsuch acts of the potentates to whom they allowed supremacy, for thereby\nan acknowledgment was given of their subordination to the people; they\nthus made themselves the Nemesis in respect to the high place accorded\nto the great, for they placed themselves in a position of equality with\nthese, while these again made evident their dependence, subjection\nand powerlessness before the others. What is told about the result of\nthis charge against Anaxagoras is quite contradictory and uncertain:\nPericles certainly saved him from condemnation to death. He was either,\nas some say, condemned only to banishment after Pericles had led him\nbefore the people, speaking and entreating for him, after, by reason\nof his age, attenuation and weakness the sympathy of the people had\nbeen aroused; or else, as others say, with the help of Pericles, he\nescaped from Athens and was in absence condemned to death, the judgment\nnever being executed upon him. Others again say that he was liberated,\nbut from the vexation that he felt respecting these charges, and from\napprehension as to their repetition, he voluntarily left Athens. And at\nabout sixty or seventy years of age, he died in Lampsacus in the 88th\nOlympiad (428 B.C.).[82]\n1. _The Universal Principle._ The logical principle of Anaxagoras was\nthat he recognized the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ as the simple, absolute essence of the\nworld. The simplicity of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ is not a Being but a universality\nwhich is distinguished from itself, though in such a way that the\ndistinction is immediately sublated and the identity is set forth for\nitself. This universal for itself, sundered, exists in purity only\nas thought; it exists also in nature as objective existence, but in\nthat case no longer purely for itself, but as having particularity as\nan immediate in it. Space and time are, for example, the most ideal,\nuniversal facts in nature as such, but there is no pure space, no pure\ntime and motion any more than any pure matter\u2014for this universal is\nimmediately defined space, air, earth, &c. In thought, when I say, I\nam I, or I = I, I certainly distinguish something from me, but the\npure unity remains; there is no movement but a distinction which is\nnot distinguished, or the being-for-me. And in all that I think, if\nthe thought has a definite content, it is my thought: I am thus known\nto myself in this object. This universal which thus exists for itself\nand the individual, or thought and being, thus, however, come into\ndefinite opposition. Here the speculative unity of this universal with\nthe individual should be considered as it is posited as absolute unity,\nbut the comprehension of the Notion itself is certainly not found\nwith the ancients. We need not expect a pure Notion such as one of an\nunderstanding realizing itself into a system, organized as a universe.\nHow Anaxagoras enunciated the Notion of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, Aristotle (De\nanim. I. 2) goes on to tell: \u201cAnaxagoras maintains that the soul is\nthe principle of movement. Yet he does not always express himself\nfully about the soul and _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_: he seems to separate _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ and soul\nfrom one another, and still he makes use of them as though they were\nthe same existence, only that by preference he makes the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ the\nprinciple of everything. He certainly speaks frequently of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_\nas of the cause of the beautiful and right, but another time he calls\nit the soul. For it is in all animals, in large as well as small, the\nhigher kind and the lower; it alone of all existence is the simple,\nunadulterated and pure; it is devoid of pain and is not in community\nwith any other.\u201d[83] What we therefore have to do is to show from the\nprinciple of motion, that it is the self-moving; and this thought is,\nas existent for itself. As soul, the self-moving is only immediately\nindividual; the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, however, as simple, is the universal. Thought\nmoves on account of something: the end is the first simple which\nmakes itself result; this principle with the ancients is grasped as\ngood and evil, i.e. end as positive and negative. This determination\nis a very important one, but with Anaxagoras it was not fully worked\nout. While in the first place the principles are material, from these\nAristotle then distinguishes determination and form, and thirdly he\nfinds in the process of Heraclitus, the principle of motion. Then in\nthe fourth place there comes the reason why, the determination of end,\nwith the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_; this is the concrete in itself. Aristotle adds in\nthe above-mentioned passage (p. 192), \u201caccording to these men\u201d (the\nIonians and others) \u201cand in reference to such causes\u201d (water, fire,\n&c.), \u201csince they are not sufficient to beget the nature of things,\nthe philosophers are, as already said, compelled by the truth to go on\nto the principle following (_\u1f10\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd_). For neither the earth nor any\nother principle is capable of explaining the fact that while on the\none hand all is good and beautiful, on the other, something else is\nproduced, and those men do not seem to have thought that this was so;\nnor is it seemly to abandon such matters to hazard (_\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u1ff3_) and to\nchance.\u201d Goodness and beauty express the simple restful Notion, and\nchange the Notion in its movement.\nWith this principle comes the determination of an understanding as of\nself-determining activity; this has hitherto been wanting, for the\nBecoming of Heraclitus, which is only process, is not yet as fate,\nthe independently self-determining. By this we must not represent\nto ourselves subjective thought; in thinking we think immediately\nof our thought as it is in consciousness. Here, on the contrary,\nquite objective thought is meant, active understanding\u2014as we say,\nthere is reason in the world, or we speak of genera in nature which\nare the universal. The genus animal is the substantial of the dog;\nthe dog itself is this; the laws of nature are themselves nature\u2019s\nimmanent essence. The nature is not formed from without as men\nmake a table; this is also made with understanding, but through an\nunderstanding outside of this wood. This external form, which is\ncalled the understanding, immediately occurs to us in speaking of\nthe understanding; but here the universal is meant, that which is\nthe immanent nature of the object itself. The _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ is thus not a\nthinking existence from without which regulates the world; by such\nthe meaning present to Anaxagoras would be quite destroyed and all\nits philosophic interest taken away. For to speak of an individual,\na unit from without, is to fall into the ordinary conception and its\ndualism; a so-called thinking principle is no longer a thought, but is\na subject. But still the true universal is for all that not abstract,\nbut the universal is just the determining in and out of itself of the\nparticular in and for itself. In this activity, which is independently\nself-determining, the fact is at once implied that the activity,\nbecause it constitutes process, retains itself as the universal\nself-identical. Fire, which, according to Heraclitus, was process,\ndies away and merely passes over, without independent existence, into\nthe opposite; it is certainly also a circle and a return to fire, but\nthe principle does not retain itself in its determinateness as the\nuniversal, seeing that a simple passing into the opposite takes place.\nThis relation to itself in determination which we see appearing in\nAnaxagoras, now, however, contains the determination of the universal\nthough it is not formally expressed, and therein we have the end or the\nGood.\nI have just recently (p. 316) spoken of the Notion of the end, yet\nby that we must not merely think of the form of the end as it is in\nus, in conscious beings. At first, end, in as far as I have it, is my\nconception, which is for itself, and the realization of which depends\non my wish; if I carry it out, and if I am not unskilful, the object\nproduced must be conformable to the end, containing nothing but it.\nThere is a transition from subjectivity to objectivity through which\nthis opposition is always again sublated. Because I am discontented\nwith my end in that it is only subjective, my activity consists in\nremoving this defect and making it objective. In objectivity the\nend has retained itself; for instance, if I have the end in view of\nbuilding a house and am active for that end, the house results in\nwhich my end is realized. But we must not, as we usually do, abide at\nthe conception of this subjective end; in this case both I and the\nend exist independently and externally in relation to each other. In\nthe conception that God, as wisdom, rules the world in accordance\nwith an end, for instance, the end is posited for itself in a wise,\nfiguratively conceiving Being. But the universal of end is the fact\nthat since it is a determination independently fixed, that rules\npresent existence, the end is the truth, the soul of a thing. The Good\nin the end gives content to itself, so that while it is active with\nthis content, and after it has entered into externality, no other\ncontent comes forth than what was already present. The best example of\nthis is presented in life; it has desires, and these desires are its\nends; as merely living, however, it knows nothing of these ends, but\nyet they are first, immediate determinations which are established.\nThe animal works at satisfying these desires, i.e. at reaching the\nend; it relates itself to external things, partly mechanically,\npartly chemically. But the character of its activity does not remain\nmechanical or chemical; the product is rather the animal itself,\nwhich, as its own end, brings forth in its activity only itself, since\nit negates and overturns those mechanical or chemical relationships.\nIn mechanical and chemical process, on the other hand, the result is\nsomething different, in which the subject does not retain itself; but\nin the end, beginning and end are alike, for we posit the subjective\nobjectively in order to receive it again. Self-preservation is a\ncontinual production by which nothing new, but always the old, arises;\nit is a taking back of activity for the production of itself.\nThus this self-determining activity, which is then active on something\nelse, enters into opposition, but it again negates the opposition,\ngoverns it, in it reflects upon itself; it is the end, the thought,\nthat which conserves itself in its self-determination. The development\nof these moments is the business of Philosophy from henceforth. But\nif we look more closely as to how far Anaxagoras has got in the\ndevelopment of this thought, we find nothing further than the activity\ndetermining from out of itself, which sets up a limit or measure;\nfurther than the determination of measure, development does not go.\nAnaxagoras gives us no more concrete definition of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, and\nthis we are still left to consider; we thus have nothing more than the\nabstract determination of the concrete in itself. The above-mentioned\npredicates which Anaxagoras gives the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, may thus indeed be\naffirmed, but they are, on their own account, one-sided only.\n2. _The Hom\u0153omeri\u00e6._ This is the one side in the principle of\nAnaxagoras; we now have to consider the going forth of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_\ninto further determinations. This remaining part of the philosophy of\nAnaxagoras at first, however, makes us think that the hopes in which\nsuch a principle justified us must be very much diminished. On the\nother side, this universal is confronted by Being, matter, the manifold\ngenerally, potentiality as distinguished from the former as actuality.\nFor if the Good or the end is also determined as potentiality, the\nuniversal, as the self-moving, may rather be called the actual in\nitself, the being-for-self, as opposed to implicit being, potentiality,\npassivity. Aristotle says in an important passage (Met. I. 8): \u201cIf\nany one should say of Anaxagoras that he adopted two principles,\nhe would rest his statement on a point respecting which the latter\nnever really clearly defined himself, but which he had necessarily\nto acknowledge to those who adduced it.... That is, Anaxagoras says\nthat originally everything is mingled.... But where nothing is yet\nseparated, no distinguishing feature is present; such substance is\nneither a white, black, gray, nor any other colour, but colourless; it\nhas no quality nor quantity nor determination (_\u03c4\u03af_). All is mingled\nexcept the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_; this is unmingled and pure. With this in view, it\nthus occurs to him to denominate as principles the one, for it alone is\nsingle and unmingled, and the other-being (_\u03b8\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd_), what we call the\nindeterminate, before it has become determined or partakes of any kind\nof form.\u201d\nThis other principle is celebrated under the name of hom\u0153omeries\n(_\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u1fc6_), of like parts or homogeneous, in Aristotle\u2019s rendering\n(Met. I. 3, 7); Riemer translates _\u1f21 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1_ \u201cthe similarity of\nindividual parts to the whole,\u201d and _\u03b1\u1f31 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9_ \u201cthe elementary\nmatter,\u201d yet this latter word seems to be of a later origin.[84]\nAristotle says, \u201cAnaxagoras sets forth\u201d (in respect of the material)\n\u201cinfinitely many principles, for he maintained that, like water\nand fire in Empedocles\u2019 system, nearly all that is formed of like\nparts only arises from union and passes away through separation;\nother arising and passing away there is none, for equal parts remain\neternal.\u201d That is, the existent, the individual matter, such as bones,\nmetal, flesh, &c., in itself consists of parts like itself\u2014flesh\nof small particles of flesh, gold of small gold particles, &c. Thus\nhe said at the beginning of his work, \u201cAll has been alike\u201d (i.e.\nunseparated as in a chaos), \u201cand has rested for an infinitude of time;\nthen came the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, and it brought in movement, separated and brought\norder into the separated creation (_\u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd_), in that it united\nthe like.\u201d[85]\nThe hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 become clearer if we compare them with the conceptions\nof Leucippus and Democritus and others. In Leucippus and Democritus, as\nwell as Empedocles, we saw this matter, or the absolute as objective\nexistence, determined so that simple atoms\u2014with the latter the four\nelements and with the former infinitely many\u2014were set forth as\nseparate only in form; their syntheses and combinations were existing\nthings. Aristotle (De c\u0153lo, III. 3) says further on this point,\n\u201cAnaxagoras asserts of the elements the opposite to Empedocles. For\nthe latter takes as original principles, fire, air, earth, and water,\nthrough whose union all things arise. On the other hand, Anaxagoras\nmaintains what are of like parts such as flesh, bones, or the like to\nbe simple materials; such things as water and fire, on the contrary,\nare a mixture of the original elements. For any one of these four\nconsists of the infinite admixture of all invisible, existing things\nof like parts, which hence come forth from these.\u201d The principle\nheld good for him as for the Eleatics, that \u201cthe like only comes out\nof the like; there is no transition into the opposite, no union of\nopposites possible.\u201d All change is hence to him only a separation\nand union of the like; change as true change, would be a Becoming\nout of the negative of itself. \u201cThat is, because Anaxagoras,\u201d says\nAristotle (Phys. I, 4), \u201cpartook of the view of all physicists that\nit is impossible that anything can come out of nothing, there was\nnothing left but to admit that what becomes was already present as an\nexistent, but that, on account of its small size, it was imperceptible\nto us.\u201d This point of view is also quite different from the conception\nof Thales and Heraclitus, in which, not only the possibility, but\nthe actuality of the transformation of these like qualitative\ndifferences is essentially maintained. But to Anaxagoras with whom\nthe elements are a mingled chaos formed therefrom, having only an\napparent uniformity, concrete things arise through the severance of\nthese infinitely many principles from such a chaos, since like finds\nlike. Respecting the difference between Empedocles and Anaxagoras,\nthere is further what Aristotle adds in the same place: \u201cThe former\nallows a change (_\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd_) in these conditions, the latter only\ntheir one appearance.\u201d The conception of Democritus is similar to that\nof Anaxagoras in so far as that an infinite manifold is the original\nsource. But with Anaxagoras the determination of the fundamental\nprinciples appears to contain that which we consider as organized, and\nto be by no means an independently existent simple; thus perfectly\nindividualized atoms such as particles of flesh and of gold, form,\nthrough their coming together, that which appears to be organized. That\ncomes near our ordinary ideas. Means of nourishment, it is thought,\ncontain such parts as are homogeneous to blood, flesh, &c. Anaxagoras\nhence says, according to Aristotle (De gen. anim. I. 18), \u201cFlesh\ncomes to flesh through food.\u201d Digestion is thus nothing more than the\ntaking up of the homogeneous and separation of the heterogeneous;\nall nourishment and growth is thus not true assimilation but only\nincrease, because each internal organ of the animal only draws its\nparts to itself out of the various plants, bodies, &c. Death is, on\nthe other hand, the separation of the like and the mingling with the\nheterogeneous. The activity of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, as the sundering of the like\nout of the chaos and the putting together of the like, as also the\nsetting at liberty again of this like, is certainly simple and relative\nto itself, but purely formal and thus for itself contentless.\nThis is the general standpoint of the philosophy of Anaxagoras,\nand quite the same standpoint which in more recent times reigns in\nchemistry for instance; flesh is certainly no longer regarded as\nsimple, but as being hydrogen, &c. The chemical elements are oxygen,\nhydrogen, carbon and metals, &c. Chemistry says, if you want to know\nwhat flesh, wood, stone, &c., really are, you must set forth their\nsimple elements, and these are ultimate. It also says that much is only\nrelatively simple, _e.g._ platinum consists of three or four metals.\nWater and air were similarly long held to be simple, but chemistry at\nlength analyzed them. From this chemical point of view, the simple\nprinciples of natural things are determined as infinitely qualitative\nand thus accepted as unchangeable and invariable, so that all else\nconsists only of the combination of these simples. Man, according to\nthis, is a collection of carbon and hydrogen, some earth, oxides,\nphosphorus, &c. It is a favourite idea of the physicists to place\nin the water or in the air, oxygen and carbon, which exist and only\nrequire to be separated. This idea of Anaxagoras certainly also differs\nfrom modern chemistry; that which we consider as concrete, is for him\nqualitatively determined or elementary. Yet he allows, with regard to\nflesh, that the parts are not all alike. \u201cFor this reason, they say,\u201d\nremarks Aristotle (Phys. I. 4; Met. IV. 5),\u2014but not particularly\nof Anaxagoras\u2014\u201ceverything is contained in everything, for they saw\neverything arise out of everything: it only appears to be different and\nis called different in accordance with the predominating number of the\nparticular kind of parts which have mingled themselves with others. In\ntruth the whole is not white, or black, or sweet, or flesh, or bones;\nbut the hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 which have most accumulated in any place, bring\nabout the result that the whole appears to us as this determinate.\u201d\nAs thus each thing contains all other things, water, air, bones,\nfruits, &c., on the other hand, the water contains flesh as flesh,\nbones, &c. Into this infinitely manifold nature of the principles,\nAnaxagoras thus goes back; the sensuous has first arisen through the\naccumulation of all those parts, and in it the one kind of parts then\nhas a predominance.\nWhile he defines absolute existence as universal, we see here that in\nobjective existence, or in matter, universality and thought abandon\nAnaxagoras. The implicit is to him, indeed, no absolutely sensuous\nBeing; the hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 are the non-sensuous, _i.e._ the invisible and\ninaudible, &c. This is the highest point reached by common physicists\nin passing from sensuous Being to the non-sensuous, as to the mere\nnegation of the being-for-us; but the positive side is that existent\nBeing is itself universal. The objective is to Anaxagoras certainly\nthe _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, but for him the other-Being is a mixture of simple\nelements, which are neither flesh nor fish, red nor blue; again\nthis simple is not simple in itself, but in its essence consists of\nhom\u0153omeri\u00e6, which are, however, so small that they are imperceptible.\nThe smallness thus does not take away their existence, for they are\nstill there; but existence is just the being perceptible to sight,\nsmell, &c. These infinitely small hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 undoubtedly disappear in\na more complete conception; flesh, for instance, is such itself, but\nit is also a mixture of everything, _i.e._ it is not simple. Further\nanalysis equally shows how such a conception must, to a greater or\nlesser degree, become confused; on the one side each form is thus\nin its main elements, original, and these parts together constitute\na corporeal whole; this whole has, however, on the other side, to\ncontain everything in itself. The _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, then, is only what binds and\nseparates, what divides and arranges [_das diakosmirende_]. This may\nsuffice us; however easily we may get confused with the hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 of\nAnaxagoras, we must hold fast to the main determination. The hom\u0153omeri\u00e6\nstill form a striking conception, and it may be asked how it conforms\nwith the rest of Anaxagoras\u2019 principle.\n3. _The Relation of the Two._ Now as to the relation of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_\nto that matter, both are not speculatively posited as one, for\nthe relation itself is not set forth as one, nor has the Notion\npenetrated it. Here the ideas become in some measure superficial, and\nin some measure the conceptions are more consistent as regards the\nparticular, than they at first appear. Because the understanding is the\nself-determining, the content is end, it retains itself in relation to\nwhat is different; it does not arise and pass away although it is in\nactivity. The conception of Anaxagoras that concrete principles subsist\nand retain themselves, is thus consistent; he abolishes arising and\npassing away and accepts only an external change, a uniting together,\nand a severance of what is so united. The principles are concrete and\nhave content, _i.e._ so many ends; in the change that takes place the\nprinciples really retain themselves. Like only goes with like even if\nthe chaotic mixture is a combination of the unlike; but this is only a\ncombination and not an individual, living form which maintains itself,\nbinding like to like. Thus, however rude these ideas are, they are\nstill really in harmony with the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_.\nBut if the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ is with Anaxagoras the moving soul in all, it yet\nremains to the real, as the soul of the world and the organic system of\nthe whole, a mere word. For the living as living, since the soul was\nconceived of as principle, the ancients demanded no further principle\n(for it is the self-moving), but for determinateness, which the\nanimal is as element in the system of the whole, they again required\nonly the universal of these determinations. Anaxagoras calls the\nunderstanding such a principle, and in fact the absolute Notion, as\nsimple existence, the self-identical in its differences, the dividing,\nthe reality-establishing, must be known as such. But that Anaxagoras\nshowed forth the understanding in the universe, or had grasped it as\na rational system\u2014of this not only do we not find a trace, but the\nancients expressly say that he simply let the matter pass, just as\nwhen we say that the world or nature is a great system, the world is\nwisely ordered or is generally speaking rational. By this we are shown\nno more of the realization of this reason or the comprehensibility of\nthe world. The _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras is thus still formal, although\nthe identity of the principle with the realization was recognized.\nAristotle (Met. I. 4) recognizes the insufficiency of the Anaxagorean\nprinciple: \u201cAnaxagoras, indeed, requires the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ for his formation\nof the world-system; that is, when he has a difficulty in showing the\nreason for which it is in accordance with necessity, he brings it in;\notherwise he employs anything for the sake of explanation, rather than\nthought.\u201d\nIt is nowhere more clearly set forth that the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras is\nstill formal, than in the well-known passage out of Plato\u2019s Ph\u00e6do (p.\n97-99, Steph.; p. 85-89, Bekk.), which is noteworthy for its exposition\nof the philosophy of Anaxagoras. Socrates, according to Plato, states\nmost definitely both what the absolute to them was, and why Anaxagoras\ndid not satisfy them. I quote this because it will best of all lead\nus on to the main conception which we recognize in the philosophic\nconsciousness of the ancients; at the same time it is an example of the\nloquacity of Socrates. Socrates\u2019 understanding of the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ as end\nis better because its determinations are congenial to him, so that we\nalso see in it the principal forms that appear in Socrates. Plato makes\nSocrates, in prison, an hour before his death, relate at considerable\nlength his experiences with regard to Anaxagoras: \u201cWhen I heard it read\nfrom a book of Anaxagoras, that he said that the understanding is the\ndisposer of the world and the first cause, I rejoiced in such a cause,\nand I held that if Mind apportioned out all reality, it would apportion\nit for the best\u201d (the end would be shown forth). \u201cNow if anyone wished\nto find the cause of the individual thing, how it becomes, and how it\npasses away, or how it is, he must discover this from what is best for\nthat thing, whether it is being or in some way suffering or doing.\u201d\nThat the understanding is cause, or that everything is made for the\nbest, means the same thing; this will become clearer from the opposite.\nIt is further said, \u201cFor this reason a man has only to consider for\nhimself, as for all others, what is best and most perfect, and then he\nwould of necessity know the worse, for the same science comprises both.\nThus reflecting, I rejoiced that I could believe that I had found in\nAnaxagoras a teacher of the cause of existence\u201d (of the good) \u201csuch\nas I approved of; he would, I believed, tell me whether the earth was\nflat or round, and if he told me this, he would show me the cause and\nnecessity of the fact, because he would show me the one or the other\nas being the better; and if he said that the earth is in the centre,\nhe would show me that it was better that it should be in the centre\u201d\n(i.e. its implicitly and explicitly determined end, and not utility as\nan externally determined end). \u201cAnd when he had shown me this, I should\nbe satisfied though he brought forward no other kind of causes, for\nthe same would hold good for the sun, the moon, and the other stars,\ntheir respective velocities, returnings, and other conditions. Because\nhe assigned its cause to each and to all in common, I thought that he\nwould explain what was best for each and what was best for all\u201d (the\nfree, implicitly and explicitly existent Idea, the absolute end). \u201cI\nwould not have given up this hope for a great deal, but seized these\nwritings zealously and read them as soon as possible in order to learn\nas soon as possible the good and the evil. These bright hopes faded\nwhen I saw that he did not require thought at all nor any reason for\nthe formation of things, but had recourse to air, fire, water and many\nother eccentricities.\u201d We here see how to what is best, according to\nthe understanding (the relation of final end), that which we call\nnatural causes is opposed, just as in Leibnitz the operating and the\nfinal causes are different.\nSocrates explains this in the following way: \u201cIt appears to me to be\nas if some one were to say that Socrates performs all his actions with\nunderstanding, and then in going on to give the reasons for each of\nmy actions, were to say that I sit here because my body consists of\nbones and muscles; the bones are fixed and have joints that divide\nthem (_\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u1f70\u03c2_), but the muscles have the power of extending and\nbending, and they cover the bones with flesh and skin; it is as though\nhe were further to bring forward as the cause of my talking with\nyou, other similar causes, sounds, and air, hearing, and a thousand\nother things, but omitted to give the true cause\u201d (free independent\ndetermination), \u201cwhich is that the Athenians judged it fit to condemn\nme, and therefore I judged it better and more just to sit here and to\nsuffer the punishment which they accorded\u201d (we must recollect that one\nof his friends had arranged everything for the flight of Socrates, but\nthat he refused to go) \u201cfor else, by the dog of Egypt, how long ago\nwould these bones and muscles have gone to Megara or to Boeotia, had\nthey been moved only by their opinion of what was best, and had I not\nconsidered it juster and better to bear the punishment which the State\nlaid upon me, instead of escaping and fleeing from it.\u201d Plato here\ncorrectly places the two kinds of reason and cause in opposition to one\nanother\u2014the cause proceeding from ends, and the inferior, subject, and\nmerely external causes of chemistry, mechanism, &c.\u2014in order to show\nthe discrepancy between them, as here exemplified in the case of a man\nwith consciousness. Anaxagoras seems to define an end and to wish to\nproceed from it; but he immediately lets this go again and proceeds to\nquite external causes. \u201cBut to call these\u201d (these bones and muscles)\n\u201ccauses is quite improper. If, however, anyone were to say that without\nhaving bones and muscles and whatever else I have, I could not do\nthat which I consider best, he would be quite right. But to say that\nfrom such causes, I do that which I do, and do with understanding;\nto say that I do not do it from the choice of what is best\u2014to make\nsuch an assertion shows a great want of consideration; it signifies an\nincapacity to distinguish that the one is the true cause and the other\nis only that without which the cause could not operate,\u201d _i.e._ the\nconditions.\nThis is a good example for showing that we miss the end in such modes\nof explanation. On the other hand, it is not a good example, because it\nis taken from the kingdom of the self-conscious will, where deliberate\nand not unconscious end reigns. In this criticism of the Anaxagorean\n_\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ we can certainly see it generally expressed that Anaxagoras\nmade no application of his _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ to reality. But the positive\nelement in the conclusion of Socrates seems, on the other hand, to\nbe unsatisfying, because it goes to the other extreme, namely, to\ndesire causes for nature which do not appear to be in it, but which\nfall outside of it in consciousness. For what is good and beautiful is\npartly due to the thought of consciousness as such; end or purposive\naction is mainly an act of consciousness and not of nature. But in so\nfar as ends become posited in nature, the end, as end, on the other\nhand, falls outside of it in our judgment only; as such it is not in\nnature itself, for in it there are only what we call natural causes,\nand for its comprehension we have only to seek and show causes that\nare immanent. According to this, we distinguish, for instance, in\nSocrates the end and ground of his action as consciousness, and the\ncauses of his actual action: and the latter we would undoubtedly seek\nin his bones, muscles, nerves, &c. Since we banish the consideration\nof nature in relation to ends\u2014as present in our thought and not\nexistent in nature\u2014we also banish from our consideration teleological\nexplanations in nature formerly admired, _e.g._ that grass grows that\nanimals may eat it, and that these last exist and eat grass, so that we\nmay eat them. The end of trees is said to be that their fruit may be\nconsumed and that they should give us wood for heat; many animals have\nskins for warm clothing; the sea in northern climates floats timber to\nthe shores because on these shores themselves no wood grows, and the\ninhabitants can hence obtain it, and so on. Thus presented, the end,\nthe Good, lies outside of the thing itself: the nature of a thing then\nbecomes considered, not in and for itself, but only in relation to\nanother which is nothing to it. Thus, because things are only useful\nfor an end, this determination is not their own but one foreign to\nthem. The tree, the grass, is as natural existence, independent, and\nthis adaptation of it to an end, such as making grass that which is\nto be eaten, does not concern the grass as grass, just as it does\nnot concern the animal that man should clothe himself in his skin;\nSocrates may hence seem to miss in Anaxagoras this mode of looking at\nnature. But this to us familiar way of regarding the good and expedient\nis on the one hand not the only one, and does not represent Plato\u2019s\nmeaning, while, on the other, it is likewise necessary. We have not to\nrepresent the good or the end in so one-sided a manner that we think\nof it existing as such in the perceiving mind, and in opposition to\nwhat is; but set free from this form, we must take it in its essence\nas the Idea of all existence. The nature of things must be recognized\nin accordance with the Notion, which is the independent, unfettered\nconsideration of things; and because it is that which things are in and\nfor themselves, it controls the relationship of natural causes. This\nNotion is the end, the true cause, but that which recedes into itself;\nit is the implicitly existent first from which movement proceeds and\nwhich becomes result; it is not only an end present in the imagination\nbefore its actuality exists, but is also present in reality. Becoming\nis the movement through which a reality or totality becomes; in the\nanimal or plant its essence as universal genus, is that which begins\nits movement and brings it forth. But this whole is not the product of\nsomething foreign, but its own product, what is already present as\ngerm or seed; thus it is called end, the self-producing, that which\nin its Becoming is already implicitly existent. The Idea is not a\nparticular thing, which might have another content than reality or\nappear quite different. The opposition is the merely formal opposition\nof possibility and actuality; the active impelling substance and\nthe product are the same. This realization goes right through the\nopposition; the negative in the universal is just this process. The\ngenus sets itself in a state of opposition as individual and universal,\nand thus, in what lives, the genus realizes itself in the opposition of\nraces which are opposed, but whose principle is the universal genus.\nThey, as individuals, aim at their own self-preservation as individuals\nin eating, drinking, &c., but what they thereby bring to pass is genus.\nIndividuals sublate themselves, but genus is that which is ever brought\nforth; plants bring forth only the same plants whose ground is the\nuniversal.\nIn accordance with this, the distinction between what have been badly\nnamed natural causes and the final causes has to be determined. Now\nif I isolate individuality and merely regard it as movement and the\nmoments of the same, I show what are natural causes. For example,\nwhere has this life taken its origin? Through the generation of this\nits father and mother. What is the cause of these fruits? The tree\nwhose juices so distil themselves that the fruit forthwith arises.\nAnswers of this kind give the causes, _i.e._ the individuality\nopposed to an individuality; but their principle is the genus. Now\nnature cannot represent essence as such. The end of generation is the\nsublation of the individuality of Being; but nature which in existence\ncertainly brings about this sublation of individuality, does not set\nthe universal in its place, but another individual. Bones, muscles,\n&c., bring forth a movement; they are causes, but they themselves are\nso through other causes, and so on into infinitude. The universal,\nhowever, takes them up into itself as moments which undoubtedly appear\nin movement as causes, though the fundamental ground of these parts\nactually is the whole. It is not they which come first, but the result\ninto which the juices of the plants, &c., pass, is the first, just\nas in origination it appears only as product, as seed, that which\nconstitutes the beginning and the end, even though they be in different\nindividuals. Their real nature is the same.\nBut such a genus is itself a particular genus and is essentially\nrelated to another, _e.g._ the Idea of the plant to that of the animal;\nthe universal moves on. This looks like external teleology\u2014that plants\nare eaten by animals, &c., in which their limitation as genus lies.\nThe genus of the plant has the absolute totality of its realization in\nthe animal, the animal in the conscious existence, just as the earth\nhas it in the plant. This is the system of the whole in which each\nmoment is transitory. The double method of considering the matter thus\nis that each Idea is a circle within itself, the plant or the animal\nthe Good of its kind; and, on the other hand, each is a moment in the\nuniversal Good. If I consider the animal merely as externally adapted\nto an end, as created for something else, I consider it in a one-sided\nway; it is real existence, in and for itself universal. But it is just\nas one-sided to say that the plant, for instance, is only in and for\nitself, only end to itself, only shut up within itself and going back\ninto itself. For each idea is a circle which is complete in itself,\nbut whose completion is likewise a passing into another circle; it\nis a vortex whose middle point, that into which it returns, is found\ndirectly in the periphery of a higher circle which swallows it up.\nThus, for the first time, we reach the determination of an end in the\nworld which is immanent within it.\nThese explanations are necessary here, since hereafter we see the\nspeculative Idea coming more into the universal; it was formerly\nexpressed as Being and the moments and movements were called existent.\nWhat has to be avoided in this transition is that we should thereby\nthink that Being is given up and that we pass into consciousness\nas opposed to Being (in so doing the universal would lose all its\nspeculative significance); the universal is immanent in nature. This\nis the meaning which is present when we represent to ourselves that\nthought constitutes, orders, &c., the world. It is not, so to speak,\nthe activity of the individual consciousness, in which I stand here\non one side and, opposite to me, an actuality, matter, which I form,\ndispose and order as I will; for the universal, Thought, must abide in\nPhilosophy without this opposition. Being, pure Being, is universal\nwhen we thereby keep in mind that Being is absolute abstraction,\npure thought; but Being as it is thus set forth as Being, has the\nsignificance of the opposite to this Being-reflected-into-itself,\nto thought and recollection; the universal, on the contrary, has\nreflection immediately in itself. So far, the ancients really got:\nit does not seem far. \u201cUniversal\u201d is a dry determination; everyone\nknows about the universal, but not of it as real existence. Thought,\nindeed, reaches to the invisibility of the sensuous; not to the\npositive determinateness of thinking it as universal, but only to the\npredicateless absolute as to the merely negative; and that is as far\nas the common ideas of the present day have come. With this discovery\nof thought we conclude the first Section and enter upon the second\nperiod. The profit to be derived from the first period is not very\ngreat. Some, indeed, think that there is still some special wisdom in\nit, but thought is still young, the determinations are thus still poor,\nabstract and arid. Thought here has but few determinations\u2014water,\nBeing, number, &c.\u2014and these cannot endure; the universal must go\nforth on its own account as the self-determining activity, and this we\nfind it doing in Anaxagoras alone.\nWe have still to consider the relationship of the universal as opposed\nto Being, or consciousness as such in its relation to what is. By\nAnaxagoras\u2019 determination of real existence, this relationship of\nconsciousness is also determined. In this regard nothing satisfactory\ncan be found; for he recognized, on the one hand, thought as real\nexistence, without, however, bringing this thought to bear on ordinary\nreality. Thus, on the other hand, this is destitute of thought and\nindependent, an infinite number of hom\u0153omeri\u00e6, _i.e._ an infinite\namount of a sensuous implicit existence, which now, however, is\nsensuous Being; for existent Being is an accumulation of hom\u0153omeri\u00e6.\nThe relationship borne by consciousness to real existence may likewise\nbe various. Anaxagoras could thus either say that the truth is only in\nthought and in rational knowledge, or that it is sensuous perception;\nfor in this we have the hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 which are themselves implicit. Thus,\nin the first place, we find from him\u2014as Sextus tells us, (adv. Math.\nVII., 89-91) \u201cthat the understanding (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_) is the criterion of\nthe truth; the senses cannot judge of the truth on account of their\nweakness\u201d\u2014weakness for the hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 are the infinitely small;\nthe senses could not grasp them, do not know that they have to be\nsomething ideal and thought. A celebrated example of this is given by\nhim according to Sextus (Pyrrh. Hyp. I. 13, \u00a7. 33), in the assertion\nthat \u201cthe snow is black, for it is water, and water is black.\u201d He\nhere asserts the truth in a reason. In the second place, according to\nAristotle (Met. III. 7), Anaxagoras is said to have asserted that,\n\u201cthere is a medium between contradiction (_\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2_); so that\neverything is untrue. For because the two sides of the opposition are\nmingled, what is mingled is neither good nor not good, and thus not\ntrue.\u201d Aristotle also quotes another time from him (Met. III. 5): \u201cThat\none of his apothegms to his disciples was that to them things were as\nthey supposed them.\u201d This may relate to the fact that because existent\nBeing is an accumulation of hom\u0153omeri\u00e6 which are what really exists,\nsensuous perception takes things as they are in truth.\nThere is little more to be made of this. But here we have the beginning\nof a more distinct development of the relationship of consciousness to\nBeing, the development of the nature of knowledge as a knowledge of the\ntrue. The mind has gone forth to express real existence as Thought;\nand thus real existence as existent, is in consciousness as such; it\nis implicit but likewise in consciousness. This Being is such only in\nso far as consciousness recognizes it, and real existence is only the\nknowledge of it. The mind has no longer to seek existence in something\nforeign, since it is in itself; for what formerly appeared foreign\nis Thought, _i.e._ consciousness has this real existence in itself.\nBut this consciousness in opposition is an individual consciousness;\nthereby in fact, implicit Being is sublated, for the implicit is\nwhat is not opposed, not singled out, but universal. It is, indeed,\nknown, but what is, only is in knowledge, or it is no other Being than\nthat of the knowledge of consciousness. We see this development of\nthe universal in which real existence goes right over to the side of\nconsciousness, in the so much decried worldly wisdom of the Sophists;\nwe may view this as indicating that the negative nature of the\nuniversal is now developing.\nCHAPTER II\nFIRST PERIOD, SECOND DIVISION: FROM THE SOPHISTS TO THE SOCRATICS.\nIN this second division we have first to consider more particularly\nthe Sophists, secondly Socrates, and thirdly the Socratics, while we\ndistinguish from these Plato, and take him along with Aristotle in the\nthird division. The _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_, which is at first only grasped in a very\nsubjective manner as end, that is to say as that which is end to men,\n_i.e._ the Good, in Plato and Aristotle became understood in what is on\nthe whole an objective way, as genus or Idea. Because thought has now\nbecome set forth as principle, and this at first presents a subjective\nappearance as being the subjective activity of thought, there now sets\nin (since the absolute is posited as subject) an age of subjective\nreflection; _i.e._ there begins in this period\u2014which coincides with\nthe disintegration of Greece in the Peloponnesian war\u2014the principle of\nmodern times.\nSince in the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras, as the still formal self-determining\nactivity, determination is as yet quite undetermined, general and\nabstract, and along with that contentless throughout, the universal\nstandpoint is the immediate necessity of going on to a content which\nbegins actual determination. But what is this absolute, universal\ncontent which abstract thought as self-determining activity gives\nitself? That is the real question here. Consciousness now confronts\nthe untrammeled thought of those ancient philosophers, whose general\nideas we have considered. While hitherto the subject, when it reflected\non the absolute, only produced thoughts, and had this content before\nit, it is now seen that what is here present is not the whole, but\nthat the thinking subject likewise really belongs to the totality of\nthe objective. Furthermore, this subjectivity of thought has again\nthe double character of at once being the infinite, self-relating\nform, which as this pure activity of the universal, receives\ncontent-determinations; and, on the other hand, as consciousness\nreflects that it is the thinking subject which is thus positing, of\nalso being a return of spirit from objectivity into itself. Thus if\nthought, because it immersed itself in the object, had as such, and\nlike the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras, at first no content, because this\nstood on the other side, so now, with the return of thought as to\nthe consciousness that the subject is what thinks, we have the other\nside\u2014that what has to be dealt with is the attainment of a truly\nabsolute content. This content, taken abstractly, may itself be again\na double one. Either the \u201cI\u201d is in respect of determination the real\nwhen it makes itself and its interests the content, or the content\nbecomes determined as the altogether universal. According to this,\nwe have two questions to deal with, which are\u2014how the determination\nof what is in and for itself is to be comprehended, and how this is\nlikewise in immediate relation to the \u201cI\u201d as thinking. It comes to pass\nin Philosophy that although the \u201cI\u201d is the positing, yet the posited\ncontent of that which is thought is the object existent in and for\nitself. If one were to remain at saying that the \u201cI\u201d is that which\nposits, this would be the false idealism of modern times: in earlier\ntimes men did not remain at saying that what is thought is bad because\nI posit it.\nTo the Sophists the content is _mine_, and subjective: Socrates grasped\nthe content which is in and for itself, and the followers of Socrates\nhave, in direct connection with him, merely further defined this\ncontent.\nA.\u2014THE SOPHISTS.\nThe Notion, which reason has found in Anaxagoras to be real existence,\nis the simple negative into which all determination, all that is\nexistent and individual sinks. Before the Notion nothing can exist,\nfor it is simply the predicateless absolute to which everything is\nclearly a moment only; for it there is thus nothing so to speak\npermanently fixed and sealed. The Notion is just the constant change\nof Heraclitus, the movement, the causticity, which nothing can resist.\nThus the Notion which finds itself, finds itself as the absolute\npower before which everything vanishes; and thereby all things, all\nexistence, everything held to be secure, is now made fleeting. This\nsecurity\u2014whether it be a security of natural Being or the security of\ndefinite conceptions, principles, customs and laws\u2014becomes vacillation\nand loses its stability. As universal, such principles, &c., certainly\nthemselves pertain to the Notion, yet their universality is only\ntheir form, for the content which they have, as determinate, falls\ninto movement. We see this movement arising in the so-called Sophists\nwhom we here encounter for the first time. They gave themselves the\nname _\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af_, as teachers of wisdom, _i.e._ as those who could\nmake wise (_\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd_). The learning of the Sophists is thus directly\nthe opposite to ours, which only aspires to acquire information and\ninvestigate what is and has been\u2014it is a mass of empirical matter, in\nwhich the discovery of a new form, a new worm, or other vermin is held\nto be a point of great importance. Our learned professors are in so\nfar much less responsible than the Sophists; however, Philosophy has\nnothing to do with this lack of responsibility.\nBut as regards the relation of the Sophists to what is ordinarily\nbelieved, they are, by the healthy human understanding, as much\ndecried as by morality. By the former this is on account of their\ntheoretic teaching, since it is senseless to say that nothing is;\nand in respect of practice because they subvert all principles and\nlaws. For the first mentioned, things certainly cannot be left in\nthis confusion of movement and in their negative aspect merely; yet\nthe rest into which they pass is not the restoration of what is\nmoved into its former condition of security, as if in the end the\nresult were the same and the action were a superfluous one. Now the\nsophistry of common opinion, which is without the culture of thought\nand without scientific knowledge, is found in the fact that to it its\ndeterminations are, as such, held to be existent in and for themselves,\nand a number of rules of life, maxims, principles, &c., are considered\nas absolutely fixed truths. Mind itself is, however, the unity of these\nin many ways limited truths, which in it are all recognized as being\npresent as sublated only, as merely relative truths, _i.e._ with their\nrestrictions, in their limitation, and not as existent in themselves.\nHence these truths to the ordinary understanding, are, in fact, no\nmore, for on another occasion it allows and even asserts the opposite\nto have a value also for consciousness; or it does not know that it\nsays directly the opposite to what it means, its expression being thus\nonly an expression of contradiction. In its actions generally, and not\nin its bad actions, ordinary understanding breaks these its maxims and\nits principles itself, and if it leads a rational life, it is properly\nspeaking only a standing inconsistency, the making good of one narrow\nmaxim of conduct through breaking off from others. For example, a\nstatesman of experience and culture is one who knows how to steer a\nmiddle course, and has practical understanding, _i.e._ deals with the\nwhole extent of the case before him and not with one side of it, which\nexpresses itself in one maxim only. On the other hand, he, whoever he\nis, who acts on one maxim, is a pedant and spoils things for himself\nand others. Most commonly it is thus. For example, we hear it said, \u201cit\nis certain that the things that I see are; I believe in their reality.\u201d\nAnyone can say this quite easily. But in fact it is not true that\nhe believes in their reality; really he assumes the contrary. For he\neats and drinks them, _i.e._ he is convinced that these things are not\nin themselves, and their being has no security, no subsistence. Thus\ncommon understanding is in its actions better than it thinks, for in\naction it is Mind as a whole. But it is not here known to itself as\nMind, for what comes within its consciousness are definite laws, rules,\ngeneral propositions, such as by its understanding are esteemed to be\nthe absolute truth, whose limitation it, however, sets aside in action.\nNow, when the Notion turns to the riches which consciousness thinks to\npossess, and when the latter is sensible of the danger to its truth\nwithout which it would not be, when its fixed realities are destroyed,\nit is enraged; and the Notion which in this its realization applies\nitself to the common verities, draws hatred and disdain upon itself.\nThis is the ground of the universal denunciation of the Sophists; a\ndenunciation of healthy human understanding which does not know how\nelse to help itself.\nSophistry is certainly a word of ill-repute, and indeed it is\nparticularly through the opposition to Socrates and Plato that the\nSophists have come into such disrepute that the word usually now\nsignifies that, by false reasoning, some truth is either refuted and\nmade dubious, or something false is proved and made plausible. We\nhave to put this evil significance on one side and to forget it. On\nthe other hand, we now wish to consider further from the positive\nand properly speaking scientific side, what was the position of the\nSophists in Greece.\nIt was the Sophists who now applied the simple Notion as thought\n(which with Zeno in the Eleatic school had commenced to turn towards\nits pure counterpart, motion) to worldly objects generally, and with\nit penetrated all human relations. For it is conscious of itself as\nthe absolute and single reality, and, jealous of all else, exercises\nits power and rule in this reality as regards all else, since this\ndesires to be considered as the determinate which is not Thought. The\nthought identical with itself, thus directs its negative powers towards\nthe manifold determination of the theoretical and the practical, the\ntruths of natural consciousness and the immediately recognized laws\nand principles; and what to the ordinary conception is established,\ndissolves itself in it, and in so doing leaves it to particular\nsubjectivity to make itself first and fixed, to relate everything to\nitself.\nNow that this Notion has appeared, it has become a more universal\nPhilosophy, and not so much simple Philosophy as the universal culture\nof which every man who did not belong to those devoid of thought,\npartook, and necessarily partook. For we call culture just the Notion\nas applied in actuality, in so far as it makes its appearance not\npurely in its abstraction, but in unity with the manifold content of\nall ordinary conceptions. But in culture, the Notion is the predominant\nas also the actuating, because in both the determinate is recognized\nin its limits, in its transition into something else. This culture\nbecame the general aim of education, and there were hence a number\nof teachers of Sophistry. Indeed, the Sophists are the teachers of\nGreece through whom culture first came into existence in Greece, and\nthus they took the place of poets and of rhapsodists, who before this\nwere the ordinary instructors. For religion was no instructress, since\nno teaching was in it imparted; and though priests certainly offered\nsacrifices, prophesied and interpreted the sayings of the oracle,\ninstruction is something quite different from this. But the Sophists\neducated men in wisdom, in the sciences, music, mathematics, &c., and\nthis was their foremost aim. Before Pericles appeared in Greece, the\ndesire for culture through thought and through reflection was awakened;\nmen wished to be cultured in their ideas, and in their various\nrelations to guide themselves by thought, and no longer merely through\noracles, or through custom, passion, the feelings of the moment. For\nthe end of the State is the universal, under which the particular is\ncomprehended. Because the Sophists kept in view and enlarged upon this\nculture, they prosecuted teaching as a special calling, business, or\nprofession, as an office taking the place of schools; they travelled\nround the towns of Greece, the youth of which was by them instructed.\nNow culture is certainly an indefinite expression. It has, however,\nthis meaning, that what free thought is to attain must come out of\nitself and be personal conviction; it is then no longer believed\nbut investigated\u2014in short, it is the so-called enlightenment of\nmodern times. Thought seeks general principles by which it criticizes\neverything which is by us esteemed, and nothing has value to us which\nis not in conformity with these principles. Thus, thought undertakes\nto compare the positive content with itself, to dissolve the former\nconcrete of belief; on one side to split the content up, and, on the\nother, to isolate these individualities, these particular points of\nview and aspects, and to secure them on their own account. These\naspects, which are properly not independent, but only moments of a\nwhole, when detached from it, relate themselves to themselves, and\nin this way assume the form of universality. Any one of them can\nthus be elevated to a reason, _i.e._ to a universal determination,\nwhich is again applied to particular aspects. Thus, in culture, it is\nrequisite that men should be acquainted with the universal points of\nview which belong to a transaction, event, &c., that this point of\nview and thereby the thing, should be grasped in a universal way, in\norder to afford a present knowledge of what is in question. A judge\nknows the various laws, _i.e._ the various legal points of view under\nwhich a thing is to be considered; these are already for him universal\naspects through which he has a universal consciousness, and considers\nthe matter in a universal way. A man of culture thus knows how to say\nsomething of everything, to find points of view in all. Greece has\nto thank the Sophists for this culture, because they taught men to\nexercise thought as to what should have authority for them, and thus\ntheir culture was culture in philosophy as much as in eloquence.\nIn order to reach this double end, the Sophists were one in their\ndesire to be wise. To know what constitutes power amongst men and in\nthe State, and what I have to recognize as such, is counted as wisdom;\nand because I know the power, I also know how to direct others in\nconformity with my end. Hence the admiration that Pericles and other\nstatesmen excited, just because they knew their own standpoint, and\nhad the power of putting others in their proper place. That man is\npowerful who can deduce the actions of men from the absolute ends which\nmove them. The object of the Sophists has thus been to teach what is\nthe mainspring of the world, and since Philosophy alone knows that\nthis is the universal thought which resolves all that is particular,\nthe Sophists were also speculative philosophers. Learned in the proper\nsense they hence were not, because there were as yet no positive\nsciences without Philosophy, such as in their aridity did not concern\nall mankind and man\u2019s essential aspects.\nThey further had the most ordinary practical end, to give a\nconsciousness of that which is involved in the moral world and which\nsatisfies man. Religion taught that the gods are the powers which rule\nover men. Immediate morality recognized the rule of laws; man was to\nfind satisfaction in conforming to laws, and was to assume that others\nalso find satisfaction because they follow these laws. But from the\nreflection which here breaks in, it no longer satisfies man to obey\nlaw as an authority and external necessity, for he desires to satisfy\nhimself in himself, to convince himself, through his reflection, of\nwhat is binding upon him, what is his end and what he has to do for\nthis end. Thus the impulses and desires that man has, become his\npower; and only inasmuch as he affords them satisfaction does he\nbecome satisfied. Now the Sophists taught how these powers could be\nmoved in empirical man, for the good as ordinarily recognized, no\nlonger determined them. Rhetoric, however, teaches how circumstances\nmay be made subject to such forces; it even makes use of the wrath\nand passions of the hearer in order to bring about a conclusion. Thus\nthe Sophists were more especially the teachers of oratory, and that\nis the aspect in which the individual could make himself esteemed\namongst the people as well as carry out what was best for the people;\nthis certainly characterizes a democratic constitution, in which the\ncitizens have the ultimate decision. Because, in this way, oratory was\none of the first requirements for the rule of a people, or for making\nsomething clear to them through their ordinary ideas, the Sophists\ntrained men for common Greek life, for citizenship and for statesmen,\nwithout appearing to prepare State officials for an examination in\nspecific subjects. For the particular characteristic of eloquence is\nto show the manifold points of view existing in a thing, and to give\nforce to those which harmonize with what appears to me to be most\nuseful; it thus is the art of putting forward various points of view in\nthe concrete case, and placing others rather in the shade. Aristotle\u2019s\n_Topica_ comes to mind in the connection, inasmuch as it gives the\ncategories or thought-determinations (_\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2_), according to which we\nhave to regard things in order to learn to speak; but the Sophists were\nthe first to apply themselves to a knowledge of these.\nThis is the position taken up by the Sophists. But we find a perfectly\ndefinite picture of their further progress and procedure in Plato\u2019s\nProtagoras. Plato here makes Protagoras express himself more precisely\nrespecting the art of the Sophists. That is to say, Plato in this\ndialogue represents that Socrates accompanies a young man named\nHippocrates, who desires to place himself under Protagoras, then newly\narrived in Athens, for instruction in the science of the Sophists.\nOn the way, Socrates now asks Hippocrates what is this wisdom of\nthe Sophists which he wishes to learn. Hippocrates at first replies\nRhetoric, for the Sophist is one who knows how to make men clever\n(_\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd_) in speech. In fact, what is most striking in a man or people\nof culture is the art of speaking well, or of turning subjects round\nand considering them in many aspects. The uncultivated man finds it\nunpleasant to associate with people who know how to grasp and express\nevery point of view with ease. The French are good speakers in this\nsense, and the Germans call their talking prattle; but it is not mere\ntalk that brings about this result, for culture is also wanted. We may\nhave mastered a speech quite completely, but if we have not culture,\nit is not good speaking. Men thus learn French, not only to be able\nto speak French well, but to acquire French culture. What is to be\nobtained from the Sophists is thus the power of keeping the manifold\npoints of view present to the mind, so that the wealth of categories by\nwhich an object may be considered, immediately occurs to it. Socrates,\nindeed, remarks that the principle of the Sophists is not hereby\ndetermined in a sufficiently comprehensive way, and thus it is not\nsufficiently known what a Sophist is, \u201cyet,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have a desire\nto go on.\u201d[86] For likewise, if anyone wishes to study Philosophy, he\ndoes not as yet know what Philosophy is, else he would not need to\nstudy it.\nHaving reached Protagoras with Hippocrates, Socrates finds him in\nan assemblage of the foremost Sophists and surrounded by listeners,\n\u201cwalking about and like an Orpheus entrancing all men by his words,\nHippias sitting meanwhile on a chair with not so many round him, and\nProdicus lying amongst a great number of admirers.\u201d After Socrates\nbrought before Protagoras the request to have Hippocrates placed under\nhis instruction, in order that he might by him be taught how to become\neminent in the State, he also asks whether they might speak with him\nin public or alone. Protagoras praises his discretion, and replies\nthat they act wisely to make use of this precaution. For because the\nSophists wandered about the towns, and thus youths, deserting fathers\nand friends, followed them in view of improving themselves through\ntheir intercourse with them, they drew upon themselves much envy and\nill-will\u2014for everything new is hated. On this point Protagoras speaks\nat length: \u201cI assert that the art of the Sophists is old; but that\nthose of the ancients who practised it in fear of giving offence\u201d (for\nthe uncultured world is antagonistic to the cultured) \u201cveiled and\nconcealed it. One section, like Homer and Hesiod, taught it in their\npoetry; others, like Orpheus and Mus\u00e6us, through mysteries and oracles.\nSome, I believe, like Iccus of Tarentum, and the Sophist now living\nand unsurpassed\u2014Herodicus, of Selymbria\u2014in gymnastics, but many more\nthrough music.\u201d We see that Protagoras usually describes the end of\nmental culture as being to bring about morality, presence of mind,\nsense of order and general capacity. He adds: \u201call those who feared\nenvy arising against the sciences, required such veils and screens.\nBut I think that they do not attain their end, for men of penetration\nin the State see the end appearing through, while the people notice\nnothing, and only quote the others. If people behave so, they make\nthemselves more hated, and appear to be impostors. I have therefore\ntaken the opposite way, and openly acknowledge (_\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u1ff6_), and do not\ndeny that I am a Sophist\u201d (Protagoras first used the name of Sophist),\n\u201cand that my business is to give men culture (_\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd_).\u201d[87]\nFurther on, where the arts which Hippocrates was to acquire under\nProtagoras\u2019 instruction were discussed, Protagoras answered Socrates:\n\u201cWhat you ask is sensible, and I like to answer a sensible question.\nHippocrates will not have the same experience that he would have\nwith other teachers (_\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd_). These latter are at variance with\n(_\u03bb\u03c9\u03b2\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9_) their pupils, for they take them against their wills\nstraight back to the arts and sciences which they just wished to\nescape, inasmuch as they teach them arithmetic, geometry and music.\nBut he who comes to me will be instructed in nothing else than that in\nwhich he comes to be instructed.\u201d Thus the youths came freely, with\nthe wish to be made men of culture through his instruction, and in the\nhope that he, as teacher, knew the way to succeed in so doing. As to\nhis general aim, Protagoras says, \u201cThe instruction consists in bringing\nabout a right perception and understanding (_\u03b5\u1f50\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1_) of the best\nway of regulating one\u2019s own family affairs, and similarly as regards\ncitizenship, in qualifying men both to speak on the affairs of the\nState, and to do the best for the State.\u201d Thus two interests are here\napparent, that of the individual and that of the State. Now Socrates\nexpresses dissent and surprise at Protagoras\u2019 assertion as to imparting\ninstruction in political aptitude. \u201cI thought that the political\nvirtues could not be learned,\u201d for it is Socrates\u2019 main tenet that\nvirtue cannot be taught. And Socrates now brings forward the following\nargument, after the manner of the Sophists appealing to experience.\n\u201cThose who are masters of the art of politics cannot impart that art to\nothers. Pericles, the father of these youths, gave them instruction in\nall that instructors could teach; but not in the science for which he\nis celebrated; here he left them free to wander in the chance of their\nlighting upon wisdom. Similarly other great statesmen did not teach it\nto others, whether friends or strangers.\u201d[88]\nProtagoras now replied that it could be taught, and shows the reason\nwhy great statesmen did not give this instruction, while he asks\nwhether he is to speak as an elder to younger men in a myth, or whether\nhe should give his reasons. The company left the matter to him and\nhe began with the following myth of everlasting interest: \u201cThe gods\ncommanded Prometheus and Epimetheus to adorn the world and confer on\nit its qualities and powers. Epimetheus imparted strength, power of\nflight, arms, clothing, herbs and fruits, but in some incomprehensible\nway he gave all to the beasts, so that nothing remained to men.\nPrometheus saw them unclothed, unarmed, helpless, when the moment came\nin which the form of man had to go forth into the light. Then he stole\nfire from heaven, the arts of Vulcan and Minerva, to equip man for\nhis needs. But political wisdom was wanting, and, living without any\ncommon bond, they were in a constant state of strife and misery. Then\nZeus gave the command to Hermes to grant reverence\u201d (natural obedience,\nhonour, docility, respect of children for parents, and of men for\nhigher and better natures), \u201cand justice. Hermes asks, \u2018How shall I\nimpart them? To individuals, as particular arts are distributed, just\nas some have a knowledge of medicine sufficient for assisting others?\u2019\nBut Zeus answers that it must be to all, for no body of men (_\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2_)\ncan exist if only a few partake of those qualities. And it shall be\nthe law that whoever cannot acknowledge authority and justice must be\nexterminated as a plague to the State. Hence the Athenians when they\nwish to build, call builders into counsel, and when they contemplate\nany other business, those who have experience in it, but when they\nwish to come to a decision or make a regulation in State affairs, they\nadmit all. For all must partake of this virtue or no State could exist.\nThus if anyone is inexperienced in the art of flute-playing and yet\nprofesses to be a master in it, he is justly thought to be mad. But in\njustice it is otherwise; if anyone is not just and confesses it, he is\nthought to be mad. He must profess to be so, for everybody must either\nshare in it or be shut out from social life.\u201d[89]\nFor the fact that this political science is also so constituted \u201cthat\neveryone by education and diligence (_\u1f10\u03be \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2_) may acquire it,\u201d\nProtagoras gives additional reasons in the following argument: \u201cNo\none blames or punishes on account of a defect or evil that has come\nto anyone by nature or by chance. But defects and faults which can\nbe removed through diligence, exercise and teaching are considered\nto be blameworthy and punishable. Impiety and injustice are of this\ndescription and, generally speaking, all that opposes public virtue.\nMen guilty of these sins are thus reproached; they are punished in the\nidea that they had the power to remove the wrong and still more to\nacquire political virtue through diligence and teaching. Thus men do\nnot punish on account of what is past\u2014excepting as we strike a vicious\nbeast on the head\u2014but on account of what is to come, so that neither\nthe one who committed the crime nor any other misled by his example,\nshould do the same again. Thus it is in this implied that virtue can be\nacquired through education and exercise.\u201d[90] This is a good argument\nfor the teachability of virtue.\nAs to the statement of Socrates that men such as Pericles, who were\nfamed for their political virtues, did not impart these to their\nchildren and friends, Protagoras in the first place says that it\nmay on the other hand be replied, that in these virtues all men are\ninstructed by all men. Political virtue is so constituted that it\nis the common province of all; this one essential for all men is\njustice, temperance, and holiness\u2014in one word, whatever comprises\nmanly virtue. In it no particular education from men of eminence is\nthus required. The children are from their earliest infancy exhorted\nand admonished to do what is good, and are accustomed to that which\nis right. Instruction in music and gymnastics contributes to temper\nthe indulgence of self-will and pleasure, and to accustom men to\nconform to a law or rule; and the reading of the poets who enforce\nthis does the same. When man steps outside this circle of education,\nhe enters into that of the constitution of a State which likewise\ncontributes to keep everyone within the bounds of law and order, so\nthat political virtue is a result of the education of youth. But the\nobjection that distinguished men did not impart their distinction to\ntheir children and friends, Protagoras answered secondly and very\nwell as follows: \u201cLet us say that in a State all the citizens had to\nbecome flute-players, all would be instructed in the art; some would\nbe distinguished, many good, some mediocre, a few perhaps bad, and\nyet all would have a certain amount of skill. But it might very well\nbe the case that the son of an artist should be a bad player, for\nthe distinction depends on particular talents, and a particularly\ngood natural capacity. From very skilful players very unskilful might\ndescend, and conversely, but all would have a certain knowledge of the\nflute, and all would certainly be infinitely better than those who were\nquite ignorant of the art. Similarly all, even the worst citizens of\na rational State are better and juster than citizens of a State where\nthere is no culture nor justice nor law, in a word, where there is no\nnecessity to bring them up to be just. For this superiority they have\nto thank the education given in their State.\u201d[91] All these are quite\ngood examples and striking arguments which are not at all worse than\nCicero\u2019s reasoning\u2014_a natura insitum_. The arguments of Socrates and\nthe development of these arguments are, on the contrary, examples based\nupon experience, and are often not better than what is here placed in\nthe mouth of a Sophist.\nWhat now confronts us is the question of how far this may be\ninadequate, and particularly how far Socrates and Plato came into\ncollision with the Sophists and constituted the antagonism to them.\nFor the claim made by the Sophists in Greece was that they had given\na higher culture to their people; for this, indeed, great credit was\nascribed to them in Greece, but they were met by the reproach that\nwas encountered by all culture. That is to say, because the Sophists\nwere masters of argument and reasoning, and were within the stage of\nreflective thought, they wished, passing from the particular to the\nuniversal, to awaken attention through examples and illustrations to\nwhat in his experience and to his mind appears to man to be right.\nThis, the necessary course of free, thinking reflection, which with\nus has also been adopted by culture, must, however, necessarily lead\nbeyond implicit trust and unrestricted faith in the current morality\nand religion. The statement that the Sophists thereby fell into\none-sided principles rests upon the fact that in Greek culture the\ntime had not yet come when, out of thinking consciousness itself, the\nultimate principles had become manifested, and thus there was something\nfirm to rest upon, as is the case with us in modern times. Because,\non the one hand, the need of subjective freedom existed merely to\ngive effect to that which man himself perceives and finds present in\nhis reason (thus laws, religious ideas, only in so far as I recognize\nthem through my thought), on the other hand, no fixed principle had\nso far been found in thought; thought was rather reasoning, and\nwhat remained indeterminate could thus only be fulfilled through\nself-will. It is otherwise in our European world where culture is, so\nto speak, introduced under the protection and in presupposition of\na spiritual religion, _i.e._ not of a religion of the imagination,\nbut by presupposing a knowledge of the eternal nature of Spirit and\nof the absolute end, of the end of man, to be in a spiritual way\nactual and to posit himself in unity with the absolute spirit. Thus\nhere there is a groundwork of a fixed spiritual principle which\nthus satisfies the needs of the subjective mind; and from this\nabsolute principle all further relationships, duties, laws, &c.,\nare established. Consequently culture cannot receive the variety of\ndirection\u2014and hence the aimlessness\u2014of the Greeks and of those who\nextended culture over Greece, the Sophists. As regards the religion\nof the imagination, as regards the undeveloped principle of the Greek\nState, culture was able to divide itself into many points of view, or\nit was easy to it to represent particular subordinate points of view as\nhighest principles. Where, on the contrary, as is the case with us, a\nuniversal aim so high, indeed the highest possible, floats before the\nimagination, a particular principle cannot so easily reach this rank,\neven if the reflection of reason attains to the position of determining\nand recognizing from itself what is highest; for the subordination\nof special principles is already determined, although in form our\nenlightenment may have the same standpoint as that of the Sophists.\nAs regards content, the standpoint of the Sophists differed from\nthat of Socrates and Plato, in that the mission of Socrates was to\nexpress the beautiful, good, true, and right, as the end and aim of\nthe individual, while with the Sophists the content was not present\nas an ultimate end, so that all this was left to the individual will.\nHence came the evil reputation obtained by the Sophists through the\nantagonism of Plato, and this is certainly their defect. As to their\noutward lives, we know that the Sophists accumulated great riches;[92]\nthey became very proud, and some of them lived very luxuriously. But in\nrespect of the inward life, reasoning thought has, in distinction to\nPlato, this prevailing characteristic, that it makes duty, that which\nhas to be done, not come from the Notion of the thing as determined in\nand for itself; for it brings forward external reasons through which\nright and wrong, utility and harmfulness, are distinguished. To Plato\nand Socrates, on the other hand, the main point is that the nature of\nthe conditions should be considered, and that the Notion of the thing\nin and for itself should become evolved. Socrates and Plato wished to\nbring forward this Notion as opposed to the consideration of things\nfrom points of view and reasonings which are always merely particular\nand individual, and thus opposed to the Notion itself. The distinction\nin the two points of view is thus that cultured reasoning only belongs,\nin a general way, to the Sophists, while Socrates and Plato determined\nthought through a universal determination (the Platonic Idea), or\nsomething fixed, which mind finds eternally in itself.\nIf sophistry is bad in the sense that it signifies a quality of which\nonly bad men are guilty, it is at the same time much more common\nthan this would imply; for all argumentative reasoning, adducing of\narguments and counterarguments, bringing into prominence particular\npoints of view, is sophistry. And just as utterances of the Sophists\nare adduced against which nothing can be said (as they are by Plato),\nmen of our day are urged to all that is good for the very reasons that\nare reasons to the Sophists. Thus it is said, \u201cdo not cheat, else you\nlose your credit, hence your wealth,\u201d or, \u201cbe temperate, or you will\nspoil your appetite and have to suffer.\u201d Or for punishment men give the\nexternal reasons of improvement, &c.; or else an action is defended on\nexternal grounds taken from the result. If, on the other hand, firmly\nrooted principles lie at the foundation\u2014as in the Christian Religion,\nalthough men now remember this no longer\u2014it is said, \u201cthe grace of God\nin respect of holiness, &c., thus directs the life of men;\u201d and these\nexternal grounds fall away. Sophistry thus does not lie so far from\nus as we think. When educated men discuss matters now-a-days, it may\nseem all very good, but it is in no way different from what Socrates\nand Plato called sophistry\u2014although they themselves have adopted\nthis standpoint as truly as did the Sophists. Educated men fall into\nit when they judge of concrete cases in which a particular point of\nview determines the result, and we must in ordinary life do the same\nif we wish to make up our minds in action. If duties and virtues are\nadvocated as in sermons (this is so in most sermons), we must hear such\nreasons given. Other speakers, such as those in parliament, likewise\nmake use of arguments and counterarguments similar to these, through\nwhich they try to persuade and convince. On the one hand something\ndefinite is in question, such as the constitution, or a war, and from\nthe fixed direction thus given, certain provisions have to be deduced\nconsistently; but this consistency, on the other, soon disappears, just\nbecause the matter can be arranged either this way or that, and thus\nparticular points of view always are decisive. Men likewise make use of\ngood arguments, after the manner of the Sophists, against Philosophy.\nThere are, they say, various philosophies, various opinions, and this\nis contrary to the one Truth; the weakness of human reason allows of\nno knowledge. What is Philosophy to the feelings, mind, and heart?\nAbstract thinking about such matters produces abstruse results which\nare of no use in the practical life of man. We no longer apply the word\nsophistry thus, but it is the way of the Sophists not to take things\nas they are, but to bring about their proofs by arguments derived from\nfeelings as ultimate ends. We shall see this characteristic of the\nSophists more clearly still in Socrates and Plato.\nWith such reasoning men can easily get so far as to know (where they\ndo not, it is owing to the want of education\u2014but the Sophists were\nvery well educated) that if arguments are relied upon, everything can\nbe proved by argument, and arguments for and against can be found\nfor everything; as particular, however, they throw no light upon the\nuniversal, the Notion. Thus what has been considered the sin of the\nSophists is that they taught men to deduce any conclusion required by\nothers or by themselves; but that is not due to any special quality\nin the Sophists, but to reflective reasoning. In the worst action\nthere exists a point of view which is essentially real; if this is\nbrought to the front, men excuse and vindicate the action. In the\ncrime of desertion in time of war, there is, for example, the duty of\nself-preservation. Similarly in more modern times the greatest crimes,\nassassination, treachery, &c., have been justified, because in the\npurpose there lay a determination which was actually essential, such as\nthat men must resist the evil and promote the good. The educated man\nknows how to regard everything from the point of view of the good, to\nmaintain in everything a real point of view. A man does not require to\nmake great progress in his education to have good reasons ready for the\nworst action; all that has happened in the world since the time of Adam\nhas been justified by some good reason.\nIt appears that the Sophists were conscious of this reasoning, and\nknew, as educated men, that everything could be proved. Hence in\nPlato\u2019s Gorgias it is said that the art of the Sophists is a greater\ngift than any other; they could convince the people, the senate, the\njudges, of what they liked.[93] The advocate has similarly to inquire\nwhat arguments there are in favour of the party which claims his help,\neven if it be the opposite one to that which he wished to support.\nThat knowledge is no defect, but is part of the higher culture of\nthe Sophists; and if uneducated men naturally form conclusions from\nexternal grounds which are those alone coming to their knowledge, they\nmay perhaps be mainly determined by something besides what they know\n(by their integrity, for instance). The Sophists thus knew that on\nthis basis nothing was secure, because the power of thought treated\neverything dialectically. That is the formal culture which they had\nand imparted, for their acquaintanceship with so many points of view\nshook what was morality in Greece (the religion, duties, and laws,\nunconsciously exercised), since through its limited content, that\ncame into collision with what was different. Once it was highest\nand ultimate, then it was deposed. Ordinary knowledge thus becomes\nconfused, as we shall see very clearly in Socrates, for something\nis held to be certain to consciousness, and then other points of\nview which are also present and recognized, have similarly to be\nallowed; hence the first has no further value, or at least loses its\nsupremacy. We saw in the same way, how bravery, which lies in the\nhazarding of one\u2019s life, is made dubious by the duty of preserving\nlife, if put forward unconditionally. Plato quotes several examples\nof this unsettling tendency, as when he makes Dionysodorus maintain:\n\u201cWhoever gives culture to one who does not possess knowledge, desires\nthat he should no longer remain what he is. He desires to direct\nhim to reason, and this is to make him not the same as he is.\u201d And\nEuthydemus, when the others say that he lies, answers, \u201cWho lies, says\nwhat is not; men cannot say what is not, and thus no one can lie.\u201d[94]\nAnd again Dionysodorus says, \u201cYou have a dog, this dog has young,\nand is a father; thus a dog is your father, and you are brother to\nits young.\u201d[95] Sequences put together thus are constantly found in\ncritical treatises.\nWith this comes the question which the nature of thought brings along\nwith it. If the field of argument, that which consciousness holds to\nbe firmly established, is shaken by reflection, what is man now to\ntake as his ultimate basis? For something fixed there must be. This is\neither the good, the universal, or the individuality, the arbitrary\nwill of the subject; and both may be united, as is shown later on in\nSocrates. To the Sophists the satisfaction of the individual himself\nwas now made ultimate, and since they made everything uncertain, the\nfixed point was in the assertion, \u201cit is my desire, my pride, glory,\nand honour, particular subjectivity, which I make my end.\u201d Thus the\nSophists are reproached for countenancing personal affections, private\ninterests, &c. This proceeds directly from the nature of their culture,\nwhich, because it places ready various points of view, makes it depend\non the pleasure of the subject alone which shall prevail, that is, if\nfixed principles do not determine. Here the danger lies. This takes\nplace also in the present day where the right and the true in our\nactions is made to depend on good intention and on my own conviction.\nThe real end of the State, the best administration and constitution, is\nlikewise to demagogues very vague.\nOn account of their formal culture, the Sophists have a place in\nPhilosophy; on account of their reflection they have not. They are\nassociated with Philosophy in that they do not remain at concrete\nreasoning, but go on, at least in part, to ultimate determinations.\nA chief part of their culture was the generalization of the Eleatic\nmode of thought and its extension to the whole content of knowledge\nand of action; the positive thus comes in as, and has become, utility.\nTo go into particulars respecting the Sophists would lead us too\nfar; individual Sophists have their place in the general history of\nculture. The celebrated Sophists are very numerous; the most celebrated\namongst them are Protagoras, Gorgias, and also Prodicus, the teacher\nof Socrates, to whom Socrates ascribes the well-known myth of \u201cThe\nchoice of Hercules\u201d[96]\u2014an allegory, beautiful in its own way, which\nhas been repeated hundreds and thousands of times. I will deal only\nwith Protagoras and Gorgias, not from the point of view of culture,\nbut in respect of proving further how the general knowledge which\nthey extended to everything, has, with one of them, the universal\nform which makes it pure science. Plato is the chief source of our\nacquaintanceship with the Sophists, for he occupied himself largely\nwith them; then we have Aristotle\u2019s own little treatise on Gorgias;\nand Sextus Empiricus, who preserved for us much of the philosophy of\nProtagoras.\n1. PROTAGORAS.\nProtagoras, born at Abdera,[97] was somewhat older than Socrates;\nlittle more is known of him, nor, indeed, could there be much known.\nFor he led a uniform life, since he spent it in the study of the\nsciences; he appeared in Greece proper as the first public teacher. He\nread his writings[98] like the rhapsodists and poets, the former of\nwhom sang the verses of others, and the latter their own. There were\nthen no places of learning, no books from which men could be taught,\nfor to the ancients, as Plato says,[99] \u201cthe chief part of culture\u201d\n(_\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2_) \u201cconsisted in being skilled\u201d (_\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd_) \u201cin poetry,\u201d\njust as with us fifty years ago the principal instruction of the\npeople consisted of Bible History and Biblical precepts. The Sophists\nnow gave, in place of a knowledge of the poets, an acquaintanceship\nwith thought. Protagoras also came to Athens and there lived for\nlong, principally with the great Pericles, who also entered into this\nculture. Indeed, the two once argued for a whole day as to whether the\ndart or the thrower or he who arranged the contest was guilty of the\ndeath of a man who thus met his death.[100] The dispute is over the\ngreat and important question of the possibility of imputation; guilt\nis a general expression, the analysis of which may undoubtedly become\na difficult and extensive undertaking. In his intercourse with such\nmen, Pericles developed his genius for eloquence; for whatever kind of\nmental occupation may be in question, a cultivated mind can alone excel\nin it; and true culture is only possible through pure science. Pericles\nwas a powerful orator, and we see from Thucydides how deep a knowledge\nhe had of the State and of his people. Protagoras had the same fate\nas Anaxagoras, in being afterwards banished from Athens. The cause of\nthis sentence was a work written by him beginning, \u201cAs to the gods,\nI am not able to say whether they are or are not; for there is much\nwhich prevents this knowledge, both in the obscurity of the matter,\nand in the life of man which is so short.\u201d This book was also publicly\nburned in Athens by command of the State, and, so far as we know, it\nwas the first to be treated so. At the age of seventy or ninety years\nProtagoras was drowned while on a voyage to Sicily.[101]\nProtagoras was not, like other Sophists, merely a teacher of culture,\nbut likewise a deep and solid thinker, a philosopher who reflected\non fundamental determinations of an altogether universal kind. The\nmain point in his system of knowledge he expressed thus: \u201cMan is the\nmeasure of all things; of that which is, that it is; of that which\nis not, that it is not.\u201d[102] On the one hand, therefore, what had\nto be done was to grasp thought as determined and as having content;\nbut, on the other, to find the determining and content-giving; this\nuniversal determination then becomes the standard by which everything\nis judged. Now Protagoras\u2019 assertion is in its real meaning a great\ntruth, but at the same time it has a certain ambiguity, in that as man\nis the undetermined and many-sided, either he may in his individual\nparticularity, as this contingent man, be the measure, or else\nself-conscious reason in man, man in his rational nature and his\nuniversal substantiality, is the absolute measure. If the statement is\ntaken in the former sense, all is self-seeking, all self-interest, the\nsubject with his interests forms the central point; and if man has a\nrational side, reason is still something subjective, it is \u201che.\u201d But\nthis is just the wrong and perverted way of looking at things which\nnecessarily forms the main reproach made against the Sophists\u2014that\nthey put forward man in his contingent aims as determining; thus with\nthem the interest of the subject in its particularity, and the interest\nof the same in its substantial reason are not distinguished.\nThe same statement is brought forward in Socrates and Plato, but\nwith the further modification that here man, in that he is thinking\nand gives himself a universal content, is the measure. Thus here the\ngreat proposition is enunciated on which, from this time forward,\neverything turns, since the further progress of Philosophy only\nexplains it further: it signifies that reason is the end of all\nthings. This proposition further expresses a very remarkable change\nof position in asserting that all content, everything objective,\nis only in relation to consciousness; thought is thus in all truth\nexpressed as the essential moment, and thereby the Absolute takes the\nform of the thinking subjectivity which comes before us principally\nin Socrates. Since man, as subject, is the measure of everything,\nthe existent is not alone, but is for my knowledge. Consciousness is\nreally the producer of the content in what is objective, and subjective\nthinking is thus really active. And this view extends even to the most\nmodern philosophy, as when, for instance, Kant says that we only know\nphenomena, _i.e._ that what seems to us to be objective reality, is\nonly to be considered in its relation to consciousness, and does not\nexist without this relation. The fact that the subject as active and\ndetermining brings forth the content, is the important matter, but now\nthe question comes as to how the content is further determined\u2014whether\nit is limited to the particularity of consciousness or is determined\nas the universal, the existent in and for itself. God, the Platonic\nGood, is certainly at first a product of thought, but in the second\nplace He is just as really in and for Himself. Since I, as existent,\nfixed and eternal, only recognize what is in its content universal,\nthis, posited as it is by me, is likewise the implicitly objective, not\nposited by me.\nProtagoras himself shows us much more of what is implied in his theory,\nfor he says, \u201cTruth is a manifestation for consciousness. Nothing is\nin and for itself one, but everything has a relative truth only,\u201d\n_i.e._ it is what it is but for another, which is man. This relativity\nis by Protagoras expressed in a way which seems to us in some measure\ntrivial, and belongs to the first beginnings of reflective thought. The\ninsignificant examples which he adduces (like Plato and Socrates when\nthey follow out in them the point of view of reflection), by way of\nexplanation, show that in Protagoras\u2019 understanding what is determined\nis not grasped as the universal and identical with self. Hence the\nexemplifications are taken mostly from sensuous manifestation. \u201cIn a\nwind it may be that one person is cold and another is not; hence of\nthis wind we cannot tell whether in itself it is cold or hot.\u201d[103]\nFrost and heat are thus not anything which exist, but only are in their\nrelation to a subject; were the wind cold in itself, it would always be\nso to the subject. Or again, \u201cif we have here six dice, and place by\nthem four others, we should say of the former that there are more of\nthem. But, again, if we put twelve by them we say that these first six\nare the fewer.\u201d[104] Because we say of the same number that it is more\nand fewer, the more and the less is merely a relative determination;\nthus what is the object, is so in the idea present to consciousness\nonly. Plato, on the contrary, considered one and many, not like the\nSophists in their distinction, but as being one and the same.\nPlato says further on this point, that the white, warm, &c., or\neverything that we say of things, does not exist for itself, but that\nthe eye, sensation, is necessary to make it for us. This reciprocal\nmovement is what first creates the white, and in it the white is not a\nthing in itself, but what we have present is a seeing eye, or, to speak\ngenerally, sight, and particularly the seeing of white, the feeling\nof warmth, &c. Undoubtedly warmth, colour, &c., really are only in\nrelation to another, but the conceiving mind divides itself into itself\nand into a world in which each also has its relation. This objective\nrelativity is expressed better in the following way. If the white were\nin itself, it would be that which brought forth the sensation of it; it\nwould be the action or the cause, and we, on the contrary, the passive\nand receptive. But the object which thus requires to be active, is not\nactive until it enters into (_\u03be\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03bb\u03b8\u1fc3_) relation with the passive;\nsimilarly the passive is only in relation to the active. Thus what\nis said in defining anything never concerns the thing as in itself,\nbut clearly only as being related to something else. Nothing is thus\nconstituted in and for itself as it appears, but the truth is just\nthis phenomenon to which our activity contributes. As things appear\nto the healthy man they are thus not in themselves, but for him; as\nthey appear to the sick or deranged man, they are to him, without our\nbeing able to say that as they appear to him, they are not true.[105]\nWe feel the awkwardness of calling any such thing true, for after all\nthe existent, if related to consciousness, is yet not related to it as\nfixed, but to sensuous knowledge; and then this consciousness itself\nis a condition, _i.e._ something which passes away. Protagoras rightly\nrecognized this double relativity when he says, \u201cMatter is a pure flux,\nit is not anything fixed and determined in itself, for it can be\neverything, and it is different to different ages and to the various\nconditions of waking and sleep, &c.\u201d[106] Kant separates himself from\nthis standpoint only in that he places the relativity in the \u201cI,\u201d\nand not in objective existence. The phenomenon is, according to him,\nnothing but the fact of there being outside an impulse, an unknown\n_x_, which first receives these determinations through our feeling.\nEven if there were an objective ground for our calling one thing cold\nand another warm, we could indeed say that they must have diversity\nin themselves, but warmth and cold first become what they are in our\nfeeling. Similarly it can only be in our conception that things are\noutside of us, etc. But if the experience is quite correctly called\na \u201cphenomenon,\u201d _i.e._ something relative, because it does not come\nto pass without the determinations of the activity of our senses, nor\nwithout categories of thought, yet that one, all-pervading, universal,\nwhich permeates all experience, which to Heraclitus was necessity, has\nto be brought into consciousness.\nWe see that Protagoras possesses great powers of reflective thought,\nand indeed reflection on consciousness came to consciousness with\nProtagoras. But this is the form of manifestation which was again\ntaken by the later sceptics. The phenomenal is not sensuous Being,\nfor because I posit this as phenomenal, I assert its nullity. But the\nstatements \u201cWhat is, is only for consciousness,\u201d or \u201cThe truth of\nall things is the manifestation of them in and for consciousness,\u201d\nseem quite to contradict themselves. For it appears as though a\ncontradiction were asserted\u2014first that nothing is in itself as\nit appears, and then that it is true as it appears. But objective\nsignificance must not be given to the positive, to what is true, as\nif, for example, this were white in itself because it appears so;\nfor it is only this manifestation of the white that is true, the\nmanifestation being just this movement of the self-abrogating sensuous\nBeing, which, taken in the universal, stands above consciousness as\ntruly as above Being. The world is consequently not only phenomenal\nin that it is for consciousness, and thus that its Being is only one\nrelative to consciousness, for it is likewise in itself phenomenal. The\nelement of consciousness which Protagoras has demonstrated, and owing\nto which the developed universal has in it the moment of the negative\nBeing-for-another, has thus indeed to be asserted as a necessary\nmoment; but taken for itself, alone and isolated, it is one-sided,\nsince the moment of implicit Being is likewise essential.\n2. GORGIAS.\nThis scepticism reached a much deeper point in Gorgias of Leontium in\nSicily, a man of great culture, and also distinguished as a statesman.\nDuring the Peloponnesian war he was, in Ol. 88, 2 (427 B.C.), a few\nyears after Pericles\u2019 death in Ol. 87, 4, sent from his native town\nto Athens.[107] And when he attained his object, he went through many\nother Greek towns, such as Larissa in Thessaly, and taught in them.\nThus he obtained great wealth, along with much admiration, and this\nlasted till his death at over a hundred years of age.\nHe is said to have been a disciple of Empedocles, but he also knew the\nEleatics, and his dialectic partakes of the manner and method of the\nlatter; indeed Aristotle, who preserves this dialectic, in the work\n_De Xenophane, Zenone et Gorgia_, which has indeed only come to us in\nfragments, deals with them together. Sextus Empiricus also gives us in\nfull the dialectic of Gorgias. He was strong in the dialectic requisite\nfor eloquence, but his preeminence lies in his pure dialectic\nrespecting the quite universal categories of Being and non-being, which\nindeed is not like that of the Sophists. Tiedemann (Geist. der Spec.\nPhil. vol. I. p. 362) says very falsely: \u201cGorgias went much further\nthan any man of healthy mind could go.\u201d Tiedemann could say of every\nphilosopher that he went further than healthy human understanding, for\nwhat men call healthy understanding is not Philosophy, and is often\nfar from healthy. Healthy human understanding possesses the modes of\nthought, maxims, and judgments of its time, the thought-determinations\nof which dominate it without its being conscious thereof. In this\nway Gorgias undoubtedly went further than healthy understanding.\nBefore Copernicus it would have been contrary to all healthy human\nunderstanding if anyone had said that the earth went round the sun,\nor before the discovery of America, if it were said that there was a\ncontinent there. In India or in China a republic would even now be\ncontrary to all healthy understanding. The dialectic of Gorgias moves\nmore purely in Notion than that found in Protagoras. Since Protagoras\nasserted the relativity, or the non-implicit nature of all that is,\nthis only exists in relation to another which really is essential to\nit; and this last, indeed, is consciousness. Gorgias\u2019 demonstration of\nthe non-implicitness of Being is purer, because he takes in itself what\npasses for real existence without presupposing that other, and thus\nshows its own essential nullity and separates therefrom the subjective\nside and Being as it is for the latter.\nGorgias\u2019 treatise \u201cOn Nature,\u201d in which he composes his dialectic,\nfalls, according to Sextus Empiricus (adv. Math. VII. 65), into three\nparts. \u201cIn the first he proves that\u201d (objectively) \u201cnothing exists, in\nthe second\u201d (subjectively), \u201cthat assuming that Being is, it cannot be\nknown; and in the third place\u201d (both subjectively and objectively),\n\u201cthat were it to exist and be knowable, no communication of what is\nknown would be possible.\u201d Gorgias was a congenial subject to Sextus,\nbut the former still proved, and this is what the Sceptics ceased\nto do. Here very abstract thought-determinations regarding the most\nspeculative moments of Being and non-being, of knowledge, and of\nbringing into existence, of communicating knowledge, are involved; and\nthis is no idle talk, as was formerly supposed, for Gorgias\u2019 dialectic\nis of a quite objective kind, and is most interesting in content.\n_a._ \u201cIf anything is,\u201d (this \u201canything\u201d is, however, a makeshift\nthat we are in the habit of using in our conversation, and which\nis, properly speaking, inappropriate, for it implies an opposition\nof subject and predicate, while at present the \u201cis\u201d alone is in\nquestion)\u2014then \u201cif it _is_\u201d (and now it becomes for the first time\ndefined as subject) \u201cit is either the existent or the non-existent, or\nelse existence and non-existence. It is now evident of these three that\nthey are not.\u201d[108]\n_\u03b1_. \u201cThat which is not, is not; for if Being belonged to it, there\nwould at the same time be existence and non-existence. That is, in so\nfar as it is thought of as non-existent, it is not; but in so far as\nit _is_ the non-existent, it must exist. But it cannot at the same\ntime be and not be. Again, if the non-existent is, the existent is\nnot, for the two are opposed. Thus, if Being pertained to non-being,\nnon-being would belong to Being. But if Being does not exist, no more\ndoes non-being.\u201d[109] This is with Gorgias a characteristic mode of\nreasoning.[110]\n_\u03b2_. \u201cBut in proving,\u201d Aristotle adds to the passages just quoted,\n\u201cthat the existent is not, he follows Melissus and Zeno.\u201d This is\nthe dialectic already brought forward by them. \u201cIf Being is, it is\ncontradictory to predicate a quality to it, and if we do this, we\nexpress something merely negative about it.\u201d\n_\u03b1\u03b1_. For Gorgias says: \u201cWhat is, either is in itself (_\u1f00\u0390\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_)\nbeing without beginning, or it has originated,\u201d and he now shows\nthat it could neither be the one nor the other, for each leads to\ncontradiction. \u201cIt cannot be the former, for what is in itself has\nno beginning, and is the infinite,\u201d and hence likewise undetermined\nand indeterminable. \u201cThe infinite is nowhere, for if it is anywhere,\nthat in which it is, is different from it.\u201d Where it is, it is in\nanother, \u201cbut that is not infinite which is different from another,\nand contained in another. Just as little is it contained in itself,\nfor then that in which it is, and that which is therein, would be the\nsame. What it is in, is the place; that which is in this, is the body;\nbut that both should be the same is absurd. The infinite does not thus\nexist.\u201d[111] This dialectic of Gorgias regarding the infinite is on\nthe one hand limited, because immediate existence has certainly no\nbeginning and no limit, but asserts a progression into infinitude; the\nself-existent Thought, the universal Notion, as absolute negativity,\nhas, however, limits in itself. On the other hand, Gorgias is quite\nright, for the bad, sensuous infinite is nowhere present, and thus\ndoes not exist, but is a Beyond of Being; only we may take what\nGorgias takes as a diversity of place, as being diversity generally.\nThus, instead of placing the infinite, like Gorgias, sometimes in\nanother, sometimes within itself, _i.e._ sometimes maintaining it to be\ndifferent, sometimes abrogating the diversity, we may say better and\nmore universally, that this sensuous infinite is a diversity which is\nalways posited as different from the existent, for it is just the being\ndifferent from itself.\n\u201cIn the same way Being has not originated, because it must then have\ncome either from the existent or from the non-existent. From the\nexistent it did not arise, for then it would be already; just as little\nfrom the non-existent, because this cannot beget anything.\u201d[112] The\nsceptics followed this up further. The object to be contemplated\nhence ever becomes posited under determinations with \u2018either\u2019 \u2018or,\u2019\nwhich then contradict one another. But that is not the true dialectic,\nbecause the object resolves itself into those determinations only; when\nnothing follows respecting the nature of the object itself, then, as is\nalready proved, the object must be necessarily in one determination,\nand not in and for itself.\n_\u03b2\u03b2_. In a similar way Gorgias shows \u201cof what exists, that it must\neither be one or many; but neither is possible. For as one, it would\nhave a certain magnitude, or continuity, or number, or body, but all\nthis is not one, but different, divisible. Every sensuous one is, in\nfact, necessarily another, a manifold. If it is not one, it cannot be\nmany, for the many is many ones.\u201d[113]\n_\u03b3_. \u201cSimilarly both, Being and non-being, cannot exist at the same\ntime. If one exists as much as the other, they are the same, and\ntherefore neither of them is, for the non-being does not exist, and\nhence neither does the Being, since it is identical with it. Nor can\nthey, on the other hand, both exist, for if they are identical, I\ncannot express them both,\u201d[114] and thus both do not exist, for if I\nexpress both, I differentiate. This dialectic, which Aristotle (De\nXenoph. &c., c. 5) likewise designates as peculiar to Gorgias, has its\ntruth. In speaking of Being and non-being, we always say the opposite\nto what we wish. Being and non-being are the same, just as they are\nnot the same; if they are the same, I speak of the two as different:\nif different, I express the same predicate of them, diversity. This\ndialectic is not to be despised by us, as if it dealt with empty\nabstractions, for these categories are, on the one hand, in their\npurity the most universal, and if, on the other hand, they are not the\nultimate, yet it is always Being or non-being that are in question;\nthey are not, however, definitely fixed and divided off, but are\nself-abrogating. Gorgias is conscious that they are vanishing moments,\nwhile the ordinary unconscious conception also has present to it this\ntruth, but knows nothing about it.\n_b._ The relation of the conceiver to conception, the difference\nbetween conception and Being, is a subject which is in our mouths\nto-day. \u201cBut if there is an \u2018is,\u2019 it is unknowable and unthinkable, for\nwhat is presented is not the existent\u201d but only a presentation. \u201cIf\nwhat is presented is white, it is the case that white is presented;\nif what is presented is not the really existent, it is the case that\nwhat is, is not presented. For if what is presented is the real\nexistent, everything that is presented also exists, but no one says\nthat if a flying man, or waggon riding on the sea were presented to\nus, it would exist. Further, if what is presented is the existent, the\nnon-existent is not presented, for opposites are in opposition. But\nthis non-existent is everywhere presented as it is in Scylla and the\nChim\u00e6ra.[115] Gorgias on the one hand pronounces a just polemic against\nabsolute realism, which, because it represents, thinks to possess the\nvery thing itself, when it only has a relative, but he falls, on the\nother hand, into the false idealism of modern times, according to which\nthought is always subjective only, and thus not the existent, since\nthrough thought an existent is transformed into what is thought.\u201d\n_c._ We finally have the basis of the dialectic of Gorgias in respect\nof the third point, that knowledge cannot be imparted, in this: \u201cIf the\nexistent were presented, it could still not be expressed and imparted.\nThings are visible, audible, &c., or are experienced. The visible\nis grasped through sight, the audible through hearing, and not the\ncontrary way; thus, the one cannot be indicated by the other. Speech,\nby which the existent has to be expressed, is not the existent; what is\nimparted is thus not the existent, but only words.[116] In this manner\nGorgias\u2019 dialectic is the laying hold of this difference exactly as\nagain occurred in Kant; if I maintain this difference, certainly that\nwhich is, cannot be known.\u201d\nThis dialectic is undoubtedly impregnable to those who maintain\nsensuous Being to be real. But its truth is only this movement to\nposit itself negatively as existent, and the unity is the reflection\nthat the existent, comprehended also as non-existent, becomes, in this\ncomprehension of it, universal. That this existent cannot be imparted,\nmust likewise be held most strongly, for _this_ individual cannot be\nexpressed. Philosophic truth is thus not only expressed as if there\nwere another truth in sensuous consciousness; but Being is present\nin that philosophic truth expresses it. The Sophists thus also made\ndialectic, universal Philosophy, their object, and they were profound\nthinkers.\nB.\u2014SOCRATES.\nConsciousness had reached this point in Greece, when in Athens the\ngreat form of Socrates, in whom the subjectivity of thought was brought\nto consciousness in a more definite and more thorough manner, now\nappeared. But Socrates did not grow like a mushroom out of the earth,\nfor he stands in continuity with his time, and thus is not only a\nmost important figure in the history of Philosophy\u2014perhaps the most\ninteresting in the philosophy of antiquity\u2014but is also a world-famed\npersonage. For a mental turning-point exhibited itself in him in the\nform of philosophic thought. If we shortly recall the periods already\npassed over, we find that the ancient Ionic philosophers certainly\nthought, but without reflecting on the thought or defining its product\nas thought. The Atomists made objective existence into thoughts, but\nthese were to them only abstractions, pure entities. Anaxagoras, on the\nother hand, raised thought as such, into a principle which thereby\npresented itself as the all-powerful Notion, as the negative power\nover all that is definite and existent. Protagoras finally expresses\nthought as real existence, but it is in this its movement, which is\nthe all-resolving consciousness, the unrest of the Notion. This unrest\nis in itself at the same time something restful or secure. But the\nfixed point of motion as such, is the \u2018I,\u2019 for it has the moments of\nmovement outside of it; as the self-retaining, which only abrogates\nwhat is different, the \u2018I\u2019 is negative unity, but just in that very\nway individual, and not yet the universal reflected within itself. Now\nwe here find the ambiguity of dialectic and sophistry, which rests\nin the fact that if the objective disappears, the signification of\nthe fixed subjective is either that of the individual opposed to the\nobjective, and thereby the contingent and lawless will, or that of the\nobjective and universal in itself. Socrates expresses real existence\nas the universal \u2018I,\u2019 as the consciousness which rests in itself; but\nthat is the good as such, which is free from existent reality, free\nfrom individual sensuous consciousness of feeling and desire, free\nfinally from the theoretically speculative thought about nature, which,\nif indeed thought, has still the form of Being and in which I am not\ncertain of my existence.\nSocrates herein adopted firstly the doctrine of Anaxagoras that\nthought, the understanding, is the ruling and self-determining\nuniversal, though this principle did not, as with the Sophists, attain\nthe form of formal culture or of abstract philosophizing. Thus, if with\nSocrates, as with Protagoras, the self-conscious thought that abrogates\nall that is determined, was real existence, with Socrates this was\nthe case in such a way that he at the same time grasped in thought\nrest and security. This substance existing in and for itself, the\nself-retaining, has become determined as end, and further as the true\nand the good.\nTo this determination of the universal, we have, in the second place,\nto add that this good, which has by me to be esteemed as substantial\nend, must be known by me; with this the infinite subjectivity, the\nfreedom of self-consciousness in Socrates breaks out. This freedom\nwhich is contained therein, the fact that consciousness is clearly\npresent in all that it thinks, and must necessarily be at home\nwith itself, is in our time constantly and plainly demanded; the\nsubstantial, although eternal and in and for itself, must as truly\nbe produced through me; but this my part in it is only the formal\nactivity. Thus Socrates\u2019 principle is that man has to find from himself\nboth the end of his actions and the end of the world, and must attain\nto truth through himself. True thought thinks in such a way that its\nimport is as truly objective as subjective. But objectivity has been\nthe significance of substantial universality, and not of external\nobjectivity; thus truth is now posited as a product mediated through\nthought, while untrained morality, as Sophocles makes Antigone say\n(vers. 454-457), is \u201cthe eternal law of the Gods\u201d:\n\u201cAnd no one knew from whence it came.\u201d\nBut though in modern times we hear much said of immediate knowledge and\nbelief, it is a misconception to maintain that their content, God, the\nGood, Just, &c., although the content of feeling and conception, is\nnot, as spiritual content, also posited through thought. The animal has\nno religion, because it only feels; but what is spiritual rests on the\nmediation of thought, and pertains to man.\nSince Socrates thus introduces the infinitely important element\nof leading back the truth of the objective to the thought of the\nsubject, just as Protagoras says that the objective first is through\nrelation to us, the battle of Socrates and Plato with the Sophists\ncannot rest on the ground that these, as belonging to the old faith,\nmaintained against the others the religion and customs of Greece, for\nthe violation of which Anaxagoras was condemned. Quite the contrary.\nReflection, and the reference of any judgment to consciousness, is\nheld by Socrates in common with the Sophists. But the opposition into\nwhich Socrates and Plato were in their philosophy necessarily brought\nin regard to the Sophists, as the universal philosophic culture of\nthe times, was as follows:\u2014The objective produced through thought,\nis at the same time in and for itself, thus being raised above all\nparticularity of interests and desires, and being the power over\nthem. Hence because, on the one hand, to Socrates and Plato the\nmoment of subjective freedom is the directing of consciousness into\nitself, on the other, this return is also determined as a coming out\nfrom particular subjectivity. It is hereby implied that contingency\nof events is abolished, and man has this outside within him, as the\nspiritual universal. This is the true, the unity of subjective and\nobjective in modern terminology, while the Kantian ideal is only\nphenomenal and not objective in itself.\nIn the third place Socrates accepted the Good at first only in the\nparticular significance of the practical, which nevertheless is only\none mode of the substantial Idea; the universal is not only for me,\nbut also, as end existent in and for itself, the principle of the\nphilosophy of nature, and in this higher sense it was taken by Plato\nand Aristotle. Of Socrates it is hence said, in the older histories\nof Philosophy, that his main distinction was having added ethics as\na new conception to Philosophy, which formerly only took nature into\nconsideration. Diogenes Laertius, in like manner says (III., 56), that\nthe Ionics founded natural philosophy, Socrates ethics, and Plato\nadded to them dialectic. Now ethics is partly objective, and partly\nsubjective and reflected morality [Sittlichkeit und Moralit\u00e4t],[117]\nand the teaching of Socrates is properly subjectively moral, because\nin it the subjective side, my perception and meaning, is the prevailing\nmoment, although this determination of self-positing is likewise\nsublated, and the good and eternal is what is in and for itself.\nObjective morality is, on the contrary, natural, since it signifies the\nknowledge and doing of what is in and for itself good. The Athenians\nbefore Socrates were objectively, and not subjectively, moral, for\nthey acted rationally in their relations without knowing that they\nwere particularly excellent. Reflective morality adds to natural\nmorality the reflection that this is the good and not that; the Kantian\nphilosophy, which is reflectively moral, again showed the difference.\nBecause Socrates in this way gave rise to moral philosophy, all\nsucceeding babblers about morality and popular philosophy constituted\nhim their patron and object of adoration, and made him into a cloak\nwhich should cover all false philosophy. As he treated it, it was\nundoubtedly popular; and what contributed to make it such was that\nhis death gave him the never-failing interest derived from innocent\nsuffering. Cicero (Tusc. Qu\u00e6st. V. 4), whose manner of thought was,\non the one hand, of the present, and who, on the other hand, had the\nbelief that Philosophy should yield itself up, and hence succeeded in\nattaining to no content in it, boasted of Socrates (what has often\nenough been said since) that his most eminent characteristic was\nto have brought Philosophy from heaven to earth, to the homes and\nevery-day life of men, or, as Diogenes Laertius expresses it (II. 21),\n\u201cinto the market place.\u201d There we have what has just been said. This\nwould seem as if the best and truest Philosophy were only a domestic\nor fireside philosophy, which conforms to all the ordinary ideas of\nmen, and in which we see friends and faithful ones talk together\nof righteousness, and of what can be known on the earth, without\nhaving penetrated the depths of the heavens, or rather the depths of\nconsciousness. But this last is exactly what Socrates, as these men\nthemselves indicate, first ventured to do. And it was not incumbent on\nhim to reflect upon all the speculations of past Philosophy, in order\nto be able to come down in practical philosophy to inward thought. This\ngives a general idea of his principle.\nWe must examine more closely this noteworthy phenomenon, and begin with\nthe history of Socrates\u2019 life. This is, however, closely intertwined\nwith his interest in Philosophy, and the events of his life are bound\nup with his principles. We have first of all to consider the beginning\nof his life only. Socrates, whose birth occurs in the fourth year of\nthe 77th Olympiad (469 B.C.), was the son of Sophroniscus, a sculptor,\nand of Ph\u00e6narete, a midwife. His father brought him up to sculpture,\nand it is said that Socrates acquired skill in the art, and long after,\nstatues of draped Graces, found in the Acropolis, were ascribed to\nhim. But his art did not satisfy him; a great desire for Philosophy,\nand love of scientific research, got possession of him. He pursued his\nart merely to get money for a necessary subsistence, and to be able to\napply himself to the study of the sciences; and it is told of Crito, an\nAthenian, that he defrayed the cost of Socrates\u2019 instruction by masters\nin all the arts. During the exercise of his art, and specially after he\ngave it up altogether, he read the works of ancient philosophers in so\nfar as he could get possession of them. At the same time he attended\nAnaxagoras\u2019 instructions, and, after his expulsion from Athens, at\nwhich time Socrates was thirty-seven years old, those of Archelaus,\nwho was regarded as Anaxagoras\u2019 successor, besides those of Sophists\ncelebrated in other sciences. Amongst these he heard Prodicus, a\ncelebrated teacher of oratory, whom, according to Xenophon (Memorab.\nII. c. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 34), he mentions with affection, and other teachers of\nmusic, poetry, etc. He was esteemed as on all sides a man of culture,\nwho was instructed in everything then requisite thereto.[118]\nAnother feature in his life was that he fulfilled the duty of\nprotecting his country, which rested on him as an Athenian citizen.\nHence he made three campaigns in the Peloponnesian war, which occurred\nduring his life. The Peloponnesian war led to the dissolution of\nGreek life, inasmuch as it was preparatory to it; and what took place\npolitically was by Socrates carried out in thinking consciousness. In\nthese campaigns he not only acquired the fame of a brave warrior, but,\nwhat was best of all, the merit of having saved the lives of other\ncitizens. In the first, he was present at the tedious siege of Potid\u00e6a\nin Thrace. Here Alcibiades had already attached himself to him, and,\naccording to Plato, he recited in the Banquet (p. 219-222, Steph.; p.\n461-466, Bekk.), a eulogy on Socrates for being able to endure all\ntoil, hunger and thirst, heat and cold, with mind at rest and health\nof body. In an engagement in this campaign he saw Alcibiades wounded\nin the midst of the enemy, lifted him up, forced his way through, and\nsaved both him and his arms. The generals rewarded him with a wreath,\nwhich was the prize of the bravest; Socrates did not, however, take\nit, maintaining that it was given to Alcibiades. In this campaign\nit is said that once, sunk in deep meditation, he stood immovable\non one spot the whole day and night, until the morning sun awoke\nhim from his trance\u2014a condition in which he is said often to have\nbeen. This was a cataleptic state, which may bear some relation to\nmagnetic somnambulism, in which Socrates became quite dead to sensuous\nconsciousness. From this physical setting free of the inward abstract\nself from the concrete bodily existence of the individual, we have, in\nthe outward manifestation, a proof of how the depths of his mind worked\nwithin him. In him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of consciousness\nthat in an anthropological way existed in the first instance in him,\nand became later on a usual thing. He made his other campaign in B\u0153otia\nat Delium, a small fortification which the Athenians possessed not\nfar from the sea, and where they had an unfortunate, though not an\nimportant engagement. Here Socrates saved another of his favourites,\nXenophon; he saw him in the flight, for Xenophon, having lost his\nhorse, lay wounded on the ground. Socrates took him over his shoulders,\ncarried him off, defending himself at the same time with the greatest\ntranquillity and presence of mind from the pursuing enemy. Finally\nhe made his last campaign at Amphipolis in Edonis, on the Strymonian\nBay.[119]\nBesides this, he occupied various civil offices. At the time when the\ndemocratic constitution of Athens hitherto existing, was taken away\nby the Lacedemonians, who now introduced everywhere an aristocratic\nand indeed tyrannical rule, whereby they in great measure put\nthemselves at the head of affairs, he was chosen for the council,\nwhich, as a representative body, took the place of the people. Here he\ndistinguished himself by his immovable firmness in what he held to be\nright as against the wills of the thirty tyrants, as formerly against\nthe will of the people. For he sat in the tribunal which condemned\nthe ten generals to death, because, as admirals at the battle of\nArginus\u00e6, though they certainly had conquered, yet, being kept back\nthrough storm, they had not dragged out the bodies nor buried them\non the shore, and because they neglected to erect trophies; _i.e._\nreally because they did not stand their ground, and thus appeared to\nhave been beaten. Socrates alone did not agree with this decision,\ndeclaring himself more emphatically against the people than against\nthe rulers.[120] To-day he fares badly who says anything against\nthe people. \u201cThe people have excellent intelligence, understand\neverything, and have only the most excellent intentions.\u201d As to rulers,\ngovernments, ministers, it is self-evident that \u201cthey understand\nnothing, and only desire and bring forth what is bad.\u201d\nAlong with these to him more accidental relationships to the State, in\nwhich he acted only from the ordinary sense of citizenship, without\nspontaneously making the affairs of the State his real business, or\npressing on to the head of public affairs, the real business of his\nlife was to discuss moral philosophy with any who came in his way. His\nphilosophy, which asserts that real existence is in consciousness as a\nuniversal, is still not a properly speculative philosophy, but remained\nindividual; yet the aim of his philosophy was that it should have a\nuniversal significance. Hence we have to speak of his own individual\nbeing, of his thoroughly noble character, which usually is depicted\nas a complete catalogue of the virtues adorning the life of a private\ncitizen; and these virtues of Socrates are certainly to be looked at\nas his own, and as made habitual to him by his own will. It has to be\nnoted that with the ancients these qualities have generally more of the\ncharacter of virtue, because with the ancients, in ordinary morality,\nindividuality, as the form of the universal, was given free scope, so\nthat virtues were regarded more as the actions of the individual will,\nand thus as personal qualities; while with us they seem to be less what\nis meritorious to the individual, or what comes from himself as this\nunit. We are accustomed to think of them much more as what exists, as\nduty, because we have a fuller consciousness of the universal, and\nconsider the pure individual, the personal inward consciousness, as\nreal existence and duty. With us virtues are hence actually either\nelements in our dispositions and nature, or they have the form of the\nuniversal and of what is necessary; but with Socrates they have the\nform, not of ordinary morality or of a natural or necessary thing, but\nof an independent determination. It is well known that his appearance\nindicated naturally low and hateful qualities, which, as indeed he\nsays, he himself subdued.\nHe lived amongst his fellow-citizens, and stands before us as one\nof those great plastic natures consistent through and through, such\nas we often see in those times\u2014resembling a perfect classical work\nof art which has brought itself to this height of perfection. Such\nindividuals are not made, but have formed themselves into what they\nare; they have become that which they wished to be, and are true to\nthis. In a real work of art the distinguishing point is that some idea\nis brought forth, a character is presented in which every trait is\ndetermined by the idea, and, because this is so, the work of art is,\non the one hand, living, and, on the other, beautiful, for the highest\nbeauty is just the most perfect carrying out of all sides of the\nindividuality in accordance with the one inward principle. Such works\nof art are also seen in the great men of every time. The most plastic\nindividual as a statesman is Pericles, and round him, like stars,\nSophocles, Thucydides, Socrates, &c., worked out their individuality\ninto an existence of its own\u2014into a character which regulated their\nwhole being, and which was one principle running throughout the whole\nof their existence. Pericles alone lived with the sole end of being a\nstatesman. Plutarch (in Pericle, c. 5, 7) says of him that, from the\ntime that he devoted himself to the business of the State, he laughed\nno more, and never again went to a feast. Thus, too, Socrates formed\nhimself, through his art and through the power of self-conscious\nwill, into this particular character, and acquired this capacity for\nthe business of his life. Through his principle he attained that\nfar-reaching influence which has lasted to the present day in relation\nto religion, science, and justice, for since his time the genius of\ninward conviction has been the basis which must be fundamental. And\nsince this principle proceeded from the plasticity of his character,\nit is very inappropriate when Tennemann regrets (Vol. II. p. 26) \u201cthat\nthough we know what he was, we do not know how he became such.\u201d\nSocrates was a peaceful, pious example of the moral virtues\u2014of wisdom,\ndiscretion, temperance, moderation, justice, courage, inflexibility,\nfirm sense of rectitude in relation to tyrants and people; he was\nequally removed from cupidity and despotism. His indifference to money\nwas due to his own determination, for, according to the custom of the\ntimes, he could acquire it through the education of youth, like other\nteachers. On the other side, this acquisition was purely matter of\nchoice, and not, as with us, something which is accepted, so that to\ntake nothing would be to break through a custom, thus to present the\nappearance of wishing to become conspicuous, and to be more blamed than\npraised. For this was not yet a State affair; it was under the Roman\nemperors that there first were schools with payment. This moderation\nof his life was likewise a power proceeding from conscious knowledge,\nbut this is not a principle found to hand, but the regulation of self\nin accordance with circumstances; in company he was, however, a good\nfellow. His sobriety in respect to wine is best depicted in Plato\u2019s\n\u201cSymposium,\u201d in a very characteristic scene in which we see what\nSocrates called virtue. Alcibiades there appears, no longer sober, at a\nfeast given by Agathon, on the occasion of a success which his tragedy\nhad obtained on the previous day at the games. Since the company had\ndrunk much on the first day of the feast, the assembled guests, amongst\nwhom was Socrates, this evening took a resolution, in opposition to the\nGreek custom at meals, to drink little. Alcibiades, finding that he\nwas coming in amongst abstemious men, and that there was no one else\nin his own frame of mind, made himself king of the feast, and offered\nthe goblet to the others, in order to bring them into the condition\nreached by himself; but with Socrates he said that he could do nothing,\nbecause he remained as he was, however much he drank. Plato then makes\nthe individual who tells what happened at the Banquet, also tell that\nhe, with the others, at last fell asleep on the couch, and as he awoke\nin the morning, Socrates, cup in hand, still talked with Aristophanes\nand Agathon about comedy and tragedy, and whether one man could write\nboth comedies and tragedies, and then went at the usual time into the\npublic places, to the Lyceum, as if nothing had happened, and walked\nabout the whole day as usual.[121] This is not a moderation which\nexists in the least possible enjoyment, no aimless abstemiousness and\nself-mortification, but a power belonging to consciousness, which keeps\nits self-possession in bodily excess. We see from this that we have\nnot to think of Socrates throughout after the fashion of the litany of\nmoral virtues.\nHis behaviour to others was not only just, true, open, without\nrudeness, and honourable, but we also see in him an example of the most\nperfect Attic urbanity; i.e. he moves in the freest possible relations,\nhas a readiness for conversation which is always judicious, and,\nbecause it has an inward universality, at the same time always has the\nright living relationship to the individual, and bears upon the case\non which it operates. The intercourse is that of a most highly cultured\nman who, in his relation to others, never places anything personal in\nall his wit, and sets aside all that is unpleasant. Thus Xenophon\u2019s,\nbut particularly Plato\u2019s Socratic Dialogues belong to the highest type\nof this fine social culture.\nBecause the philosophy of Socrates is no withdrawal from existence now\nand here into the free, pure regions of thought, but is in a piece\nwith his life, it does not proceed to a system; and the manner of his\nphilosophizing, which appears to imply a withdrawal from actual affairs\nas it did to Plato, yet in that very way gives itself this inward\nconnection with ordinary life. For his more special business was his\nphilosophic teaching, or rather his philosophic social intercourse (for\nit was not, properly speaking, teaching) with all; and this outwardly\nresembled ordinary Athenian life in which the greater part of the\nday was passed without any particular business, in loitering about\nthe market-place, or frequenting the public Lyceum, and there partly\npartaking of bodily exercises, and partly and principally, talking\nwith one another. This kind of intercourse was only possible in the\nAthenian mode of life, where most of the work which is now done by a\nfree citizen\u2014by a free republican and free imperial citizen alike\u2014was\nperformed by slaves, seeing that it was deemed unworthy of free men.\nA free citizen could in Athens certainly be a handicraftsman, but he\nhad slaves who did the work, just as a master now has workmen. At\nthe present day such a life of movement would not be suitable to our\ncustoms. Now Socrates also lounged about after this manner, and lived\nin this constant discussion of ethical questions.[122] Thus what he\ndid was what came naturally to him, and what can in general be called\nmoralizing; but its nature and method was not that of preaching,\nexhortation or teaching; it was not a dry morality. For amongst the\nAthenians and in Attic urbanity, this had no place, since it is not a\nreciprocal, free, and rational relationship. But with all men, however\ndifferent their characters, he entered on one kind of dialogue, with\nall that Attic urbanity which, without presumption on his part, without\ninstructing others, or wishing to command them, while maintaining their\nperfect right to freedom, and honouring it, yet causes all that is rude\nto be suppressed.\n1. _The Socratic Method._ In this conversation Socrates\u2019 philosophy is\nfound, as also what is known as the Socratic method, which must in its\nnature be dialectic, and of which we must speak before dealing with\nthe content. Socrates\u2019 manner is not artificial; the dialogues of the\nmoderns, on the contrary, just because no internal reason justifies\ntheir form, are necessarily tedious and heavy. But the principle of\nhis philosophy falls in with the method itself, which thus far cannot\nbe called method, since it is a mode which quite coincides with the\nmoralizing peculiar to Socrates. For the chief content is to know the\ngood as the absolute, and that particularly in relation to actions.\nSocrates gives this point of view so high a place, that he both puts\naside the sciences which involve the contemplation of the universal in\nnature, mind, &c., himself, and calls upon others to do the same.[123]\nThus it can be said that in content his philosophy had an altogether\npractical aspect, and similarly the Socratic method, which is essential\nto it, was distinguished by the system of first bringing a person to\nreflection upon his duty by any occasion that might either happen\nto be offered spontaneously, or that was brought about by Socrates.\nBy going to the work-places of tailors and shoemakers, and entering\ninto discourse with them, as also with youths and old men, Sophists,\nstatesmen, and citizens of all kinds, he in the first place took\ntheir interests as his topic\u2014whether these were household interests,\nthe education of children, or the interests of knowledge or of truth.\nThen he led them on from a definite case to think of the universal,\nand of truths and beauties which had absolute value, since in every\ncase, from the individual\u2019s own thoughts, he derived the conviction\nand consciousness of that which is the definite right. This method has\ntwo prominent aspects, the one the development of the universal from\nthe concrete case, and the exhibition of the notion which implicitly\nexists in every consciousness,[124] and the other is the resolution of\nthe firmly established, and, when taken immediately in consciousness,\nuniversal determinations of the sensuous conception or of thought, and\nthe causing of confusion between these and what is concrete.\n_a._ If we proceed from the general account of Socrates\u2019 method\nto a nearer view, in the first place its effect is to inspire men\nwith distrust towards their presuppositions, after faith had become\nwavering and they were driven to seek that which is, in themselves.\nNow whether it was that he wished to bring the manner of the Sophists\ninto disrepute, or that he was desirous to awaken the desire for\nknowledge and independent thought in the youths whom he attracted to\nhimself, he certainly began by adopting the ordinary conceptions which\nthey considered to be true. But in order to bring others to express\nthese, he represents himself as in ignorance of them, and, with a\nseeming ingenuousness, puts questions to his audience as if they\nwere to instruct him, while he really wished to draw them out. This\nis the celebrated Socratic irony, which in his case is a particular\nmode of carrying on intercourse between one person and another, and\nis thus only a subjective form of dialectic, for real dialectic deals\nwith the reasons for things. What he wished to effect was, that when\nother people brought forward their principles, he, from each definite\nproposition, should deduce as its consequence the direct opposite of\nwhat the proposition stated, or else allow the opposite to be deduced\nfrom their own inner consciousness without maintaining it directly\nagainst their statements. Sometimes he also derived the opposite from\na concrete case. But as this opposite was a principle held by men as\nfirmly as the other, he then went on to show that they contradicted\nthemselves. Thus Socrates taught those with whom he associated to know\nthat they knew nothing; indeed, what is more, he himself said that\nhe knew nothing, and therefore taught nothing. It may actually be\nsaid that Socrates knew nothing, for he did not reach the systematic\nconstruction of a philosophy. He was conscious of this, and it was also\nnot at all his aim to establish a science.\nOn the one view, this irony seems to be something untrue. But when we\ndeal with objects which have a universal interest, and speak about\nthem to one and to another, it is always the case that one does not\nunderstand another\u2019s conception of the object. For every individual has\ncertain ultimate words as to which he presupposes a common knowledge.\nBut if we really are to come to an understanding, we find it is these\npresuppositions which have to be investigated. For instance, if in\nmore recent times belief and reason are discussed as the subjects of\npresent intellectual interest, everyone pretends that he knows quite\nwell what reason, &c., is, and it is considered ill-bred to ask for an\nexplanation of this, seeing that all are supposed to know about it. A\nvery celebrated divine, ten years ago,[125] published ninety theses\non reason, which contained very interesting questions, but resulted\nin nothing, although they were much discussed, because one person\u2019s\nassertions issued from the point of view of faith, and the other\u2019s\nfrom that of reason, and each remained in this state of opposition,\nwithout the one\u2019s knowing what the other meant. Thus what would make\nan understanding possible is just the explanation of what we think is\nunderstood, without really being so. If faith and knowledge certainly\ndiffer from one another at the first, yet through this declaration of\ntheir notional determinations the common element will at once appear;\nin that way questions like these and the trouble taken with them may,\nfor the first time, become fruitful; otherwise men may chatter this way\nand that for years, without making any advance. For if I say I know\nwhat reason, what belief is, these are only quite abstract ideas; it is\nnecessary, in order to become concrete, that they should be explained,\nand that it should be understood that what they really are, is unknown.\nThe irony of Socrates has this great quality of showing how to make\nabstract ideas concrete and effect their development, for on that alone\ndepends the bringing of the Notion into consciousness.\nIn recent times much has been said about the Socratic irony which,\nlike all dialectic, gives force to what is taken immediately, but only\nin order to allow the dissolution inherent in it to come to pass;\nand we may call this the universal irony of the world. Yet men have\ntried to make this irony of Socrates into something quite different,\nfor they extended it into a universal principle; it is said to be\nthe highest attitude of the mind, and has been represented as the\nmost divine. It was Friedrich von Schlegel who first brought forward\nthis idea, and Ast repeated it, saying, \u201cThe most ardent love of all\nbeauty in the Idea, as in life, inspires Socrates\u2019 words with inward,\nunfathomable life.\u201d This life is now said to be irony! But this irony\nissues from the Fichtian philosophy, and is an essential point in the\ncomprehension of the conceptions of most recent times. It is when\nsubjective consciousness maintains its independence of everything,\nthat it says, \u201cIt is I who through my educated thoughts can annul all\ndeterminations of right, morality, good, &c., because I am clearly\nmaster of them, and I know that if anything seems good to me I can\neasily subvert it, because things are only true to me in so far as they\nplease me now.\u201d This irony is thus only a trifling with everything, and\nit can transform all things into show: to this subjectivity nothing\nis any longer serious, for any seriousness which it has, immediately\nbecomes dissipated again in jokes, and all noble or divine truth\nvanishes away or becomes mere triviality. But the Greek gaiety, as it\nbreathes in Homer\u2019s poems, is ironical, for Eros mocks the power of\nZeus and of Mars; Vulcan, limping along, serves the gods with wine, and\nbrings upon himself the uncontrollable laughter of the immortal gods.\nJuno boxes Diana\u2019s ears. Thus, too, there is irony in the sacrifices\nof the ancients, who themselves consumed the best; in the pain that\nlaughs, in the keenest joy which is moved to tears, in the scornful\nlaughter of Mephistopheles, and in every transition from one extreme\nto another\u2014from what is best to what is worst. Sunday morning may be\npassed in deep humility, profoundest contrition and self-abasement,\nin striking the breast in penitence, and the evening in eating and\ndrinking to the full, going the round of pleasures, thus allowing self\nto re-assert its independence of any such subjection. Hypocrisy, which\nis of the same nature, is the truest irony. Socrates and Plato were\nfalsely stated to be the originators of this irony, of which it is\nsaid that it is the \u201cinmost and deepest life,\u201d although they possessed\nthe element of subjectivity; in our time it was not permitted to us\nto give effect to this irony. Ast\u2019s \u201cinmost, deepest life\u201d is just\nthe subjective and arbitrary will, the inward divinity which knows\nitself to be exalted above all. The divine is said to be the purely\nnegative attitude, the perception of the vanity of everything, in which\nmy vanity alone remains. Making the consciousness of the nullity of\neverything ultimate, might indeed indicate depth of life, but it only\nis the depth of emptiness, as may be seen from the ancient comedies\nof Aristophanes. From this irony of our times, the irony of Socrates\nis far removed; as is also the case with Plato, it has a significance\nwhich is limited. Socrates\u2019 premeditated irony may be called a manner\nof speech, a pleasant rallying; there is in it no satirical laughter or\npretence, as though the idea were nothing but a joke. But his tragic\nirony is his opposition of subjective reflection to morality as it\nexists, not a consciousness of the fact that he stands above it, but\nthe natural aim of leading men, through thought, to the true good and\nto the universal Idea.\n_b._ Now the second element is what Socrates has called the art of\nmidwifery\u2014an art which came to him from his mother.[126] It is the\nassisting into the world of the thought which is already contained in\nthe consciousness of the individual\u2014the showing from the concrete,\nunreflected consciousness, the universality of the concrete, or\nfrom the universally posited, the opposite which already is within\nit. Socrates hence adopts a questioning attitude, and this kind of\nquestioning and answering has thus been called the Socratic method;\nbut in this method there is more than can be given in questions and\nreplies. For the answer seems occasionally to be quite different from\nwhat was intended by the question, while in printed dialogue, answers\nare altogether under the author\u2019s control; but to say that in actual\nlife people are found to answer as they are here made to do, is quite\nanother thing. To Socrates those who reply may be called pliable\nyouths, because they reply directly to the questions, which are so\nformed that they make the answer very easy, and exclude any originality\nin reply. To this plastic manner, which we see in the method of\nSocrates, as represented by Plato and Xenophon, it is objected that we\ndo not answer in the same relation in which the questioner asks; while,\nwith Socrates, the relation which the questioner adopts is respected\nin the reply. The other way, which is to bring forward another point\nof view, is undoubtedly the spirit of an animated conversation, but\nsuch emulation is excluded from this Socratic method, in which the\nprincipal matter is to keep to the point. The spirit of dogmatism,\nself-assertion, stopping short when we seem to get into difficulties,\nand escaping from them by a jest, or by setting them aside\u2014all these\nattitudes and methods are here excluded; they do not constitute good\nmanners, nor do they have a place in Socrates\u2019 dialogues. In these\ndialogues, it is hence not to be wondered at that those questioned\nanswered so precisely to the point, while in the best modern dialogues\nthere is always an arbitrary element.\nThis difference concerns only what is external and formal. But the\nprincipal point, and the reason why Socrates set to work with questions\nin bringing the good and right into consciousness in universal form,\nwas that he did not proceed from what is present in our consciousness\nin a simple form through setting forth the conception allied to it\nin pure necessity, which would be a deduction, a proof or, speaking\ngenerally, a consequence following from the conception. But this\nconcrete, as it is in natural consciousness without thinking of it,\nor universality immersed in matter, he analyzed, so that through\nthe separation of the concrete, he brought the universal contained\ntherein to consciousness as universal. We see this method also carried\non to a large extent in Plato\u2019s dialogues, where there is, in this\nregard, particular skill displayed. It is the same method which\nforms in every man his knowledge of the universal; an education in\nself-consciousness, which is the development of reason. The child, the\nuncultured man, lives in concrete individual ideas, but to the man who\ngrows and educates himself, because he thereby goes back into himself\nas thinking, reflection becomes reflection on the universal and the\npermanent establishment of the same; and a freedom\u2014formerly that of\nmoving in concrete ideas\u2014is now that of so doing in abstractions and\nin thoughts. We see such a development of universal from particular,\nwhere a number of examples are given, treated in a very tedious way.\nFor us who are trained in presenting to ourselves what is abstract,\nwho are taught from youth up in universal principles, the Socratic\nmethod of so-called deference, with its eloquence, has often something\ntiresome and tedious about it. The universal of the concrete case is\nalready present to us as universal, because our reflection is already\naccustomed to the universal, and we do not require, first of all, to\ntake the trouble of making a separation; and thus, if Socrates were now\nto bring what is abstract before consciousness, we should not require,\nin order to establish it as universal, that all these examples should\nbe adduced, so that through repetition the subjective certainty of\nabstraction might arise.\n_c._ The next result of this method of procedure may be that\nconsciousness is surprised that what it never looked for should be\nfound in consciousness. If we reflect, for example, on the universally\nknown idea of Becoming, we find that what becomes is not and yet it is;\nit is the identity of Being and non-being, and it may surprise us that\nin this simple conception so great a distinction should exist.\nThe result attained was partly the altogether formal and negative one\nof bringing home to those who conversed with Socrates, the conviction\nthat, however well acquainted with the subject they had thought\nthemselves, they now came to the conclusion, \u201cthat what we knew has\nrefuted itself.\u201d Socrates thus put questions in the intent that the\nspeaker should be drawn on to make admissions, implying a point of\nview opposed to that from which he started. That these contradictions\narise because they bring their ideas together, is the drift of the\ngreater part of Socrates\u2019 dialogues; their main tendency consequently\nwas to show the bewilderment and confusion which exist in knowledge.\nBy this means, he tries to awaken shame, and the perception that what\nwe consider as true is not the truth, from which the necessity for\nearnest effort after knowledge must result. Plato, amongst others,\ngives these examples in his Meno (p. 71-80, Steph.; p. 327-346, Bekk.).\nSocrates is made to say, \u201cBy the gods, tell me what is virtue.\u201d Meno\nproceeds to make various distinctions: \u201cMan\u2019s virtue is to be skilful\nin managing state affairs, and thereby to help friends and harm foes;\nwoman\u2019s to rule her household; other virtues are those of boys, of\nyoung men, of old men,\u201d &c. Socrates interrupts him by saying, that\nit is not that about which he inquires, but virtue in general, which\ncomprehends every thing in itself. Meno says \u201cIt is to govern and rule\nover others.\u201d Socrates brings forward the fact that the virtue of boys\nand slaves does not consist in governing. Meno says that he cannot tell\nwhat is common in all virtue. Socrates replies that it is the same as\nfigure, which is what is common in roundness, squareness, &c. There a\ndigression occurs. Meno says, \u201cVirtue is the power of securing the good\ndesired.\u201d Socrates interposes that it is superfluous to say the good,\nfor from the time that men know that something is an evil, they do not\ndesire it; and also the good must be acquired in a right way. Socrates\nthus confounds Meno, and he sees that these ideas are false. The latter\nsays, \u201cI used to hear of you, before I knew you, that you were yourself\nin doubt (_\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2_), and also brought others into doubt, and now you\ncast a spell on me too, so that I am at my wits\u2019 end (_\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2_). You\nseem, if I may venture to jest, to be like the torpedo fish, for it\nis said of it that it makes torpid (_\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u1fb7\u03bd_) those who come near it\nand touch it. You have done this to me, for I am become torpid in body\nand soul, and I do not know how to answer you, although I have talked\nthousands of times about virtue with many persons, and, as it seemed\nto me, talked very well. But now I do not know at all what to say.\nHence you do well not to travel amongst strangers, for you might be\nput to death as a magician.\u201d Socrates again wishes to \u201cinquire.\u201d Now\nMeno says, \u201cHow can you inquire about what you say you do not know?\nCan you have a desire for what you do not know? And if you find it out\nby chance, how can you know that it is what you looked for, since you\nacknowledge that, you do not know it?\u201d A number of dialogues end in the\nsame manner, both in Xenophon and Plato, leaving us quite unsatisfied\nas to the result. It is so in the Lysis, where Plato asks the question\nof what love and friendship secures to men; and similarly the Republic\ncommences by inquiring what justice is. Philosophy must, generally\nspeaking, begin with a puzzle in order to bring about reflection;\neverything must be doubted, all presuppositions given up, to reach the\ntruth as created through the Notion.\n2. _The Principle of the Good._ This, in short, is Socrates\u2019 method.\nThe affirmative, what Socrates develops in the consciousness,\nis nothing but the good in as far as it is brought forth from\nconsciousness through knowledge\u2014it is the eternal, in and for itself\nuniversal, what is called the Idea, the true, which just in so far\nas it is end, is the Good. In this regard Socrates is opposed to the\nSophists, for the proposition that man is the measure of all things, to\nthem still comprehends particular ends, while to Socrates the universal\nbrought forth through free thought is thereby expressed in objective\nfashion. Nevertheless, we must not blame the Sophists because, in the\naimlessness of their time, they did not discover the principle of the\nGood; for every discovery has its time, and that of the Good, which as\nend in itself is now always made the starting point, had not yet been\nmade by Socrates. It now seems as if we had not yet shown forth much\nof the Socratic philosophy, for we have merely kept to the principle;\nbut the main point with Socrates is that his knowledge for the first\ntime reached this abstraction. The Good is nevertheless no longer\nas abstract as the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras, but is the universal which\ndetermines itself in itself, realizes itself, and has to be realized\nas the end of the world and of the individual. It is a principle,\nconcrete within itself, which, however, is not yet manifested in its\ndevelopment, and in this abstract attitude we find what is wanting in\nthe Socratic standpoint, of which nothing that is affirmative can,\nbeyond this, be adduced.\n_a._ As regards the Socratic principle, the first determination is\nthe great determination which is, however, still merely formal,\nthat consciousness creates and has to create out of itself what is\nthe true. This principle of subjective freedom was present to the\nconsciousness of Socrates himself so vividly that he despised the\nother sciences as being empty learning and useless to mankind; he has\nto concern himself with his moral nature only in order to do what is\nbest\u2014a one-sidedness which is very characteristic of Socrates. This\nreligion of the Good is to Socrates, not only the essential point to\nwhich men have to direct their thoughts, but it is that exclusively.\nWe see him showing how from every individual this universal, this\nabsolute in consciousness may be found as his reality. Here we see\nlaw, the true and good, what was formerly present as an existent,\nreturn into consciousness. But it is not a single chance manifestation\nin this individual Socrates, for we have to comprehend Socrates and\nhis manifestation. In the universal consciousness, in the spirit of\nthe people to which he belongs, we see natural turn into reflective\nmorality, and he stands above as the consciousness of this change.\nThe spirit of the world here begins to change, a change which was\nlater on carried to its completion. From this higher standpoint,\nSocrates, as well as the Athenian people and Socrates in them, have\nto be considered. The reflection of consciousness into itself begins\nhere, the knowledge of the consciousness of self as such, that it is\nreal existence\u2014or that God is a Spirit, or again, in a cruder and\nmore sensuous form, that God takes human form. This epoch begins\nwhere essence is given up as Being\u2014even though it be, as hitherto,\nabstract Being, Being as thought. But this epoch in a naturally moral\npeople in the highest state of development, makes its appearance as\nthe destruction threatening them or breaking in upon them unprevented.\nFor its morality, as was usually so with the ancients, consisted in\nthe fact that the Good was present as a universal, without its having\nhad the form of the conviction of the individual in his individual\nconsciousness, but simply that of the immediate absolute. It is the\nauthoritative, present law, without testing investigation, but yet\nan ultimate ground on which this moral consciousness rests. It is\nthe law of the State; it has authority as the law of the gods, and\nthus it is universal destiny which has the form of an existent, and\nis recognized as such by all. But moral consciousness asks if this\nis actually law in itself? This consciousness turned back within\nitself from everything that has the form of the existent, requires to\nunderstand, to know, that the above law is posited in truth, _i.e._\nit demands that it should find itself therein as consciousness. In\nthus returning into themselves the Athenian people are revealed to us:\nuncertainty as to existent laws as existent has arisen, and a doubt\nabout what was held to be right, the greatest freedom respecting all\nthat is and was respected. This return into itself represents the\nhighest point reached by the mind of Greece, in so far as it becomes\nno longer the mere existence of these moralities, but the living\nconsciousness of the same, which has a content which is similar, but\nwhich, as spirit, moves freely in it. This is a culture which we never\nfind the Laced\u00e6monians reach. This deepest life of morality is so to\nspeak a free personal consciousness of morality or of God, and a happy\nenjoyment of them. Consciousness and Being have here exactly the same\nvalue and rank; what is, is consciousness; neither is powerful above\nanother. The authority of law is no oppressive bond to consciousness,\nand all reality is likewise no obstacle to it, for it is secure in\nitself. But this return is just on the point of abandoning the content,\nand indeed of positing itself as abstract consciousness, without\nthe content, and, as existent, opposed to it. From this equilibrium\nof consciousness and Being, consciousness takes up its position as\nindependent. This aspect of separation is an independent conception,\nbecause consciousness, in the perception of its independence, no\nlonger immediately acknowledges what is put before it, but requires\nthat this should first justify itself to it, _i.e._ it must comprehend\nitself therein. Thus this return is the isolation of the individual\nfrom the universal, care for self at the cost of the State; to us,\nfor instance, it is the question as to whether I shall be in eternal\nbliss or condemnation, whereas philosophic eternity is present now\nin time, and is nothing other than the substantial man himself. The\nState has lost its power, which consisted in the unbroken continuity\nof the universal spirit, as formed of single individuals, so that the\nindividual consciousness knew no other content and reality than law.\nMorals have become shaken, because we have the idea present that man\ncreates his maxims for himself. The fact that the individual comes to\ncare for his own morality, means that he becomes reflectively moral;\nwhen public morality disappears, reflective morality is seen to have\narisen. We now see Socrates bringing forward the opinion, that in\nthese times every one has to look after his own morality, and thus\nhe looked after his through consciousness and reflection regarding\nhimself; for he sought the universal spirit which had disappeared from\nreality, in his own consciousness. He also helped others to care for\ntheir morality, for he awakened in them this consciousness of having\nin their thoughts the good and true, _i.e._ having the potentiality\nof action and of knowledge. This is no longer there immediately, but\nmust be provided, just as a ship must make provision of water when it\ngoes to places where none is to be found. The immediate has no further\nauthority but must justify itself to thought. Thus we comprehend the\nspecial qualities of Socrates, and his method in Philosophy, from the\nwhole; and we also understand his fate from the same.\nThis direction of consciousness back into itself takes the form\u2014very\nmarkedly in Plato\u2014of asserting that man can learn nothing, virtue\nincluded, and that not because the latter has no relation to science.\nFor the good does not come from without, Socrates shows; it cannot\nbe taught, but is implied in the nature of mind. That is to say, man\ncannot passively receive anything that is given from without like the\nwax that is moulded to a form, for everything is latent in the mind\nof man, and he only seems to learn it. Certainly everything begins\nfrom without, but this is only the beginning; the truth is that this\nis only an impulse towards the development of spirit. All that has\nvalue to men, the eternal, the self-existent, is contained in man\nhimself, and has to develop from himself. To learn here only means\nto receive knowledge of what is externally determined. This external\ncomes indeed through experience, but the universal therein belongs to\nthought, not to the subjective and bad, but to the objective and true.\nThe universal in the opposition of subjective and objective, is that\nwhich is as subjective as it is objective; the subjective is only a\nparticular, the objective is similarly only a particular as regards\nthe subjective, but the universal is the unity of both. According to\nthe Socratic principle, nothing has any value to men to which the\nspirit does not testify. Man in it is free, is at home with himself,\nand that is the subjectivity of spirit. As it is said in the Bible,\n\u201cFlesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone,\u201d that which is held by me as\ntruth and right is spirit of my spirit. But what spirit derives from\nitself must come from it as from the spirit which acts in a universal\nmanner, and not from its passions, likings, and arbitrary desires.\nThese, too, certainly come from something inward which is \u201cimplanted\nin us by nature,\u201d but which is only in a natural way our own, for it\nbelongs to the particular; high above it is true thought, the Notion,\nthe rational. Socrates opposed to the contingent and particular inward,\nthat universal, true inward of thought. And Socrates awakened this real\nconscience, for he not only said that man is the measure of all things,\nbut man as thinking is the measure of all things. With Plato we shall,\nlater on, find it formulated that what man seems to receive he only\nremembers.\nAs to the question of what is the Good, Socrates recognized its\ndetermination as being not only a determination in particularity to\nthe exclusion of the natural side, as determination is understood in\nempirical science, but even in relation to the actions of men, he holds\nthe Good to be still undetermined, and the ultimate determinateness, or\nthe determining, is what we may call subjectivity generally. That the\nGood should be determined, primarily signifies that while, at first, in\nopposition to the Being of reality, it was a general maxim only, that\nto which the activity of individuality was still wanting, in the second\nplace it was not permitted to be inert, to be mere thought, but had to\nbe present as the determining and actual, and thus as the effectual. It\nis such only through subjectivity, through the activity of man. That\nthe Good is a determinate thus further means that individuals know what\nthe Good is, and we call this standpoint reflective morality, while\nnatural morality does right unconsciously. Thus to Socrates virtue is\nperception. For to the proposition of the Platonic Protagoras that\nall other virtues have a relationship to one another, but that it is\nnot so with valour, since many brave men are to be found who are the\nmost irreligious, unjust, intemperate and uncultured of people (such\nas a band of robbers), Plato makes Socrates answer that valour, like\nall virtues, also is a science, that is, it is the knowledge and the\nright estimation of what is to be feared.[127] By this the distinctive\nqualities of valour are certainly not unfolded. The naturally moral and\nupright man is such without his having considered the matter at all; it\nis his character, and what is good is securely rooted within him. When,\non the other hand, consciousness is concerned, the question arises as\nto whether I directly desire the good or not. Hence this consciousness\nof morality easily becomes dangerous, and causes the individual to\nbe puffed up by a good opinion of himself, which proceeds from the\nconsciousness of his own power to decide for the good. The \u2018I\u2019 is then\nthe master, he who chooses the Good, and in that there is the conceit\nof my knowing that I am an excellent man. With Socrates this opposition\nof the good and the subject as choosing is not reached, for what is\ndealt with is only the determination of the Good and the connection\ntherewith of subjectivity; this last, as an individual person who can\nchoose, decides upon the inward universal. We have here on the one side\nthe knowledge of the Good, but, on the other, it is implied that the\nsubject is good, since this is his ordinary character; and the fact\nthat the subject is such, was by the ancients called virtue.\nWe understand from this the following criticism which Aristotle makes\n(Magna Mor. I. 1) on the quality of virtue as expounded by Socrates.\nHe says: \u201cSocrates spoke better of virtue than did Pythagoras, but\nnot quite justly, for he made virtues into a science (_\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2_).\nBut this is impossible, since, though all knowledge has some basis\n(_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_) this basis only exists in thought. Consequently, he\nplaces all the virtues in the thinking (_\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff7_) side of the\nsoul. Hence it comes to pass that he does away with the feeling\n(_\u1f04\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd_) part of the soul, that is, the inclination (_\u03c0\u1fb6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2_) and\nthe habits (_\u1f20\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2_),\u201d which, however, also pertain to virtue. \u201cBut\nPlato rightly distinguished the thinking and the feeling sides of\nthe soul.\u201d This is a good criticism. We see that what Aristotle\nmisses in the determination of virtue in Socrates, is the side of\nsubjective actuality, which we now call the heart. Certainly virtue is\ndetermination in accordance with universal, and not with particular\nends, but perception is not the only element in virtue. For in order\nthat the good perceived should be virtue, it must come to pass that the\nwhole man, the heart and mind, should be identical with it, and this\naspect of Being or of realization generally, is what Aristotle calls\n_\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd_. If we understand the reality of the good as universal\nmorality, substantiality is wanting to the perception; but matter,\nwhen we regard the inclination of the individual subjective will as\nthis reality. This double want may also be considered as a want of\ncontent and of activity, in so far as to the universal development is\nwanting; and in the latter case, determining activity comes before us\nas negative only in reference to the universal. Socrates thus omits,\nin characterizing virtue, just what we saw had also disappeared in\nactuality, that is, first the real spirit of a people, and then reality\nas the sympathies of the individual. For it is just when consciousness\nis not yet turned back into itself, that the universal good appears\nto the individual as the object of his sympathy. To us, on the other\nhand, because we are accustomed to put on one side the good or virtue\nas practical reason, the other side, which is opposed to a reflective\nmorality, is an equally abstract sensuousness, inclination, passion,\nand hence the bad. But in order that the universal should be reality,\nit must be worked out through consciousness as individual, and the\ncarrying into effect pertains to this individuality. A passion,\nas for example, love, ambition, is the universal itself, as it is\nself-realizing, not in perception, but in activity; and if we did not\nfear being misunderstood, we should say that for the individual the\nuniversal is his own interests. Yet this is not the place in which to\nunravel all the false ideas and contradictions present in our culture.\nAristotle (Eth. Nicom. VI. 13), supplementing the one-sidedness of\nSocrates, further says of him: \u201cSocrates in one respect worked on right\nlines, but not in the other. For to call virtue scientific knowledge is\nuntrue, but to say that it is not without scientific basis is right.\nSocrates made virtues into perceptions (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2_), but we say that\nvirtue exists with perception.\u201d This is a very true distinction; the\none side in virtue is that the universal of end belongs to thought. But\nin virtue, as character, the other side, active individuality, real\nsoul, must necessarily come forth; and indeed with Socrates the latter\nappears in a characteristic form of which we shall speak below (p. 421\net seq.).\n_b._ If we consider the universal first, it has within it a positive\nand a negative side, which we find both united in Xenophon\u2019s\n\u201cMemorabilia,\u201d a work which aims at justifying Socrates. And if we\ninquire whether he or Plato depicts Socrates to us most faithfully\nin his personality and doctrine, there is no question that in regard\nto the personality and method, the externals of his teaching, we\nmay certainly receive from Plato a satisfactory, and perhaps a more\ncomplete representation of what Socrates was. But in regard to the\ncontent of his teaching and the point reached by him in the development\nof thought, we have in the main to look to Xenophon.\nThe fact that the reality of morality had become shaken in the mind\nof the people, came to consciousness in Socrates; he stands so high\nbecause he gave expression to what was present in the times. In this\nconsciousness he elevated morality into perception, but this action is\njust the bringing to consciousness of the fact that it is the power of\nthe Notion which sublates the determinate existence and the immediate\nvalue of moral laws and the sacredness of their implicitude. When\nperception likewise positively acknowledges as law that which was\nheld to be law (for the positive subsists through having recourse to\nlaws), this acknowledgment of them always passes through the negative\nmode, and no longer has the form of absolute being-in-itself: it is,\nhowever, just as far from being a Platonic Republic. To the Notion\ntoo, because to it the determinateness of laws in the form in which\nthey have value to unperceiving consciousness has dissolved, only the\npurely implicit universal Good is the true. But since this is empty\nand without reality, we demand, if we are not satisfied with a dull\nmonotonous round, that again a movement should be made towards the\nextension of the determination of the universal. Now because Socrates\nremains at the indeterminateness of the good, its determination\nmeans for him simply the expression of the particular good. Then it\ncomes to pass that the universal results only from the negation of\nthe particular good; and since this last is just the existing laws\nof Greek morality, we have here the doubtlessly right, but dangerous\nelement in perception, the showing in all that is particular only its\ndeficiencies. The inconsistency of making what is limited into an\nabsolute, certainly becomes unconsciously corrected in the moral man;\nthis improvement rests partly on the morality of the subject and partly\non the whole of the social life; and unfortunate extremes resulting in\nconflict are unusual and unfrequent. But since the dialectic sublates\nthe particular, the abstract universal also becomes shaken.\n_\u03b1_. Now as regards the positive side, Xenophon tells us in the fourth\nbook of the Memorabilia (c. 2, \u00a7 40), how Socrates, once having\nmade the need for perception sensible to the youths, then actually\ninstructed them, and no longer wandered through mere subtleties in\nhis talk, but taught them the good in the clearest and most open way.\nThat is, he showed them the good and true in what is determined, going\nback into it because he did not wish to remain in mere abstraction.\nXenophon gives an example of this (Memorab. IV. c. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 12-16, 25)\nin a dialogue with the Sophist Hippias. Socrates there asserts that\nthe just man is he who obeys the law, and that these laws are divine.\nXenophon makes Hippias reply by asking how Socrates could declare it to\nbe an absolute duty to obey the laws, for the people and the governors\nthemselves often condemn them by changing them, which is allowing that\nthey are not absolute. But Socrates answers by demanding if those who\nconduct war do not again make peace, which is not, any more than in the\nother case, to condemn war, for each was just in its turn. Socrates\nthus says, in a word, that the best and happiest State is that in which\nthe citizens are of one mind and obedient to law. Now this is the one\nside in which Socrates looks away from the contradiction and makes\nlaws and justice, as they are accepted by each individually, to be\nthe affirmative content. But if we here ask what these laws are, they\nare, we find, just those which have a value at some one time, as they\nhappen to be present in the State and in the idea; at another time they\nabrogate themselves as determined, and are not held to be absolute.\n_\u03b2_. We hence see this other negative side in the same connection\nwhen Socrates brings Euthydemus into the conversation, for he asks\nhim whether he did not strive after the virtue without which neither\nthe private man nor the citizen could be useful to himself or to his\npeople or the State. Euthydemus declares that this undoubtedly is\nso. But without justice, replies Socrates, this is not possible, and\nhe further asks whether Euthydemus had thus attained to justice in\nhimself. Euthydemus answers affirmatively, for he says that he thinks\nhe is no less just than any other man. Socrates now replies, \u201cJust\nas workmen can show their work, the just will be able to say what\ntheir works are.\u201d This he also agrees to, and replies that he could\neasily do so. Socrates now proposes if this is so to write, \u201con the\none hand under _\u0394_ the actions of the just, and on the other, under\n_\u0391_, those of the unjust?\u201d With the approbation of Euthydemus, lies,\ndeceit, robbery, making a slave of a free man, thus fall on the side of\nthe unjust. Now Socrates asks, \u201cBut if a general subdues the enemy\u2019s\nState, would this not be justice?\u201d Euthydemus says \u201cYes.\u201d Socrates\nreplies, \u201cLikewise if he deceives and robs the enemy and makes slaves?\u201d\nEuthydemus has to admit the justice of this. It is thus shown \u201cthat\nthe same qualities come under the determination both of justice and of\ninjustice.\u201d Here it strikes Euthydemus to add the qualification that\nhe intended that Socrates should understand the action to be only in\nreference to friends; as regards them it is wrong. Socrates accepts\nthis, but proceeds, \u201cIf a general at the decisive moment of the battle\nsaw his own army in fear, and he deceived them by falsely saying that\nhelp was coming in order to lead them on to victory, could it be\ndeemed right?\u201d Euthydemus acknowledges that it could. Socrates says,\n\u201cIf a father gives a sick child a medicine which it does not wish to\ntake, in its food, and makes it well through deceit, is this right?\u201d\nEuthydemus\u2014\u201cYes.\u201d Socrates\u2014\u201cOr is anyone wrong who takes arms from\nhis friend secretly or by force, when he sees him in despair, and in\nthe act of taking his own life?\u201d Euthydemus has to admit that this is\nnot wrong.[128] Thus it is again shown here, that as regards friends\nalso, the same determinations have to hold good on both sides, as\njustice as well as injustice. Here we see that abstention from lying,\ndeceit, and robbery, that which we naturally hold to be established,\ncontradicts itself by being put into connection with something\ndifferent, and something which holds equally good. This example further\nexplains how through thought, which would lay hold of the universal in\nthe form of the universal only, the particular becomes uncertain.\n_\u03b3_. The positive, which Socrates sets in the place of what was\nfixed and has now become vacillating, in order to give a content to\nthe universal, is, on the one hand, and in opposition to this last,\nobedience to law (p. 416), that is, the mode of thought and idea which\nis inconsistent; and, on the other hand, since such determinations\ndo not hold good for the Notion, it is perception, in which the\nimmediately posited has now, in the mediating negation, to justify\nitself as a determination proceeding out of the constitution of the\nwhole. But it is both true that we do not find this perception present\nin Socrates, for it remains in its content undetermined, and that\nin reality it is a contingent, which is seen in the fact, that the\nuniversal commands, such as \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d are connected with\na particular content which is conditioned. Now whether the universal\nmaxim in this particular case has value or not, depends first on the\ncircumstances; and it is the perception which discovers the conditions\nand circumstances whereby exceptions to this law of unconditioned\nvalidity arise. However, because through this contingency in the\ninstances, the fixed nature of the universal principle disappears,\nsince it, too, appears as a particular only, the consciousness of\nSocrates arrives at pure freedom in each particular content. This\nfreedom, which does not leave the content as it is in its dissipated\ndetermination to the natural consciousness, but makes it to be\npenetrated by the universal, is the real mind which, as unity of the\nuniversal content and of freedom, is the veritable truth. Thus if we\nhere consider further what is the true in this consciousness, we pass\non to the mode in which the realization of the universal appeared to\nSocrates himself.\nEven the uneducated mind does not follow the content of its\nconsciousness as this content appears in it; but, as mind, it corrects\nthat which is wrong in its consciousness, and is thus implicitly,\nif not explicitly as consciousness, free. That is, though this\nconsciousness expresses the universal law, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d as a\nduty, that consciousness\u2014if no cowardly spirit dwells within it\u2014will\nstill bravely attack and slay the enemy in war. Here, if it is asked\nwhether there is a command to kill one\u2019s enemies, the reply would be\naffirmative, as likewise when a hangman puts to death a criminal. But\nwhen in private life we become involved with adversaries, this command\nto kill one\u2019s enemies will not occur to us. We may thus call this the\nmind which thinks at the right time, first of the one, and then of\nthe other; it is spirit, but an unspiritual consciousness. The first\nstep towards reaching a spiritual consciousness is the negative one\nof acquiring freedom for one\u2019s consciousness. For since perception\nattempts to prove individual laws, it proceeds from a determination to\nwhich, as a universal basis, particular duty is submitted; but this\nbasis is itself not absolute, and falls under the same dialectic.\nFor example, were moderation commanded as a duty on the ground that\nintemperance undermined the health, health is the ultimate which is\nhere considered as absolute; but it is at the same time not absolute,\nfor there are other duties which ordain that health, and even life\nitself, should be risked and sacrificed. The so-called conflict of\nduties is nothing but duty, which is expressed as absolute, showing\nitself as not absolute; in the constant contradiction morals become\nunsettled. For a consciousness which has become consistent, law,\nbecause it has then been brought into contact with its opposite, has\nbeen sublated. For the positive truth has not yet become known in\nits determination. But to know the universal in its determination,\n_i.e._ the limitation of the universal which comes to us as fixed\nand not contingent, is only possible in connection with the whole\nsystem of actuality. Thus if with Socrates the content has become\nspiritualized, yet manifold independent grounds have merely taken the\nplace of manifold laws. For the perception is not yet expressed as the\nreal perception of these grounds over which it rules; but the truth\nof consciousness simply is this very movement of pure perception.\nThe true ground is, however, spirit, and the spirit of the people\u2014a\nperception of the constitution of a people, and the connection of the\nindividual with this real universal spirit. Laws, morals, the actual\nsocial life, thus have in themselves their own corrective against the\ninconsistent, which consists of the expression of a definite content\nas absolute. In ordinary life we merely forget this limitation of\nuniversal principles, and these still hold their place with us; but\nthe other point of view is thus when the limitation comes before our\nconsciousness.\nWhen we have the perfect consciousness that in actual life fixed duties\nand actions do not exist, for each concrete case is really a conflict\nof many duties which separate themselves in the moral understanding,\nbut which mind treats as not absolute, comprehending them in the\nunity of its judgment, we call this pure, deciding individuality, the\nknowledge of what is right, or conscience, just as we call the pure\nuniversal of consciousness not a particular but an all-comprehensive\none, duty. Now both sides here present, the universal law and the\ndeciding spirit which is in its abstraction the active individual,\nare also necessary to the consciousness of Socrates as the content\nand the power over this content. That is, because with Socrates the\nparticular law has become vacillating, there now comes in the place\nof the universal single mind, which, with the Greeks, was unconscious\ndetermination through unreflective morality, individual mind as\nindividuality deciding for itself. Thus with Socrates the deciding\nspirit is transformed into the subjective consciousness of man, since\nthe power of deciding originates with himself; and the first question\nnow is, how this subjectivity appears in Socrates himself. Because\nthe person, the individual, now gives the decision, we come back to\nSocrates as person, as subject, and what follows is a development\nof his personal relations. But since the moral element is generally\nplaced in the personality of Socrates, we see the contingent nature\nof the instruction and of the culture which was obtained through\nSocrates\u2019 character; for it was the actual basis on which men fortified\nthemselves in associating with Socrates, by actual communication with\nhim and by their manner of life. Thus it was true that \u201cthe intercourse\nwith his friends was, on the whole, beneficial and instructive to them,\nbut in many cases they became unfaithful to Socrates,\u201d[129] because\nnot everyone attains to perception, and he who possesses it may remain\nat the negative. The education of the citizens, life in the people,\nis quite a fresh force in the individual, and does not mean that he\neducates himself through arguments; hence, however truly educative the\nintercourse with Socrates was, this contingency still entered into it.\nWe thus see as an unhappy symptom of disorder, how Socrates\u2019 greatest\nfavourites, and those endowed with the most genial natures (such as\nAlcibiades, that genius of levity, who played with the Athenian people,\nand Critias, the most active of the Thirty) afterwards experienced the\nfate of being judged in their own country, one as an enemy and traitor\nto his fellows, and the other as an oppressor and tyrant of the State.\nThey lived according to the principle of subjective perception, and\nthus cast a bad light on Socrates, for it is shown in this how the\nSocratic principle in another form brought about the ruin of Greek\nlife.[130]\n_c._ The characteristic form in which this subjectivity\u2014this implicit\nand deciding certainty\u2014appears in Socrates, has still to be mentioned.\nThat is, since everyone here has this personal mind which appears to\nhim to be his mind, we see how in connection with this, we have what\nis known under the name of the Genius (_\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_) of Socrates; for\nit implies that now man decides in accordance with his perception\nand by himself. But in this Genius of Socrates\u2014notorious as a much\ndiscussed _bizarrerie_ of his imagination\u2014we are neither to imagine\nthe existence of protective spirit, angel, and such-like, nor even of\nconscience. For conscience is the idea of universal individuality, of\nthe mind certain of itself, which is at the same time universal truth.\nBut the Genius of Socrates is rather all the other and necessary sides\nof his universality, that is, the individuality of mind which came to\nconsciousness in him equally with the former. His pure consciousness\nstands over both sides. The deficiency in the universal, which\nlies in its indeterminateness, is unsatisfactorily supplied in an\nindividual way, because Socrates\u2019 judgment, as coming from himself,\nwas characterized by the form of an unconscious impulse. The Genius\nof Socrates is not Socrates himself, not his opinions and conviction,\nbut an oracle which, however, is not external, but is subjective,\nhis oracle. It bore the form of a knowledge which was directly\nassociated with a condition of unconsciousness; it was a knowledge\nwhich may also appear under other conditions as a magnetic state. It\nmay happen that at death, in illness and catalepsy, men know about\ncircumstances future or present, which, in the understood relations\nof things, are altogether unknown. These are facts which are usually\nrudely denied. That in Socrates we should discover what comes to pass\nthrough reflection in the form of the unconscious, makes it appear to\nbe an exceptional matter, revealed to the individual only, and not as\nbeing what it is in truth. Thereby it certainly receives the stamp\nof imagination, but there is nothing more of what is visionary or\nsuperstitious to be seen in it, for it is a necessary manifestation,\nthough Socrates did not recognize the necessity, this element being\nonly generally before his imagination.\nIn connection with what follows, we must yet further consider the\nrelationship of the Genius to the earlier existent form of decision,\nand that into which it led Socrates; regarding both Xenophon expresses\nhimself in his history most distinctly. Because the standpoint of the\nGreek mind was natural morality, in which man did not yet determine\nhimself, and still less was what we call conscience present, since\nlaws were, in their fundamental principles, regarded as traditional,\nthese last now presented an appearance of being sanctioned by the gods.\nWe know that the Greeks undoubtedly had laws on which to form their\njudgments, but on the other hand, both in private and public life,\nimmediate decisions had to be made. But in them the Greeks, with all\ntheir freedom, did not decide from the subjective will. The general\nor the people did not take upon themselves to decide as to what was\nbest in the State, nor did the individual do so in the family. For in\nmaking these decisions, the Greeks took refuge in oracles, sacrificial\nanimals, soothsayers, or, like the Romans, asked counsel of birds\nin flight. The general who had to fight a battle was guided in his\ndecision by the entrails of animals, as we often find in Xenophon\u2019s\nAnabasis. Pausanias tormented himself thus a whole day long before\nhe gave the command to fight.[131] This element, the fact that the\npeople had not the power of decision but were determined from without,\nwas a real factor in Greek consciousness; and oracles were everywhere\nessential where man did not yet know himself inwardly as being\nsufficiently free and independent to take upon himself to decide as we\ndo. This subjective freedom, which was not yet present with the Greeks,\nis what we mean in the present day when we speak of freedom; in the\nPlatonic Republic we shall see more of it. Our responsibility for what\nwe do is a characteristic of modern times; we wish to decide according\nto grounds of common sense, and consider this as ultimate. The Greeks\ndid not possess the knowledge of this infinitude.\nIn the first book of Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia (chap. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9), on the\noccasion of the defence by Socrates of his _\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd_, Socrates says\nat the very beginning: \u201cThe gods have reserved to themselves what is\nmost important in knowledge. Architecture, agriculture, forging, are\nhuman arts, as also government, the science of law, management of the\nhousehold and generalship. In all this man can attain to skill, but\nfor the other, divination is necessary. He who cultivates a field does\nnot know who will enjoy the fruit, nor does he who builds a house know\nwho will inhabit it; the general does not know whether the army should\nbe brought into the field; he who rules a State whether it is good for\nhim\u201d (the individual) \u201cor bad. Nor does he who marries a wife know\nwhether he will experience happiness or whether grief and sorrow will\nnot come through this to him; neither can he who has powerful relations\nin the State, know whether, on account of these, he may not be banished\nfrom the State. Because of this uncertainty, men have to take refuge in\ndivination.\u201d Regarding it Xenophon expresses himself (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4) to\nthe effect that it manifests itself in different ways through oracles,\nsacrifices, flight of birds, &c., but to Socrates this oracle is his\nGenius. To hold the future, or what is foreseen by the somnambulist or\nat death to be a higher kind of insight, is a perversion which easily\narises even in our ideas; but looked at more closely, we find in this\nthe particular interests of individuals merely, and the knowledge of\nwhat is right and moral is something much higher. If anyone wishes\nto marry or to build a house, &c., the result is important to the\nindividual only. The truly divine and universal is the institution of\nagriculture, the state, marriage, &c.; compared to this it is a trivial\nmatter to know whether, when I go to sea, I shall perish or not. The\nGenius of Socrates moreover reveals itself in him through nothing\nother than the counsel given respecting these particular issues, such\nas when and whether his friends ought to travel. To anything true,\nexisting in and for itself in art and science, he made no reference,\nfor this pertains to the universal mind, and these d\u00e6monic revelations\nare thus much more unimportant than those of his thinking mind. There\nis certainly something universal in them, since a wise man can often\nforesee whether anything is advisable or not. But what is truly divine\npertains to all, and though talents and genius are also personal\ncharacteristics, they find their first truth in their works which are\nuniversal.\nNow because with Socrates judgment from within first begins to break\nfree from the external oracle, it was requisite that this return into\nitself should, in its first commencement, still appear in physiological\nguise (_supra_, pp. 390, 391). The Genius of Socrates stands midway\nbetween the externality of the oracle and the pure inwardness of the\nmind; it is inward, but it is also presented as a personal genius,\nseparate from human will, and not yet as the wisdom and free will of\nSocrates himself. The further investigation of this Genius consequently\npresents to us a form which passes into somnambulism, into this double\nof consciousness; and in Socrates there clearly appears to be something\nof the kind, or something which is magnetic, for, as we already\nmentioned (p. 390), he is said often to have fallen into trances and\ncatalepsy. In modern times we have seen this in the form of a rigid\neye, an inward knowledge, perception of this thing and that, of what\nis gone, of what is best to do, &c.; but magnetism carries science\nno further than this. The Genius of Socrates is thus to be taken as\nan actual state, and is remarkable because it is not morbid but was\nnecessarily called up through a special condition of his consciousness.\nFor the turning point in the whole world-famed change of views\nconstituting the principle of Socrates, is that in place of the oracle,\nthe testimony of the mind of the individual has been brought forward\nand that the subject has taken upon itself to decide.\n3. _The Fate of Socrates._ With this Genius of Socrates as one of the\nchief points of his indictment, we now enter upon the subject of his\nfate, which ends with his condemnation. We may find this fate out of\nharmony with his professed business of instructing his fellow-citizens\nin what is good, but taken in connection with what Socrates and his\npeople were, we shall recognize the necessity of it. The contemporaries\nof Socrates, who came forward as his accusers before the Athenian\npeople, laid hold on him as the man who made known that what was held\nas absolute was not absolute. Socrates, with this new principle, and as\none who was an Athenian citizen whose express business was this form\nof instruction, came, through this his personality, into relationship\nwith the whole Athenian people; and this relationship was not merely\nwith a certain number or with a commanding number, but it was a living\nrelationship with the spirit of the Athenian people. The spirit of this\npeople in itself, its constitution, its whole life, rested, however,\non a moral ground, on religion, and could not exist without this\nabsolutely secure basis. Thus because Socrates makes the truth rest on\nthe judgment of inward consciousness, he enters upon a struggle with\nthe Athenian people as to what is right and true. His accusation was\ntherefore just, and we have to consider this accusation as also the end\nof his career. The attacks which Socrates experienced are well known,\nand were from two sources; Aristophanes attacked him in the \u201cClouds,\u201d\nand then he was formally accused before the people.\nAristophanes regarded the Socratic philosophy from the negative side,\nmaintaining that through the cultivation of reflecting consciousness,\nthe idea of law had been shaken, and we cannot question the justice\nof this conception. Aristophanes\u2019 consciousness of the one-sidedness\nof Socrates may be regarded as a prelude to his death; the Athenian\npeople likewise certainly recognized his negative methods in condemning\nhim. It is known that Aristophanes brought upon the stage along with\nSocrates, not only such men as Aeschylus, and more specially Euripides,\nbut also the Athenians generally and their generals\u2014the personified\nAthenian people and the gods themselves\u2014a freedom which we would not\ndream of were it not historically authenticated. We have not here to\nconsider the real nature of the Comedy of Aristophanes, nor the wanton\nway in which he was said to have treated Socrates. As to the first, it\nshould not startle us, nor do we require to justify Aristophanes or to\nexcuse him. The Comedy of Aristophanes is in itself as real a part of\nthe Athenian people, and Aristophanes is as essential a figure, as were\nthe sublime Pericles, the happy Alcibiades, the divine Sophocles, and\nthe moral Socrates, for he belongs as much as any other to this circle\nof luminaries (Vol. I., p. 322). Thus much can alone be said, that it\ncertainly goes against our German seriousness to see how Aristophanes\nbrings on the boards men living in the State, by name, in order to make\na jest of them; and we feel this specially in regard to so upright a\nman as Socrates.\nBy chronological considerations, some have tried hard to refute the\nfact that Aristophanes\u2019 representations had no influence on the\ncondemnation of Socrates. It is seen that, on the one hand, Socrates\nwas treated quite unjustly; but then we must recognize the merit of\nAristophanes, who in his \u201cClouds\u201d was perfectly right. This poet, who\nexposed Socrates to scorn in the most laughable and bitter way, was\nthus no ordinary joker and shallow wag who mocked what is highest and\nbest, and sacrificed all to wit with a view to making the Athenians\nlaugh. For everything has to him a much deeper basis, and in all his\njokes there lies a depth of seriousness. He did not wish merely to\nmock; and moreover to mock what was worthy of honour would be perfectly\nbald and flat. It is a pitiful wit which has no substance, and does not\nrest on contradictions lying in the matter itself. But Aristophanes\nwas no bad jester. It is, generally speaking, not possible to joke\nin an external way about what does not contain matter for joking or\nirony in itself. For what really is comic is to show a man or a thing\nas they disclose themselves in their extent; and if the thing is\nnot itself its contradiction, the comic element is superficial and\ngroundless. Hence, when Aristophanes makes merry over the Democracy,\nthere is a deep political earnestness at heart, and from all his works\nit appears what a noble, excellent, true Athenian citizen he was.\nWe thus have a real patriot before us, who, though it involved the\npunishment of death, did not fear in one of his works to counsel peace.\nIn him, as one who had a patriotism of the most enlightened kind, we\nfind the blissful self-satisfied enjoyment of a people giving free\nrein to itself. There is, in what is humorous, a self-security which,\nthough with all seriousness it strives after some particular thing,\nwhile the opposite of what it aims at always comes to pass, never has\nfor that reason any doubts nor any reflection about itself, since it\nremains perfectly certain of itself and of what concerns it. We enjoy\nin Aristophanes this side of the free Athenian spirit, this perfect\nenjoyment of itself in loss, this untroubled certainty of itself in\nall miscarriage of the result in real life, and this is the height of\nhumour.\nIn the \u201cClouds\u201d we do not indeed see this natural humour, but a\ncontradiction with definite intention. Aristophanes indeed depicts\nSocrates humorously too, for he brings forth in his moral works the\nopposite of that from which he starts, and his scholars derive delight\nfrom the far-extending discoveries reached through him, which they\nthink are made by their own good luck, but which afterwards turn\nhateful to them, and become the very opposite of what they intended.\nThe wonderful perception which the followers of Socrates are here\nrepresented as having attained, is just a perception of the nullity of\nthe laws of the determinate good as it is to the natural consciousness.\nAristophanes made fun of the fact that Socrates occupied himself with\nelementary researches as to how far fleas spring, and of his putting\nwax on their feet in order to discover this. This is not historic,\nbut it is well known that Socrates had in his philosophy the side\nwhich Aristophanes showed up with such acrimony. Shortly, the fable of\nthe \u201cClouds\u201d is this: Strepsiades, an honourable Athenian citizen of\nthe old school, had great trouble with his new-fashioned extravagant\nson, who, spoiled by mother and uncle, kept horses and led a life\nout of keeping with his position. The father thus got into trouble\nwith his creditors, and went in distress to Socrates, and became\nhis disciple. There the old man learned that not this or that, but\nanother is the right, or rather he learned the stronger (_\u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd_)\nand weaker reasons (_\u1f15\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_). He learned the dialectic of laws,\nand how, by reasoning, the payment of debts can be disregarded, and\nhe then required that his son should go to the School of Socrates;\nand the latter likewise profited from his wisdom. But we find the\nresult ensuing from the universal which has now through the Socratic\ndialectic become empty, in the private interest or the wrong spirit\nof Strepsiades and his son, which spirit is merely the negative\nconsciousness of the content of laws. Equipped with this new wisdom of\nreasons, and the discovery of reasons, Strepsiades is armed against the\nchief evil that presses on him, as regards his threatening creditors.\nThese now come one after another to obtain payment. But Strepsiades\nknows how to put them off with excellent reasons, and to argue them\naway, for he pacifies them by all sorts of _titulos_, and shows them\nthat he does not need to pay them; indeed he even mocks them, and is\nvery glad that he learned all this from Socrates. But soon the scene\nchanges, and the whole affair alters. The son comes, behaves in a very\nunseemly way to his father, and finally beats him. The father cries\nto the supreme power, as if this were the last indignity, but the son\nshows him, with equally good reasons, obtained by the method derived\nby him from Socrates, that he had a perfect right to strike him.\nStrepsiades ends the comedy with execrations on the Socratic dialectic,\nwith a return to his old ways, and with the burning of Socrates\u2019\nhouse. The exaggeration which may be ascribed to Aristophanes, is that\nhe drove this dialectic to its bitter end, but it cannot be said that\ninjustice is done to Socrates by this representation. Indeed we must\nadmire the depth of Aristophanes in having recognized the dialectic\nside in Socrates as being a negative, and\u2014though after his own way\u2014in\nhaving presented it so forcibly. For the power of judging in Socrates\u2019\nmethod is always placed in the subject, in conscience, but where this\nis bad, the story of Strepsiades must repeat itself.\nWith regard to the formal public accusation of Socrates, we must not,\nlike Tennemann (Vol. II., p. 39 seq.), say of Socrates\u2019 treatment,\nthat \u201cit is revolting to humanity that this excellent man had to\ndrink the cup of poison as a sacrifice to cabals\u2014so numerous in\ndemocracies. A man like Socrates, who had made right\u201d (right is not\nbeing discussed, but we may ask what right? The right of moral freedom)\n\u201cthe sole standard of his action, and did not stray from the straight\npath, must necessarily make many enemies\u201d (Why? This is foolish; it\nis a moral hypocrisy to pretend to be better than others who are\nthen called enemies) \u201cwho are accustomed to act from quite different\nmotives. When we think of the corruption, and of the rule of the thirty\ntyrants, we must simply wonder that he could have worked on to his\nsixtieth year unmolested. But since the Thirty did not venture to lay\nhands on him themselves, it is the more to be wondered at that in the\nreconstituted and just rule and freedom which followed the overthrow\nof despotism\u201d\u2014in that very way the danger in which their principle\nwas, came to be known\u2014\u201ca man like Socrates could be made a sacrifice\nto cabals. This phenomenon is probably explained by the fact that the\nenemies of Socrates had first of all to gain time in order to obtain\na following, and that under the rule of the Thirty, they played too\ninsignificant a part,\u201d and so on.\nNow, as regards the trial of Socrates, we have to distinguish two\npoints, the one the matter of the accusation, the judgment of the\ncourt, and the other the relation of Socrates to the sovereign people.\nIn the course of justice there are thus these two parts\u2014the relation\nof the accused to the matter on account of which he is accused, and\nhis relation to the competency of the people, or the recognition of\ntheir majesty. Socrates was found guilty by the judges in respect of\nthe content of his accusation, but was condemned to death because\nhe refused to recognize the competency and majesty of the people as\nregards the accused.\na. The accusation consisted of two points: \u201cThat Socrates did not\nconsider as gods those who were held to be such by the Athenian\npeople, but introduced new ones; and that he also led young men\nastray.\u201d[132] The leading away of youth was his casting doubt on what\nwas held to be immediate truth. The first accusation has in part the\nsame foundation, for he made it evident that what was usually so\nconsidered, was not acceptable to the gods; and in part it is to be\ntaken in connection with his D\u00e6mon, not that he called this his god.\nBut with the Greeks this was the direction which the individuality of\njudgment took; they took it to be a contingency of the individual,\nand hence, as contingency of circumstances is an external, they also\nmade the contingency of judgment into something external, _i.e._ they\nconsulted their oracles\u2014conscious that the individual will is itself\na contingent. But Socrates, who placed the contingency of judgment\nin himself, since he had his D\u00e6mon in his own consciousness, thereby\nabolished the external universal D\u00e6mon from which the Greeks obtained\ntheir judgments. This accusation, as also Socrates\u2019 defence, we wish\nnow to examine further; Xenophon represents both to us, and Plato has\nalso supplied us with an Apology. Meanwhile we may not rest content\nwith saying that Socrates was an excellent man who suffered innocently,\n&c. (p. 430), for in this accusation it was the popular mind of Athens\nthat rose against the principle which became fatal to him.\n_\u03b1_. As regards the first point of the accusation, that Socrates did\nnot honour the national gods, but introduced new ones, Xenophon[133]\nmakes him answer that he always brought the same sacrifices as others\nto the public altars, as all his fellow-citizens could see\u2014his\naccusers likewise. But as to the charge that he introduced new D\u00e6mons,\nin that he heard the voice of God showing him what he should do, he\nappealed to them whether by soothsayers the cry and flight of birds,\nthe utterances of men (like the voice of Pythia), the position of\nthe entrails of sacrificial animals, and even thunder and lightning\nwere not accepted as divine revelations. That God knows the future\nbeforehand, and, if He wishes, reveals it in these ways, all believe\nwith him; but God can also reveal the future otherwise. He could show\nthat he did not lie in maintaining that he heard the voice of God,\nfrom the testimony of his friends, to whom he often announced what was\nsaid; and in its results this was always found to be true. Xenophon\n(Memorab. I. c. 1, \u00a7 11) adds, \u201cNo one ever saw or heard Socrates do\nor say anything godless or impious, for he never tried to find out the\nnature of the Universe, like most of the others, when they sought to\nunderstand how what the Sophists called the world began.\u201d That is, from\nthem came the earlier atheists, who, like Anaxagoras, held that the sun\nwas a stone.[134]\nThe effect which the defence against this part of the accusation made\non the judges is expressed thus by Xenophon:[135] \u201cOne section of\nthem was displeased because they did not believe what Socrates said,\nand the other part because they were envious that he was more highly\nhonoured of the gods than they.\u201d This effect is very natural. In our\ntimes this also happens in two ways. Either the individual is not\nbelieved when he boasts of special manifestations, and particularly\nof manifestations which have to do with individual action and life;\nit is neither believed that such manifestations took place at all, or\nthat they happened to this subject. Or if anyone does have dealings\nwith such divinations, rightly enough his proceedings are put an end\nto, and he is shut up. By this it is not denied in a general way\nthat God foreknows everything, or that He can make revelations to\nindividuals; this may be admitted _in abstracto_, but not in actuality,\nand it is believed in no individual cases. Men do not believe that to\nhim, to this individual, there has been a revelation. For why to him\nmore than to others? And why just this trifle, some quite personal\ncircumstances\u2014as to whether someone should have a successful journey,\nor whether he should converse with another person, or whether or not he\nshould in a speech properly defend himself? And why not others amongst\nthe infinitely many things which may occur to the individual? Why not\nmuch more important things, things concerning the welfare of whole\nStates? Hence it is not believed of an individual, in spite of the fact\nthat if it is possible, it must be to the individual that it happens.\nThis unbelief, which thus does not deny the general fact and general\npossibility, but believes it in no particular case, really does not\nbelieve in the actuality and truth of the thing. It does not believe\nit because the absolute consciousness\u2014and it must be such\u2014certainly\nknows nothing of a positive kind of trivialities such as form the\nsubject of these divinations and also those of Socrates; in spirit such\nthings immediately vanish away. The absolute consciousness does not\nknow about the future as such, any more than about the past; it knows\nonly about the present. But because in its present, in its thought,\nthe opposition of future and past to present becomes apparent, it\nlikewise knows about future and past, but of the past as something\nwhich has taken shape. For the past is the preservation of the present\nas reality, but the future is the opposite of this, the Becoming of\nthe present as possibility, and thus the formless. From out of this\nformlessness the universal first comes into form in the present; and\nhence in the future no form can be perceived. Men have the dim feeling\nthat when God acts it is not in a particular way, nor for particular\nobjects. Such things are held to be too paltry to be revealed by\nGod in a particular case. It is acknowledged that God determines\nthe individual, but by this the totality of individuality, or all\nindividualities, is understood; hence it is said that God\u2019s way of\nworking is found in universal nature.\nNow while with the Greeks judgment had the form of a contingency\nexternally posited through the flight and cries of birds, in our\nculture we decide by an inward contingency, because I myself desire to\nbe this contingency, and the knowledge of individuality is likewise\na consciousness of this contingency. But if the Greeks, for whom\nthe category of the contingency of consciousness was an existent, a\nknowledge of it as an oracle, had this individuality as a universal\nknowledge of which everyone could ask counsel, in Socrates\u2014in whom\nwhat was here externally established had become inward consciousness,\nas with us, though not yet fully, being still represented as an actual\nvoice, and conceived of as something which he separated from his\nindividuality\u2014the decision of the single individual had the form of\npersonality as a particular, and it was not a universal individuality.\nThis his judges could not in justice tolerate, whether they believed it\nor not. With the Greeks such revelations had to have a certain nature\nand method; there were, so to speak, official oracles (not subjective),\nsuch as Pythia, a tree, etc. Hence when this appeared in any particular\nperson like a common citizen, it was considered incredible and wrong;\nthe D\u00e6mon of Socrates was a medium of a different kind to any formerly\nrespected in the Greek Religion. It is so much the more noteworthy,\nthat nevertheless the oracle of the Delphian Apollo, Pythia, declared\nSocrates to be the wisest Greek.[136] Socrates it was who carried\nout the command of the God of knowledge, \u201cKnow Thyself,\u201d and made\nit the motto of the Greeks, calling it the law of the mind, and not\ninterpreting it as meaning a mere acquaintanceship with the particular\nnature of man. Thus Socrates is the hero who established in the place\nof the Delphic oracle, the principle that man must look within himself\nto know what is Truth. Now seeing that Pythia herself pronounced that\nutterance, we find in it a complete revolution in the Greek mind, and\nthe fact that in place of the oracle, the personal self-consciousness\nof every thinking man has come into play. This inward certainty,\nhowever, is undoubtedly another new god, and not the god of the\nAthenians existing hitherto, and thus the accusation of Socrates was\nquite just.\n_\u03b2_. If we now consider the second point of the accusation, that\nSocrates led youth astray, we find that he first sets against it the\nfact that the oracle of Delphi declared that none could be nobler,\njuster or wiser than he.[137] And then he sets against this accusation\nhis whole manner of life, and asks whether by the example that he\ngave, particularly to those with whom he went about, he ever led any\ninto evil.[138] The general accusation had to be further defined\nand witnesses came forward. \u201cMelitus said that he knew some whom he\nadvised to obey him rather than their parents,\u201d[139] This point of the\naccusation principally related to Anytus, and since he made it good by\nsufficient testimony, the point was undoubtedly proved, in accordance\nwith law. Socrates explained himself further on this point when he\nleft the court. For Xenophon tells us (Apol. Socr. \u00a7\u00a7 27, 29\u201431) that\nAnytus was inimical to Socrates, because he said to Anytus, a respected\ncitizen, that he should not bring up his son to the trade of a tanner,\nbut in manner befitting a free man. Anytus was himself a tanner, and\nalthough his business was mostly conducted by slaves, it was in itself\nnot ignominious, and Socrates\u2019 expression was hence wrong, although,\nas we have seen (p. 366), quite in the spirit of Greek thought.\nSocrates added that he had made acquaintance with this son of Anytus\nand discovered no evil in him, but he prophesied that he would not\nremain at this servile work to which his father kept him. Nevertheless,\nbecause he had no rational person near to look after him, he would come\nto have evil desires and be brought into dissolute ways. Xenophon added\nthat Socrates\u2019 prophecy had come to pass literally, and that the young\nman gave himself up to drink, and drank day and night, becoming totally\ndepraved. This can be easily understood, for a man who feels himself to\nbe fit for something better (whether truly so or not) and through this\ndiscord in his mind is discontented with the circumstances in which he\nlives, yet capable of attaining to no other, is led out of this disgust\ninto listlessness, and is thus on the way to the evil courses which\nso often ruin men. The prediction of Socrates is thus quite natural.\n(_Supra_, p. 424.)\nTo this definite accusation that he led sons into disobedience to\ntheir parents, Socrates replied by asking the question whether in\nselecting men for public offices, such as that of general, parents,\nor those experienced in war, were selected. Similarly in all cases\nthose most skilful in an art or science are picked out. He demanded\nwhether it was not matter of astonishment that he should be brought\nbefore a judge because he was preferred to parents by the sons in\ntheir aspirations after the highest human good which is to be made\na noble man.[140] This reply of Socrates is, on the one hand, quite\njust, but we see at the same time that we cannot call it exhaustive,\nfor the real point of the accusation is not touched. What his judges\nfound unjust was the intrusion morally of a third into the absolute\nrelation between parents and children. On the whole not much can be\nsaid on this point, for all depends on the mode of intervention, and\nif it is necessary in certain cases, it need not take place generally,\nand least of all when some private individual takes that liberty.\nChildren must have the feeling of unity with their parents; this is\nthe first immediately moral relationship; every teacher must respect\nit, keep it pure, and cultivate the sense of being thus connected.\nHence when a third person is called into this relation between parents\nand children, what happens through the new element introduced, is\nthat the children are for their own good prevented from confiding in\ntheir parents, and made to think that their parents are bad people\nwho harm them by their intercourse and training; and hence we find\nthis revolting. The worst thing which can happen to children in regard\nto their morality and their mind, is that the bond which must ever\nbe held in reverence should become loosened or even severed, thereby\ncausing hatred, disdain, and ill-will. Whoever does this, does injury\nto morality in its truest form. This unity, this confidence, is the\nmother\u2019s milk of morality on which man is nurtured; the early loss of\nparents is therefore a great misfortune. The son, like the daughter,\nmust indeed come out of his natural unity with the family and become\nindependent, but the separation must be one which is natural or\nunforced, and not defiant and disdainful. When a pain like this has\nfound a place in the heart, great strength of mind is required to\novercome it and to heal the wound. If we now speak of the example given\nus by Socrates, he seems, through his intervention, to have made the\nyoung man dissatisfied with his position. Anytus\u2019 son might, indeed,\nhave found his work generally speaking uncongenial, but it is another\nthing when such dislike is brought into consciousness and established\nby the authority of a man such as Socrates. We may very well conjecture\nthat if Socrates had to do with him, he strengthened and developed in\nhim the germ of the feeling of incongruity. Socrates remarked on the\nsubject of his capacities, saying that he was fit for something better,\nand thus established a feeling of dissatisfaction in the young man, and\nstrengthened his dislike to his father, which thus became the reason of\nhis ruin. Hence this accusation of having destroyed the relationship of\nparents and children may be regarded as not unfounded, but as perfectly\nwell established. It was also thought very bad in Socrates\u2019 case\nparticularly, and made a matter of reproach that he had such followers\nas Critias and Alcibiades, who brought Athens almost to the brink of\nruin (_supra_, p. 421). For when he mixed himself in the education\nwhich others gave their children, men were justified in the demand that\nthe result should not belie what he professed to do for the education\nof youth.\nThe only question now is, how the people came to take notice of\nthis, and in how far such matters can be objects of legislation and\nbe brought into court. In our law, as regards the first part of the\naccusation, divination such as Cagliostro\u2019s is illegal, and it would\nbe forbidden as it formerly was by the Inquisition. Respecting the\nsecond point, such a moral interference is no doubt more recognized\nwith us, where there is a particular office having this duty laid\nupon it; but this interference must keep itself general, and dare\nnot go so far as to call forth disobedience to parents, which is the\nfirst immoral principle. But should such questions come before the\ncourt? This first of all brings up the question of what is the right\nof the State, and here great laxity is now allowed. Nevertheless,\nwhen some professor or preacher attacks a particular religion, the\nlegislature would certainly take notice of it, and it would have a\ncomplete right to do so, although there would be an outcry when it\ndid it. There is undoubtedly a limit which in liberty of thought and\nspeech is difficult to define and rests on tacit agreement; but there\nis a point beyond which we find what is not allowed, such as direct\nincitement to insurrection. It is indeed said, that \u201cbad principles\ndestroy themselves by themselves and find no entrance.\u201d But that is\nonly true in part, for with the populace the eloquence of sophistry\nstirs up their passions. It is also said, \u201cThis is only theoretic,\nno action follows.\u201d But the State really rests on thought, and its\nexistence depends on the sentiments of men, for it is a spiritual and\nnot a physical kingdom. Hence it has in so far maxims and principles\nwhich constitute its support, and if these are attacked, the Government\nmust intervene. Added to this, it was the case that in Athens quite\na different state of things was present than with us; in order to be\nable to judge rightly of Socrates\u2019 case we must first consider the\nAthenian State and its customs. According to Athenian laws, _i.e._\naccording to the spirit of the absolute State, both these things done\nby Socrates were destructive of this spirit, while in our constitution\nthe universal of the states is a stronger universal, which last\nundoubtedly permits of individuals having freer play, since they cannot\nbe so dangerous to this universal. Hence it would undoubtedly in the\nfirst place mean the subversion of the Athenian State, if this public\nreligion on which everything was built and without which the State\ncould not subsist, went to pieces; with us the State may be called an\nabsolute and independent power. The D\u00e6mon is now, in fact, a deity\ndiffering from any known, and because it stood in contradiction to the\npublic religion, it gave to it a subjective arbitrariness. But since\nestablished religion was identified with public life so closely that it\nconstituted a part of public law, the introduction of a new god who\nformed self-consciousness into a principle and occasioned disobedience,\nwas necessarily a crime. We may dispute with the Athenians about this,\nbut we must allow that they are consistent. In the second place, the\nmoral connection between parents and children is stronger, and much\nmore the moral foundation of life with the Athenians than with us,\nwhere subjective freedom reigns; for family piety is the substantial\nkey-note of the Athenian State. Socrates thus attacked and destroyed\nAthenian life in two fundamental points; the Athenians felt and became\nconscious of it. Is it then to be wondered at that Socrates was found\nguilty? We might say that it had to be so. Tennemann (Vol. II., p.\n41) says: \u201cThough these charges contained the most palpable untruths,\nSocrates was condemned to death because his mind was too lofty for\nhim to descend to the common unworthy means, by which the judgment of\nthe court was usually perverted.\u201d But all this is false; he was found\nguilty of these deeds, but not for that reason condemned to death.\n_b._ We here come to the second occurrence in his history. In\naccordance with Athenian laws, the accused had, after the Heliasts\n(resembling the English jury) pronounced him guilty, the liberty of\nsuggesting (_\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9_) a penalty different from the punishment\nwhich the accuser proposed; this implied a mitigation of the punishment\nwithout a formal appeal\u2014an excellent provision in Athenian law,\ntestifying to its humanity. In this penalty the punishment in itself is\nnot brought into question, but only the kind of punishment; the judges\nhad decided that Socrates deserved punishment. But when it was left\nto the accused to determine what his punishment should be, it might\nnot be arbitrary, but must be in conformity with the crime, a money\nor bodily punishment (_\u1f44, \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c7\u03c1\u1f74 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u1fd6\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9_).[141] But it was\nimplied in the guilty persons constituting himself his own judge, that\nhe submitted himself to the decision of the court and acknowledged\nhimself to be guilty. Now Socrates declined to assign a punishment for\nhimself consisting either of fine or banishment, and he had the choice\nbetween these and death, which his accusers proposed. He declined\nto choose the former punishment because he, according to Xenophon\u2019s\naccount (Apol. Socr. \u00a7 23), in the formality of the exchange-penalty\n(_\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f50\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9_), as he said, would acknowledge guilt; but there was\nno longer any question as to the guilt, but only as to the kind of\npunishment.\nThis silence may indeed be considered as moral greatness, but, on the\nother hand, it contradicts in some measure what Socrates says later on\nin prison, that he did not wish to flee, but remained there, because\nit seemed better to the Athenians and better to him to submit to the\nlaws (Vol. I., p. 342). But the first submission would have meant that\nas the Athenians had found him guilty, he respected this decision, and\nacknowledged himself as guilty. Consistently he would thus have held\nit better to impose his punishment, since thereby he would not only\nhave submitted himself to the laws, but also to the judgment. We see in\nSophocles (Antig. verses 925, 926), the heavenly Antigone, that noblest\nof figures that ever appeared on earth, going to her death, her last\nwords merely stating\u2014\n\u201cIf this seems good unto the gods,\nSuffering, we may be made to know our error.\u201d\nPericles also submitted himself to the judgment of the people as\nsovereign; we saw him (Vol. I., p. 328) going round the citizens\nentreating for Aspasia and Anaxagoras. In the Roman Republic we\nlikewise find the noblest men begging of the citizens. There is nothing\ndishonouring to the individual in this, for he must bend before the\ngeneral power, and the real and noblest power is the people. This\nacknowledgment the people must have direct from those who raise\nthemselves amongst them. Here, on the contrary, Socrates disclaims the\nsubmission to, and humiliation before the power of the people, for he\ndid not wish to ask for the remission of his punishment. We admire in\nhim a moral independence which, conscious of its own right, insists\nupon it and does not bend either to act otherwise, or to recognize as\nwrong what it itself regards as right. Socrates hence exposed himself\nto death, which could not be regarded as the punishment for the fault\nof which he was found guilty; for the fact that he would not himself\ndetermine the punishment, and thus disdained the juridical power of\nthe people, was foremost in leading to his condemnation. In a general\nway he certainly recognized the sovereignty of the people, but not in\nthis individual case; it has, however, to be recognized, not only in\ngeneral, but in each separate case. With us the competency of the court\nis presupposed, and the criminal judged without further ado; to-day\nthe whole matter is also open to the light of day and accepted as an\nacknowledged fact. But with the Athenians we find the characteristic\nrequest that the prisoner should, through the act of imposing on\nhimself a penalty, sanction the judge\u2019s sentence of guilt. In England\nthis is certainly not the case, but there still remains a like form of\nasking the accused by what law he wishes to be judged. He then answers,\nby the law of the land and by the judges of his country. Here we have\nthe recognition of legal operations.\nSocrates thus set his conscience in opposition to the judges\u2019 sentence,\nand acquitted himself before its tribunal. But no people, and least\nof all a free people like the Athenians, has by this freedom to\nrecognize a tribunal of conscience which knows no consciousness of\nhaving fulfilled its duty excepting its own consciousness. To this\ngovernment and law, the universal spirit of the people, may reply: \u201cIf\nyou have the consciousness of having done your duty, we must also have\nthe consciousness that you have so done.\u201d For the first principle of\na State is that there is no reason or conscience or righteousness or\nanything else, higher than what the State recognizes as such. Quakers,\nAnabaptists, &c., who resist any demands made on them by the State,\nsuch as to defend the Fatherland, cannot be tolerated in a true State.\nThis miserable freedom of thinking and believing what men will, is not\npermitted, nor any such retreat behind personal consciousness of duty.\nIf this consciousness is no mere hypocrisy, in order that what the\nindividual does should be recognized as duty, it must be recognized as\nsuch by all. If the people can make mistakes the individual may do so\nmuch more easily, and he must be conscious that he can do this much\nmore easily than the people. Now law also has a conscience and has to\nspeak through it; the law-court is the privileged conscience. Now if\nthe miscarriage of justice in a trial is shown by every conscience\nclamouring for something different, the conscience of the court alone\npossesses any value as being the universal legalized conscience, which\ndoes not require to recognize the particular conscience of the accused.\nMen are too easily convinced of having fulfilled their duty, but the\njudge finds out whether duty is in fact fulfilled, even if men have the\nconsciousness of its being so.\nWe should expect nothing else of Socrates than that he should go to\nmeet his death in the most calm and manly fashion. Plato\u2019s account\nof the wonderful scene his last hours presented, although containing\nnothing very special, forms an elevating picture, and will be to us a\npermanent representation of a noble deed. The last dialogue of Plato\nis popular philosophy, for the immortality of the soul is here first\nbrought forward; yet it brings no consolation, for, as Homer makes\nAchilles say in the nether world, he would prefer to be a ploughboy on\nthe earth.\nBut though the people of Athens asserted through the execution of this\njudgment the rights of their law as against the attacks of Socrates,\nand had punished the injury caused to their moral life by Socrates,\nSocrates was still the hero who possessed for himself the absolute\nright of the mind, certain of itself and of the inwardly deciding\nconsciousness, and thus expressed the higher principle of mind with\nconsciousness. Now because, as has been said, this new principle by\neffecting an entrance into the Greek world, has come into collision\nwith the substantial spirit and the existing sentiments of the Athenian\npeople, a reaction had to take place, for the principle of the Greek\nworld could not yet bear the principle of subjective reflection. The\nAthenian people were thus, not only justified, but also bound to react\nagainst it according to their law, for they regarded this principle as\na crime. In general history we find that this is the position of the\nheroes through whom a new world commences, and whose principle stands\nin contradiction to what has gone before and disintegrates it: they\nappear to be violently destroying the laws. Hence individually they\nare vanquished, but it is only the individual, and not the principle,\nwhich is negated in punishment, and the spirit of the Athenian people\ndid not in the removal of the individual, recover its old position.\nThe false form of individuality is taken away, and that, indeed, in a\nviolent way, by punishment; but the principle itself will penetrate\nlater, if in another form, and elevate itself into a form of the\nworld-spirit. This universal mode in which the principle comes forth\nand permeates the present is the true one; what was wrong was the fact\nthat the principle came forth only as the peculiar possession of one\nindividual. His own world could not comprehend Socrates, but posterity\ncan, in as far as it stands above both. It may be conceived that the\nlife of Socrates had no need to have such an end, for Socrates might\nhave lived and died a private philosopher, and his teaching might have\nbeen quietly accepted by his disciples, and have spread further still\nwithout receiving any notice from State or people; the accusation thus\nwould seem to have been contingent. But it must be said that it was\nthrough the manner of that event that this principle became so highly\nhonoured. The principle is not merely something new and peculiar to\nitself, but it is an absolutely essential moment in the self-developing\nconsciousness of self which is designed to bring to pass as a totality,\na new and higher actuality. The Athenians perceived correctly that this\nprinciple not only meant opinion and doctrine, for its true attitude\nwas that of a direct and even hostile and destructive relation to\nthe actuality of the Greek mind; and they proceeded in accordance\nwith this perception. Hence, what follows in Socrates\u2019 life is not\ncontingent, but necessarily follows upon his principle. Or the honour\nof having recognized that relation, and indeed of having felt that they\nthemselves were tinged with this principle, is due to the Athenians.\n_c._ The Athenians likewise repented of their condemnation of Socrates,\nand punished some of his accusers with death itself, and others\nwith banishment; for according to Athenian laws, the man who made\nan accusation, and whose accusation was found to be false, usually\nunderwent the same punishment that otherwise the criminal would\nhave borne. This is the last act in this drama. On the one hand the\nAthenians recognized through their repentance the individual greatness\nof the man; but on the other (and this we find by looking closer)\nthey also recognized that this principle in Socrates, signifying\nthe introduction of new gods and disrespect to parents, has\u2014while\ndestructive and hostile to it\u2014been introduced even into their own\nspirit, and that they themselves are in the dilemma of having in\nSocrates only condemned their own principle. In that they regretted\nthe just judgment of Socrates, it seems to be implied that they wished\nthat it had not occurred. But from the regret it does not follow\nthat in itself it should not have occurred, but only that it should\nnot have happened for their consciousness. Both together constitute\nthe innocence which is guilty and atones for its guilt; it would\nonly be senseless and despicable if there were no guilt. An innocent\nperson who comes off badly is a simpleton; hence it is a very flat and\nuninteresting matter when tyrants and innocent persons are represented\nin tragedies, just because this is an empty contingency. A great man\nwould be guilty and overcome the great crisis that ensues; Christ thus\ngave up his individuality, but what was brought forth by him remained.\nThe fate of Socrates is hence really tragic, not in the superficial\nsense of the word and as every misfortune is called tragic. The death\nof an estimable individual must, in such a sense, be specially tragic,\nand thus it is said of Socrates, that because he was innocent and\ncondemned to death, his fate was tragic. But such innocent suffering\nwould only be sad and not tragic, for it would not be a rational\nmisfortune. Misfortune is only rational when it is brought about by the\nwill of the subject, who must be absolutely justified and moral in what\nhe does, like the power against which he wars\u2014which must therefore not\nbe a merely natural power, or the power of a tyrannic will. For it is\nonly in such a case that man himself has any part in his misfortune,\nwhile natural death is only an absolute right which nature exercises\nover men. Hence, in what is truly tragic there must be valid moral\npowers on both the sides which come into collision; this was so with\nSocrates. His is likewise not merely a personal, individually romantic\nlot; for we have in it the universally moral and tragic fate, the\ntragedy of Athens, the tragedy of Greece. Two opposed rights come into\ncollision, and the one destroys the other. Thus both suffer loss and\nyet both are mutually justified; it is not as though the one alone\nwere right and the other wrong. The one power is the divine right,\nthe natural morality whose laws are identical with the will which\ndwells therein as in its own essence, freely and nobly; we may call it\nabstractly objective freedom. The other principle, on the contrary,\nis the right, as really divine, of consciousness or of subjective\nfreedom; this is the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil, _i.e._ of self-creative reason; and it is the universal principle\nof Philosophy for all successive times. It is these two principles\nwhich we see coming into opposition in the life and the philosophy of\nSocrates.\nThe Athenian people had come into a period of culture, in which this\nindividual consciousness made itself independent of the universal\nspirit and became for itself. This was perceived by them in Socrates,\nbut at the same time it was felt that it meant ruin, and thus they\npunished an element which was their own. The principle of Socrates is\nhence not the transgression of one individual, for all were implicated;\nthe crime was one that the spirit of the people committed against\nitself. Through this perception the condemnation of Socrates was\nretracted; Socrates appeared to have committed no crime, for the spirit\nof the people has now generally reached the consciousness which turns\nback from the universal into itself. This meant the disintegration\nof this people, whose mind and spirit consequently soon disappeared\nfrom the world, but yet out of its ashes a higher took its rise,\nfor the world-spirit had raised itself into a higher consciousness.\nThe Athenian State, indeed, endured for long, but the bloom of its\ncharacter soon faded. It is characteristic of Socrates that he\ngrasped the principle of the inwardness of knowledge, not practically\nmerely, as did Critias and Alcibiades (_supra_, pp. 421, 438), but in\nthought, making it valid to thought, and this is the higher method.\nKnowledge brought about the Fall, but it also contains the principle\nof Redemption. Thus what to others was only ruin, to Socrates, because\nit was the principle of knowledge, was also a principle of healing.\nThe development of this principle, which constitutes the content\nof all successive history, is explicitly the reason that the later\nphilosophers withdrew from the affairs of the State, restricted\nthemselves to cultivating an inner world, separated from themselves\nthe universal aim of the moral culture of the people, and took up a\nposition contrary to the spirit of Athens and the Athenians. From this\nit came to pass that particularity of ends and interests now became\npowerful in Athens. This has, in common with the Socratic principle,\nthe fact that what seems right and duty, good and useful to the\nsubject in relation to himself as well as to the State, depends on his\ninward determination and choice, and not on the constitution and the\nuniversal. This principle of self-determination for the individual has,\nhowever, become the ruin of the Athenian people, because it was not yet\nidentified with the constitution of the people; and thus the higher\nprinciple must in every case appear to bring ruin with it where it is\nnot yet identified with the substantial of the people. The Athenian\nlife became weak, and the State outwardly powerless, because its\nspirit was divided within itself. Hence it was dependent on Laced\u00e6mon,\nand we finally see the external subordination of these States to the\nMacedonians.\nWe are done with Socrates. I have been more detailed here because all\nthe features of the case have been so completely in harmony, and he\nconstitutes a great historic turning point. Socrates died at sixty-nine\nyears of age, in Olympiad 95, 1 (399-400 B.C.), an Olympiad after the\nend of the Peloponnesian war, twenty-nine years after the death of\nPericles, and forty-four years before the birth of Alexander. He saw\nAthens in its greatness and the beginning of its fall; he experienced\nthe height of its bloom and the beginning of its misfortunes.\nC. THE SOCRATICS.\nThe result of the death of Socrates was, that the little company of\nhis friends went off from Athens to Megara, where Plato also came.\nEuclides had settled there and received them gladly.[142] When\nSocrates\u2019 condemnation was retracted and his accusers punished,\ncertain of the Socratics returned, and all was again brought into\nequilibrium. The work of Socrates was far-reaching and effectual in the\nkingdom of Thought, and the stimulation of a great amount of interest\nis always the principal service of a teacher. Subjectively, Socrates\nhad the formal effect of bringing about a discord in the individual;\nthe content was subsequently left to the free-will and liking of each\nperson, because the principle was subjective consciousness and not\nobjective thought. Socrates himself only came so far as to express\nfor consciousness generally the simple existence of one\u2019s own thought\nas the Good, but as to whether the particular conceptions of the Good\nreally properly defined that of which they were intended to express the\nessence, he did not inquire. But because Socrates made the Good the\nend of the living man, he made the whole world of idea, or objective\nexistence in general, rest by itself, without seeking to find a\npassage from the Good, the real essence of what is known as such, to\nthe thing, and recognizing real essence as the essence of things. For\nwhen all present speculative philosophy expresses the universal as\nessence, this, as it first appears, has the semblance of being a single\ndetermination, beside which there are a number of others. It is the\ncomplete movement of knowledge that first removes this semblance, and\nthe system of the universe then shows forth its essence as Notion, as a\nconnected whole.\nThe most varied schools and principles proceeded from this doctrine of\nSocrates, and this was made a reproach against him, but it was really\ndue to the indefiniteness and abstraction of his principle. And in\nthis way it is only particular forms of this principle which can at\nfirst be recognized in philosophic systems which we call Socratic.\nUnder the name of Socratic, I understand, however, those schools\nand methods which remained closer to Socrates and in which we find\nnothing but the one-sided understanding of Socratic culture. One part\nof these kept quite faithfully to the direct methods of Socrates,\nwithout going any further. A number of his friends are mentioned as\nbeing of this description, and these, inasmuch as they were authors,\ncontented themselves with correctly transcribing dialogues after his\nmanner, which were partly those he actually had held with them, and\npartly those they had heard from others; or else with working out\nsimilar dialogues in his method. But for the rest they abstained from\nspeculative research, and by directing their attention to what was\npractical, adhered firmly and faithfully to the fulfilment of the\nduties of their position and circumstances, thereby maintaining calm\nand satisfaction. Xenophon is the most celebrated of those mentioned,\nbut besides him a number of other Socratics wrote dialogues. \u00c6schines,\nsome of whose dialogues have come down to us, Ph\u00e6do, Antisthenes and\nothers are mentioned, and amongst them a shoemaker, Simon, \u201cwith whom\nSocrates often spoke at his workshop, and who afterwards carefully\nwrote out what Socrates said to him.\u201d The title of his dialogues, as\nalso those of the others which are left to us, are to be found in\nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius (II. 122, 123; 60, 61; 105; VI. 15-18); they have,\nhowever, only a literary interest, and hence I will pass them by.\nBut another section of the Socratics went further than Socrates,\ninasmuch as they, starting from him, laid hold of and matured one of\nthe particular aspects of his philosophy and of the standpoint to\nwhich philosophic knowledge was brought through him. This standpoint\nmaintained the absolute character of self-consciousness within itself,\nand the relation of its self-existent universality to the individual.\nIn Socrates, and from him onward, we thus see knowledge commencing, the\nworld raising itself into the region of conscious thought, and this\nbecoming the object. We no longer hear question and answer as to what\nNature is, but as to what Truth is; or real essence has determined\nitself not to be the implicit, but to be what it is in knowledge. We\nhence have the question of the relationship of self-conscious thought\nto real essence coming to the front as what concerns us most. The true\nand essence are not the same; the true is essence as thought, but\nessence is the simply implicit. This simple is, indeed, thought, and is\nin thought, but when it is said that essence is pure Being or Becoming,\nas the being-for-self of the atomists, and then that the Notion is\nthought generally (the _\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_ of Anaxagoras), or finally measure, this\nis asserted directly, and in an objective manner. Or it is the simple\nunity of the objective and of thought; it is not purely objective\u2014for\nBeing cannot be seen, heard, &c.; nor is it pure thought in opposition\nto the existent\u2014for this is the explicitly existent self-consciousness\nwhich separates itself from essence. It is finally not the unity\ngoing back into itself from the difference in the two sides, which is\nunderstanding and knowledge. In these self-consciousness on the one\nhand presents itself as being-for-self, and on the other, as Being;\nit is conscious of this difference, and from this difference turns\nback into the unity of both. This unity, the result, is the known, the\ntrue. One element in the true is the certainty of itself; this moment\nhas attained to reality\u2014in consciousness and for consciousness. It is\nthrough this movement and the investigation of the subject, that the\nsucceeding period of Philosophy is distinguished, because it does not\ncontemplate essence as left to itself, and as purely objective, but as\nin unity with the certainty of itself. It is not to be understood by\nthis that such knowledge had itself been made into essence, so that it\nis held to be the content and definition of absolute essence, or that\nessence had been determined for the consciousness of these philosophers\nas the unity of Being and Thought, _i.e._ as if they had thought of it\nthus; but they could merely no longer speak of essence and actuality\nwithout this element of self-certainty. And this period is hence, so to\nspeak, the middle period, which is really the movement of knowledge,\nand considers knowledge as the science of essence, which first brings\nabout that unity.\nFrom what has been said, it can now be seen what philosophic systems\ncan come before us. That is to say, because in this period the relation\nof Thought to Being, or of the universal to the individual, is made\nexplicit, we see, on the one hand, as the object of Philosophy, the\ncontradiction of consciousness coming to consciousness\u2014a contradiction\nas to which the ordinary modes of thought have no knowledge, for they\nare in a state of confusion, seeing that they go on unthinkingly. On\nthe other hand we have Philosophy as perceiving knowledge itself,\nwhich, however, does not get beyond its Notion, and which, because it\nis the unfolding of a more extensive knowledge of a content, cannot\ngive itself this content, but can only think it, _i.e._ determine it\nin a simple manner. Of those Socratics who hold a place of their own,\nthere are, according to this, three schools worthy of consideration;\nfirst the Megaric School, at whose head stands Euclid of Megara, and\nthen the Cyrenaic and Cynic Schools; and from the fact that they\nall three differ very much from one another, it is clearly shown\nthat Socrates himself was devoid of any positive system. With these\nSocratics the determination of the subject for which the absolute\nprinciple of the true and good likewise appears as end, came into\nprominence; this end demands reflection and general mental cultivation,\nand also requires that men should be able to tell what the good and\ntrue really are. But though these Socratic schools as a whole rest at\nsaying that the subject itself is end, and reaches its subjective end\nthrough the cultivation of its knowledge, the form of determination in\nthem is still the universal, and it is also so that it does not remain\nabstract, for the development of the determinations of the universal\ngives real knowledge. The Megarics were most abstract, because they\nheld to the determination of the good which, as simple, was to them\nthe principle; the unmoved and self-related simplicity of thought\nbecomes the principle of consciousness as individual, as it is of\nconscious knowledge. The Megaric school associated with the assertion\nof the simplicity of the good, the dialectic, that all that was defined\nand limited is not true. But because with the Megarics the principal\npoint was to know the universal, and this universal was to them the\nAbsolute which had to be retained in this form of the universal, this\nthought, as Notion which holds a negative position in relation to all\ndeterminateness and thus to that of Notion also, was equally turned\nagainst knowledge and perception.\nThe Cyrenaics take knowledge in its subjective signification, and\nas signifying individuality as certainty of self, or feeling; to\nthis as to that which is essential, they restrict the exercise\nof consciousness, and, generally speaking, make existence for\nconsciousness consist therein. Now because they thereby sought to\ndefine the Good more closely, they called it simply pleasure or\nenjoyment, by which, however, anything can be understood. This\nprinciple of the Cyrenaic school would seem to have been far removed\nfrom that of Socrates, since we at once think of the transient\nexistence of feeling as directly in opposition to the Good; this,\nhowever, is not the case. The Cyrenaics likewise upheld the universal,\nfor, if it is asked what the Good is, we find they certainly made\npleasurable feeling, which presents the appearance of a determinate,\nto be its content, but seeing that a cultured mind is also requisite,\nenjoyment, as it is obtained through thought, is here indicated.\nThe Cynics also further defined the principle of the Good, but in\nanother way from the Cyrenaics; its content, they said, lay in man\u2019s\nkeeping to what is in conformity with nature and to the simple needs of\nnature. They similarly call all that is particular and limited in the\naims of men that which is not to be desired. To the Cynics, too, mental\nculture through the knowledge of the universal is the principle;\nbut through this knowledge of the universal the individual end must\nbe attained, and this is, that the individual should keep himself in\nabstract universality, in freedom and independence, and be indifferent\nto all he formerly esteemed. Thus we see pure thought recognized in its\nmovement with the individual, and the manifold transformations of the\nuniversal coming to consciousness. These three schools are not to be\ntreated at length. The principle of the Cyrenaics became later on more\nscientifically worked out in Epicureanism, as that of the Cynics did in\nStoicism.\n1. THE MEGARICS.\nBecause Euclides (who is regarded as the founder of the Megaric way\nof thinking) and his school held to the forms of universality, and,\nabove all, sought, and with success, to show forth the contradictions\ncontained in all particular conceptions, they were reproached with\nhaving a rage for disputation, and hence the name of Eristics was\ngiven them. The instrument for bringing all that is particular into\nconfusion and annulling this particular, was supplied by dialectic,\nwhich, indeed, was brought by them to very great perfection, but, as\nwas privately stated, they did it in a kind of anger, so that others\nsaid that they should not be called a School (_\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae_) but a gall\n(\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae).[143] With a dialectic thus constituted, we find them taking\nthe place of the Eleatic School and of the Sophists; and it seems as\nthough the Eleatic School had merely been reproduced,[144] since they\nwere essentially identical with it. But this was only partly true\u2014in\nthat the Eleatic dialecticians maintained Being as the one existence\nin relation to which nothing particular is a truth, and the Megarics\nconsidered Being as the Good. The Sophists, on the other hand, did not\nseek their impulse in simple universality as fixed and as enduring; and\nsimilarly we shall find in the Sceptics, dialecticians who maintain\nthat the subjective mind rests within itself. Besides Euclides,\nDiodorus and Menedemus are mentioned as distinguished Eristics, but\nparticularly Eubulides, and later on Stilpo, whose dialectic likewise\nrelated to contradictions which appeared in external conception and in\nspeech, so that it in great measure passed into a mere play upon words.\n_a._ EUCLIDES.\nEuclides, who is not to be confused with the mathematician, is he\nof whom it is said that during the enmity between Athens and his\nbirthplace, Megara, and in the period of most violent animosity, he\noften secretly went to Athens, dressed as a woman, not fearing even\nthe punishment of death in order to be able to hear Socrates and\nbe in his company.[145] Euclides is said, in spite of his stubborn\nmanner of disputing, to have been, even in his disputation, a most\npeaceful man. It is told that once in a quarrel his opponent was so\nirritated, that he exclaimed, \u201cI will die if I do not revenge myself\nupon you!\u201d Euclides replied, \u201cAnd I will die if I do not soften your\nwrath so much by the mildness of my speech that you will love me as\nbefore.\u201d[146] It was Euclides who said that \u201cthe Good is one,\u201d and it\nalone is, \u201cthough passing under many names; sometimes it is called\nUnderstanding, sometimes God; at another time Thought (_\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2_), and so\non. But what is opposed to the good does not exist.\u201d[147] This doctrine\nCicero (_ibid._) calls noble, and says that it differs but little\nfrom the Platonic. Since the Megarics make the Good, as the simple\nidentity of the true, into a principle, it is clearly seen that they\nexpressed the Good as the absolute existence in a universal sense,\nas did Socrates; but they no longer, like him, recognized all the\napproximate conceptions, or merely opposed them as being indifferent\nto the interests of man, for they asserted definitely that they were\nnothing at all. Thus they come into the category of the Eleatics,\nsince they, like them, showed that only Being is, and that all else,\nas negative, does not exist. While the dialectic of Socrates was thus\nincidental, in that he merely shook some current moral ideas, or the\nvery first conceptions of knowledge, the Megarics, on the contrary,\nraised their philosophic dialectic into something more universal and\nreal, for they applied themselves more to what is formal in idea and\nspeech, though not yet, like the later Sceptics, to the determinations\nof pure Notions; for knowledge, thought, was not yet present in\nabstract conceptions. Of their own dialectic not much is told, but\nmore is said of the embarrassment into which they brought ordinary\nconsciousness, for they were in all kinds of ways alert in involving\nothers in contradictions. Thus they applied dialectic after the manner\nof an ordinary conversation, just as Socrates applied his mind to every\nside of ordinary subjects, and as we also, in our conversation, try to\nmake an assertion interesting and important. A number of anecdotes are\ntold of their disputations, from which we see that what we call joking\nwas their express business. Others of their puzzles certainly deal with\na positive category of thought; they take these and show how, if they\nare held to be true, they bring about a contradiction.\n_b._ EUBULIDES.\nOf the innumerable multitude of ways in which they tried to confuse our\nknowledge in the categories, many are preserved with their names, and\nthe principal of these are the Sophisms, whose discovery is ascribed\nto Eubulides of Miletus, a pupil of Euclides.[148] The first thing\nwhich strikes us when we hear them is that they are common sophisms\nwhich are not worth contradiction, and scarcely of being heard, least\nof all have they a real scientific value. Hence we call them stupid,\nand look at them as dreary jokes, but it is in fact easier to set them\naside than to refute them. We let ordinary speech pass, and are content\nwith it, so long as everyone knows what the other means (when this is\nnot so\u2014we trust that God understands us), but these sophisms seem in\na way to mislead common speech, for they show the contradictory and\nunsatisfactory nature of it when taken strictly as it is spoken. To\nconfuse ordinary language so that we do not know how to reply, seems\nfoolish, as leading to formal contradictions, and if it is done we are\nblamed for taking mere empty words and playing upon them. Our German\nseriousness, therefore, dismisses this play on words as shallow wit,\nbut the Greeks honoured the word in itself, and the mere treatment\nof a proposition as well as the matter. And if word and thing are in\nopposition, the word is the higher, for the unexpressed thing is really\nirrational, since the rational exists as speech alone.\nIt is in Aristotle, and in his Sophistical Elenchi that we first find\nnumerous examples of these contradictions (coming from the old Sophists\nequally with the Eristics), and also their solutions. Eubulides,\ntherefore, likewise wrote against Aristotle,[149] but none of this\nhas come down to us. In Plato we also find, as we saw before (p.\n370), similar jokes and ambiguities mentioned to make the Sophists\nridiculous, and to show with what insignificant matters they took up\ntheir time. The Eristics went yet further, for they, like Diodorus,\nbecame jesters to courts, such as to that of the Ptolemies.[150]\nFrom historic facts we see that this dialectic operation of confusing\nothers and showing how to extricate them again was a general amusement\nof the Greek philosophers, both in public places and at the tables\nof kings. Just as the Queen of the East came to Solomon to put\nriddles to him, we find at the tables of kings witty conversation and\nassemblages of philosophers joking and making merry over one another.\nThe Greeks were quite enamoured of discovering contradictions met\nwith in speech and in ordinary ideas. The contradiction does not\nmake its appearance as a pure contradiction in the conception, but\nonly as interwoven with concrete ideas; such propositions neither\napply to the concrete content nor to the pure Notion. Subject and\npredicate, of which every proposition consists, are different, but in\nthe ordinary idea we signify their unity; this simple unity, which\ndoes not contradict itself, is to ordinary ideas the truth. But in\nfact, the simple self-identical proposition is an unmeaning tautology;\nfor in any affirmation, differences are present, and because their\ndiversity comes to consciousness, there is contradiction. But the\nordinary consciousness is then at an end, for only where there is\na contradiction is there the solution, self-abrogation. Ordinary\nconsciousness has not the conception that only the unity of opposites\nis the truth\u2014that in every statement there is truth and falsehood, if\ntruth is to be taken in the sense of the simple, and falsehood in the\nsense of the opposed and contradictory; in it the positive, the first\nunity, and the negative, this last opposition, fall asunder.\nIn Eubulides\u2019 propositions the main point was that because the truth\nis simple, a simple answer is required; that thus the answer should\nnot, as happened in Aristotle (De Sophist. Elench. c. 24), have regard\nto certain special considerations; and, after all, this is really\nthe demand of the understanding. Thus the mistake is to desire an\nanswer of yes or no, for since no one ventures on either, perplexity\nensues, because it is a fool\u2019s part not to know what to reply. The\nsimplicity of the truth is thus grasped as the principle. With us\nthis appears in the form of making such statements as that one of\nopposites is true, the other false; that a statement is either true\nor not true; that an object cannot have two opposite predicates. That\nis the first principle of the understanding, the _principium exclusi\ntertii_, which is of great importance in all the sciences. This stands\nin close connection with the principle of Socrates and Plato (_supra_,\npp. 455, 456), \u201cThe true is the universal;\u201d which is abstractly the\nidentity of understanding, according to which what is said to be true\ncannot contradict itself. This comes more clearly to light in Stilpo\n(p. 464). The Megarics thus kept to this principle of our logic of\nthe understanding, in demanding the form of identity for the Truth.\nNow in the cases that they put, they did not keep to the universal,\nbut sought examples in ordinary conception, by means of which they\nperplexed people; and this they formed into a kind of system. We shall\nbring forward some examples that are preserved to us; some are more\nimportant, but others are insignificant.\n_\u03b1_. One Elench was called the Liar (_\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2_); in it the question\nis put: \u201cIf a man acknowledges that he lies, does he lie or speak\nthe truth?\u201d[151] A simple answer is demanded, for the simple whereby\nthe other is excluded, is held to be the true. If it is said that he\ntells the truth, this contradicts the content of his utterance, for he\nconfesses that he lies. But if it is asserted that he lies, it may be\nobjected that his confession is the truth. He thus both lies and does\nnot lie; but a simple answer cannot be given to the question raised.\nFor here we have a union of two opposites, lying and truth, and their\nimmediate contradiction; in different forms this has at all times come\nto pass, and has ever occupied the attention of men. Chrysippus, a\ncelebrated Stoic, wrote six books on the subject,[152] and another,\nPhiletas of Cos, died in the decline which he contracted through\nover-study of these paradoxes.[153] We have the same thing over again\nwhen, in modern times, we see men worn out by absorbing themselves in\nthe squaring of the circle\u2014a proposition which has well nigh become\nimmortal. They seek a simple relation from something incommensurable,\n_i.e._ they fall into the error of demanding a simple reply where\nthe content is contradictory. That little history has perpetuated\nand reproduced itself later on; in Don Quixote the very same thing\nappears. Sancho, governor of the island of Barataria, was tested by\nmany insidious cases as he sat in judgment, and, amongst others, with\nthe following: In his domain there was a bridge which a rich man had\nerected for the good of passengers\u2014but with a gallows close by. The\ncrossing of the bridge was restricted by the condition that everyone\nmust say truly where he was going, and if he lied, he would be hung\nupon the gallows. Now one man came to the bridge, and to the question\nwhither he went, answered that he had come here to be hung on the\ngallows. The bridge-keepers were much puzzled by this. For if they\nhanged him, he would have spoken the truth and ought to have passed,\nbut if he crossed he would have spoken an untruth. In this difficulty\nthey applied to the wisdom of the governor, who uttered the wise saying\nthat in such dubious cases the mildest measures should be adopted,\nand thus the man should be allowed to pass. Sancho did not break his\nhead over the matter. The result which the statement was to have, is\nmade its content, with the condition that the opposite of the content\nshould be the consequence. Hanging, understanding it to be truly\nexpressed, should not have hanging as result; non-hanging as an event,\nshould, on the other hand, have hanging as result. Thus death is made\nthe consequence of suicide, but by suicide death itself is made into\nthe content of the crime, and cannot thus be the punishment.\nI will give another similar example along with the answer. Menedemus\nwas asked whether he had ceased to beat his father. This was an attempt\nto place him in a difficulty, since to answer either yes or no, would\nbe equally risky. For if he said \u2018yes,\u2019 then he once beat him, and if\n\u2018no,\u2019 then he still beats him. Menedemus hence replied that he neither\nceased to beat him, nor had beaten him; and with this his opponents\nwere not satisfied.[154] Through this answer, which is two-sided, the\none alternative, as well as the other, being set aside, the question\nis in fact answered; and this is also so in the former question as to\nwhether the man spoke truly who said he lied, when the reply is made,\n\u201cHe speaks the truth and lies at the same time, and the truth is this\ncontradiction.\u201d But a contradiction is not the true, and cannot enter\ninto our ordinary conceptions; hence Sancho Panza likewise set it aside\nin his judgment. If the consciousness of opposition is present, our\nordinary ideas keep the contradictory sides apart; but in fact the\ncontradiction appears in sensuous things, such as space, time, &c.,\nand has in them only to be demonstrated. These sophisms thus not only\nappear to be contradictory, but are so in truth: this choice between\ntwo opposites, which is set before us in the example, is itself a\ncontradiction.\n_\u03b2_. The Concealed one (_\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd_) and the Electra[155] proceed\nfrom the contradiction of knowing and not knowing someone at the same\ntime. I ask someone \u2018Do you know your father?\u2019 He replies \u2018Yes.\u2019 I\nthen ask \u2018Now if I show you someone hidden behind a screen, will you\nknow him?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018But it is your father, and thus you do not know your\nfather.\u2019 It is the same in the Electra. \u2018Can it be said that she knows\nher brother Orestes who stands before her or not?\u2019 These twists and\nturns seem superficial, but it is interesting to consider them further.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) To know means, on the one hand, to have someone as \u2018this one,\u2019\nand not vaguely and in general. The son thus knows his father when he\nsees him, _i.e._ when he is a \u2018this\u2019 for him; but hidden, he is not a\n\u2018this\u2019 for him, but a \u2018this\u2019 abrogated. The hidden one as a \u2018this\u2019 in\nordinary conception, becomes a general, and loses his sensuous being,\nthereby is in fact not a true \u2018this.\u2019 The contradiction that the son\nboth knows and does not know his father, thus becomes dissolved through\nthe further qualification that the son knows the father as a sensuous\n\u2018this,\u2019 and not as a \u2018this\u2019 of idea. (_\u03b2\u03b2_) On the other hand Electra\nknows Orestes, not as a sensuous \u2018this,\u2019 but in her own idea; the\n\u2018this\u2019 of idea and the \u2018this\u2019 here, are not the same to her. In this\nway there enters into these histories the higher opposition of the\nuniversal and of the \u2018this,\u2019 in as far as to have in the ordinary idea,\nmeans in the element of the universal; the abrogated \u2018this\u2019 is not only\nan idea, but has its truth in the universal. The universal is thus\nfound in the unity of opposites, and thus it is in this development\nof Philosophy the true existence, in which the sensuous being of the\n\u2018this\u2019 is negated. It is the consciousness of this in particular which,\nas we shall soon see (p. 465), is indicated by Stilpo.\n_\u03b3_. Other quibbles of the same kind have more meaning, like the\narguments which are called the Sorites (_\u03c3\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2_) and the Bald\n(_\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2_).[156] Both are related to the false infinite, and the\nquantitative progression which can reach no qualitative opposite, and\nyet at the end finds itself at a qualitative absolute opposite. The\nBald head is the reverse of the problem of the Sorites. It is asked,\n\u201cDoes one grain of corn make a heap, or does one hair less make a bald\nhead?\u201d The reply is \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor one again?\u201d \u201cNo, it does not.\u201d This\nquestion is now always repeated while a grain is always added, or a\nhair taken away. When at last it is said that there is a heap or a bald\nhead, it is found that the last added grain or last abstracted hair has\nmade the heap or the baldness, and this was at first denied. But how\ncan a grain form a heap which already consists of so many grains? The\nassertion is that one grain does not make a heap; the contradiction,\nthat one thus added or taken away brings about the change into the\nopposite\u2014the many. For to repeat one is just to obtain many, the\nrepetition causes certain \u2018many\u2019 grains to come together. The one thus\nbecomes its opposite,\u2014a heap, and the taking of one away brings about\nbaldness. One and a heap are opposed to one another, but yet one; or\nthe quantitative progression seems not to change but merely to increase\nor diminish, yet at last it has passed into its opposite. We always\nseparate quality and quantity from one another, and only accept in\nthe many a quantitative difference; but this indifferent distinction\nof number or size here turns finally into qualitative distinction,\njust as an infinitely small or infinitely great greatness is no longer\ngreatness at all. This characteristic of veering round is of the\ngreatest importance, although it does not come directly before our\nconsciousness. To give one penny or one shilling is said to be nothing,\nbut with all its insignificance the purse becomes emptied, which is\na very qualitative difference. Or, if water is always more and more\nheated, it suddenly, at 80\u00b0 Reamur, turns into steam. The dialectic\nof this passing into one another of quantity and quality is what our\nunderstanding does not recognize; it is certain that qualitative is\nnot quantitative, and quantitative not qualitative. In those examples\nwhich seem like jokes, there is in this way genuine reflection on the\nthought-determinations which are in question.\nThe examples which Aristotle brings forward in his Elenchi, all show a\nvery formal contradiction, appearing in speech, since even in it the\nindividual is taken into the universal. \u201cWho is that? It is Coriscus.\nIs Coriscus not masculine? Yes. _That_ is neuter sex, and thus Coriscus\nis said to be neuter.\u201d[157] Or else Aristotle (De Sophist. Elench. c.\n24) quotes the argument: \u201cTo thee a dog is father (_\u03c3\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1_).\nThou art thus a dog;\u201d that is what Plato, as we already mentioned (p.\n370), made a Sophist say: it is the wit of a journeyman such as we\nfind in Eulenspiegel. Aristotle is really at great pains to remove the\nconfusion, for he says the \u2018thy\u2019 and the \u2018father\u2019 are only accidentally\n(_\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2_), and not in substance (_\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd_) joined\nto one another. In the invention of such witticisms, the Greeks of that\nand of later times were quite indefatigable. With the Sceptics we shall\nlater on see the dialectic side further developed and brought to a\nhigher standpoint.\n_c._ STILPO.\nStilpo, a native of Megara, is one of the most celebrated of the\nEristics. Diogenes tells us that \u201che was a very powerful debater, and\nexcelled all so greatly in readiness of speech that all Greece, in\nlooking to him, was in danger (\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03b5\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9) of becoming Megareans.\u201d\nHe lived in the time of Alexander the Great, and after his death (Ol.\n114, 1; 324 B.C.) in Megara, when Alexander\u2019s generals fought together.\nPtolemy Soter, Demetrius Poliorcetes, Antigonus\u2019 son, when they\nconquered Megara, bestowed many honours on him. \u201cIn Athens all came out\nof their work-places to see him, and when anyone said that they admired\nhim like a strange animal, he replied, No, but like a true man.\u201d[158]\nWith Stilpo it was pre-eminently true that the universal was taken\nin the sense of the formal abstract identity of the understanding.\nThe main point in his examples is, however, always the fact of his\nhaving given prominence to the form of universality as opposed to the\nparticular.\n_\u03b1_. Diogenes (II. 119) first quotes from him in relation to the\nopposition of the \u2018this\u2019 and the universal, \u201cWhoever speaks of any\nman (_\u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9_), speaks of no one, for he neither speaks of\nthis one nor that. For why should it rather be of this one than that?\nHence it is not of this one.\u201d That man is the universal, and that no\none is specially indicated, everyone readily acknowledges, but some\none still remains present to us in our conception. But Stilpo says\nthat the \u2018this\u2019 does not exist at all, and cannot be expressed\u2014that\nthe universal only exists. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius certainly understands\nthis as though \u201cStilpo abolished distinction of genera (_\u1f00\u03bd\u1fc4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7_),\u201d and Tennemann (Vol II., p. 158) supports him. But from\nwhat is quoted from him the opposite may clearly be deduced\u2014that he\nupheld the universal and did away with the individual. And the fact\nthat the form of universality is maintained, is further expressed in a\nnumber of anecdotes which are taken by Stilpo from common life. Thus\nhe says: \u201cThe cabbage is not what is here shown (_\u03c4\u1f78 \u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\n\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bd\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd_). For the cabbage has existed for many thousand years,\nand hence this (what is seen) is not cabbage,\u201d _i.e._ the universal\nonly is, and this cabbage is not. If I say _this_ cabbage, I say\nquite another thing from what I mean, for I say all other cabbages.\nAn anecdote is told in the same reference. \u201cHe was conversing with\nCrates, a Cynic, and broke off to buy some fish;\u201d Crates said, \u201cWhat,\nyou would avoid the question?\u201d (for even in ordinary life anyone is\nlaughed at or thought stupid who is unable to reply, and here where\nthe subject was so important and where it would seem better to reply\nanything than nothing at all, no answer was forthcoming). Stilpo\nreplied, \u201cBy no means, for I have the conversation, but I leave you,\nsince the conversation remains but the fish will be sold.\u201d What is\nindicated in these simple examples seems trivial, because the matter is\ntrivial, but in other forms it seems important enough to be the subject\nof further inquiry.\nThat the universal should in Philosophy be given a place of such\nimportance that only the universal can be expressed, and the \u2018this\u2019\nwhich is meant, cannot, indicates a state of consciousness and thought\nwhich the philosophic culture of our time has not yet reached. As\nregards the ordinary human understanding, or the scepticism of our\ntimes, or in general the Philosophy which asserts that sensuous\ncertainty (that which we see, hear, &c.), is the truth, or else that\nit is true that there are sensuous things outside of us\u2014as to these,\nnothing, so far as the reasons for disbelieving them are concerned,\nneed be said. For because the direct assertion that the immediate is\nthe true is made, such statements only require to be taken with respect\nto what they say, and they will always be found to say something\ndifferent from what they mean. What strikes us most is that they cannot\nsay what they mean; for if they say the sensuous, this is a universal;\nit is all that is sensuous, a negative of the \u2018this,\u2019 or \u2018this\u2019 is all\n\u2018these.\u2019 Thought contains only the universal, the \u2018this\u2019 is only in\nthought; if I say \u2018this\u2019 it is the most universal of all. For example,\nhere is that which I show; now I speak; but here and now is all here\nand now. Similarly when I say \u2018I,\u2019 I mean myself, this individual\nseparated from all others. But I am even thus that which is thought of\nand cannot express the self which I mean at all. \u2018I\u2019 is an absolute\nexpression which excludes every other \u2018I,\u2019 but everyone says \u2018I\u2019 of\nhimself, for everyone is an \u2018I.\u2019 If we ask who is there, the answer \u2018I\u2019\nindicates every \u2018I.\u2019 The individual also is thus the universal only,\nfor in the word as an existence born of the mind, the individual, if\nit is meant, cannot find a place, since actually only the universal is\nexpressed. If I would distinguish myself and establish my individuality\nby my age, my place of birth, through what I have done and where I have\nbeen or am at a particular time, it is the same thing. I am now so many\nyears old, but this very now which I say is all now. If I count from a\nparticular period such as the birth of Christ, this epoch is again only\nfixed by the \u2018now\u2019 which is ever displaced. I am now thirty-five years\nold, and now is 1805 A.D.; each period is fixed only through the other,\nbut the whole is undetermined. That \u2018now\u2019 1805 years have passed since\nChrist\u2019s birth, is a truth which soon will become empty sound, and the\ndeterminateness of the \u2018now\u2019 has a before and after of determinations\nwithout beginning or end. Similarly everyone is at a \u2018here\u2019\u2014this\nhere, for everyone is in a \u2018here.\u2019 This is the nature of universality,\nwhich makes itself evident in speech. We hence help ourselves through\nnames with which we define perfectly anything individual, but we allow\nthat we have not expressed the thing in itself. The name as name, is\nno expression which contains what I am; it is a symbol, and indeed a\ncontingent symbol, of the lively recollection.\n_\u03b2_. Inasmuch as Stilpo expressed the universal as the independent,\nhe disintegrated everything. Simplicius says (in Phys. Arist. p. 26),\n\u201cSince the so-called Megarics took it as ascertained that what has\ndifferent determinations is different (_\u1f67\u03bd \u03bf\u1f31\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\n\u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd_), and that the diverse are separated one from the other (_\u03c4\u1f70\n\u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd_), they seemed to prove that each thing is\nseparated from itself (_\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd_). Hence since\nthe musical Socrates is another determination (_\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2_) from the\nwise Socrates, Socrates was separated from himself.\u201d That means that\nbecause the qualities of things are determinations for themselves, each\nof these is fixed independently, but yet the thing is an aggregate of\nmany independent universalities. Stilpo asserted this. Now because,\naccording to him, universal determinations are in their separation\nonly the true reality, and the individual is the unseparated unity of\ndifferent ideas, to him nothing individual has any truth.\n_\u03b3_. It is very remarkable that this form of identity came to be\nknown in Stilpo, and he in this way only wished to know propositions\nidentically expressed. Plutarch quotes from him: \u201cA different\npredicate may in no case be attributed to any object (_\u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f11\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\n\u03bc\u1f74 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9_). Thus we could not say that the man is good or the\nman is a general, but simply that man is only man, good is only good,\nthe general is only the general. Nor could we say ten thousand knights,\nbut knights are only knights, ten thousand are only ten thousand,\n&c. When we speak of a horse running, he says that the predicate is\nnot identical with the object to which it is attributed. For the\nconcept-determination man is different (_\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03af \u1f26\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd_)\nfrom the concept-determination good. Similarly horse and running are\ndistinct: when we are asked for a definition of either, we do not give\nthe same for both. Hence those who say something different of what is\ndifferent are wrong. For if man and good were the same, and likewise\nhorse and running, how could good be used of bread and physic, and\nrunning of lions and dogs\u201d?[159] Plutarch remarks here that Colotes\nattacks Stilpo in a bombastic manner (_\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff7\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9_) as though\nhe ignored common life (_\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9_). \u201cBut what man,\u201d\nPlutarch reflects, \u201clived any the worse for this? Is there any man who\nhears this said, and who does not know that it is an elaborate joke\n(_\u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2_)?\u201d\n2. THE CYRENAIC SCHOOL.\nThe Cyrenaics took their name from Aristippus of Cyrene in Africa, the\noriginator and head of the school. Just as Socrates wished to develop\nhimself as an individual, his disciples, or those of the Cyrenaic\nand Cynic Schools, made individual life and practical philosophy\ntheir main object. Now if the Cyrenaics did not rest content with the\ndetermination of good in general, seeing that they inclined to place\nit in the enjoyment of the individual, the Cynics appear to be opposed\nto the whole doctrine, for they expressed the particular content of\nsatisfaction as natural desires in a determination of negativity\nwith regard to what is done by others. But as the Cyrenaics thereby\nsatisfied their particular subjectivity, so also did the Cynics, and\nboth schools have hence on the whole the same end\u2014the freedom and\nindependence of the individual. Because we are accustomed to consider\nhappiness, which the Cyrenaics made the highest end of man, to be\ncontentless, because we obtain it in a thousand ways, and it may be\nthe result of most various causes, this principle appears at first\nto us as trivial, and indeed, generally speaking, it is so; we are\nlikewise accustomed to believe that there is something higher than\npleasure. The philosophic development of this principle which, for the\nrest, has not much in it, is mainly ascribed to Aristippus\u2019 follower,\nAristippus the younger. But Theodorus, Hegesias, and Anniceris, of\nthe later Cyrenaics, are specially mentioned as having scientifically\nworked out the Aristippian principle, until it degenerated and merged\ninto Epicureanism. But the consideration of the further progress of the\nCyrenaic principle is specially interesting because this progression,\nin the essential nature of things, is carried quite beyond the\nprinciple, and has really abrogated it. Feeling is the indeterminate\nindividual. But if thought, reflection, mental culture, are given a\nplace in this principle, through the principle of the universality\nof thought that principle of contingency, individuality, mere\nsubjectivity, disappears; and the only really remarkable thing in this\nschool is that this greater consistency in the universal is therefore\nan inconsistency as regards the principle.\n_a._ ARISTIPPUS.\nAristippus went about with Socrates for a long time, and educated\nhimself under him, although at the same time he was a strong and\nhighly cultivated man before he sought out Socrates at all. He heard\nof him either in Cyrene or at the Olympian Games, which, as Greeks,\nthe Cyrenians likewise visited. His father was a merchant, and he\nhimself came to Athens on a journey which had commerce as its object.\nHe was first amongst the Socratics to ask money of those whom he\ninstructed; he also sent money to Socrates, who, however, returned\nit.[160] He did not content himself with the general expressions, good\nand beautiful, to which Socrates adhered, but took existence reflected\nin consciousness in its extreme determinateness as individuality; and\nbecause universal existence, as thought, was to him, from the side of\nreality, individual consciousness, he fixed on enjoyment as the only\nthing respecting which man had rationally to concern himself. The\ncharacter and personality of Aristippus is what is most important,\nand what is preserved to us in his regard is his manner and life\nrather than his philosophic doctrines. He sought after enjoyment as a\nman of culture, who in that very way had raised himself into perfect\nindifference to all that is particular, all passions and bonds of every\nkind. When pleasure is made the principle, we immediately have the idea\nbefore us that in its enjoyment we are dependent, and that enjoyment\nis thus opposed to the principle of freedom. But neither of the\nCyrenaic teaching, nor the Epicurean, whose principle is on the whole\nthe same, can this be stated. For by itself the end of enjoyment may\nwell be said to be a principle in opposition to Philosophy; but when it\nis considered in such a way that the cultivation of thought is made the\nonly condition under which enjoyment can be attained, perfect freedom\nof spirit is retained, since it is inseparable from culture. Aristippus\ncertainly esteemed culture at its highest, and proceeded from this\nposition\u2014that pleasure is only a principle for men of philosophic\nculture; his main principle thus was that what is found to be pleasant\nis not known immediately but only by reflection.\nAristippus lived in accordance with these principles, and what in him\ninterests us most is the number of anecdotes told about him, because\nthey contain traces of a mentally rich and free disposition. Since in\nhis life he went about to seek enjoyment, not without understanding\n(and thereby he was in his way a philosopher), he sought it partly with\nthe discretion which does not yield itself to a momentary happiness,\nbecause a greater evil springs therefrom; and partly (as if philosophy\nwere merely preservation from anxiety) without that anxiety which on\nevery side fears possible evil and bad results; but above all without\nany dependence on things, and without resting on anything which is\nitself of a changeable nature. He enjoyed, says Diogenes, the pleasures\nof the moment, without troubling himself with those which were not\npresent; he suited himself to every condition, being at home in all;\nhe remained the same whether he were in regal courts or in the most\nmiserable conditions. Plato is said to have told him that it was given\nto him alone to wear the purple and the rags. He was specially attached\nto Dionysius, being very popular with him; he certainly clung to him,\nbut always retained complete independence. Diogenes, the Cynic, for\nthis reason called him the royal dog. When he demanded fifty drachms\nfrom someone who wished to hand over to him his son, and the man found\nthe sum too high, saying that he could buy a slave for it, Aristippus\nanswered, \u201cDo so, and you will have two.\u201d When Socrates asked him, \u201cHow\ndo you have so much money?\u201d he replied, \u201cHow do you have so little?\u201d\nWhen a courtesan said to him that she had a child by him, he replied,\n\u201cYou know as little whether it is mine as, were you walking through\nbriars, would you know which thorn pricked you.\u201d A proof of his perfect\nindifference is given in the following: When Dionysius once spat at\nhim, he bore it patiently, and when blamed, said, \u201cThe fishermen let\nthemselves be wet by the sea to catch the little fish, and I, should I\nnot bear this to catch such a good one?\u201d When Dionysius asked him to\nchoose one of three courtesans, he took them all with him, observing\nthat it had been a dangerous thing even to Paris to choose out one;\nbut after leading them to the vestibule of the house, he let all three\ngo. He made nothing of the possession of money as contrasted with the\nresults which appear to follow from pursuing pleasure, and hence he\nwasted it on dainties. He once bought a partridge at fifty drachms\n(about twenty florins). When someone rebuked him, he asked, \u201cWould\nyou not buy it for a farthing?\u201d And when this was acknowleged, he\nanswered, \u201cNow fifty drachms are no more than that to me.\u201d Similarly\nin journeying in Africa, the slave thought it hard to be troubled with\na sum of money. When Aristippus knew this he said, \u201cThrow away what is\ntoo much and carry what you can.\u201d\nAs regards the value of culture, he replied to the question as to how\nan educated man differs from an uneducated, that a stone would not\nfit in with the other, _i.e._ the difference is as great as that of a\nman from the stone. This is not quite wrong, for man is what he ought\nto be as man, through culture; it is his second nature through which\nhe first enters into possession of that which he has by nature, and\nthus for the first time he is Mind. We may not, however, think in this\nway of our uncultured men, for with us such men through the whole of\ntheir conditions, through customs and religion, partake of a source\nof culture which places them far above those who do not live in such\nconditions. Those who carry on other sciences and neglect Philosophy,\nAristippus compares to the wooers of Penelope in the Odyssey, who might\neasily have Melantho and the other maidens, but who could not obtain\nthe queen.[161]\nThe teaching of Aristippus and his followers is very simple, for he\ntook the relation of consciousness to existence in its most superficial\nand its earliest form, and expressed existence as Being as it is\nimmediately for consciousness, _i.e._ as feeling simply. A distinction\nis now made between the true, the valid, what exists in and for itself,\nand the practical and good, and what ought to be our end; but in\nregard to both the theoretic and practical truth, the Cyrenaics make\nsensation what determines. Hence their principle is more accurately\nnot the objective itself, but the relation of consciousness to the\nobjective; the truth is not what is in sensation the content, but is\nitself sensation, it is not objective, but the objective subsists only\nin it. \u201cThus the Cyrenaics say, sensations form the real criterion;\nthey alone can be known, and are infallible, but what produces feeling\nis neither knowable nor infallible. Thus when we perceive a white and\nsweet, we may assert this condition as ours with truth and certainty.\nBut that the causes of these feelings are themselves a white and sweet\nobject we cannot with certainty affirm. What these men say about ends\nis also in harmony with this, for sensations also extend to ends. The\nsensations are either pleasant or unpleasant or neither of the two.\nNow they call the unpleasant feelings the bad, the end of which is\npain; the pleasant is the good, whose invariable end is happiness. Thus\nfeelings are the criteria of knowledge and the ends for action. We\nlive because we follow them from testimony (_\u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u1fb3_) received and\nsatisfaction (_\u03b5\u1f51\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9_) experienced, the former in accordance with\ntheoretic intuitions (_\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7_), and the latter with what\ngives us pleasure.\u201d[162] That is to say, as end, feeling is no longer\na promiscuous variety of sensuous affections (_\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7_), but the\nsetting up of the Notion as the positive or negative relation to the\nobject of action, which is just the pleasant or the unpleasant.\nHere we enter on a new sphere where two kinds of determinations\nconstitute the chief points of interest; these are everywhere treated\nof in the many Socratic schools which were being formed, and though not\nby Plato and Aristotle, they were specially so by the Stoics, the new\nAcademy, &c. That is to say, the one point is determination itself in\ngeneral, the criterion; and the second is what determination for the\nsubject is. And thus the idea of the wise man results\u2014what the wise\ndo, who the wise are, &c. The reason that these two expressions are\nnow so prominent is one which rests on what has gone before. On the\none hand the main interest is to find a content for the good, for else\nmen may talk about it for years. This further definition of the good\nis just the criterion. On the other hand the interest of the subject\nappears, and that is the result of the revolution in the Greek mind\nmade by Socrates. When the religion, constitution, laws of a people,\nare held in esteem, and when the individual members of a people are\none with them, the question of what the individual has to do on his\nown account, will not be put. In a moralized, religious condition of\nthings we are likely to find the end of man in what is present, and\nthese morals, religion and laws are also present in him. When, on\nthe contrary, the individual exists no longer in the morality of his\npeople, no longer has his substantial being in the religion, laws,\n&c., of his land, he no longer finds what he desires, and no longer\nsatisfies himself in his present. But if this discord has arisen, the\nindividual must immerse himself in himself, and there seek his end. Now\nthis is really the cause that the question of what is the essential\nfor the individual arises. After what end must he form himself and\nafter what strive? Thus an ideal for the individual is set up, and\nthis is the wise man: what was called the ideal of the wise man is\nthe individuality of self-consciousness which is conceived of as\nuniversal essence. The point of view is the same when we now ask, What\ncan I know? What should I believe? What ought I to hope? What is the\nhighest interest of the subject? It is not what is truth, right, the\nuniversal end of the world, for instead of asking about the science\nof the implicitly and explicitly objective, the question is what is\ntrue and right in as far as it is the insight and conviction of the\nindividual, his end and a mode of his existence? This talk about wise\nmen is universal amongst the Stoics, Epicureans, &c., but is devoid\nof meaning. For the wise man is not in question, but the wisdom of\nthe universe, real reason. A third definition is that the universal\nis the good; the real side of things is enjoyment and happiness as a\nsimple existence and immediate actuality. How then do the two agree?\nThe philosophic schools which now arise and their successors have set\nforth the harmony of both determinations, which are the higher Being\nand thought.\n_b._ THEODORUS.\nOf the later Cyrenaics, Theodorus must be mentioned first; he is\nfamous for having denied the existence of the gods, and being, for\nthis reason, banished from Athens. Such a fact can, however, have\nno further interest or speculative significance, for the positive\ngods which Theodorus denied, are themselves not any object of\nspeculative reason. He made himself remarkable besides for introducing\nthe universal more into the idea of that which was existence for\nconsciousness, for \u201che made joy and sorrow the end, but in such a\nway that the former pertained to the understanding and the latter\nto want of understanding. He defined the good as understanding and\njustice, and the bad as the opposite; enjoyment and pain, however,\nwere indifferent.\u201d[163] When we reach the consciousness that the\nindividual sensuous feeling, as it is immediately, is not to be\nconsidered as real existence, it is then said that it must be accepted\nwith understanding; _i.e._ feeling, just as it is, is not reality.\nFor the sensuous generally, as sensation, theoretic or practical, is\nsomething quite indeterminate, this or that unit; a criticism of this\nunit is hence required, _i.e._ it must be considered in the form of\nuniversality, and hence this last necessarily reappears. But this\nadvance on individuality is culture, which, through the limitation of\nindividual feelings and enjoyments, tries to make these harmonious,\neven though it first of all only calculates as to that by which the\ngreater pleasure is to be found. Now, to the question as to which of\nthe many enjoyments which I, as a many-sided man, can enjoy, is the\none which is in completest harmony with me, and in which I thus find\nthe greatest satisfaction, it must be replied that the completest\nharmony with me is only found in the accordance of my particular\nexistence and consciousness with my actual substantial Being. Theodorus\ncomprehended this as understanding and justice, in which we know where\nto seek enjoyment. But when it is said that felicity must be sought\nby reflection, we know that these are empty words and thoughtless\nutterances. For the feeling in which felicity is contained, is in its\nconception the individual, self-changing, without universality and\nsubsistence. Thus the universal, understanding, as an empty form,\nadheres to a content quite incongruous with it; and thus Theodorus\ndistinguished the Good in its form, from the end as the Good in its\nnature and content.\n_c._ HEGESIAS.\nIt is remarkable that another Cyrenaic, Hegesias, recognized this\nincongruity between sensation and universality, which last is opposed\nto the individual, having what is agreeable as well as disagreeable\nwithin itself. Because, on the whole, he took a firmer grasp of the\nuniversal and gave it a larger place, there passed from him all\ndetermination of individuality, and with it really the Cyrenaic\nprinciple. It came to his knowledge that individual sensation is in\nitself nothing; and, as he nevertheless made enjoyment his end, it\nbecame to him the universal. But if enjoyment is the end, we must ask\nabout the content; if this content is investigated, we find every\ncontent a particular which is not in conformity with the universal, and\nthus falls into dialectic. Hegesias followed the Cyrenaic principle\nas far as to this consequence of thought. That universal is contained\nin an expression of his which we often enough hear echoed, \u201cThere is\nno perfect happiness. The body is troubled with manifold pains, and\nthe soul suffers along with it; it is hence a matter of indifference\nwhether we choose life or death. In itself nothing is pleasant or\nunpleasant.\u201d That is to say, the criterion of being pleasant or\nunpleasant, because its universality is removed, is thus itself made\nquite indeterminate; and because it has no objective determinateness\nin itself, it has become unmeaning; before the universal, which is\nthus held secure, the sum of all determinations, the individuality of\nconsciousness as such, disappears, but with it even life itself as\nbeing unreal. \u201cThe rarity, novelty, or excess of enjoyment begets in\nsome cases enjoyment and in others discontent. Poverty and riches have\nno meaning for what is pleasant, since we see that the rich do not\nenjoy pleasures more than the poor. Similarly, slavery and liberty,\nnoble and ignoble birth, fame and lack of fame, are equivalent as\nregards pleasure. Only to a fool can living be a matter of moment; to\nthe wise man it is indifferent,\u201d and he is consequently independent.\n\u201cThe wise man acts only after his own will, and he considers none\nother equally worthy. For even if he attain from others the greatest\nbenefits, this does not equal what he gives himself. Hegesias and\nhis friends also take away sensation, because it gives no sufficient\nknowledge,\u201d which really amounts to scepticism. \u201cThey say further that\nwe ought to do what we have reason to believe is best. The sinner\nshould be forgiven, for no one willingly sins, but is conquered by a\npassion. The wise man does not hate, but instructs; his endeavours go\nnot so much to the attainment of good, as to the avoidance of evil, for\nhis aim is to live without trouble and sorrow.\u201d[164] This universality,\nwhich proceeds from the principle of the freedom of the individual\nself-consciousness, Hegesias expressed as the condition of the perfect\nindifference of the wise men\u2014an indifference to everything into which\nwe shall see all philosophic systems of the kind going forth, and which\nis a surrendering of all reality, the complete withdrawal of life into\nitself. It is told that Hegesias, who lived in Alexandria, was not\nallowed to teach the Ptolemies of the time, because he inspired many\nof his hearers with such indifference to life that they took their\nown.[165]\n_d._ ANNICERIS.\nWe also hear of Anniceris and his followers, who, properly speaking,\ndeparted from the distinctive character of the principle of the\nCyrenaic school, and thereby gave philosophic culture quite another\ndirection. It is said of them that \u201cthey acknowledged friendship in\ncommon life, along with gratitude, honour to parents, and service for\none\u2019s country. And although the wise man has, by so doing, to undergo\nhardship and work, he can still be happy, even if he therein obtains\nfew pleasures. Friendships are not to be formed on utilitarian grounds\nalone, but because of the good will that develops; and out of love to\nfriends, even burdens and difficulties are to be undertaken.\u201d[166]\nThe universal, the theoretically speculative element in the school,\nis thus lost; it sinks more into what is popular. This is then the\nsecond direction which the Cyrenaic school has taken; the first was\nthe overstepping of the principle itself. A method of philosophizing\nin morals arises, which later on prevailed with Cicero and the\nPeripatetics of his time, but the interest has disappeared, so far as\nany consistent system of thought is concerned.\n3. THE CYNIC SCHOOL.\nThere is nothing particular to say of the Cynics, for they possess\nbut little Philosophy, and they did not bring what they had into a\nscientific system; it was only later that their tenets were raised by\nthe Stoics into a philosophic discipline. With the Cynics, as with the\nCyrenaics, the point was to determine what should be the principle\nfor consciousness, both as regards its knowledge and its actions.\nThe Cynics also set up the Good as a universal end, and asked in\nwhat, for individual men, it is to be sought. But if the Cyrenaic,\nin accordance with his determinate principle, made the consciousness\nof himself as an individual, or feeling, into real existence for\nconsciousness, the Cynic took this individuality, in as far as it has\nthe form of universality directly for me, _i.e._ in as far as I am a\nfree consciousness, indifferent to all individuality. Thus they are\nopposed to the Cyrenaics for while to these feeling, which, because\nit has to be determined through thought, is undoubtedly extended into\nuniversality and perfect freedom, is made the principle, the former\nbegin with perfect freedom and independence as the property of man.\nBut since this is the same indifference of self-consciousness which\nHegesias expressed as real existence, the extremes in the Cynic and\nCyrenaic modes of thought destroy themselves by their own consequences,\nand pass into one another. With the Cyrenaics there is the impulse to\nturn things back into consciousness, according to which nothing is\nreal existence for me; the Cynics had also only to do with themselves,\nand the individual self-consciousness was likewise principle. But\nthe Cynic, at least in the beginning, set up for the guidance of men\nthe principle of freedom and indifference, both in regard to thought\nand actual life, as against all external individuality, particular\nends, needs, and enjoyments; so that culture not only sought after\nindifference to these and independence within itself, as with the\nCyrenaics, but for express privation, and for the limitation of\nneeds to what is necessary and what nature demands. The Cynics thus\nmaintained as the content of the good, the greatest independence of\nnature, _i.e._ the slightest possible necessities; this meant a rebound\nfrom enjoyment, and from the pleasures of feeling. The negative is\nhere the determining; later on this opposition of Cynics and Cyrenaics\nlikewise appeared between Stoics and Epicureans. But the same negation\nwhich the Cynics made their principle, had already shown itself in the\nfurther development which the Cyrenaic philosophy had taken. The School\nof the Cynics had no scientific weight; it only constitutes an element\nwhich must necessarily appear in the knowledge of the universal, and\nwhich is that consciousness must know itself in its individuality, as\nfree from all dependence on things and on enjoyment. To him who relies\nupon riches or enjoyment such dependence is in fact real consciousness,\nor his individuality is real existence. But the Cynics so enforced that\nnegative moment that they placed freedom in actual renunciation of\nso-called superfluities; they only recognized this abstract unmoving\nindependence, which did not concern itself with enjoyment or the\ninterests of an ordinary life. But true freedom does not consist in\nflying from enjoyment and the occupations which have as their concern\nother men and other ends in life; but in the fact that consciousness,\nthough involved in all reality, stands above it and is free from it.\n_a._ ANTISTHENES.\nAntisthenes, an Athenian and friend of Socrates, was the first who\nprofessed to be a Cynic. He lived at Athens, and taught in a gymnasium,\ncalled Cynosarges, and he was called the \u201csimple dog\u201d (_\u1f01\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd_).\nHis mother was Thracian, which was often made a reproach to him\u2014a\nreproach which to us would be unmeaning. He replied that the mother of\nthe gods was a Phrygian, and that the Athenians, who make so much of\ntheir being native born, are in no way nobler than the native fish and\ngrasshoppers. He educated himself under Gorgias and Socrates, and went\ndaily from the Pir\u00e6us to the city to hear Socrates. He wrote several\nworks, the titles of which Diogenes mentions, and, according to all\naccounts, was esteemed a highly cultivated and upright man.[167]\nAntisthenes\u2019 principles are simple, because the content of his teaching\nremains general; it is hence superfluous to say anything further\nabout it. He gives general rules, which consist of such excellent\nmaxims as that \u201cvirtue is self-sufficing, and requires nothing more\nthan a Socratic strength of character. The good is excellent, the bad\ndiscreditable. Virtue consists of works, and does not require many\nreasons or theories. The end of man is a virtuous life. The wise man\nis contented with himself, for he possesses everything that others\nseem to possess. His own virtue satisfies him; he is at home all over\nthe world. If he lacks fame, this is not to be regarded as an evil,\nbut as a good,\u201d &c.[168] We here, once more, have the tedious talk\nabout the wise man, which by the Stoics, as also by the Epicureans,\nwas even more spun out and made more tedious. In this ideal, where the\ndetermination of the subject is in question, its satisfaction is placed\nin simplifying its needs. But when Antisthenes says that virtue does\nnot require reasons and theories, he forgets that he himself acquired,\nthrough the cultivation of mind, its independence and the power of\nrenouncing all that men desire. We see directly that virtue has now\nobtained another signification; it no longer is unconscious virtue,\nlike the simple virtue of a citizen of a free people, who fulfils\nhis duties to fatherland, place, and family, as these relationships\nimmediately require. The consciousness which has gone beyond itself\nmust, in order to become Mind, now lay hold of and comprehend all\nreality, i.e. be conscious of it as its own. But conditions such as\nare called by names like innocence or beauty of soul, are childish\nconditions, which are certainly to be praised in their own place, but\nfrom which man, because he is rational, must come forth, in order\nto re-create himself from the sublated immediacy. The freedom and\nindependence of the Cynics, however, which consists only in lessening\nto the utmost the burden imposed by wants, is abstract, because it, as\nnegative in character, has really to be a mere renunciation. Concrete\nfreedom consists in maintaining an indifferent attitude towards\nnecessities, not avoiding them, but in their satisfaction remaining\nfree, and abiding in morality and in participation in the moral life\nof man. Abstract freedom, on the contrary, surrenders its morality,\nbecause the individual withdraws into his subjectivity, and is\nconsequently an element of immorality.\nYet Antisthenes bears a high place in this Cynical philosophy. But\nthe attitude he adopted comes very near to that of rudeness, vulgarity\nof conduct and shamelessness; and later on Cynicism passed into such.\nHence comes the continual mockery of, and the constant jokes against\nthe Cynics; and it is only their individual manners and individual\nstrength of character which makes them interesting. It is even told\nof Antisthenes that he began to attribute value to external poverty\nof life. Cynicism adopted a simple wardrobe\u2014a thick stick of wild\nolive, a ragged double mantle without any under garment, which served\nas bed by night, a beggar\u2019s sack for the food that was required,\nand a cup with which to draw water.[169] This was the costume with\nwhich these Cynics used to distinguish themselves. That on which\nthey placed highest value was the simplification of their needs; it\nseems very plausible to say that this produces freedom. For needs\nare certainly dependence upon nature, and this is antagonistic to\nfreedom of spirit; the reduction of that dependence to a minimum is\nthus an idea which commends itself. But at the same time this minimum\nis itself undetermined, and if such stress is laid on thus merely\nfollowing nature, it follows that too great a value is set on the needs\nof nature and on the renunciation of others. This is what is also\nevident in the monastic principle. The negative likewise contains an\naffirmative bias towards what is renounced; and the renunciation and\nthe importance of what is renounced is thus made too marked. Socrates\nhence declares the clothing of the Cynics to be vanity. For \u201cwhen\nAntisthenes turned outside a hole in his cloak, Socrates said to him,\nI see thy vanity through the hole in thy cloak.\u201d[170] Clothing is not\na thing of rational import, but is regulated through needs that arise\nof themselves. In the North the clothing must be different from that in\nCentral Africa; and in winter we do not wear cotton garments. Anything\nfurther is meaningless, and is left to chance and to opinion; in modern\ntimes, for instance, old-fashioned clothing had a meaning in relation\nto patriotism. The cut of my coat is decided by fashion, and the tailor\nsees to this; it is not my business to invent it, for mercifully others\nhave done so for me. This dependence on custom and opinion is certainly\nbetter than were it to be on nature. But it is not essential that men\nshould direct their understanding to this; indifference is the point of\nview which must reign, since the thing itself is undoubtedly perfectly\nindifferent. Men are proud that they can distinguish themselves in\nthis, and try to make a fuss about it, but it is folly to set oneself\nagainst the fashion. In this matter I must hence not decide myself, nor\nmay I draw it within the radius of my interests, but simply do what is\nexpected of me.\n_b._ DIOGENES.\nDiogenes of Sinope, the best known Cynic, distinguished himself even\nmore than Antisthenes by the life he led, as also by his biting and\noften clever hits, and bitter and sarcastic retorts; but he likewise\nreceived replies which were often aimed as well. He is called the Dog,\njust as Aristippus was called by him the royal Dog, for Diogenes bore\nthe same relation to idle boys as Aristippus did to kings. Diogenes\nis only famed for his manner of life; with him, as with the moderns,\nCynicism came to signify more a mode of living than a philosophy. He\nconfined himself to the barest necessities, and tried to make fun of\nothers who did not think as he, and who laughed at his ways. That he\nthrew away his cup when he saw a boy drinking out of his hands is well\nknown. To have no wants, said Diogenes, is divine; to have as few as\npossible is to come nearest to the divine. He lived in all sorts of\nplaces, in the streets of Athens, in the market in tubs; and he usually\nresided and slept in Jupiter\u2019s Stoa in Athens; he hence remarked that\nthe Athenians had built him a splendid place of residence.[171] Thus\nthe Cynics thought not only of dress, but also of other wants. But a\nmode of life such as that followed by the Cynics, which professed to\nbe a result of culture, is really conditioned by the culture of the\nmind. The Cynics were not anchorites; their consciousness was still\nessentially related to other consciousness. Antisthenes and Diogenes\nlived in Athens, and could only exist there. But in culture the mind\nis also directed to the most manifold needs, and to the methods of\nsatisfying these. In more recent times the needs have much increased,\nand hence a division of the general wants into many particular wants\nand modes of satisfaction has arisen; this is the function of the\nactivity of the understanding, and in its application luxury has a\nplace. We may declaim against the morality of this, but in a State all\ntalents, natural inclinations and customs must have free scope and be\nbrought into exercise, and every individual may take what part he will,\nonly he must in the main make for the universal. Thus the chief point\nis to place no greater value on such matters than what is demanded, or\ngenerally, to place no importance either on possessing or dispensing\nwith them.\nOf Diogenes we have only anecdotes to relate. In a voyage to \u00c6gina he\nfell into the hands of sea-robbers, and was to be sold as a slave in\nCrete. Being asked what he understood, he replied, \u201cTo command men,\u201d\nand told the herald to call out, \u201cWho will buy a ruler?\u201d A certain\nXeniades of Corinth bought him, and he instructed his sons.\nThere are very many stories told of his residence in Athens. There he\npresented a contrast in his rudeness and disdainfulness to Aristippus\u2019\nfawning philosophy. Aristippus set no value on his enjoyments any more\nthan on his wants, but Diogenes did so on his poverty. Diogenes was\nonce washing his greens when Aristippus passed by, and he called out,\n\u201cIf you knew how to wash your greens yourself, you would not run after\nkings.\u201d Aristippus replied very aptly, \u201cIf you knew how to associate\nwith men, you would not wash greens.\u201d In Plato\u2019s house he once walked\non the beautiful carpets with muddy feet, saying, \u201cI tread on the pride\nof Plato.\u201d \u201cYes, but with another pride,\u201d replied Plato, as pointedly.\nWhen Diogenes stood wet through with rain, and the bystanders pitied\nhim, Plato said, \u201cIf you wish to compassionate him, just go away. His\nvanity is in showing himself off and exciting surprise; it is what\nmade him act in this way, and the reason would not exist if he were\nleft alone.\u201d Once when he got a thrashing, as anecdotes often tell, he\nlaid a large plaster on his wounds, and wrote on it the names of those\nwho had struck him in order that they might be blamed of all. When\nyouths standing by him said, \u201cWe are afraid that you will bite us,\u201d he\nreplied, \u201cDon\u2019t mind, a dog never eats turnips.\u201d At a feast a guest\nthrew bones to him like a dog, and he went up to him and behaved to him\nlike a dog. He gave a good answer to a tyrant who asked him from what\nmetal statues should be cast: \u201cFrom the metal from which the statues of\nHarmodius and Aristogiton were cast.\u201d He tried to eat raw meat, which\ndid not, however, agree with him; he could not digest it, and died at a\nvery great age, as he lived\u2014in the streets.[172]\n_c._ LATER CYNICS.\nAntisthenes and Diogenes, as already mentioned, were men of great\nculture. The succeeding Cynics are not any the less conspicuous by\ntheir exceeding shamelessness, but they were, generally speaking,\nnothing more than swinish beggars, who found their satisfaction in the\ninsolence which they showed to others. They are worthy of no further\nconsideration in Philosophy, and they deserve in its full the name of\ndogs, which was early given to them; for the dog is a shameless animal.\nCrates, of Thebes, and Hipparchia, a Cynic, celebrated their nuptials\nin the public market.[173] This independence of which the Cynics\nboasted, is really subjection, for while every other sphere of active\nlife contains the affirmative element of free intelligence, this means\nthe denying oneself the sphere in which the element of freedom can be\nenjoyed.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] Zur Philosophie und Geschichte.

The editor found\na justification in this for placing the passage in its proper place.\n[Note by editor.]\n[50] Adv. Math. VII. 47-52; 110, 111; VIII. 326; Pyrrh. Hyp. II. 4, \u00a7\n18.\n[51] Sext.

Dr.\nHutchison Stirling, in his annotations on Schwegler\u2019s \u201cHistory\nof Philosophy,\u201d says: \u201cZeller accepts (and Hegel, by quoting and\ntranslating the whole passage, already countenanced him in advance) the\nequivalent of Theophrastus for _\u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd_ namely, and\ninterprets the clause itself thus:\u2014\u2018The preponderating element of the\ntwo is thought occasions and determines the ideas;\u2019 that is as is the\npreponderating element (the warm or the cold) so is the state of mind.\nIn short, _the more is the thought_ is the linguistic equivalent of the\ntime for _according to the more is the thought_.\u201d [Translator\u2019s note.]\n[57] As a matter of fact, since a comparison of this reasoning with\nthe fragments of Melissus which Simplicius (in Arist. Physica and De\nC\u0153lo) has retained, places this conjecture beyond doubt, the editor is\nconstrained to place it here, although Hegel, when he dealt with the\nEleatics separately, put it under the heading of Xenophanes.

But since, in the\ncourse of his treatment of them, he always connected the Atomists\nwith the Eleatics and Heraclitus, and took Empedocles, in so far as\nhe anticipated design, as the forerunner of Anaxagoras, the present\ntransposition is sufficiently justified. If we further consider that\nEmpedocles swayed to and fro between the One of Heraclitus and the\nMany of Leucippus, without, like them, adhering to either of these\none-sided determinations, it is clear that both moments are assumptions\nthrough whose variations he opened a way for the Anaxagorean conception\nof end, which, by comprehending them, is the essential unity from\nwhich proceeds the manifold of phenomena, as from their immanent\nsource.\u2014[Note by Editor.]\n[79] Anaxagor\u00e6 Clazomenii fragmenta, qu\u00e6 supersunt omnia, edita ab E.\nSchaubach, Lipsi\u00e6, 1827.\n[80] Plin.

Schwegler, in explaining Hegel\u2019s position in his \u201cHistory of\nPhilosophy,\u201d states that Hegel asserts that Socrates set _Moralit\u00e4t_,\nthe subjective morality of individual conscience, in the place of\n_Sittlichkeit_, \u201cthe spontaneous, natural, half-unconscious (almost\ninstinctive) virtue that rests in obedience to established custom\n(use and wont, natural objective law, that is at bottom, according to\nHegel, rational, though not yet subjectively cleared, perhaps, into\nits rational principles).\u201d As Dr. Stirling says in his Annotations\nto the same work (p. 394), \u201cThere is a period in the history of the\nState when people live in tradition; that is a period of unreflected\n_Sittlichkeit_, or natural observance. Then there comes a time when the\nobservances are questioned, and when the right or truth they involve\nis reflected into the subject. This is a period of Aufkl\u00e4rung, and for\n_Sittlichkeit_ there is substituted _Moralit\u00e4t_, subjective morality:\nthe subject will approve nought but what he finds inwardly true to\nhimself, to his conscience.\u201d\u2014[TRANSLATOR\u2019S NOTE.]\n[118] Diog.

It was preceded by\nthe _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ in 1807, and the _Science of Logic_ (in\ntwo volumes), in 1812-16, and was followed by the _Outlines of the\nPhilosophy of Law_ in 1820. The only other works which came directly\nfrom his hand are a few essays, addresses, and reviews. The earliest\nof these appeared in the _Critical Journal of Philosophy,_ issued by\nhis friend Schelling and himself, in 1802--when Hegel was one and\nthirty, which, as Bacon thought, 'is a great deal of sand in the\nhour-glass'; and the latest were his contributions to the _Jahrb\u00fccher\nf\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Kritik,_ in the year of his death (1831).\nThis _Encyclopaedia_ is the only complete, matured, and authentic\nstatement of Hegel's philosophical system. But, as the title-page\nbears, it is only an outline; and its primary aim is to supply a manual\nfor the guidance of his students. In its mode of exposition the free\nflight of speculation is subordinated to the needs of the professorial\nclass-room. Pegasus is put in harness. Paragraphs concise in form and\nsaturated with meaning postulate and presuppose the presiding spirit\nof the lecturer to fuse them into continuity and raise them to higher\nlucidity. Yet in two directions the works of Hegel furnish a supplement\nto the defects of the _Encyclopaedia._\nOne of these aids to comprehension is the _Phenomenology of Spirit,_\npublished in his thirty-seventh year. It may be going too far to say\nwith David Strauss that it is the Alpha and Omega of Hegel, and his\nlater writings only extracts from it.[1] Yet here the Pegasus of mind\nsoars free through untrodden fields of air, and tastes the joys of\nfirst love and the pride of fresh discovery in the quest for truth. The\nfire of young enthusiasm has not yet been forced to hide itself and\nsmoulder away in apparent calm. The mood is Olympian--far above the\nturmoil and bitterness of lower earth, free from the bursts of temper\nwhich emerge later, when the thinker has to mingle in the fray and\nendure the shafts of controversy. But the _Phenomenology,_ if not less\nthan the _Encyclopaedia_ it contains the diamond purity of Hegelianism,\nis a key which needs consummate patience and skill to use with\nadvantage. If it commands a larger view, it demands a stronger wing of\nhim who would join its voyage through the atmosphere of thought up to\nits purest empyrean. It may be the royal road to the Idea, but only a\nkingly soul can retrace its course.\nThe other commentary on the _Encyclopaedia_ is supplied partly by\nHegel's other published writings, and partly by the volumes (IX-XV in\nthe Collected works) in which his editors have given his Lectures on\nthe Philosophy of History, on Aesthetic, on the Philosophy of Religion,\nand on the History of Philosophy. All of these lectures, as well as\nthe _Philosophy of Law,_ published by himself, deal however only with\nthe third part of the philosophic system. That system (p. 28) includes\n(i) Logic, (ii) Philosophy of Nature, and (iii) Philosophy of Spirit.\nIt is this third part--or rather it is the last two divisions therein\n(embracing the great general interests of humanity, such as law and\nmorals, religion and art, as well as the development of philosophy\nitself) which form the topics of Hegel s most expanded teaching. It\nis in this region that he has most appealed to the liberal culture of\nthe century, and influenced (directly or by reaction) the progress of\nthat philosophical history and historical philosophy of which our own\ngeneration is reaping the fast-accumulating fruit. If one may foist\nsuch a category into systematic philosophy, we may say that the study\nof the 'Objective' and 'Absolute Spirit' is the most _interesting_ part\nof Hegel.\nOf the second part of the system there is less to be said. For nearly\nhalf a century the study of nature has passed almost completely out\nof the hands of the philosophers into the care of the specialists of\nscience. There are signs indeed everywhere--and among others Helmholtz\nhas lately reminded us--that the higher order of scientific students\nare ever and anon driven by the very logic of their subject into the\nprecincts or the borders of philosophy. But the name of a Philosophy\nof Nature still recalls a time of hasty enthusiasms and over-grasping\nambition of thought which, in its eagerness to understand the mystery\nof the universe jumped to conclusions on insufficient grounds, trusted\nto bold but fantastic analogies, and lavished an unwise contempt on the\nplodding industry of the mere hodman of facts and experiments. Calmer\nretrospection will perhaps modify this verdict, and sift the various\ncontributions (towards a philosophical unity of the sciences) which\nare now indiscriminately damned by the title of _Naturphilosophie._\nFor the present purpose it need only be said that, for the second\npart of the Hegelian system, we are restricted for explanations\nto the notes collected by the editors of Vol. VII. part i. of the\nCollected works--notes derived from the annotations which Hegel himself\nsupplied in the eight or more courses of lectures which he gave on the\nPhilosophy of Nature between 1804 and 1830.\nQuite other is the case with the Logic--the first division of the\n_Encyclopaedia._ There we have the collateral authority of the\n'Science of Logic,' the larger Logic which appeared whilst Hegel was\nschoolmaster at N\u00fcrnberg. The idea of a new Logic formed the natural\nsequel to the publication of the _Phenomenology_ in 1807. In that\nyear Hegel was glad to accept, as a stop-gap and pot-boiler, the post\nof editor of the Bamberg Journal. But his interests lay in other\ndirections, and the circumstances of the time and country helped to\ndetermine their special form. 'In Bavaria,' he says in a letter[2],\n'it looks as if organisation were the current business.' A very mania\nof reform, says another, prevailed. Hegel's friend and fellow-Swabian,\nNiethammer, held an important position in the Bavarian education\noffice, and wished to employ the philosopher in the work of carrying\nout his plans of re-organising the higher education of the Protestant\nsubjects of the crown. He asked if Hegel would write a logic for school\nuse, and if he cared to become rector of a grammar school. Hegel, who\nwas already at work on his larger Logic, was only half-attracted by\nthe suggestion. 'The traditional Logic,' he replied[3], 'is a subject\non which there are text-books enough, but at the same time it is one\nwhich can by no means remain as it is: it is a thing nobody can make\nanything of: 'tis dragged along like an old heirloom, only because\na substitute--of which the want is universally felt--is not yet in\nexistence. The whole of its rules, still current, might be written\non two pages: every additional detail beyond these two is perfectly\nfruitless scholastic subtlety;--or if this logic is to get a thicker\nbody, its expansion must come from psychological paltrinesses,' Still\nless did he like the prospect of instructing in theology, as then\nrationalised. 'To write a logic and to be theological instructor is as\nbad as to be white-washer and chimney-sweep at once.' 'Shall he, who\nfor many long years built his eyry on the wild rock beside the eagle\nand learned to breathe the free air of the mountains, now learn to feed\non the carcases of dead thoughts or the still-born thoughts of the\nmoderns, and vegetate in the leaden air of mere babble[4]?'\nAt N\u00fcrnberg he found the post of rector of the 'gymnasium' by no\nmeans a sinecure. The school had to be made amid much lack of funds\nand general bankruptcy of apparatus:--all because of an all-powerful\nand unalterable destiny which is called the course of business.' One\nof his tasks was 'by graduated exercises to introduce his pupils to\nspeculative thought,'--and that in the space of four hours weekly[5].\nOf its practicability--and especially with himself as instrument--he\nhad grave doubts. In theory, he held that an intelligent study of\nthe ancient classics was the best introduction to philosophy; and\npractically he preferred starting his pupils with the principles\nof law, morality and religion, and reserving the logic and higher\nphilosophy for the highest class. Meanwhile he continued to work on\nhis great Logic, the first volume of which appeared in two parts, 1812,\n1813, and the second in 1816.\nThis is the work which is the real foundation of the Hegelian\nphilosophy. Its aim is the systematic reorganisation of the\ncommonwealth of thought. It gives not a criticism, like Kant; not\na principle, like Fichte; not a bird's eye view of the fields of\nnature and history, like Schelling; it attempts the hard work of\nre-constructing, step by step, into totality the fragments of the\norganism of intelligence. It is scholasticism, if scholasticism means\nan absolute and all-embracing system; but it is a protest against\nthe old school-system and those who tried to rehabilitate it through\ntheir comprehensions of the Kantian theory. Apropos of the logic of\nhis contemporary Fries (whom he did not love), published in 1811, he\nremarks: 'His paragraphs are mindless, quite shallow, bald, trivial;\nthe explanatory notes are the dirty linen of the professorial chair,\nutterly slack and unconnected.'[6] Of himself he thus speaks: 'I am\na schoolmaster who has to teach philosophy,--who, possibly for that\nreason, believes that philosophy like geometry is teachable, and\nmust no less than geometry have a regular structure. But again, a\nknowledge of the facts in geometry and philosophy is one thing, and the\nmathematical or philosophical talent which procreates and discovers is\nanother: my province is to discover that scientific form, or to aid\nin the formation of it[7].' So he writes to an old college friend;\nand in a letter to the rationalist theologian Paulus, in 1814[8], he\nprofesses: 'You know that I have had too much to do not merely with\nancient literature, but even with mathematics, latterly with the higher\nanalysis, differential calculus, chemistry, to let myself be taken in\nby the humbug of Naturphilosophie, philosophising without knowledge of\nfact and by mere force of imagination, and treating mere fancies, even\nimbecile fancies, as Ideas.'\nIn the autumn of 1816 Hegel became professor of philosophy at\nHeidelberg. In the following year appeared the first edition of his\n_Encyclopaedia_: two others appeared in his lifetime (in 1827 and\n1830). The first edition is a thin octavo volume of pp. xvi. 288,\npublished (like the others) at Heidelberg. The Logic in it occupies\npp. 1-126 (of which 12 pp. are Einleitung and 18 pp. Vorbegriff); the\nPhilosophy of Nature, pp. 127-204; and the Philosophy of Mind (Spirit),\npp. 205-288.\nIn the Preface the book is described (p. iv) as setting forth 'a new\ntreatment of philosophy on a method which will, as I hope, yet be\nrecognised as the only genuine method identical with the content.'\nContrasting his own procedure with a mannerism of the day which\nused an assumed set of formulas to produce in the facts a show of\nsymmetry even more arbitrary and mechanical than the arrangements\nimposed _ab extra_ in the sciences, he goes on: 'This wilfulness we\nsaw also take possession of the contents of philosophy and ride out\non an intellectual knight-errantry--for a while imposing on honest\ntrue-hearted workers, though elsewhere it was only counted grotesque,\nand grotesque even to the pitch of madness. But oftener and more\nproperly its teachings--far from seeming imposing or mad--were found\nout to be familiar trivialities, and its form seen to be a mere trick\nof wit, easily acquired, methodical and premeditated, with its quaint\ncombinations and strained eccentricities,--the mien of earnestness only\ncovering self-deception and fraud upon the public. On the other side,\nagain, we saw shallowness and unintelligence assume the character of\na scepticism wise in its own eyes and of a criticism modest in its\nclaims for reason, enhancing their vanity and conceit in proportion\nas their ideas grew more vacuous. For a space of time these two\nintellectual tendencies have befooled German earnestness, have tired\nout its profound craving for philosophy, and have been succeeded by\nan indifference and even a contempt for philosophic science, till at\nlength a self-styled modesty has the audacity to let its voice be heard\nin controversies touching the deepest philosophical problems, and to\ndeny philosophy its right to that cognition by reason, the form of\nwhich was what formerly was called _demonstration._'\n'The first of these phenomena may be in part explained as the youthful\nexuberance of the new age which has risen in the realm of science no\nless than in the world of politics. If this exuberance greeted with\nrapture the dawn of the intellectual renascence, and without profounder\nlabour at once set about enjoying the Idea and revelling for a while in\nthe hopes and prospects which it offered, one can more readily forgive\nits excesses; because it is sound at heart, and the surface vapours\nwhich it had suffused around its solid worth must spontaneously clear\noff. But the other spectacle is more repulsive; because it betrays\nexhaustion and impotence, and tries to conceal them under a hectoring\nconceit which acts the censor over the philosophical intellects of all\nthe centuries, mistaking them, but most of all mistaking itself.\n'So much the more gratifying is another spectacle yet-to be noted; the\ninterest in philosophy and the earnest love of higher knowledge which\nin the presence of both tendencies has kept itself single-hearted and\nwithout affectation. Occasionally this interest may have taken too\nmuch to the language of intuition and feeling; yet its appearance\nproves the existence of that inward and deeper-reaching impulse of\nreasonable intelligence which alone gives man his dignity,--proves it\nabove all, because that standpoint can only be gained as a _result_\nof philosophical consciousness; so that what it seems to disdain is\nat least admitted and recognised as a condition. To this interest\nin ascertaining the truth I dedicate this attempt to supply an\nintroduction and a contribution towards its satisfaction.'\nThe second edition appeared in 1827. Since the autumn of 1818 Hegel\nhad been professor at Berlin: and the manuscript was sent thence (from\nAugust 1826 onwards) to Heidelberg, where Daub, his friend--himself\na master in philosophical theology--attended to the revision of the\nproofs. 'To the Introduction,' writes Hegel[9], 'I have given perhaps\ntoo great an amplitude: but it, above all, would have cost me time and\ntrouble to bring within narrower compass. Tied down and distracted\nby lectures, and sometimes here in Berlin by other things too, I\nhave--without a general survey--allowed myself so large a swing that\nthe work has grown upon me, and there was a danger of its turning into\na book. I have gone through it several times. The treatment of the\nattitudes (of thought) which I have distinguished in it was to meet an\ninterest of the day. The rest I have sought to make more definite, and\nso far as may be clearer; but the main fault is not mended--to do which\nwould require me to limit the detail more, and on the other hand make\nthe whole more surveyable, so that the contents should better answer\nthe title of an Encyclopaedia.' Again, in Dec. 1826, he writes[10]: 'In\nthe Naturphilosophie I have made essential changes, but could not help\nhere and there going too far into a detail which is hardly in keeping\nwith the tone of the whole. The second half of the Geistesphilosophie\nI shall have to modify entirely.' In May 1827, Hegel offers his\nexplanation of delay in the preface, which, like the concluding\nparagraphs, touches largely on contemporary theology. By August of that\nyear the book was finished, and Hegel off to Paris for a holiday.\nIn the second edition, which substantially fixed the form of the\n_Encyclopaedia_, the pages amount to xlii, 534--nearly twice as many\nas the first, which, however, as Professor Caird remarks, 'has a\ncompactness, a brief energy and conclusiveness of expression, which\nhe never surpassed.' The Logic now occupies pp. 1214, Philosophy of\nNature 215-354, and Philosophy of Spirit from 355-534. The second part\ntherefore has gained least; and in the third part the chief single\nexpansions occur towards the close and deal with the relations of\nphilosophy, art, and religion in the State; viz. \u00a7 563 (which in the\nthird edition is transposed to \u00a7 552), and \u00a7 573 (where two pages are\nenlarged to 18). In the first part, or the Logic, the main increase\nand alteration falls within the introductory chapters, where 96 pages\ntake the place of 30. The Vorbegriff (preliminary notion) of the first\nedition had contained the distinction of the three logical 'moments'\n(see p. 142), with a few remarks on the methods, first, of metaphysic,\nand then (after a brief section on empiricism), of the 'Critical\nPhilosophy through which philosophy has reached its close.' Instead\nof this the second edition deals at length, under this head, with the\nthree 'attitudes (or positions) of thought to objectivity;' where,\nbesides a more lengthy criticism of the Critical philosophy, there is a\ndiscussion of the doctrines of Jacobi and other Intuitivists.\nThe Preface, like much else in this second edition, is an assertion\nof the right and the duty of philosophy to treat independently of\nthe things of God, and an emphatic declaration that the result of\nscientific investigation of the truth is, not the subversion of\nthe faith, but 'the restoration of that sum of absolute doctrine\nwhich thought at first would have put behind and beneath itself--a\nrestoration of it however in the most characteristic and the freest\nelement of the mind.' Any opposition that may be raised against\nphilosophy on religious grounds proceeds, according to Hegel, from a\nreligion which has abandoned its true basis and entrenched itself in\nformulae and categories that pervert its real nature. 'Yet,' he adds\n(p. vii), 'especially where religious subjects are under discussion,\nphilosophy is expressly set aside, as if in that way all mischief were\nbanished and security against error and illusion attained;' ... 'as if\nphilosophy--the mischief thus kept at a distance--were anything but\nthe investigation of Truth, but with a full sense of the nature and\nvalue of the intellectual links which give unity and form to all fact\nwhatever.' 'Lessing,' he continues (p. xvi), 'said in his time that\npeople treat Spinoza like a dead dog[11]. It cannot be said that in\nrecent times Spinozism and speculative philosophy in general have been\nbetter treated.'\nThe time was one of feverish unrest and unwholesome irritability. Ever\nsince the so-called Carlsbad decrees of 1819 all the agencies of the\nhigher literature and education had been subjected to an inquisitorial\nsupervision which everywhere surmised political insubordination and\nreligious heresy. A petty provincialism pervaded what was then still\nthe small Residenz-Stadt Berlin; and the King, Frederick William\nIII, cherished to the full that paternal conception of his position\nwhich has not been unusual in the royal house of Prussia. Champions\nof orthodoxy warned him that Hegelianism was unchristian, if not even\nanti-christian. Franz von Baader, the Bavarian religious philosopher\n(who had spent some months at Berlin during the winter of 1823-4,\nstudying the religious and philosophical teaching of the universities\nin connexion with the revolutionary doctrines which he saw fermenting\nthroughout Europe), addressed the king in a communication which\ndescribed the prevalent Protestant theology as infidel in its very\nsource, and as tending directly to annihilate the foundations of\nthe faith. Hegel himself had to remind the censor of heresy that\n'all speculative philosophy on religion maybe carried to atheism:\nall depends on who carries it; the peculiar piety of our times and\nthe malevolence of demagogues will not let us want carriers[12].'\nHis own theology was suspected both by the Rationalists and by the\nEvangelicals. He writes to his wife (in 1827) that he had looked at\nthe university buildings in Louvain and Li\u00e8ge with the feeling that\nthey might one day afford him a resting-place 'when the parsons in\nBerlin make the Kupfergraben completely intolerable for him[13].' 'The\nRoman Curia,' he adds, 'would be a more honourable opponent than the\nmiserable cabals of a miserable boiling of parsons in Berlin.' Hence\nthe tone in which the preface proceeds (p. xviii).\n'Religion is the kind and mode of consciousness in which the Truth\nappeals to all men, to men of every degree of education; but the\nscientific ascertainment of the Truth is a special kind of this\nconsciousness, involving a labour which not all but only a few\nundertake. The substance of the two is the same; but as Homer says of\nsome stars that they have two names, the one in the language of the\ngods, the other in the language of ephemeral men--so for that substance\nthere are two languages,--the one of feeling, of pictorial thought,\nand of the limited intellect that makes its home in finite categories\nand inadequate abstractions, the other the language of the concrete\nnotion. If we propose then to talk of and to criticise philosophy from\nthe religious point of view, there is more requisite than to possess\na familiarity with the language of the ephemeral consciousness. The\nfoundation of scientific cognition is the substantiality at its core,\nthe indwelling idea with its stirring intellectual life; just as the\nessentials of religion are a heart fully disciplined, a mind awake to\nself-collectedness, a wrought and refined substantiality. In modern\ntimes religion has more and more contracted the intelligent expansion\nof its contents and withdrawn into the intensiveness of piety, or even\nof feeling,--a feeling which betrays its own scantiness and emptiness.\nSo long however as it still has a creed, a doctrine, a system of dogma,\nit has what philosophy can occupy itself with and where it can find for\nitself a point of union with religion. This however is not to be taken\nin the wrong separatist sense (so dominant in our modern religiosity)\nrepresenting the two as mutually exclusive, or as at bottom so capable\nof separation that their union is only imposed from without. Rather,\neven in what has gone before, it is implied that religion may well\nexist without philosophy, but philosophy not without religion--which\nit rather includes. True religion--intellectual and spiritual\nreligion--must have body and substance, for spirit and intellect are\nabove all consciousness, and consciousness implies an _objective_ body\nand substance.\n'The contracted religiosity which narrows itself to a point in the\nheart must make that heart's softening and contrition the essential\nfactor of its new birth; but it must at the same time recollect that it\nhas to do with the heart of a spirit, that the spirit is the appointed\nauthority over the heart, and that it can only have such authority so\nfar as it is itself born again. This new birth of the spirit out of\nnatural ignorance and natural error takes place through instruction and\nthrough that faith in objective truth and substance which is due to the\nwitness of the spirit. This new birth of the spirit is besides _ipso\nfacto_ a new birth of the heart out of that vanity of the one-sided\nintellect (on which it sets so much) and its discoveries that finite is\ndifferent from infinite, that philosophy must either be polytheism, or,\nin acuter minds, pantheism, &c. It is, in short, a new birth out of the\nwretched discoveries on the strength of which pious humility holds its\nhead so high against philosophy and theological science. If religiosity\npersists in clinging to its unexpanded and therefore unintelligent\nintensity, then it can be sensible only of the contrast which divides\nthis narrow and narrowing form from the intelligent expansion of\ndoctrine as such, religious not less than philosophical.'\nAfter an appreciative quotation from Franz von Baader, and noting his\nreference to the theosophy of B\u00f6hme, as a work of the past from which\nthe present generation might learn the speculative interpretation of\nChristian doctrines, he reverts to the position that the only mode in\nwhich thought will admit a reconciliation with religious doctrines, is\nwhen these doctrines have learned to 'assume their worthiest phase--the\nphase of the notion, of necessity, which binds, and thus also makes\nfree everything, fact no less than thought.' But it is not from B\u00f6hme\nor his kindred that we are likely to get the example of a philosophy\nequal to the highest theme--to the comprehension of divine things. 'If\nold things are to be revived--an old phase, that is; for the burden\nof the theme is ever young--the phase of the Idea such as Plato and,\nstill better, as Aristotle conceived it, is far more deserving of being\nrecalled,--and for the further reason that the disclosure of it, by\nassimilating it into our system of ideas, is, _ipso facto,_ not merely\nan interpretation of it, but a progress of the science itself. But\nto interpret such forms of the Idea by no means lies so much on the\nsurface as to get hold of Gnostic and Cabbalistic phantasmagorias; and\nto develope Plato and Aristotle is by no means the sinecure that it is\nto note or to hint at echoes of the Idea in the medievalists.'\nThe third edition of the _Encyclopaedia,_ which appeared in 1830,\nconsists of pp. lviii, 600--a slight additional increase. The increase\nis in the Logic, eight pages; in the Philosophy of Nature, twenty-three\npages; and in the Philosophy of Spirit, thirty-four pages. The concrete\ntopics, in short, gain most.\nThe preface begins by alluding to several criticisms on his\nphilosophy,--'which for the most part have shown little vocation for\nthe business'--and to his discussion of them in the _Jahrb\u00fccher_ of\n1829 (_Vermischte Schriften,_ ii. 149). There is also a paragraph\ndevoted to the quarrel originated by the attack in Hengstenberg's\nEvangelical Journal on the rationalism of certain professors at Halle\n(notably Gesenius and Wegscheider),--(an attack based on the evidence\nof students' note-books), and by the protest of students and professors\nagainst the insinuations. 'It seemed a little while ago,' says Hegel\n(p. xli), 'as if there was an initiation, in a scientific spirit\nand on a wider range, of a more serious inquiry, from the region of\ntheology and even of religiosity, touching God, divine things, and\nreason. But the very beginning of the movement checked these hopes;\nthe issue turned on personalities, and neither the pretensions of the\naccusing pietists nor the pretensions of the free reason they accused,\nrose to the real subject, still less to a sense that the subject\ncould only be discussed on philosophic soil. This personal attack, on\nthe basis of very special externalities of religion, displayed the\nmonstrous assumption of seeking to decide by arbitrary decree as to\nthe Christianity of individuals, and to stamp them accordingly with\nthe seal of temporal and eternal reprobation. Dante, in virtue of the\nenthusiasm of divine poesy, has dared to handle the keys of Peter, and\nto condemn by name to the perdition of hell many--already deceased\nhowever--of his contemporaries, even Popes and Emperors. A modern\nphilosophy has been made the subject of the infamous charge that in\nit human individuals usurp the rank of God; but such a fictitious\ncharge--reached by a false logic--pales before the actual assumption\nof behaving like judges of the world, prejudging the Christianity of\nindividuals, and announcing their utter reprobation. The Shibboleth\nof this absolute authority is the name of the Lord Christ, and the\nassertion that the Lord dwells in the hearts of these judges.' But the\nassertion is ill supported by the fruits they exhibit,--the monstrous\ninsolence with which they reprobate and condemn.\nBut the evangelicals are not alone to blame for the bald and\nundeveloped nature of their religious life; the same want of free and\nliving growth in religion characterises their opponents. 'By their\nformal, abstract, nerveless reasoning, the rationalists have emptied\nreligion of all power and substance, no less than the pietists by the\nreduction of all faith to the Shibboleth of Lord! Lord! One is no\nwhit better than the other: and when they meet in conflict there is\nno material on which they could come into contact, no common ground,\nand no possibility of carrying on an inquiry which would lead to\nknowledge and truth. \"Liberal\" theology on its side has not got beyond\nthe formalism of appeals to liberty of conscience, liberty of thought,\nliberty of teaching, to reason itself and to science. Such liberty no\ndoubt describes the _infinite right_ of the spirit, and the second\nspecial condition of truth, supplementary to the first, faith. But\nthe rationalists steer clear of the material point: they do not tell\nus the reasonable principles and laws involved in a free and genuine\nconscience, nor the import and teaching of free faith and free thought;\nthey do not get beyond a bare negative formalism and the liberty to\nembody their liberty at their fancy and pleasure--whereby in the end\nit matters not how it is embodied. There is a further reason for\ntheir failure to reach a solid doctrine. The Christian community must\nbe, and ought always to be, unified by the tie of a doctrinal idea,\na confession of faith; but the generalities and abstractions of the\nstale, not living, waters of rationalism forbid the specificality of\nan inherently definite and fully developed body of Christian doctrine.\nTheir opponents, again, proud of the name Lord! Lord! frankly and\nopenly disdain carrying out the faith into the fulness of spirit,\nreality, and truth.'\nIn ordinary moods of mind there is a long way from logic to religion.\nBut almost every page of what Hegel has called Logic is witness to\nthe belief in their ultimate identity. It was no new principle of\nlater years for him. He had written in post-student days to his\nfriend Schelling: 'Reason and freedom remain our watch-word, and our\npoint of union the invisible church[14].' His parting token of faith\nwith another youthful comrade, the poet H\u00f6lderlin, had been 'God's\nkingdom[15].'\nBut after 1827 this religious appropriation of philosophy becomes\nmore apparent, and in 1829 Hegel seemed deliberately to accept the\nposition of a Christian philosopher which G\u00f6schel had marked out for\nhim. 'A philosophy without heart and a faith without intellect,' he\nremarks[16], 'are abstractions from the true life of knowledge and\nfaith. The man whom philosophy leaves cold, and the man whom real faith\ndoes not illuminate may be assured that the fault lies in them, not in\nknowledge and faith. The former is still an alien to philosophy, the\nlatter an alien to faith.'\nThis is not the place--in a philological chapter--to discuss the issues\ninvolved in the announcement that the truth awaits us ready to hand[17]\n'in all genuine consciousness, in all religions and philosophies.'\nYet one remark may be offered against hasty interpretations of a\n'speculative' identity. If there is a double edge to the proposition\nthat the actual is the reasonable, there is no less caution necessary\nin approaching and studying from both sides the far-reaching import\nof that equation to which Joannes Scotus Erigena gave expression ten\ncenturies ago: '_Non alia est philosophia, i.e. sapientiae studium,\net alia religio.

W. F. HEGEL\nTHE SCIENCE OF LOGIC\nCHAPTER I.\nINTRODUCTION.\n1.] PHILOSOPHY misses an advantage enjoyed by the other sciences. It\ncannot like them rest the existence of its objects on the natural\nadmissions of consciousness, nor can it assume that its method of\ncognition, either for starting or for continuing, is one already\naccepted. The objects of philosophy, it is true, are upon the whole the\nsame as those of religion. In both the object is Truth, in that supreme\nsense in which God and God only is the Truth. Both in like manner go on\nto treat of the finite worlds of Nature and the human Mind, with their\nrelation to each other and to their truth in God. Some _acquaintance_\nwith its objects, therefore, philosophy may and even must presume, that\nand a certain interest in them to boot, were it for no other reason\nthan this: that in point of time the mind makes general _images_ of\nobjects, long before it makes _notions_ of them, and that it is only\nthrough these mental images, and by recourse to them, that the thinking\nmind rises to know and comprehend _thinkingly._\nBut with the rise of this thinking study of things, it soon becomes\nevident that thought will be satisfied with nothing short of showing\nthe _necessity_ of its facts, of demonstrating the existence of\nits objects, as well as their nature and qualities. Our original\nacquaintance with them is thus discovered to be inadequate. We can\nassume nothing, and assert nothing dogmatically; nor can we accept the\nassertions and assumptions of others. And yet we must make a beginning:\nand a beginning, as primary and underived, makes an assumption, or\nrather is an assumption. It seems as if it were impossible to make a\nbeginning at all.\n2.] This _thinking study of things_ may serve, in a general way, as\na description of philosophy. But the description is too wide. If it\nbe correct to say, that thought makes the distinction between man and\nthe lower animals, then everything human is human, for the sole and\nsimple reason that it is due to the operation of thought. Philosophy,\non the other hand, is a peculiar mode of thinking--a mode in which\nthinking becomes knowledge, and knowledge through notions. However\ngreat therefore may be the identity and essential unity of the two\nmodes of thought, the philosophic mode gets to be different from the\nmore general thought which acts in all that is human, in all that gives\nhumanity its distinctive character. And this difference connects itself\nwith the fact that the strictly human and thought-induced phenomena of\nconsciousness do not originally appear in the form of a thought, but as\na feeling, a perception, or mental image--all of which aspects must be\ndistinguished from the form of thought proper.\nAccording to an old preconceived idea, which has passed into a trivial\nproposition, it is thought which marks the man off from the animals.\nYet trivial as this old belief may seem, it must, strangely enough,\nbe recalled to mind in presence of certain preconceived ideas of the\npresent day. These ideas would put feeling and thought so far apart as\nto make them opposites, and would represent them as so antagonistic,\nthat feeling, particularly religious feeling, is supposed to be\ncontaminated, perverted, and even annihilated by thought. They also\nemphatically hold that religion and piety grow out of, and rest upon\nsomething else, and not on thought. But those who make this separation\nforget meanwhile that only man has the capacity for religion, and that\nanimals no more have religion than they have law and morality.\nThose who insist on this separation of religion from thinking usually\nhave before their minds the sort of thought that may be styled\n_after-thought._ They mean 'reflective' thinking, which has to deal\nwith thoughts as thoughts, and brings them into consciousness.\nSlackness to perceive and keep in view this distinction which\nphilosophy definitely draws in respect of thinking is the source of\nthe crudest objections and reproaches against philosophy. Man,--and\nthat just because it is his nature to think,--is the only being that\npossesses law, religion, and morality. In these spheres of human life,\ntherefore, thinking, under the guise of feeling, faith, or generalised\nimage, has not been inactive: its action and its productions are\nthere present and therein contained. But it is one thing to have such\nfeelings and generalised images that have been moulded and permeated by\nthought, and another thing to have thoughts about them. The thoughts,\nto which after-thought upon those modes of consciousness gives rise,\nare what is comprised under reflection, general reasoning, and the\nlike, as well as under philosophy itself.\nThe neglect of this distinction between thought in general and the\nreflective thought of philosophy has also led to another and more\nfrequent misunderstanding. Reflection of this kind has been often\nmaintained to be the condition, or even the only way, of attaining a\nconsciousness and certitude of the Eternal and True. The (now somewhat\nantiquated) metaphysical proofs of God's existence, for example, have\nbeen treated, as if a knowledge of them and a conviction of their truth\nwere the only and essential means of producing a belief and conviction\nthat there is a God. Such a doctrine would find its parallel, if we\nsaid that eating was impossible before we had acquired a knowledge\nof the chemical, botanical, and zoological characters of our food;\nand that we must delay digestion till we had finished the study of\nanatomy and physiology. Were it so, these sciences in their field,\nlike philosophy in its, would gain greatly in point of utility; in\nfact, their utility would rise to the height of absolute and universal\nindispensableness. Or rather, instead of being indispensable, they\nwould not exist at all.\n3.] The _Content,_ of whatever kind it be, with which our consciousness\nis taken up, is what constitutes the qualitative character of our\nfeelings, perceptions, fancies, and ideas; of our aims and duties;\nand of our thoughts and notions. From this point of view, feeling,\nperception, &c. are the _forms_ assumed by these contents. The contents\nremain one and the same, whether they are felt, seen, represented, or\nwilled, and whether they are merely felt, or felt with an admixture of\nthoughts, or merely and simply thought. In any one of these forms, or\nin the admixture of several, the contents confront consciousness, or\nare its _object._ But when they are thus objects of consciousness, the\nmodes of the several forms ally themselves with the contents; and each\nform of them appears in consequence to give rise to a special object.\nThus what is the same at bottom, may look like a different sort of\nfact.\nThe several modes of feeling, perception, desire, and will, so far\nas we are _aware_ of them, are in general called ideas (mental\nrepresentations): and it may be roughly said, that philosophy puts\nthoughts, categories, or, in more precise language, adequate _notions,_\nin the place of the generalised images we ordinarily call ideas. Mental\nimpressions such as these may be regarded as the metaphors of thoughts\nand notions. But to have these figurate conceptions does not imply\nthat we appreciate their intellectual significance, the thoughts and\nrational notions to which they correspond. Conversely, it is one thing\nto have thoughts and intelligent notions, and another to know what\nimpressions, perceptions, and feelings correspond to them.\nThis difference will to some extent explain what people call the\nunintelligibility of philosophy. Their difficulty lies partly in an\nincapacity--which in itself is nothing but want of habit--for abstract\nthinking; _i.e._ in an inability to get hold of pure thoughts and move\nabout in them. In our ordinary state of mind, the thoughts are clothed\nupon and made one with the sensuous or spiritual material of the hour;\nand in reflection, meditation, and general reasoning, we introduce a\nblend of thoughts into feelings, percepts, and mental images. (Thus,\nin propositions where the subject-matter is due to the senses--_e.g._\n'This leaf is green'--we have such categories introduced, as being and\nindividuality.) But it is a very different thing to make the thoughts\npure and simple our object.\nBut their complaint that philosophy is unintelligible is as much due to\nanother reason; and that is an impatient wish to have before them as a\nmental picture that which is in the mind as a thought or notion. When\npeople are asked to apprehend some notion, they often complain that\nthey do not know what they have to think. But the fact is that in a\nnotion there is nothing further to be thought than the notion itself.\nWhat the phrase reveals, is a hankering after an image with which we\nare already familiar. The mind, denied the use of its familiar ideas,\nfeels the ground where it once stood firm and at home taken away from\nbeneath it, and, when transported into the region of pure thought,\ncannot tell where in the world it is.\nOne consequence of this weakness is that authors, preachers, and\norators are found most intelligible, when they speak of things which\ntheir readers or hearers already know by rote,--things which the latter\nare conversant with, and which require no explanation.\n4.] The philosopher then has to reckon with popular modes of thought,\nand with the objects of religion. In dealing with the ordinary modes\nof mind, he will first of all, as we saw, have to prove and almost\nto awaken the need for his peculiar method of knowledge. In dealing\nwith the objects of religion, and with truth as a whole, he will have\nto show that philosophy is capable of apprehending them from its own\nresources; and should a difference from religious conceptions come to\nlight, he will have to justify the points in which it diverges.\n5.] To give the reader a preliminary explanation of the distinction\nthus made, and to let him see at the same moment that the real import\nof our consciousness is retained, and even for the first time put\nin its proper light, when translated into the form of thought and\nthe notion of reason, it may be well to recall another of these old\nunreasoned beliefs. And that is the conviction that to get at the truth\nof any object or event, even of feelings, perceptions, opinions, and\nmental ideas, we must think it over. Now in any case to think things\nover is at least to transform feelings, ordinary ideas, &c. into\nthoughts.\nNature has given every one a faculty of thought. But thought is all\nthat philosophy claims as the form proper to her business: and thus\nthe inadequate view which ignores the distinction stated in \u00a7 3, leads\nto a new delusion, the reverse of the complaint previously mentioned\nabout the unintelligibility of philosophy. In other words, this science\nmust often submit to the slight of hearing even people who have never\ntaken any trouble with it talking as if they thoroughly understood all\nabout it. With no preparation beyond an ordinary education they do\nnot hesitate, especially under the influence of religious sentiment,\nto philosophise and to criticise philosophy. Everybody allows that\nto know any other science you must have first studied it, and that\nyou can only claim to express a judgment upon it in virtue of such\nknowledge. Everybody allows that to make a shoe you must have learned\nand practised the craft of the shoemaker, though every man has a model\nin his own foot, and possesses in his hands the natural endowments for\nthe operations required. For philosophy alone, it seems to be imagined,\nsuch study, care, and application are not in the least requisite.\nThis comfortable view of what is required for a philosopher has\nrecently received corroboration through the theory of immediate or\nintuitive knowledge.\n6.] So much for the form of philosophical knowledge. It is no less\ndesirable, on the other hand, that philosophy should understand that\nits content is no other than _actuality,_ that core of truth which,\noriginally produced and producing itself within the precincts of the\nmental life, has become the _world,_ the inward and outward world, of\nconsciousness. At first we become aware of these contents in what we\ncall Experience. But even Experience, as it surveys the wide range\nof inward and outward existence, has sense enough to distinguish\nthe mere appearance, which is transient and meaningless, from what\nin itself really deserves the name of actuality. As it is only in\nform that philosophy is distinguished from other modes of attaining\nan acquaintance with this same sum of being, it must necessarily be\nin harmony with actuality and experience. In fact, this harmony may\nbe viewed as at least an extrinsic means of testing the truth of a\nphilosophy. Similarly it may be held the highest and final aim of\nphilosophic science to bring about, through the ascertainment of this\nharmony, a reconciliation of the self-conscious reason with the reason\nwhich _is_ in the world,--in other words, with actuality.\nIn the preface to my Philosophy of Law, p. xix, are found the\npropositions:\nWhat is reasonable is actual;\nand, What is actual is reasonable.\nThese simple statements have given rise to expressions of surprise and\nhostility, even in quarters where it would be reckoned an insult to\npresume absence of philosophy, and still more of religion. Religion\nat least need not be brought in evidence; its doctrines of the divine\ngovernment of the world affirm these propositions too decidedly. For\ntheir philosophic sense, we must pre-suppose intelligence enough to\nknow, not only that God is actual, that He is the supreme actuality,\nthat He alone is truly actual; but also, as regards the logical\nbearings of the question, that existence is in part mere appearance,\nand only in part actuality. In common life, any freak of fancy, any\nerror, evil and everything of the nature of evil, as well as every\ndegenerate and transitory existence whatever, gets in a casual way\nthe name of actuality. But even our ordinary feelings are enough to\nforbid a casual (fortuitous) existence getting the emphatic name of an\nactual; for by fortuitous we mean an existence which has no greater\nvalue than that of something possible, which may as well not be as\nbe. As for the term Actuality, these critics would have done well to\nconsider the sense in which I employ it. In a detailed Logic I had\ntreated amongst other things of actuality, and accurately distinguished\nit not only from the fortuitous, which, after all, has existence,\nbut even from the cognate categories of existence and the other\nmodifications of being.\nThe actuality of the rational stands opposed by the popular fancy\nthat Ideas and ideals are nothing but chimeras, and philosophy a mere\nsystem of such phantasms. It is also opposed by the very different\nfancy that Ideas and ideals are something far too excellent to have\nactuality, or something too impotent to procure it for themselves. This\ndivorce between idea and reality is especially dear to the analytic\nunderstanding which looks upon its own abstractions, dreams though they\nare, as something true and real, and prides itself on the imperative\n'ought,' which it takes especial pleasure in prescribing even on the\nfield of politics. As if the world had waited on it to learn how it\nought to be, and was not! For, if it were as it ought to be, what would\ncome of the precocious wisdom of that 'ought'? When understanding\nturns this 'ought' against trivial external and transitory objects,\nagainst social regulations or conditions, which very likely possess a\ngreat relative importance for a certain time and special circles, it\nmay often be right. In such a case the intelligent observer may meet\nmuch that fails to satisfy the general requirements of right; for\nwho is not acute enough to see a great deal in his own surroundings\nwhich is really far from being as it ought to be? But such acuteness\nis mistaken in the conceit that, when it examines these objects and\npronounces what they ought to be, it is dealing with questions of\nphilosophic science. The object of philosophy is the Idea: and the Idea\nis not so impotent as merely to have a right or an obligation to exist\nwithout actually existing. The object of philosophy is an actuality of\nwhich those objects, social regulations and conditions, are only the\nsuperficial outside.\n7.] Thus reflection--thinking things over--in a general way involves\nthe principle (which also means the beginning) of philosophy. And when\nthe reflective spirit arose again in its independence in modern times,\nafter the epoch of the Lutheran Reformation, it did not, as in its\nbeginnings among the Greeks, stand merely aloof, in a world of its own,\nbut at once turned its energies also upon the apparently illimitable\nmaterial of the phenomenal world. In this way the name philosophy came\nto be applied to all those branches of knowledge, which are engaged\nin ascertaining the standard and Universal in the ocean of empirical\nindividualities, as well as in ascertaining the Necessary element, or\nLaws, to be found in the apparent disorder of the endless masses of\nthe fortuitous. It thus appears that modern philosophy derives its\nmaterials from our own personal observations and perceptions of the\nexternal and internal world, from nature as well as from the mind and\nheart of man, when both stand in the immediate presence of the observer.\nThis principle of Experience carries with it the unspeakably important\ncondition that, in order to accept and believe any fact, we must be\nin contact with it; or, in more exact terms, that we must find the\nfact united and combined with the certainty of our own selves. We must\nbe in touch with our subject-matter, whether it be by means of our\nexternal senses, or, else, by our profounder mind and our intimate\nself-consciousness.--This principle is the same as that which has in\nthe present day been termed faith, immediate knowledge, the revelation\nin the outward world, and, above all, in our own heart.\nThose sciences, which thus got the name of philosophy, we call\n_empirical_ sciences, for the reason that they take their departure\nfrom experience. Still the essential results which they aim at and\nprovide, are laws, general propositions, a theory--the thoughts of what\nis found existing. On this ground the Newtonian physics was called\nNatural Philosophy. Hugo Grotius, again, by putting together and\ncomparing the behaviour of states towards each other as recorded in\nhistory, succeeded, with the help of the ordinary methods of general\nreasoning, in laying down certain general principles, and establishing\na theory which may be termed the Philosophy of International Law. In\nEngland this is still the usual signification of the term philosophy.\nNewton continues to be celebrated as the greatest of philosophers: and\nthe name goes down as far as the price-lists of instrument-makers.\nAll instruments, such as the thermometer and barometer, which do not\ncome under the special head of magnetic or electric apparatus, are\nstyled philosophical instruments[1]. Surely thought, and not a mere\ncombination of wood, iron, &c. ought to be called the instrument of\nphilosophy! The recent science of Political Economy in particular,\nwhich in Germany is known as Rational Economy of the State, or\nintelligent national economy, has in England especially appropriated\nthe name of philosophy.[2]\n8.] In its own field this empirical knowledge may at first give\nsatisfaction; but in two ways it is seen to come short. In the first\nplace there is another circle of objects which it does not embrace.\nThese are Freedom, Spirit, and God. They belong to a different\nsphere, not because it can be said that they have nothing to do with\nexperience; for though they are certainly not experiences of the\nsenses, it is quite an identical proposition to say that whatever is\nin consciousness is experienced. The real ground for assigning them to\nanother field of cognition is that in their scope and _content_ these\nobjects evidently show themselves as infinite.\nThere is an old phrase often wrongly attributed to Aristotle, and\nsupposed to express the general tenor of his philosophy. '_Nihil\nest in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu_': there is nothing in\nthought which has not been in sense and experience. If speculative\nphilosophy refused to admit this maxim, it can only have done so from\na misunderstanding. It will, however, on the converse side no less\nassert: '_Nihil est in sensu quod non fuerit in intellectu._' And this\nmay be taken in two senses. In the general sense it means that \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 or\nspirit (the more profound idea of \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 in modern thought) is the cause\nof the world. In its special meaning (see \u00a7 2) it asserts that the\nsentiment of right, morals, and religion is a sentiment (and in that\nway an experience) of such scope and such character that it can spring\nfrom and rest upon thought alone.\n9.] But in the second place in point of _form_ the subjective reason\ndesires a further satisfaction than empirical knowledge gives; and\nthis form, is, in the widest sense of the term, Necessity (\u00a7 1). The\nmethod of empirical science exhibits two defects. The first is that the\nUniversal or general principle contained in it, the genus, or kind, &c,\nis, on its own account, indeterminate and vague, and therefore not on\nits own account connected with the Particulars or the details. Either\nis external and accidental to the other; and it is the same with the\nparticular facts which are brought into union: each is external and\naccidental to the others. The second defect is that the beginnings are\nin every case data and postulates, neither accounted for nor deduced.\nIn both these points the form of necessity fails to get its due. Hence\nreflection, whenever it sets itself to remedy these defects, becomes\nspeculative thinking, the thinking proper to philosophy. As a species\nof reflection, therefore, which, though it has a certain community\nof nature with the reflection already mentioned, is nevertheless\ndifferent from it, philosophic thought thus possesses, in addition to\nthe common forms, some forms of its own, of which the Notion may be\ntaken as the type.\nThe relation of speculative science to the other sciences may be\nstated in the following terms. It does not in the least neglect the\nempirical facts contained in the several sciences, but recognises and\nadopts them: it appreciates and applies towards its own structure the\nuniversal element in these sciences, their laws and classifications:\nbut besides all this, into the categories of science it introduces, and\ngives currency to, other categories. The difference, looked at in this\nway, is only a change of categories. Speculative Logic contains all\nprevious Logic and Metaphysics: it preserves the same forms of thought,\nthe same laws and objects,--while at the same time remodelling and\nexpanding them with wider categories.\nFrom _notion_ in the speculative sense we should distinguish what\nis ordinarily called a notion. The phrase, that no notion can ever\ncomprehend the Infinite, a phrase which has been repeated over and over\nagain till it has grown axiomatic, is based upon this narrow estimate\nof what is meant by notions.\n10.] This thought, which is proposed as the instrument of philosophic\nknowledge, itself calls for further explanation. We must understand in\nwhat way it possesses necessity or cogency: and when it claims to be\nequal to the task of apprehending the absolute objects (God, Spirit,\nFreedom), that claim must be substantiated. Such an explanation,\nhowever, is itself a lesson in philosophy, and properly falls within\nthe scope of the science itself. A preliminary attempt to make matters\nplain would only be unphilosophical, and consist of a tissue of\nassumptions, assertions, and inferential pros and cons, _e.g._ of\ndogmatism without cogency, as against which there would be an equal\nright of counter-dogmatism.\nA main line of argument in the Critical Philosophy bids us pause before\nproceeding to inquire into God or into the true being of things, and\ntells us first of all to examine the faculty of cognition and see\nwhether it is equal to such an effort. We ought, says Kant, to become\nacquainted with the instrument, before we undertake the work for which\nit is to be employed; for if the instrument be insufficient, all our\ntrouble will be spent in vain. The plausibility of this suggestion has\nwon for it general assent and admiration; the result of which has been\nto withdraw cognition from an interest in its objects and absorption in\nthe study of them, and to direct it back upon itself; and so turn it to\na question of form. Unless we wish to be deceived bywords, it is easy\nto see what this amounts to. In the case of other instruments, we can\ntry and criticise them in other ways than by setting about the special\nwork for which they are destined. But the examination of knowledge can\nonly be carried out by an act of knowledge. To examine this so-called\ninstrument is the same thing as to know it. But to seek to know before\nwe know is as absurd as the wise resolution of Scholasticus, not to\nventure into the water until he had learned to swim.\nReinhold saw the confusion with which this style of commencement is\nchargeable, and tried to get out of the difficulty by starting with a\nhypothetical and problematical stage of philosophising. In this way he\nsupposed that it would be possible, nobody can tell how, to get along,\nuntil we found ourselves, further on, arrived at the primary truth\nof truths. His method, when closely looked into, will be seen to be\nidentical with a very common practice. It starts from a substratum\nof experiential fact, or from a provisional assumption which has\nbeen brought into a definition; and then proceeds to analyse this\nstarting-point. We can detect in Reinhold's argument a perception of\nthe truth, that the usual course which proceeds by assumptions and\nanticipations is no better than a hypothetical and problematical mode\nof procedure. But his perceiving this does not alter the character of\nthis method; it only makes clear its imperfections.\n11.] The special conditions which call for the existence of philosophy\nmaybe thus described. The mind or spirit, when it is sentient or\nperceptive, finds its object in something sensuous; when it imagines,\nin a picture or image; when it wills, in an aim or end. But in contrast\nto, or it may be only in distinction from, these forms of its existence\nand of its objects, the mind has also to gratify the cravings of\nits highest and most inward life. That innermost self is thought.\nThus the mind renders thought its object. In the best meaning of the\nphrase, it comes to itself; for thought is its principle, and its\nvery unadulterated self. But while thus occupied, thought entangles\nitself in contradictions, _e.g._ loses itself in the hard-and-fast\nnon-identity of its thoughts, and so, instead of reaching itself,\nis caught and held in its counterpart. This result, to which honest\nbut narrow thinking leads the mere understanding, is resisted by the\nloftier craving of which we have spoken. That craving expresses the\nperseverance of thought, which continues true to itself, even in this\nconscious loss of its native rest and independence, 'that it may\novercome' and work out in itself the solution of its own contradictions.\nTo see that thought in its very nature is dialectical, and that, as\nunderstanding, it must fall into contradiction,--the negative of\nitself, will form one of the main lessons of logic. When thought\ngrows hopeless of ever achieving, by its own means, the solution of\nthe contradiction which it has by its own action brought upon itself,\nit turns back to those solutions of the question with which the mind\nhad learned to pacify itself in some of its other modes and forms.\nUnfortunately, however, the retreat of thought has led it, as Plato\nnoticed even in his time, to a very uncalled-for hatred of reason\n(misology); and it then takes up against its own endeavours that\nhostile attitude of which an example is seen in the doctrine that\n'immediate' knowledge, as it is called, is the exclusive form in which\nwe become cognisant of truth.\n12.] The rise of philosophy is due to these cravings of thought. Its\npoint of departure is Experience; including under that name both our\nimmediate consciousness and the inductions from it. Awakened, as it\nwere, by this stimulus, thought is vitally characterised by raising\nitself above the natural state of mind, above the senses and inferences\nfrom the senses into its own unadulterated element, and by assuming,\naccordingly, at first a stand-aloof and negative attitude towards\nthe point from which it started. Through this state of antagonism to\nthe phenomena of sense its first satisfaction is found in itself, in\nthe Idea of the universal essence of these phenomena: an Idea (the\nAbsolute, or God) which may be more or less abstract. Meanwhile, on\nthe other hand, the sciences, based on experience, exert upon the\nmind a stimulus to overcome the form in which their varied contents\nare presented, and to elevate these contents to the rank of necessary\ntruth. For the facts of science have the aspect of a vast conglomerate,\none thing coming side by side with another, as if they were merely\ngiven and presented,--as in short devoid of all essential or necessary\nconnexion. In consequence of this stimulus thought is dragged out\nof its unrealised universality and its fancied or merely possible\nsatisfaction, and impelled onwards to a development from itself. On\none hand this development only means that thought incorporates the\ncontents of science, in all their speciality of detail as submitted. On\nthe other it makes these contents imitate the action of the original\ncreative thought, and present the aspect of a free evolution determined\nby the logic of the fact alone.\nOn the relation between 'immediacy' and 'mediation' in consciousness\nwe shall speak later, expressly and with more detail. Here it may be\nsufficient to premise that, though the two 'moments' or factors present\nthemselves as distinct, still neither of them can be absent, nor can\none exist apart from the other. Thus the knowledge of God, as of every\nsupersensible reality, is in its true character an exaltation above\nsensations or perceptions: it consequently involves a negative attitude\nto the initial data of sense, and to that extent implies mediation.\nFor to mediate is to take something as a beginning and to go onward to\na second thing; so that the existence of this second thing depends on\nour having reached it from something else contradistinguished from it.\nIn spite of this, the knowledge of God is no mere sequel, dependent\non the empirical phase of consciousness: in fact, its independence is\nessentially secured through this negation and exaltation.--No doubt, if\nwe attach an unfair prominence to the fact of mediation, and represent\nit as implying a state of conditionedness, it may be said--not that the\nremark would mean much--that philosophy is the child of experience, and\nowes its rise to _a posteriori_ fact. (As a matter of fact, thinking\nis always the negation of what we have immediately before us.) With\nas much truth however we may be said to owe eating to the means of\nnourishment, so long as we can have no eating without them. If we take\nthis view, eating is certainly represented as ungrateful: it devours\nthat to which it owes itself. Thinking, upon this view of its action,\nis equally ungrateful.\nBut there is also an _a priori_ aspect of thought, where by a\nmediation, not made by anything external but by a reflection into self,\nwe have that immediacy which is universality, the self-complacency\nof thought which is so much at home with itself that it feels an\ninnate indifference to descend to particulars, and in that way to the\ndevelopment of its own nature. It is thus also with religion, which,\nwhether it be rude or elaborate, whether it be invested with scientific\nprecision of detail or confined to the simple faith of the heart,\npossesses, throughout, the same intensive nature of contentment and\nfelicity. But if thought never gets further than the universality of\nthe Ideas, as was perforce the case in the first philosophies (when\nthe Eleatics never got beyond Being, or Heraclitus beyond Becoming),\nit is justly open to the charge of formalism. Even in a more advanced\nphase of philosophy, we may often find a doctrine which has mastered\nmerely certain abstract propositions or formulae, such as, 'In the\nabsolute all is one,' 'Subject and object are identical,'--and only\nrepeating the same thing when it comes to particulars. Bearing in\nmind this first period of thought, the period of mere generality, we\nmay safely say that experience is the real author of _growth_ and\n_advance_ in philosophy. For, firstly, the empirical sciences do not\nstop short at the mere observation of the individual features of a\nphenomenon. By the aid of thought, they are able to meet philosophy\nwith materials prepared for it, in the shape of general uniformities,\n_i.e._ laws, and classifications of the phenomena. When this is done,\nthe particular facts which they contain are ready to be received into\nphilosophy. This, secondly, implies a certain compulsion on thought\nitself to proceed to these concrete specific truths. The reception into\nphilosophy of these scientific materials, now that thought has removed\ntheir immediacy and made them cease to be mere data, forms at the same\ntime a development of thought out of itself. Philosophy, then, owes\nits development to the empirical sciences. In return it gives their\ncontents what is so vital to them, the freedom of thought,--gives them,\nin short, an _a priori_ character. These contents are now warranted\nnecessary, and no longer depend on the evidence of facts merely, that\nthey were so found and so experienced. The fact as experienced thus\nbecomes an illustration and a copy of the original and completely\nself-supporting activity of thought.\n13.] Stated in exact terms, such is the origin and development of\nphilosophy. But the History of Philosophy gives us the same process\nfrom an historical and external point of view. The stages in the\nevolution of the Idea there seem to follow each other by accident, and\nto present merely a number of different and unconnected principles,\nwhich the several systems of philosophy carry out in their own way.\nBut it is not so. For these thousands of years the same Architect has\ndirected the work: and that Architect is the one living Mind whose\nnature is to think, to bring to self-consciousness what it is, and,\nwith its being thus set as object before it, to be at the same time\nraised above it, and so to reach a higher stage of its own being.\nThe different systems which the history of philosophy presents are\ntherefore not irreconcilable with unity. We may either say, that it\nis one philosophy at different degrees of maturity: or that the\nparticular principle, which is the groundwork of each system, is\nbut a branch of one and the same universe of thought. In philosophy\nthe latest birth of time is the result of all the systems that have\npreceded it, and must include their principles; and so, if, on other\ngrounds, it deserve the title of philosophy, will be the fullest, most\ncomprehensive, and most adequate system of all.\nThe spectacle of so many and so various systems of philosophy suggests\nthe necessity of defining more exactly the relation of Universal to\nParticular. When the universal is made a mere form and co-ordinated\nwith the particular, as if it were on the same level, it sinks into a\nparticular itself. Even common sense in every-day matters is above the\nabsurdity of setting a universal _beside_ the particulars. Would any\none, who wished for fruit, reject cherries, pears, and grapes, on the\nground that they were cherries, pears, or grapes, and not fruit? But\nwhen philosophy is in question, the excuse of many is that philosophies\nare so different, and none of them is _the_ philosophy,--that each is\nonly _a_ philosophy. Such a plea is assumed to justify any amount of\ncontempt for philosophy. And yet cherries too are fruit. Often, too, a\nsystem, of which the principle is the universal, is put on a level with\nanother of which the principle is a particular, and with theories which\ndeny the existence of philosophy altogether. Such systems are said to\nbe only different views of philosophy. With equal justice, light and\ndarkness might be styled different kinds of light.\n14.] The same evolution of thought which is exhibited in the history\nof philosophy is presented in the System of Philosophy itself. Here,\ninstead of surveying the process, as we do in history, from the\noutside, we see the movement of thought clearly defined in its native\nmedium. The thought, which is genuine and self-supporting, must be\nintrinsically concrete; it must be an Idea; and when it is viewed in\nthe whole of its universality, it is the Idea, or the Absolute. The\nscience of this Idea must form a system. For the truth is concrete;\nthat is, whilst it gives a bond and principle of unity, it also\npossesses an internal source of development. Truth, then, is only\npossible as a universe or totality of thought; and the freedom of the\nwhole, as well as the necessity of the several sub-divisions, which it\nimplies, are only possible when these are discriminated and defined.\nUnless it is a system, a philosophy is not a scientific production.\nUnsystematic philosophising can only be expected to give expression to\npersonal peculiarities of mind, and has no principle for the regulation\nof its contents. Apart from their interdependence and organic union,\nthe truths of philosophy are valueless, and must then be treated as\nbaseless hypotheses, or personal convictions. Yet many philosophical\ntreatises confine themselves to such an exposition of the opinions and\nsentiments of the author.\nThe term _system_ is often misunderstood. It does not denote a\nphilosophy, the principle of which is narrow and to be distinguished\nfrom others. On the contrary, a genuine philosophy makes it a principle\nto include every particular principle.\n15.] Each of the parts of philosophy is a philosophical whole, a circle\nrounded and complete in itself. In each of these parts, however, the\nphilosophical Idea is found in a particular specificality or medium.\nThe single circle, because it is a real totality, bursts through the\nlimits imposed by its special medium, and gives rise to a wider circle.\nThe whole of philosophy in this way resembles a circle of circles. The\nIdea appears in each single circle, but, at the same time, the whole\nIdea is constituted by the system of these peculiar phases, and each is\na necessary member of the organisation.\n16.] In the form of an Encyclopaedia, the science has no room for a\ndetailed exposition of particulars, and must be limited to setting\nforth the commencement of the special sciences and the notions of\ncardinal importance in them.\nHow much of the particular parts is requisite to constitute a\nparticular branch of knowledge is so far indeterminate, that the part,\nif it is to be something true, must be not an isolated member merely,\nbut itself an organic whole. The entire field of philosophy therefore\nreally forms a single science; but it may also be viewed as a total,\ncomposed of several particular sciences.\nThe encyclopaedia of philosophy must not be confounded with ordinary\nencyclopaedias. An ordinary encyclopaedia does not pretend to be more\nthan an aggregation of sciences, regulated by no principle, and merely\nas experience offers them. Sometimes it even includes what merely bear\nthe name of sciences, while they are nothing more than a collection of\nbits of information. In an aggregate like this, the several branches of\nknowledge owe their place in the encyclopaedia to extrinsic reasons,\nand their unity is therefore artificial: they are _arranged,_ but we\ncannot say they form a _system._ For the same reason, especially as the\nmaterials to be combined also depend upon no one rule or principle,\nthe arrangement is at best an experiment, and will always exhibit\ninequalities.\nAn encyclopaedia of philosophy excludes three kinds of partial science.\nI. It excludes mere aggregates of bits of information. Philology in\nits _prima facie_ aspect belongs to this class. II. It rejects the\nquasi-sciences, which are founded on an act of arbitrary will alone,\nsuch as Heraldry. Sciences of this class are positive from beginning to\nend. III. In another class of sciences, also styled positive, but which\nhave a rational basis and a rational beginning, philosophy claims that\nconstituent as its own. The positive features remain the property of\nthe sciences themselves.\nThe positive element in the last class of sciences is of different\nsorts. (I) Their commencement, though rational at bottom, yields to the\ninfluence of fortuitousness, when they have to bring their universal\ntruth into contact with actual facts and the single phenomena of\nexperience. In this region of chance and change, the adequate notion\nof science must yield its place to reasons or grounds of explanation.\nThus, _e.g._ in the science of jurisprudence, or in the system of\ndirect and indirect taxation, it is necessary to have certain points\nprecisely and definitively settled which lie beyond the competence of\nthe absolute lines laid down by the pure notion. A certain latitude\nof settlement accordingly is left: and each point may be determined\nin one way on one principle, in another way on another, and admits of\nno definitive certainty. Similarly the Idea of Nature, when parcelled\nout in detail, is dissipated into contingencies. Natural history,\ngeography, and medicine stumble upon descriptions of existence, upon\nkinds and distinctions, which are not determined by reason, but by\nsport and adventitious incidents. Even history comes under the same\ncategory. The Idea is its essence and inner nature; but, as it appears,\neverything is under contingency and in the field of voluntary action.\n(II) These sciences are positive also in failing to recognise the\nfinite nature of what they predicate, and to point out how these\ncategories and their whole sphere pass into a higher. They assume their\nstatements to possess an authority beyond appeal. Here the fault lies\nin the finitude of the form, as in the previous instance it lay in\nthe matter. (III) In close sequel to this, sciences are positive in\nconsequence of the inadequate grounds on which their conclusions rest:\nbased as these are on detached and casual inference, upon feeling,\nfaith, and authority, and, generally speaking, upon the deliverances\nof inward and outward perception. Under this head we must also class\nthe philosophy which proposes to build upon anthropology,' facts of\nconsciousness, inward sense, or outward experience. It may happen,\nhowever, that empirical is an epithet applicable only to the form of\nscientific exposition; whilst intuitive sagacity has arranged what are\nmere phenomena, according to the essential sequence of the notion. In\nsuch a case the contrasts between the varied and numerous phenomena\nbrought together serve to eliminate the external and accidental\ncircumstances of their conditions, and the universal thus comes clearly\ninto view. Guided by such an intuition, experimental physics will\npresent the rational science of Nature,--as history will present the\nscience of human affairs and actions--in an external picture, which\nmirrors the philosophic notion.\n17.] It may seem as if philosophy, in order to start on its course,\nhad, like the rest of the sciences, to begin with a subjective\npresupposition. The sciences postulate their respective objects, such\nas space, number, or whatever it be; and it might be supposed that\nphilosophy had also to postulate the existence of thought. But the\ntwo cases are not exactly parallel. It is by the free act of thought\nthat it occupies a point of view, in which it is for its own self, and\nthus gives itself an object of its own production. Nor is this all.\nThe very point of view, which originally is taken on its own evidence\nonly, must in the course of the science be converted to a result,--the\nultimate result in which philosophy returns into itself and reaches\nthe point with which it began. In this manner philosophy exhibits the\nappearance of a circle which closes with itself, and has no beginning\nin the same way as the other sciences have. To speak of a beginning of\nphilosophy has a meaning only in relation to a person who proposes to\ncommence the study, and not in relation to the science as science. The\nsame thing may be thus expressed. The notion of science--the notion\ntherefore with which we start--which, for the very reason that it is\ninitial, implies a separation between the thought which is our object,\nand the subject philosophising which is, as it were, external to the\nformer, must be grasped and comprehended by the science itself. This\nis in short the one single aim, action, and goal of philosophy--to\narrive at the notion of its notion, and thus secure its return and its\nsatisfaction.\n18.] As the whole science, and only the whole, can exhibit what the\nIdea or system of reason is, it is impossible to give in a preliminary\nway a general impression of a philosophy. Nor can a division of\nphilosophy into its parts be intelligible, except in connexion with the\nsystem. A preliminary division, like the limited conception from which\nit comes, can only be an anticipation. Here however it is premised that\nthe Idea turns out to be the thought which is completely identical\nwith itself, and not identical simply in the abstract, but also in its\naction of setting itself over against itself, so as to gain a being of\nits own, and yet of being in full possession of itself while it is in\nthis other. Thus philosophy is subdivided into three parts:\nI. Logic, the science of the Idea in and for itself.\nII. The Philosophy of Nature: the science of the Idea in its otherness.\nIII. The Philosophy of Mind: the science of the Idea come back to\nitself out of that otherness.\nAs observed in \u00a7 15, the differences between the several philosophical\nsciences are only aspects or specialisations of the one Idea or system\nof reason, which and which alone is alike exhibited in these different\nmedia. In Nature nothing else would have to be discerned, except the\nIdea: but the Idea has here divested itself of its proper being. In\nMind, again, the Idea has asserted a being of its own, and is on the\nway to become absolute. Every such form in which the Idea is expressed,\nis at the same time a passing or fleeting stage: and hence each of\nthese subdivisions has not only to know its contents as an object which\nhas being for the time, but also in the same act to expound how these\ncontents pass into their higher circle. To represent the relation\nbetween them as a division, therefore, leads to misconception; for it\nco-ordinates the several parts or sciences one beside another, as if\nthey had no innate development, but were, like so many species, really\nand radically distinct.\n[1] The journal, too, edited by Thomson is called 'Annals of\nPhilosophy; or, Magazine of Chemistry, Mineralogy, Mechanics, Natural\nHistory, Agriculture, and Arts.' We can easily guess from the title\nwhat sort of subjects are here to be understood under the term\n'philosophy.' Among the advertisements of books just published, I\nlately found the following notice in an English newspaper: 'The Art of\nPreserving the Hair, on Philosophical Principles, neatly printed in\npost 8vo, price seven shillings.' By philosophical principles for the\npreservation of the hair are probably meant chemical or physiological\nprinciples.\n[2] In connexion with the general principles of Political Economy,\nthe term 'philosophical' is frequently heard from the lips of English\nstatesmen, even in their public speeches. In the House of Commons, on\nthe 2nd Feb. 1825, Brougham, speaking oh the address in reply to the\nspeech from the throne, talked of 'the statesman-like and philosophical\nprinciples of Free-trade,--for philosophical they undoubtedly are--upon\nthe acceptance of which his majesty this day congratulated the House.'\nNor is this language confined to members of the Opposition. At the\nshipowners' yearly dinner in the same month, under the chairmanship\nof the Premier Lord Liverpool, supported by Canning the Secretary of\nState, and Sir C. Long the Paymaster-General of the Army, Canning\nin reply to the toast which had been proposed said: 'A period has\njust begun, in which ministers have it in their power to apply to\nthe administration of this country the sound maxims of a profound\nphilosophy.' Differences there may be between English and German\nphilosophy: still, considering that elsewhere the name of philosophy\nis used only as a nickname and insult, or as something odious, it is\na matter of rejoicing to see it still honoured in the mouth of the\nEnglish Government.\nCHAPTER II.\nPRELIMINARY NOTION.\n19.] LOGIC IS THE SCIENCE OF THE PURE IDEA; pure, that is, because the\nIdea is in the abstract medium of Thought.\nThis definition, and the others which occur in these introductory\noutlines, are derived from a survey of the whole system, to which\naccordingly they are subsequent. The same remark applies to all\nprefatory notions whatever about philosophy.\nLogic might have been defined as the science of thought, and of its\nlaws and characteristic forms. But thought, as thought, constitutes\nonly the general medium, or qualifying circumstance, which renders\nthe Idea distinctively logical. If we identify the Idea with thought,\nthought must not be taken in the sense of a method or form, but in the\nsense of the self-developing totality of its laws and peculiar terms.\nThese laws are the work of thought itself, and not a fact which it\nfinds and must submit to.\nFrom different points of view, Logic is either the hardest or the\neasiest of the sciences, Logic is hard, because it has to deal not with\nperceptions, nor, like geometry, with abstract representations of the\nsenses, but with pure abstractions; and because it demands a force and\nfacility of withdrawing into pure thought, of keeping firm hold on it,\nand of moving in such an element. Logic is easy, because its facts are\nnothing but our own thought and its familiar forms or terms: and these\nare the acme of simplicity, the abc of everything else. They are also\nwhat we are best acquainted with: such as, 'Is' and 'Is not': quality\nand magnitude: being potential and being actual: one, many, and so on.\nBut such an acquaintance only adds to the difficulties of the study;\nfor while, on the one hand, we naturally think it is not worth our\ntrouble to occupy ourselves any longer with things so familiar, on the\nother hand, the problem is to become acquainted with them in a new way,\nquite opposite to that in which we know them already.\nThe utility of Logic is a matter which concerns its bearings upon the\nstudent, and the training it may give for other purposes. This logical\ntraining consists in the exercise in thinking which the student has\nto go through (this science is the thinking of thinking): and in the\nfact that he stores his head with thoughts, in their native unalloyed\ncharacter. It is true that Logic, being the absolute form of truth, and\nanother name for the very truth itself, is something more than merely\nuseful. Yet if what is noblest, most liberal and most independent is\nalso most useful, Logic has some claim to the latter character. Its\nutility must then be estimated at another rate than exercise in thought\nfor the sake of the exercise.\n(1) The first question is: What is the object of our science? The\nsimplest and most intelligible answer to this question is that Truth\nis the object of Logic. Truth is a noble word, and the thing is nobler\nstill. So long as man is sound at heart and in spirit, the search for\ntruth must awake all the enthusiasm of his nature. But immediately\nthere steps in the objection--Are _we_ able to know truth? There\nseems to be a disproportion between finite beings like ourselves and\nthe truth which is absolute: and doubts suggest themselves whether\nthere is any bridge between the finite and the infinite. God is\ntruth: how shall we know Him? Such an undertaking appears to stand in\ncontradiction with the graces of lowliness and humility.--Others who\nask whether we can know the truth have a different purpose. They want\nto justify themselves in living on contented with their petty, finite\naims. And humility of this stamp is a poor thing.\nBut the time is past when people asked: How shall I, a poor worm of the\ndust, be able to know the truth? And in its stead we find vanity and\nconceit: people claim, without any trouble on their part, to breathe\nthe very atmosphere of truth. The young have been flattered into the\nbelief that they possess a natural birthright of moral and religious\ntruth. And in the same strain, those of riper years are declared to\nbe sunk, petrified, ossified in falsehood. Youth, say these teachers,\nsees the bright light of dawn: but the older generation lies in the\nslough and mire of the common day. They admit that the special sciences\nare something that certainly ought to be cultivated, but merely as\nthe means to satisfy the needs of outer life. In all this it is not\nhumility which holds back from the knowledge and study of the truth,\nbut a conviction that we are already in full possession of it. And no\ndoubt the young carry with them the hopes of their elder compeers; on\nthem rests the advance of the world and science. But these hopes are\nset upon the young, only on the condition that, instead of remaining as\nthey are, they undertake the stern labour of mind.\nThis modesty in truth-seeking has still another phase: and that is the\ngenteel indifference to truth, as we see it in Pilate's conversation\nwith Christ. Pilate asked 'What is truth?' with the air of a man who\nhad settled accounts with everything long ago, and concluded that\nnothing particularly matters:--he meant much the same as Solomon when\nhe says: 'All is vanity.' When it comes to this, nothing is left but\nself-conceit.\nThe knowledge of the truth meets an additional obstacle in timidity.\nA slothful mind finds it natural to say: 'Don't let it be supposed\nthat we mean to be in earnest with our philosophy. We shall be glad\n_inter alia_ to study Logic: but Logic must be sure to leave us as\nwe were before.' People have a feeling that, if thinking passes the\nordinary range of our ideas and impressions, it cannot but be on the\nevil road. They seem to be trusting themselves to a sea on which they\nwill be tossed to and fro by the waves of thought, till at length they\nagain reach the sandbank of this temporal scene, as utterly poor as\nwhen they left it. What coines of such a view, we see in the world. It\nis possible within these limits to gain varied information and many\naccomplishments, to become a master of official routine, and to be\ntrained for special purposes. But it is quite another thing to educate\nthe spirit for the higher life and to devote our energies to its\nservice. In our own day it may be hoped a longing for something better\nhas sprung up among the young, so that they will not be contented with\nthe mere straw of outer knowledge.\n(2) It is universally agreed that thought is the object of Logic. But\nof thought our estimate may be very mean, or it may be very high. On\none hand, people say: 'It is _only_ a thought.' In their view thought\nis subjective, arbitrary and accidental--distinguished from the thing\nitself, from the true and the real. On the other hand, a very high\nestimate may be formed of thought; when thought alone is held adequate\nto attain the highest of all things, the nature of God, of which the\nsenses can tell us nothing. God is a spirit, it is said, and must be\nworshipped in spirit and in truth. But the merely felt and sensible,\nwe admit, is not the spiritual; its heart of hearts is in thought;\nand only spirit can know spirit. And though it is true that spirit\ncan demean itself as feeling and sense--as is the case in religion,\nthe mere feeling, as a mode of consciousness, is one thing, and its\ncontents another. Feeling, as feeling, is the general form of the\nsensuous nature which we have in common with the brutes. This form,\nviz. feeling, may possibly seize and appropriate the full organic\ntruth: but the form has no real congruity with its contents. The form\nof feeling is the lowest in which spiritual truth can be expressed.\nThe world of spiritual existences, God himself, exists in proper\ntruth, only in thought and as thought. If this be so, there fore,\nthought, far from being a mere thought, is the highest and, in strict\naccuracy, the sole mode of apprehending the eternal and absolute.\nAs of thought, so also of the science of thought, a very high or a\nvery low opinion may be formed. Any man, it is supposed, can think\nwithout Logic, as he can digest without studying physiology. If he\nhave studied Logic, he thinks afterwards as he did before, perhaps\nmore methodically, but with little alteration. If this were all, and\nif Logic did no more than make men acquainted with the action of\nthought as the faculty of comparison and classification, it would\nproduce nothing which had not been done quite as well before. And in\npoint of fact Logic hitherto had no other idea of its duty than this.\nYet to be well-informed about thought, even as a mere activity of the\nsubject-mind, is honourable and interesting for man. It is in knowing\nwhat he is and what he does, that man is distinguished from the brutes.\nBut we may take the higher estimate of thought--as what alone can get\nreally in touch with the supreme and true. In that case, Logic as the\nscience of thought occupies a high ground. If the science of Logic\nthen considers thought in its action and its productions (and thought\nbeing no resultless energy produces thoughts and the particular thought\nrequired), the theme of Logic is in general the supersensible world,\nand to deal with that theme is to dwell for a while in that world.\nMathematics is concerned with the abstractions of time and space. But\nthese are still the object of sense, although the sensible is abstract\nand idealised. Thought bids adieu even to this last and abstract\nsensible: it asserts its own native independence, renounces the field\nof the external and internal sense, and puts away the interests and\ninclinations of the individual. When Logic takes this ground, it is a\nhigher science than we are in the habit of supposing.\n(3) The necessity of understanding Logic in a deeper sense than as\nthe science of the mere form of thought is enforced by the interests\nof religion and politics, of law and morality. In earlier days men\nmeant no harm by thinking: they thought away freely and fearlessly.\nThey thought about God, about Nature, and the State; and they felt\nsure that a knowledge of the truth was obtainable through thought\nonly, and not through the senses or any random ideas or opinions.\nBut while they so thought, the principal ordinances of life began\nto be seriously affected by their conclusions. Thought deprived\nexisting institutions of their force. Constitutions fell a victim to\nthought: religion was assailed by thought: firm religious beliefs\nwhich had been always looked upon as revelations were undermined, and\nin many minds the old faith was upset. The Greek philosophers, for\nexample, became antagonists of the old religion, and destroyed its\nbeliefs. Philosophers were accordingly banished or put to death, as\nrevolutionists who had subverted religion and the state, two things\nwhich were inseparable. Thought, in short, made itself a power in the\nreal world, and exercised enormous influence. The matter ended by\ndrawing attention to the influence of thought, and its claims were\nsubmitted to a more rigorous scrutiny, by which the world professed to\nfind that thought arrogated too much and was unable to perform what\nit had undertaken. It had not--people said--learned the real being of\nGod, of Nature and Mind. It had not learned what the truth was. What\nit had done, was to overthrow religion and the state. It became urgent\ntherefore to justify thought, with reference to the results it had\nproduced: and it is this examination into the nature of thought and\nthis justification which in recent times has constituted one of the\nmain problems of philosophy.\n20.] If we take our _prima facie_ impression of thought, we find on\nexamination first (a) that, in its usual subjective acceptation,\nthought is one out of many activities or faculties of the mind,\nco-ordinate with such others as sensation, perception, imagination,\ndesire, volition, and the like. The product of this activity, the form\nor character peculiar to thought, is the UNIVERSAL, or, in general,\nthe abstract. Thought, regarded as an _activity,_ may be accordingly\ndescribed as the _active_ universal, and, since the deed, its product,\nis the universal once more, may be called a self-actualising universal.\nThought conceived as a _subject_ (agent) is a thinker, and the subject\nexisting as a thinker is simply denoted by the term 'I.'\nThe propositions giving an account of thought in this and the following\nsections are not offered as assertions or opinions of mine on the\nmatter. But in these preliminary chapters any deduction or proof would\nbe impossible, and the statements may be taken as matters in evidence.\nIn other words, every man, when he thinks and considers his thoughts,\nwill discover by the experience of his consciousness that they possess\nthe character of universality as well as the other aspects of thought\nto be afterwards enumerated. We assume of course that his powers of\nattention and abstraction have undergone a previous training, enabling\nhim to observe correctly the evidence of his consciousness and his\nconceptions.\nThis introductory exposition has already alluded to the distinction\nbetween Sense, Conception, and Thought. As the distinction is of\ncapital importance for understanding the nature and kinds of knowledge,\nit will help to explain matters if we here call attention to it. For\nthe explanation of _Sense,_ the readiest method certainly is, to refer\nto its external source--the organs of sense. But to name the organ\ndoes not help much to explain what is apprehended by it. The real\ndistinction between sense and thought lies in this--that the essential\nfeature of the sensible is individuality, and as the individual (which,\nreduced to its simplest terms, is the atom) is also a member of a\ngroup, sensible existence presents a number of mutually exclusive\nunits,--of units, to speak in more definite and abstract formulae,\nwhich exist side by side with, and after, one another. _Conception_ or\npicture-thinking works with materials from the same sensuous source.\nBut these materials when _conceived_ are expressly characterised as in\nme and therefore mine: and secondly, as universal, or simple, because\nonly referred to self. Nor is sense the only source of materialised\nconception. There are conceptions constituted by materials emanating\nfrom self-conscious thought, such as those of law, morality, religion,\nand even of thought itself, and it requires some effort to detect\nwherein lies the difference between such conceptions and thoughts\nhaving the same import. For it is a thought of which such conception is\nthe vehicle, and there is no want of the form of universality, without\nwhich no content could be in me, or be a conception at all. Yet here\nalso the peculiarity of conception is, generally speaking, to be sought\nin the individualism or isolation of its contents. True it is that, for\nexample, law and legal provisions do not exist in a sensible space,\nmutually excluding one another. Nor as regards time, though they appear\nto some extent in succession, are their contents themselves conceived\nas affected by time, or as transient and changeable in it. The fault\nin conception lies deeper. These ideas, though implicitly possessing\nthe organic unity of mind, stand isolated here and there on the broad\nground of conception, with its inward and abstract generality. Thus\ncut adrift, each is simple, unrelated: Right, Duty, God. Conception in\nthese circumstances either rests satisfied with declaring that Right\nis Right, God is God: or in a higher grade of culture, it proceeds to\nenunciate the attributes; as, for instance, God is the Creator of the\nworld, omniscient, almighty, &c. In this way several isolated, simple\npredicates are strung together: but in spite of the link supplied\nby their subject, the predicates never get beyond mere contiguity.\nIn this point Conception coincides with Understanding: the only\ndistinction being that the latter introduces relations of universal\nand particular, of cause and effect, &c., and in this way supplies a\nnecessary connexion to the isolated ideas of conception; which last has\nleft them side by side in its vague mental spaces, connected only by a\nbare 'and.'\nThe difference between conception and thought is of special importance:\nbecause philosophy may be said to do nothing but transform conceptions\ninto thoughts,--though it works the further transformation of a mere\nthought into a notion.\nSensible existence has been characterised by the attributes of\nindividuality and mutual exclusion of the members. It is well to\nremember that these very attributes of sense are thoughts and general\nterms. It will be shown in the Logic that thought (and the universal)\nis not a mere opposite of sense: it lets nothing escape it, but,\noutflanking its other, is at once that other and itself. Now language\nis the work of thought: and hence all that is expressed in language\nmust be universal. What I only mean or suppose is mine: it belongs\nto me,--this particular individual. But language expresses nothing\nbut universality; and so I cannot say what I merely _mean._ And the\nunutterable,--feeling or sensation,--far from being the highest truth,\nis the most unimportant and untrue. If I say 'The individual,' 'This\nindividual,' 'here,' 'now,' all these are universal terms. Everything\nand anything is an individual, a 'this,' and if it be sensible, is\nhere and now. Similarly when I say, 'I,' I _mean_ my single self to\nthe exclusion of all others: but what I _say,_ viz. 'I,' is just\nevery 'I,' which in like manner excludes all others from itself. In\nan awkward expression which Kant used, he said that I _accompany_\nall my conceptions,--sensations, too, desires, actions, &c. 'I' is\nin essence and act the universal: and such partnership is a form,\nthough an external form, of universality. All other men have it in\ncommon with me to be 'I': just as it is common to all my sensations\nand conceptions to be mine. But 'I,' in the abstract, as such, is the\nmere act of self-concentration or self-relation, in which we make\nabstraction from all conception and feeling, from every state of mind\nand every peculiarity of nature, talent, and experience. To this\nextent, 'I' is the existence of a wholly _abstract_ universality, a\nprinciple of abstract freedom. Hence thought, viewed as a subject, is\nwhat is expressed by the word 'I': and since I am at the same time in\nall my sensations, conceptions, and states of consciousness, thought\nis everywhere present, and is a category that runs through all these\nmodifications.\nOur first impression when we use the term thought is of a subjective\nactivity--one amongst many similar faculties, such as memory,\nimagination and will. Were thought merely an activity of the\nsubject-mind and treated under that aspect by logic, logic would\nresemble the other sciences in possessing a well-marked object. It\nmight in that case seem arbitrary to devote a special science to\nthought, whilst will, imagination and the rest were denied the same\nprivilege. The selection of one faculty however might even in this view\nbe very well grounded on a certain authority acknowledged to belong to\nthought, and on its claim to be regarded as the true nature of man, in\nwhich consists his distinction from the brutes. Nor is it unimportant\nto study thought even as a subjective energy. A detailed analysis\nof its nature would exhibit rules and laws, a knowledge of which is\nderived from experience. A treatment of the laws of thought, from this\npoint of view, used once to form the body of logical science. Of that\nscience Aristotle was the founder. He succeeded in assigning to thought\nwhat properly belongs to it. Our thought is extremely concrete: but\nin its composite contents we must distinguish the part that properly\nbelongs to thought, or to the abstract mode of its action. A subtle\nspiritual bond, consisting in the agency of thought, is what gives\nunity to all these contents, and it was this bond, the form as form,\nthat Aristotle noted and described. Up to the present day, the logic\nof Aristotle continues to be the received system. It has indeed been\nspun out to greater length, especially by the labours of the medieval\nSchoolmen who, without making any material additions, merely refined\nin details. The moderns also have left their mark upon this logic,\npartly by omitting many points of logical doctrine due to Aristotle and\nthe Schoolmen, and partly by foisting in a quantity of psychological\nmatter. The purport of the science is to become acquainted with the\nprocedure of finite thought: and, if it is adapted to its pre-supposed\nobject, the science is entitled to be styled correct. The study of this\nformal logic undoubtedly has its uses. It sharpens the wits, as the\nphrase goes, and teaches us to collect our thoughts and to abstract\n--whereas in common consciousness we have to deal with sensuous\nconceptions which cross and perplex one another. Abstraction moreover\nimplies the concentration of the mind on a single point, and thus\ninduces the habit of attending to our inward selves. An acquaintance\nwith the forms of finite thought may be made a means of training the\nmind for the empirical sciences, since their method is regulated by\nthese forms: and in this sense logic has been designated Instrumental.\nIt is true, we may be still more liberal, and say: Logic is to be\nstudied not for its utility, but for its own sake; the super-excellent\nis not to be sought for the sake of mere utility. In one sense this is\nquite correct: but it may be replied that the super-excellent is also\nthe most useful: because it is the all-sustaining principle which,\nhaving a subsistence of its own, may therefore serve as the vehicle of\nspecial ends which it furthers and secures. And thus, special ends,\nthough they have no right to be set first, are still fostered by the\npresence of the highest good. Religion, for instance, has an absolute\nvalue of its own; yet at the same time other ends flourish and succeed\nin its train. As Christ says: 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and\nall these things shall be added unto you.' Particular ends can be\nattained only in the attainment of what absolutely is and exists in its\nown right.\n21.] (b) Thought was described as active. We now, in the second place,\nconsider this action in its bearings upon objects, or as reflection\nupon something. In this case the universal or product of its operation\ncontains the value of the thing--is the essential, inward, and true.\nIn \u00a7 5 the old belief was quoted that the reality in object,\ncircumstance, or event, the intrinsic worth or essence, the thing on\nwhich everything depends, is not a self-evident datum of consciousness,\nor coincident with the first appearance and impression of the object;\nthat, on the contrary, Reflection is required in order to discover the\nreal constitution of the object--and that by such reflection it will be\nascertained.\nTo reflect is a lesson which even the child has to learn. One of his\nfirst lessons is to join adjectives with substantives. This obliges\nhim to attend and distinguish: he has to remember a rule and apply it\nto the particular case. This rule is nothing but a universal: and the\nchild must see that the particular adapts itself to this universal.\nIn life, again, we have ends to attain. And with regard to these we\nponder which is the best way to secure them. The end here represents\nthe universal or governing principle: and we have means and instruments\nwhose action we regulate in conformity to the end. In the same way\nreflection is active in questions of conduct. To reflect here means to\nrecollect the right, the duty,--the universal which serves as a fixed\nrule' to guide our behaviour in the given case. Our particular act\nmust imply and recognise the universal law.--We find the same thing\nexhibited in our study of natural phenomena. For instance, we observe\nthunder and lightning. The phenomenon is a familiar one, and we often\nperceive it. But man is not content with a bare acquaintance, or with\nthe fact as it appears to the senses; he would like to get behind the\nsurface, to know what it is, and to comprehend it. This leads him to\nreflect: he seeks to find out the cause as something distinct from\nthe mere phenomenon: he tries to know the inside in its distinction\nfrom the outside. Hence the phenomenon becomes double, it splits into\ninside and outside, into force and its manifestation, into cause and\neffect. Once more we find the inside or the force identified with the\nuniversal and permanent: not this or that flash of lightning, this\nor that plant--but that which continues the same in them all. The\nsensible appearance is individual and evanescent: the permanent in\nit is discovered by. reflection. Nature shows us a countless number\nof individual forms and phenomena. Into this variety we feel a need\nof introducing unity: we compare, consequently, and try to find the\nuniversal of each single case. Individuals are born and perish: the\nspecies abides and recurs in them all: and its existence is only\nvisible to reflection. Under the same head fall such laws as those\nregulating the motion of the heavenly bodies. To-day we see the stars\nhere, and to-morrow there: and our mind finds something incongruous, in\nthis chaos--something in which it can put no faith, because it believes\nin order and in a simple, constant, and universal law. Inspired by this\nbelief, the mind has directed its reflection towards the phenomena,\nand learnt their laws. In other words, it has established the movement\nof the heavenly bodies to be in accordance with a universal law from\nwhich every change of position may be known and predicted. The case is\nthe same with the influences which make themselves felt in the infinite\ncomplexity of human conduct. There, too, man has the belief in the sway\nof a general principle.--From all these examples it may be gathered\nhow reflection is always seeking for something fixed and permanent,\ndefinite in itself and governing the particulars. This universal which\ncannot be apprehended by the senses counts as the true and essential.\nThus, duties and rights are all-important in the matter of conduct: and\nan action is true when it conforms to those universal formulae.\nIn thus characterising the universal, we become aware of its antithesis\nto something else. This something else is the merely immediate,\noutward and individual, as opposed to the mediate, inward and\nuniversal. The universal does not exist externally to the outward eye\nas a universal. The kind as kind cannot be perceived: the laws of the\ncelestial motions are not written on the sky. The universal is neither\nseen nor heard, its existence is only for the mind. Religion leads us\nto a universal, which embraces all else within itself, to an Absolute\nby which all else is brought into being: and this Absolute is an object\nnot of the senses but of the mind and of thought.\n22.] (c) By the act of reflection something is _altered_ in the way in\nwhich the fact was originally presented in sensation, perception, or\nconception. Thus, as it appears, an alteration of the object must be\ninterposed before its true nature can be discovered.\nWhat reflection elicits, is a product of our thought. Solon, for\ninstance, produced out of his head the laws he gave to the Athenians.\nThis is half of the truth: but we must not on that account forget\nthat the universal (in Solon's case, the laws) is the very reverse of\nmerely subjective, or fail to note that it is the essential, true,\nand objective being of things. To discover the truth in things,\nmere attention is not enough; we must call in the action of our own\nfaculties to transform what is immediately before us. Now, at first\nsight, this seems an inversion of the natural order, calculated to\nthwart the very purpose on which knowledge is bent. But the method is\nnot so irrational as it seems. It has been the conviction of every age\nthat the only way of reaching the permanent substratum was to transmute\nthe given phenomenon by means of reflection. In modern times a doubt\nhas for the first time been raised on this point in connexion with the\ndifference alleged to exist between the products of our thought and the\nthings in their own nature. This real nature of things, it is said,\nis very different from what we make out of them. The divorce between\nthought and thing is mainly the work of the Critical Philosophy,\nand runs counter to the conviction of all previous ages, that their\nagreement was a matter of course. The antithesis between them is\nthe hinge on which modern philosophy turns. Meanwhile the natural\nbelief of men gives the lie to it. In common life we reflect, without\nparticularly reminding ourselves that this is the process of arriving\nat the truth, and we think without hesitation, and in the firm belief\nthat thought coincides with thing. And this belief is of the greatest\nimportance. It marks the diseased state of the age when we see it adopt\nthe despairing creed that our knowledge is only subjective, and that\nbeyond this subjective we cannot go. Whereas, rightly understood, truth\nis objective, and ought so to regulate the conviction of every one,\nthat the conviction of the individual is stamped as wrong when it does\nnot agree with this rule. Modern views, on the contrary, put great\nvalue on the mere fact of conviction, and hold that to be convinced is\ngood for its own sake, whatever be the burden of our conviction,--there\nbeing no standard by which we can measure its truth.\nWe said above that, according to the old belief, it was the\ncharacteristic right of the mind to know the truth. If this be so, it\nalso implies that everything we know both of outward and inward nature,\nin one word, the objective world, is in its own self the same as it is\nin thought, and that to think is to bring out the truth of our object,\nbe it what it may. The business of philosophy is only to bring into\nexplicit consciousness what the world in all ages has believed about\nthought. Philosophy therefore advances nothing new; and our present\ndiscussion has led us to a conclusion which agrees with the natural\nbelief of mankind.\n23.] (d) The real nature of the object is brought to light in\nreflection; but it is no less true that this exertion of thought is\n_my_ act. If this be so, the real nature is a _product_ of _my_ mind,\nin its character of thinking subject--generated by me in my simple\nuniversality, self-collected and removed from extraneous influences,\n--in one word, in my Freedom.\nThink for yourself, is a phrase which people often use as if it had\nsome special significance. The fact is, no man can think for another,\nany more than he can eat or drink for him: and the expression is a\npleonasm. To think is in fact _ipso facto_ to be free, for thought as\nthe action of the universal is an abstract relating of self to self,\nwhere, being at home with ourselves, and as regards our subjectivity,\nutterly blank, our consciousness is, in the matter of its contents,\nonly in the fact and its characteristics. If this be admitted, and\nif we apply the term humility or modesty to an attitude where our\nsubjectivity is not allowed to interfere by act or quality, it is\neasy to appreciate the question touching the humility or modesty and\npride of philosophy. For in point of contents, thought is only true in\nproportion as it sinks itself in the facts; and in point of form it\nis no private or particular state or act of the subject, but rather\nthat attitude of consciousness where the abstract self, freed from\nall the special limitations to which its ordinary states or qualities\nare liable, restricts itself to that universal action in which it is\nidentical with all individuals. In these circumstances philosophy may\nbe acquitted of the charge of pride. And when Aristotle summons the\nmind to rise to the dignity of that attitude, the dignity he seeks is\nwon by letting slip all our individual opinions and prejudices, and\nsubmitting to the sway of the fact.\n24.] With these explanations and qualifications, thoughts may be termed\nObjective Thoughts,--among which are also to be included the forms\nwhich are more especially discussed in the common logic, where they are\nusually treated as forms of conscious thought only. _Logic therefore\ncoincides with Metaphysics, the science of things set and held in\nthoughts,_--thoughts accredited able to express the essential reality\nof things.\nAn exposition of the relation in which such forms as notion, judgment,\nand syllogism stand to others, such as causality, is a matter for the\nscience itself. But this much is evident beforehand. If thought tries\nto form a notion of things, this notion (as well as its proximate\nphases, the judgment and syllogism) cannot be composed of articles and\nrelations which are alien and irrelevant to the things. Reflection, it\nwas said above, conducts to the universal of things: which universal\nis itself one of the constituent factors of a notion. To say that\nReason or Understanding is in the world, is equivalent in its import\nto the phrase 'Objective Thought.' The latter phrase however has the\ninconvenience that thought is usually confined to express what belongs\nto the mind or consciousness only, while objective is a term applied,\nat least primarily, only to the non-mental.\n(1) To speak of thought or objective thought as the heart [and soul\nof the world, may seem to be ascribing consciousness to the things of\nnature. We feel a certain repugnance against making thought the inward\nfunction of things, especially as we speak of thought as marking the\ndivergence of man from nature. It would be necessary, therefore, if\nwe use the term thought at all, to speak of nature as the system of\nunconscious thought, or, to use Schelling's expression, a petrified\nintelligence. And in order to prevent misconception, thought-form or\nthought-type should be substituted for the ambiguous term thought.\nFrom what has been said the principles of logic are to be sought\nin a system of thought-types or fundamental categories, in which\nthe opposition between subjective and objective, in its usual\nsense, vanishes. The signification thus attached to thought and its\ncharacteristic forms may be illustrated by the ancient saying that\n'\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe7\u03c2 governs the world,' or by our own phrase that 'Reason is in the\nworld: which means that Reason is the soul of the world it inhabits,\nits immanent principle, its most proper and inward nature, its\nuniversal. Another illustration is offered by the circumstance that\nin speaking of some definite animal we say it is (an) animal. Now,\nthe animal, _qu\u00e2_ animal, cannot be shown; nothing can be pointed out\nexcepting some special animal. Animal, _qu\u00e2_ animal, does not exist: it\nis merely the universal nature of the individual animals, whilst each\nexisting animal is a more concretely, defined and particularised thing.\nBut to be an animal,--the law of kind which is the universal in this\ncase,--is the property of the particular animal, and constitutes its\ndefinite essence. Take away from the dog its animality, and it becomes\nimpossible to say what it is. All things have a permanent inward\nnature, as well as an outward existence. They live and die, arise and\npass away; but their essential and universal part is the kind; and this\nmeans much more than something _common_ to them all.\nIf thought is the constitutive substance of external things, it is also\nthe universal substance of what is spiritual. In all human perception\nthought is present; so too thought is the universal in all the acts of\nconception and recollection; in short, in every mental activity, in\nwilling, wishing and the like. All these faculties are only further,\nspecialisations of thought. When it is presented in this light, thought\nhas a different part to play from what it has if we speak of a faculty\nof thought, one among a crowd of other faculties, such as perception,\nconception and will, with which it stands on the same level. When it\nis seen, to be the true universal of all that nature and mind contain,\nit extends its scope far beyond all these, and becomes the basis of\neverything. From this view of thought, in its objective meaning as\n[greek: nous], we may next pass to consider the subjective sense of the\nterm. We say first, Man is a being that thinks; but we also say at the\nsame time, Man is a being that perceives and wills. Man is a thinker,\nand is universal: but he is a thinker only because he feels his own\nuniversality. The animal too is by implication universal, but the\nuniversal is not consciously felt by it to be universal: it feels only\nthe individual. The animal sees a singular object, for instance, its\nfood, or a man. For the animal all this never goes beyond an individual\nthing. Similarly, sensation has to do with nothing but singulars, such\nas _this_ pain or _this_ sweet taste. Nature does not bring its \"\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2\"\ninto consciousness: it is man who first makes himself double so as\nto be a universal for a universal. This first happens when man knows\nthat he is 'I.' By the term 'I' I mean myself, a single and altogether\ndeterminate person. And yet I really utter nothing peculiar to myself,\nfor every one else is an 'I' or 'Ego,' and when I call myself 'I,'\nthough I indubitably mean the single person myself, I express a\nthorough universal. 'I,' therefore, is mere being-for-self, in which\neverything peculiar or marked is renounced and buried out of sight;\nit is as it were the ultimate and unanalysable point of consciousness\nWe may say 'I' I and thought are the same, or, more definitely, 'I'\nis thought as a thinker. What I have in my consciousness, is for me.\n'I' is the vacuum or receptacle for anything and everything: for which\neverything is and which stores up everything in itself. Every man is a\nwhole world of conceptions, that lie buried in the night of the 'Ego.'\nIt follows that the 'Ego' is the universal in which we leave aside all\nthat is particular, and in which at the same time all the particulars\nhave a latent existence. In other words, it is not a mere universality\nand nothing more, but the universality which includes in it everything.\nCommonly we use the word 'I' without attaching much importance to it,\nnor is it an object of study except to philosophical analysis. In the\n'Ego,' we have thought before us in its utter purity. While the brute\ncannot say 'I,' man can, because it is his nature to think. Now in the\n'Ego' there are a variety of contents, derived both from within and\nfrom, without, and according to the nature of these contents our state\nmay be described as perception, or conception, or reminiscence. But\nin all of them the 'I' is found: or in them all thought is present.\nMan, therefore, is always thinking, even in his perceptions: if he\nobserves anything, he always observes it as a universal, fixes on a\nsingle point which he places in relief, thus withdrawing his attention\nfrom other points, and takes it as abstract and universal, even if the\nuniversality be only in form.\nIn the case of our ordinary conceptions, two things may happen. Either\nthe contents are moulded by thought, but not the form: or, the form\nbelongs to thought and not the contents. In using such terms, for\ninstance, as anger, rose, hope, I am speaking of things which I have\nlearnt in the way of sensation, but I express these contents in a\nuniversal mode, that is, in the form of thought. I have left out much\nthat is particular and given the contents in their generality: but\nstill the contents remain sense-derived. On the other hand, when I\nrepresent God, the content is undeniably a product of pure thought,\nbut the form still retains the sensuous limitations which it has as\nI find it immediately present in myself. In these generalised images\nthe content is not merely and simply sensible, as it is in a visual\ninspection; but either the content is sensuous and the form appertains\nto thought, or _vice vers\u00e2._ In the first case the material is given to\nus, and our thought supplies the form: in the second case the content\nwhich has its source in thought is by means of the form turned into a\nsomething given, which accordingly reaches the mind from without.\n(2) Logic is the study of thought pure and simple, or of the pure\nthought-forms. In the ordinary sense of the term, by thought we\ngenerally represent to ourselves something more than simple and\nunmixed thought; we mean some thought, the material of which is from\nexperience. Whereas in logic a thought is understood to include nothing\nelse but what depends on thinking and what thinking has brought into\nexistence. It is in these circumstances that thoughts are _pure_\nthoughts. The mind is then in its own home-element and therefore free:\nfor freedom means that the other thing with which you deal is a second\nself--so that you never leave your own ground but give the law to\nyourself. In the impulses or appetites the beginning is from something\nelse, from something which we feel to be external. In this case then\nwe speak of dependence. For freedom it is necessary that we should\nfeel no presence of something else which is not ourselves. The natural\nman, whose motions follow the rule only of his appetites, is not his\nown master. Be he as self-willed as he may, the constituents of his\nwill and opinion are not his own, and his freedom is merely formal.\nBut when we _think,_ we renounce our selfish and particular being,\nsink ourselves in the thing, allow thought to follow its own course,\nand,--if we add anything of our own, we think ill.\nIf in pursuance of the foregoing remarks we consider-, Logic to be\nthe system of the pure types of thought, we find that the other\nphilosophical sciences, the Philosophy of I Nature and the Philosophy\nof Mind, take the place, as it were, of an Applied Logic, and that\nLogic is the soul which animates them both. Their problem in that\ncase is only to recognise the logical forms under the shapes they\nassume in Nature and Mind,--shapes which are only a particular mode\nof expression for the forms of pure thought. If for instance we take\nthe syllogism (not as it was understood in the old formal logic, but\nat its real value), we shall find it gives expression to the law that\nthe particular is the middle term which fuses together the extremes of\nthe universal and the singular. The syllogistic form is a universal\nform of all things. Everything that exists is a particular, which\ncouples together the universal and the singular. But Nature is weak\nand fails to exhibit the logical forms in their purity. Such a feeble\nexemplification of the syllogism may be seen in the magnet. In the\nmiddle or point of indifference of a magnet, its two poles, however\nthey may be distinguished, are brought into one. Physics also teaches\nus to see the universal or essence in Nature: and the only difference\nbetween it and the Philosophy of Nature is that the latter brings\nbefore our mind the adequate forms of the notion in the physical world.\nIt will now be understood that Logic is the all-animating spirit of\nall the sciences, and its categories the spiritual hierarchy. They\nare the heart and centre of things: and yet at the same time they\nare always on our lips, and, apparently at least, perfectly familiar\nobjects. But things thus familiar are usually the greatest strangers.\nBeing, for example, is a category of pure thought: but to make 'Is'\nan object of investigation never occurs to us. Common fancy puts the\nAbsolute far away in a world beyond. The Absolute is rather directly\nbefore us, so present that so long as we think, we must, though without\nexpress consciousness of it, always carry it with us and always use it.\nLanguage is the main depository of these types of thought; and one use\nof the grammatical instruction which children receive is unconsciously\nto turn their attention to distinctions of thought.\nLogic is usually said to be concerned with forms _only_ and to derive\nthe material for them from elsewhere. But this 'only,' which assumes\nthat the logical thoughts are nothing in comparison with the rest\nof the contents, is not the word to use about forms which are the\nabsolutely-real ground of everything. Everything else rather is an\n'only' compared with these thoughts. To make such abstract forms a\nproblem pre-supposes in the inquirer a higher level of culture than\nordinary; and to study them in themselves and for their own sake\nsignifies in addition that these thought-types must be deduced out of\nthought itself, and their truth or reality examined by the light of\ntheir own laws. We do not assume them as data from without, and then\ndefine them or exhibit their value and authority by comparing them with\nthe shape they take in our minds. If we thus acted, we should proceed\nfrom observation and experience, and should, for instance, say we\nhabitually employ the term 'force' in such a case, and such a meaning.\nA definition like that would be called correct, if it agreed with the\nconception of its object present in our ordinary state of mind. The\ndefect of this empirical method is that a notion is not defined as it\nis in and for itself, but in terms of something assumed, which is then\nused as a criterion and standard of correctness. No such test need be\napplied: we have merely to let the thought-forms follow the impulse of\ntheir own organic life.\nTo ask if a category is true or not, must sound strange to the ordinary\nmind: for a category apparently becomes true only when it is applied\nto a given object, and apart from this application it would seem\nmeaningless to inquire into its truth. But this is the very question on\nwhich everything turns. We must however in the first place understand\nclearly what we mean by Truth. In common life truth means the agreement\nof an object with our conception of it. We thus pre-suppose an object\nto which our conception must conform. In the philosophical sense of the\nword, on the other hand, truth may be described, in general abstract\nterms, as the agreement of a thought-content with itself. This meaning\nis quite different from the one given above. At the same time the\ndeeper and philosophical meaning of truth can be partially traced even\nin the ordinary usage of language. Thus we speak of a true friend; by\nwhich we mean a friend whose manner of conduct accords with the notion\nof friendship. In the same way we speak of a true work of Art. Untrue\nin this sense means the same as bad, or self-discordant. In this sense\na bad state is an untrue state; and evil and untruth may be said to\nconsist in the contradiction subsisting between the function or notion\nand the existence of the object. Of such a bad object we may form\na correct representation, but the import of such representation is\ninherently false. Of these correctnesses; which are at the same time\nuntruths, we may have many in our heads.--God alone is the thorough\nharmony of notion and reality. All finite things involve an untruth:\nthey have a notion and an existence, but their existence does not meet\nthe requirements of the notion. For this reason they must perish, and\nthen the incompatibility between their notion and their existence\nbecomes manifest. It is in the kind that the individual animal has its\nnotion: and the kind liberates itself from this individuality by death.\nThe study of truth, or, as it is here explained to mean, consistency,\nconstitutes the proper problem of logic. In our every-day mind we\nare never troubled with questions about the truth of the forms of\nthought.--We may also express the problem of logic by saying that it\nexamines the forms of thought touching their capability to hold truth.\nAnd the question comes to this: What are the forms of the infinite, and\nwhat are the forms of the finite? Usually no suspicion attaches to the\nfinite forms of thought; they are allowed to pass unquestioned. But it\nis from conforming to finite categories in thought and action that all\ndeception originates.\n(3) Truth may be ascertained by several methods, each of which however\nis no more than a form. Experience is the first of these methods. But\nthe method is only a form: it has no intrinsic value of its own. For\nin experience everything depends upon the mind we bring to bear upon\nactuality. A great mind is great in its experience; and in the motley\nplay of phenomena at once perceives the point of real significance. The\nidea is present, in actual shape, not something, as it were, over the\nhill and far away. The genius of a Goethe, for example, looking into\nnature or history, has great experiences, catches sight of the living\nprinciple, and gives expression to it. A second method of apprehending\nthe truth is Reflection, which defines it by intellectual relations of\ncondition and conditioned. But in these two modes the absolute truth\nhas not yet found its appropriate form. The most perfect method of\nknowledge proceeds in the pure form of thought: and here the attitude\nof man is one of entire freedom.\nThat the form of thought is the perfect form, and that it presents\nthe truth as it intrinsically and actually is, is the general dogma\nof all philosophy. To give a proof of the dogma there is, in the\nfirst instance, nothing to do but show that these other forms of\nknowledge are finite. The grand Scepticism of antiquity accomplished\nthis task when it exhibited the contradictions contained in every\none of these forms. That Scepticism indeed went further: but when\nit ventured to assail the forms of reason, it began by insinuating\nunder them something finite upon which it might fasten. All the\nforms of finite thought will make their appearance in the course of\nlogical development, the order in which they present themselves being\ndetermined by necessary laws. Here in the introduction they could only\nbe unscientifically assumed as something given. In the theory of logic\nitself these forms will be exhibited, not only on their negative, but\nalso on their positive side.\nWhen we compare the different forms of ascertaining truth with one\nanother, the first of them, immediate knowledge, may perhaps seem the\nfinest, noblest and most appropriate. It includes everything which\nthe moralists term innocence as well as religious feeling, simple\ntrust, love, fidelity, and natural faith. The two other forms, first\nreflective, and secondly philosophical cognition, must leave that\nunsought natural harmony behind. And so far as they have this in\ncommon, the methods which claim to apprehend the truth by thought\nmay naturally be regarded as part and parcel of the pride which leads\nman to trust to his own powers for a knowledge of the truth. Such a\nposition involves a thorough-going disruption, and, viewed in that\nlight, might be regarded as the source of all evil and wickedness--the\noriginal transgression. Apparently therefore they only way of being\nreconciled and restored to peace is to surrender all claims to think or\nknow.\nThis lapse from natural unity has not escaped notice, and nations from\nthe earliest times have asked the meaning of the wonderful division of\nthe spirit against itself. No such inward disunion is found in nature:\nnatural things do nothing wicked.\nThe Mosaic legend of the Fall of Man has preserved an ancient picture\nrepresenting the origin and consequences of this disunion. The\nincidents of the legend form the basis of an essential article of the\ncreed, the doctrine of original sin in man and his consequent need of\nsuccour. It may be well at the commencement of logic to examine the\nstory which treats of the origin and the bearings of the very knowledge\nwhich logic has to discuss. For, though philosophy must not allow\nherself to be overawed by religion, or accept the position of existence\non sufferance, she cannot afford to neglect these popular conceptions.\nThe tales and allegories of religion, which have enjoyed for thousands\nof years the veneration of nations, are not to be set aside as\nantiquated even now.\nUpon a closer inspection of the story of the Fall we find, as was\nalready said, that it exemplifies the universal bearings of knowledge\nupon the spiritual life. In its instinctive and natural stage,\nspiritual life wears the garb of innocence and confiding simplicity:\nbut the very essence of spirit implies the absorption of this immediate\ncondition in something higher. The spiritual is distinguished from the\nnatural, and more especially from the animal, life, in the circumstance\nthat it does not continue a mere stream of tendency, but sunders itself\nto self-realisation. But this position of severed life has in its turn\nto be suppressed, and the spirit has by its own act to win its way\nto concord again. The final concord then is spiritual; that is, the\nprinciple of restoration is found in thought, and thought only. The\nhand that inflicts the wound is also the hand which heals it.\nWe are told in our story that Adam and Eve, the first human beings,\nthe types of humanity, were placed in a garden, where grew a tree of\nlife and a tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God, it is said,\nhad forbidden them to eat of the fruit of this latter tree: of the\ntree of life for the present nothing further is said. These words\nevidently assume that man is not intended to seek knowledge, and ought\nto remain in the state of innocence. Other meditative races, it may\nbe remarked, have held the same belief that the primitive state of\nmankind was one of innocence and harmony. Now all this is to a certain\nextent correct. The disunion that appears throughout humanity is not\na condition to rest in. But it is a mistake to regard the natural and\nimmediate harmony as the right state. The mind is not mere instinct:\non the contrary, it essentially involves the tendency to reasoning\nand meditation. Childlike innocence no doubt has in it something\nfascinating and attractive: but only because it reminds us of what the\nspirit must win for itself. The harmoniousness of childhood is a gift\nfrom the hand of nature: the second harmony must spring from the labour\nand culture of the spirit. And so the words of Christ, 'Except ye\n_become_ as little children,' &c., are very far from telling us that we\nmust always remain children.\nAgain, we find in the narrative of Moses that the occasion which led\nman to leave his natural unity is attributed to solicitation from\nwithout. The serpent was the tempter. But the truth is, that the step\ninto opposition, the awakening of consciousness, follows from the\nvery nature of man: and the same history repeats itself in every son\nof Adam. The serpent represents likeness to God as consisting in the\nknowledge of good and evil: and it is just this knowledge in which man\nparticipates when he breaks with the unity of his instinctive being\nand eats of the forbidden fruit. The first reflection of awakened\nconsciousness in men told them that they were naked. This is a na\u00efve\nand profound trait. For the sense of shame bears evidence to the\nseparation of man from his natural and sensuous life. The beasts never\nget so far as this separation, and they feel no shame. And it is in\nthe human feeling of shame that we are to seek the spiritual and moral\norigin of dress, compared with which the merely physical need is a\nsecondary matter.\nNext comes the Curse, as it is called, which God pronounced upon\nman. The prominent point in that curse turns chiefly on the contrast\nbetween man and nature. Man must work in the sweat of his brow: and\nwoman bring forth in sorrow. As to work, if it is the result of the\ndisunion, it is also the victory over it. The beasts have nothing more\nto do but to pick up the materials required to satisfy their wants: man\non the contrary can only satisfy his wants by himself producing and\ntransforming the necessary means. Thus even in these outside things man\nis dealing with himself.\nThe story does not close with the expulsion from Paradise. We are\nfurther told, God said, 'Behold Adam is become as one of us, to\nknow good and evil.' Knowledge is now spoken of as divine, and not,\nas before, as something wrong and forbidden. Such words contain a\nconfutation of the idle talk that philosophy pertains only to the\nfinitude of the mind. Philosophy is knowledge, and it is through\nknowledge that man first realises his original vocation, to be the\nimage of God. When the record adds that God drove men out of the Garden\nof Eden to prevent their eating of the tree of life, it only means\nthat on his natural side certainly man is finite and mortal, but in\nknowledge infinite.\nWe all know the theological dogma that man's nature is evil, tainted\nwith what is called Original Sin. Now while we accept the dogma, we\nmust give up the setting of incident which represents original sin as\nconsequent upon an accidental act of the first man. For the very notion\nof spirit is enough to show that man is evil by nature, and it is an\nerror to imagine that he could ever be otherwise. To such extent as man\nis and acts like a creature of nature, his whole behaviour is what it\nought not to be. For the spirit it is a duty to be free, and to realise\nitself by its own act. Nature is for man only the starting-point which\nhe has to transform. The theological doctrine of original sin is a\nprofound truth; but modern enlightenment prefers to believe that man is\nnaturally good, and that he acts right so long as he continues true to\nnature.\nThe hour when man leaves the path of mere natural being marks the\ndifference between him, a self-conscious agent, and the natural world.\nBut this schism, though it forms a necessary element in the very notion\nof spirit, is not the final goal of man. It is to this state of inward\nbreach that the whole finite action of thought and will belongs.\nIn that finite sphere man pursues ends of his own and draws from\nhimself the material of his conduct. While he pursues these aims to\nthe uttermost, while his knowledge and his will seek himself, his own\nnarrow self apart from the universal, he is evil; and his evil is to be\nsubjective.\nWe seem at first to have a double evil here: but both are really the\nsame. Man in so far as he is spirit is not the creature of nature: and\nwhen he behaves as such, and follows the cravings of appetite, he wills\nto be so. The natural wickedness of man is therefore unlike the natural\nlife of animals. A mere natural life may be more exactly defined by\nsaying that the natural man as such is an individual: for nature in\nevery part is in the bonds of individualism. Thus when man wills to be\na creature of nature, he wills in the Same degree to be an individual\nsimply. Yet against such impulsive and appetitive action, due to\nthe individualism of nature, there also steps in the law or general\nprinciple. This law may either be an external force, or have the form\nof divine authority. So long as he continues in his natural state, man\nis in bondage to the law.--It is true that among the instincts and\naffections of man, there are social or benevolent inclinations, love,\nsympathy, and others, reaching beyond his selfish isolation. But so\nlong as these tendencies are instinctive, their virtual universality\nof scope and purport is vitiated by the subjective form which always\nallows free play to self-seeking and random action.\n25.] The term 'Objective Thoughts' indicates the _truth_--the truth\nwhich is to be the absolute _object_ of philosophy, and not merely the\ngoal at which it aims. But the very expression cannot fail to suggest\nan opposition, to characterise and appreciate which is the main motive\nof the philosophical attitude of the present time, and which forms the\nreal problem of the question about truth and our means of ascertaining\nit. If the thought-forms are vitiated by a fixed antithesis, _i.\ne._ if they are only of a finite character, they are unsuitable for\nthe self-centred universe of truth, and truth can find no adequate\nreceptacle in thought. Such thought, which--- can produce only limited\nand partial categories and I proceed by their means; is what in the\nstricter sense of the word is termed Understanding. The finitude,\nfurther, of these categories lies in two points. Firstly, they are only\nsubjective, and the antithesis of an objective permanently clings to\nthem. Secondly, they are always of restricted content, and so persist\nin antithesis to one another and still more to the Absolute. In order\nmore fully to explain the position and import here attributed to logic,\nthe attitudes in which thought is supposed to stand to objectivity will\nnext be examined by way of further introduction.\nIn my Phenomenology of the Spirit, which on that account was at its\npublication described as the first part of the System of Philosophy,\nthe method adopted was to begin with the first and simplest phase of\nmind, immediate consciousness, and to show how that stage gradually\nof necessity worked onward to the philosophical point of view, the\nnecessity of that view being proved by the process. But in these\ncircumstances it was impossible to restrict the quest to the mere form\nof consciousness. For the stage of philosophical knowledge is the\nrichest in material and organisation, and therefore, as it came before\nus in the shape of a result, it pre-supposed the existence of the\nconcrete formations of consciousness, such as individual and social\nmorality, art and religion. In the development of consciousness, which\nat first sight appears limited to the point of form merely, there is\nthus at the same time included the development of the matter or of the\nobjects discussed in the special branches of philosophy. But the latter\nprocess must, so to speak, go on behind consciousness, since those\nfacts are the essential nucleus which is raised into consciousness.\nThe exposition accordingly is rendered more intricate, because so much\nthat properly belongs to the concrete branches is prematurely dragged\ninto the introduction. The survey which follows in the present work has\neven more the inconvenience of being only historical and inferential in\nits method. But it tries especially to show how the questions men have\nproposed, outside the school, on the nature of Knowledge, Faith and the\nlike,--questions which they imagine to have no connexion with abstract\nthoughts,--are really reducible to the simple categories, which first\nget cleared up in Logic.\nCHAPTER III.\nFIRST ATTITUDE OF THOUGHT TO OBJECTIVITY.\n28.] The first of these attitudes of thought is seen in the method\nwhich has no doubts and no sense of the contradiction in thought, or of\nthe hostility of thought against itself. It entertains an unquestioning\nbelief that reflection is the means of ascertaining the truth, and of\nbringing the objects before the mind as they really are. And in this\nbelief it advances straight upon its objects, takes the materials\nfurnished by sense and perception, and reproduces them from itself as\nfacts of thought; and then, believing this result to be the truth, the\nmethod is content. Philosophy in its earliest stages, all the sciences,\nand even the daily action and movement of consciousness, live in this\nfaith.\n27.] This method of thought has never become aware, of the antithesis\nof subjective and objective: and to that extent there is nothing to\nprevent its statements from possessing a genuinely philosophical and\nspeculative character, though it is just as possible that they may\nnever get beyond finite categories, or the stage where the antithesis\nis still unresolved. In the present introduction the main question\nfor us is to observe this attitude of thought in its extreme form;\nand we shall accordingly first of all examine its second and inferior\naspect as a philosophic system. One of the clearest instances of it,\nand one lying nearest to ourselves, may be found in the Metaphysic of\nthe Past as it subsisted among us previous to the philosophy of Kant.\nIt is however only in reference to the history of philosophy that this\nMetaphysic can be said to belong to the past: the thing is always and\nat all places to be found, as the view which the abstract understanding\ntakes of the objects of reason. And it is in this point that the real\nand immediate good lies of a closer examination of its main scope and\nits _modus operandi._\n28.] This metaphysical system took the laws and forms of thought to be\nthe fundamental laws and forms of things. It assumed that to think a\nthing was the means of finding its very self and nature: and to that\nextent it occupied higher ground than the Critical. Philosophy which\nsucceeded it. But in the first instance (i) _these terms of thought\nwere cut off from their connexion,_ their solidarity; each was believed\nvalid by itself and capable of serving as a predicate of the truth. It\nwas the general assumption of this metaphysic that a knowledge of the\nAbsolute was gained by assigning predicates to it. It neither inquired\nwhat the terms of the understanding specially meant or what they were\nworth, nor did it test the method which characterises the Absolute by\nthe assignment of predicates.\nAs an example of such predicates may be taken; Existence, in the\nproposition, 'God has existence:' Finitude or Infinity, as in the\nquestion, 'Is the world-finite or infinite?': Simple and Complex,\nin the proposition, 'The soul is simple,'--or again, 'The thing is\na unity, a whole,' &c. Nobody asked whether such predicates had any\nintrinsic and independent truth, or if the propositional form could be\na form of truth.\nThe Metaphysic of the past assumed, as unsophisticated belief always\ndoes that thought apprehends the very self of things, and that things,\nto become what they truly are, require to be thought. For Nature and\nthe human soul are a very Proteus in their perpetual transformations;\nand it soon occurs to the observer that the first crude impression of\nthings is not their essential being.--This is a point of view the very\nreverse of the result arrived at by the Critical Philosophy; a result,\nof which it may be said, that it bade man go and feed on mere husks and\nchaff.\nWe must look more closely into the procedure of that old metaphysic.\nIn the first place it never went beyond the province of the analytic\nunderstanding. Without preliminary inquiry it adopted the abstract\ncategories of thought and let them rank as predicates of truth. But in\nusing the term thought we must not forget the difference between finite\nor discursive thinking and the thinking which is infinite and rational.\nThe categories, as they meet us _prima facie_ and in isolation, are\nfinite forms. But truth is always infinite, and cannot be expressed\nor presented to consciousness in finite terms. The phrase _infinite\nthought_ may excite surprise, if we adhere to the modern conception\nthat thought is always limited. But it is, speaking rightly, the very\nessence of thought to be infinite. The nominal explanation of calling\na thing finite is that it has an end, that it exists up to a certain\npoint only, where it comes into contact with, and is limited by, its\nother. The finite therefore subsists in reference to its other, which\nis its negation and presents itself as its limit. Now thought is always\nin its own sphere; its relations are with itself, and it is its own\nobject. In having a thought for object, I am at home with myself.\nThe thinking power, the 'I,' is therefore infinite, because, when it\nthinks, it is in relation to an object which is itself. Generally\nspeaking, an object means a something else, a negative confronting me.\nBut in the case where thought thinks itself, it has an object which\nis at the same time no object: in other words, its objectivity is\nsuppressed and transformed into an idea. Thought, as thought, therefore\nin its unmixed nature involves no limits; it is finite only when it\nkeeps to limited categories, which it believes to be ultimate. Infinite\nor speculative thought, on the contrary, while it no less defines,\ndoes in the very act of limiting and defining make that defect vanish.\nAnd so infinity is not, as most frequently happens, to be conceived as\nan abstract away and away for ever and ever, but in the simple manner\npreviously indicated.\nThe thinking of the old metaphysical system was finite. Its whole mode\nof action was regulated by categories, the limits of which it believed\nto be permanently fixed and not subject to any further negation. Thus,\none of its questions was: Has God existence? The question supposes that\nexistence is an altogether positive term, a sort of _ne plus ultra._\nWe shall see however at a later point that existence is by no means a\nmerely positive term, but one which is toe low for the Absolute Idea,\nand unworthy of God. A second question in these metaphysical systems\nwas: Is the world finite or infinite? The very terms of the question\nassume that the finite is a permanent contradictory to the infinite:\nand one can easily see that, when they are so opposed, the infinite,\nwhich of course ought to be the whole, only appears as a single aspect\nand suffers restriction from the finite. But a restricted infinity is\nitself only a finite. In the same way it was asked whether the soul was\nsimple or composite. Simpleness was, in other words, taken to be an\nultimate characteristic, giving expression to a whole truth. Far from\nbeing so, simpleness is the expression of a half-truth, as one-sided\nand abstract as existence:--a term of thought, which, as we shall\nhereafter see, is itself untrue and hence unable to hold truth. If the\nsoul be viewed as merely and abstractly simple, it is characterised in\nan inadequate and finite way.\nIt was therefore the main question of the pre-Kantian metaphysic to\ndiscover whether predicates of the kind mentioned were to be ascribed\nto its objects. Now these predicates are after all only limited\nformulae of the understanding which, instead of expressing the truth,\nmerely impose a limit. More than this, it should be noted that the\nchief feature of the method lay in 'assigning' or 'attributing'\npredicates to the object that was to be cognised, for example, to\nGod. But attribution is no more than an external reflection about the\nobject: the predicates by which the object is to be determined are\nsupplied from the resources of picture-thought, and are applied in\na mechanical way. Whereas, if we are to have genuine cognition, the\nobject must characterise its own self and not derive its predicates\nfrom without. Even supposing we follow the method of predicating, the\nmind cannot help feeling that predicates of this sort fail to exhaust\nthe object. From the same point of view the Orientals are quite correct\nin calling God the many-named or the myriad-named One. One after\nanother of these finite categories leaves the soul unsatisfied, and\nthe Oriental sage is compelled unceasingly to seek for more and more\nof such predicates. In finite things it is no doubt the case that they\nhave to be characterised through finite predicates: and with these\nthings the understanding finds proper scope for its special action.\nItself finite, it knows only the nature of the finite. Thus, when\nI call some action a theft, I have characterised the action in its\nessential facts: and such a knowledge is sufficient for the judge.\nSimilarly, finite things stand to each other as cause and effect,\nforce and exercise, and when they are apprehended in these categories,\nthey are known in their finitude. But the objects of reason cannot be\ndefined by these finite predicates. To try to do so was the defect of\nthe old metaphysic.\n29.] Predicates of this kind, taken individually, have but a limited\nrange of meaning, and no one can fail to perceive how inadequate they\nare, and how far they fall below the fulness of detail which our\nimaginative thought gives, in the case, for example, of God, Mind, or\nNature. Besides, though the fact of their being all predicates of one\nsubject supplies them with a certain connexion, their several meanings\nkeep them apart: and consequently each is brought in as a stranger in\nrelation to the others.\nThe first of these defects the Orientals sought to remedy, when, for\nexample, they defined God by attributing to Him many names; but still\nthey felt that the number of names would have had to be infinite.\n30.] (2) In the second place, _the metaphysical systems adopted a\nwrong criterion._ Their objects were no doubt totalities which in\ntheir own proper selves belong to reason,--that is, to the organised\nand systematically-developed universe, of thought. But these\ntotalities--God, the Soul, the World,--were taken by the metaphysician\nas subjects made and ready, to form the basis for an application of\nthe categories of the understanding. They were assumed from popular\nconception. Accordingly popular conception was the only canon for\nsettling whether or not the predicates were suitable and sufficient.\n31.] The common conceptions of God, the Soul, the World, may be\nsupposed to afford thought a firm and fast footing. They do not really\ndo so. Besides having, a particular and subjective character clinging\nto them, and thus leaving room for great variety of interpretation,\nthey themselves first of all require a firm and fast definition by\nthought. This may be seen in any of these propositions where the\npredicate, or in philosophy the category, is needed to indicate what\nthe subject, or the conception we start with, is.\nIn such a sentence as 'God is eternal,' we begin with the conception of\nGod, not knowing as yet what he is: to tell us that, is the business of\nthe predicate. In the principles of logic, accordingly, where the terms\nformulating the subject-matter are those of thought only, it is not\nmerely superfluous to make these categories predicates to propositions\nin which God, or, still vaguer, the Absolute, is the subject, but it\nwould also have the disadvantage of suggesting another canon than\nthe nature of thought. Besides, the propositional form (and for\nproposition, it would be more correct to substitute judgment) is not\nsuited to express the concrete--and the true is always concrete--or\nthe speculative. Every judgment is by its form one-sided and, to that\nextent, false.\nThis metaphysic was not free or objective thinking. Instead of letting\nthe object freely and spontaneously expound its own characteristics,\nmetaphysic pre-supposed it ready-made. If any one wishes to know what\nfree thought means, he must go to Greek philosophy: for Scholasticism,\nlike these metaphysical systems, accepted its facts, and accepted them\nas a dogma from the authority of the Church. We moderns, too, by our\nwhole up-bringing, have been initiated into ideas which it is extremely\ndifficult to overstep, on account of their far-reaching significance.\nBut the ancient philosophers were in a different position. They were\nmen who lived wholly in the perceptions of the senses, and who,\nafter their rejection of mythology and its fancies, pre-supposed\nnothing but the heaven above and the earth around. In these material,\nnon-metaphysical surroundings, thought is free and enjoys its own\nprivacy,--cleared of everything material, and thoroughly at home. This\nfeeling that we are all our own is characteristic of free thought--of\nthat voyage into the open, where nothing is below us or above us, and\nwe stand in solitude with ourselves alone.\n32.] (3) In the third place, _this system of metaphysic turned into\nDogmatism._ When our thought never ranges beyond narrow and rigid\nterms, we are forced to assume that of two opposite assertions, such as\nwere the above propositions, the one must be true and the other false.\nDogmatism may be most simply described as the contrary of Scepticism.\nThe ancient Sceptics gave the name of Dogmatism to every philosophy\nwhatever holding a system of definite doctrine. In this large sense\nScepticism may apply the name even to philosophy which is properly\nSpeculative. But in the narrower sense, Dogmatism consists in the\ntenacity which draws a hard and fast line between certain terms\nand others opposite to them. We may see this clearly in the strict\n'Either--or': for instance, The world is either finite or infinite;\nbut one of these two it must be. The contrary of this rigidity is the\ncharacteristic of all Speculative truth. There no such inadequate\nformulae are allowed, nor can they possibly exhaust it. These formulae\nSpeculative truth holds in union as a totality, whereas, Dogmatism\ninvests them in their isolation with a title to fixity and truth.\nIt often happens in philosophy that the half-truth takes its place\nbeside the whole truth and assumes on its own account the position\nof something permanent. But the fact is that the half-truth, instead\nof being a fixed or self-subsistent principle, is a mere element\nabsolved and included in the whole. The metaphysic of understanding is\ndogmatic, because it maintains half-truths in their isolation: whereas\nthe idealism of speculative philosophy carries out the principle of\ntotality and shows that it can reach beyond the inadequate formularies\nof abstract thought. Thus idealism would say:--The soul is neither\nfinite only, nor infinite only; it is really the one just as much as\nthe other, and in that way neither the one nor the other. In other\nwords; such formularies in their isolation are inadmissible, and only\ncome into account as formative elements in a larger notion. Such\nidealism we see even in the ordinary phases of consciousness. Thus we\nsay of sensible things, that they are changeable: that is, they _are,_\nbut it is equally true that they are _not._ We show more obstinacy\nin dealing with the categories of the understanding. These are terms\nwhich we believe to be somewhat firmer--or even absolutely firm and\nfast. We look upon them as separated from each other by an infinite\nchasm, so that opposite categories can never get at each other. The\nbattle of reason is the struggle to break up the rigidity to which the\nunderstanding has reduced everything.\n33.] The _first_ part of this metaphysic in its systematic form is\nOntology, or the doctrine of the abstract characteristics of Being.\nThe multitude of these characteristics, and the limits set to their\napplicability, are not founded upon any principle. They have in\nconsequence to be enumerated as experience and circumstances direct,\nand the import ascribed to them is founded only upon common sensualised\nconceptions, upon assertions that particular words are used in a\nparticular sense, and even perhaps upon etymology. If experience\npronounces the list to be complete, and if the usage of language, by\nits agreement, shows the analysis to be correct, the metaphysician is\nsatisfied; and the intrinsic and independent truth and necessity of\nsuch characteristics is never made a matter of investigation at all.\nTo ask if being, existence, finitude, simplicity, complexity, &c. are\nnotions intrinsically and independently true, must surprise those who\nbelieve that a question about truth can only concern propositions (as\nto whether a notion is or is not with truth to be attributed, as the\nphrase is, to a subject), and that falsehood lies in the contradiction\nexisting between the subject in our ideas, and the notion to be\npredicated of it. Now as the notion is concrete, it and every character\nof it in general is essentially a self-contained unity of distinct\ncharacteristics. If truth then were nothing more than the absence\nof contradiction, it would be first of all necessary in the case of\nevery-notion to examine whether it, taken individually, did not contain\nthis sort of intrinsic contradiction.\n34.] The _second_ branch of the metaphysical system was Rational\nPsychology or Pneumatology. It dealt with the metaphysical nature of\nthe Soul,--that is, of the Mind regarded as a thing. It expected to\nfind immortality in a sphere dominated by the laws of composition,\ntime, qualitative change, and quantitative increase or decrease.\nThe name 'rational,' given to this species of psychology, served\nto contrast it with empirical modes of observing the phenomena of\nthe soul. Rational psychology viewed the soul in its metaphysical\nnature, and through the categories supplied by abstract thought. The\nrationalists endeavoured to ascertain the inner nature of the soul as\nit is in itself and as it is for thought.--In philosophy at present we\nhear little of the soul: the favourite term now is mind (spirit). The\ntwo are distinct, soul being as it were the middle term between body\nand spirit, or the bond between the two. The mind, as soul, is immersed\nin corporeity, and the soul is the animating principle of the body.\nThe pre-Kantian metaphysic, we say, viewed the soul as a thing. 'Thing'\nis a very ambiguous word. By a thing, we mean, firstly, an immediate\nexistence, something we represent in sensuous form: and in this meaning\nthe term has been applied to the soul. Hence the question regarding the\nseat of the soul. Of course, if the soul have a seat, it is in space\nand sensuously envisaged. So, too, if the soul be viewed as a thing,\nwe can ask whether the soul is simple or composite. The question is\nimportant as bearing on the immortality of the soul, which is supposed\nto depend on the absence of composition. But the fact is, that in\nabstract simplicity we have a category, which as little corresponds to\nthe nature of the soul, as that of compositeness.\nOne word on the relation of rational to empirical psychology. The\nformer, because it sets itself to apply thought to cognise mind and\neven to demonstrate the result of such thinking, is the higher; whereas\nempirical psychology starts from perception, and only recounts and\ndescribes what perception supplies. But if we propose to think the\nmind, we must not be quite so shy of its special phenomena. Mind is\nessentially active in the same sense as the Schoolmen said that God\nis 'absolute actuosity.' But if the mind is active it must as it were\nutter itself. It is wrong therefore to take the mind for a processless\n_ens,_ as did the old metaphysic which divided the processless inward\nlife of the mind from its outward life. The mind, of all things, must\nbe looked at in its concrete actuality, in its energy; and in such a\nway that its manifestations are seen to be determined by its inward\nforce.\n35.] The _third_ branch of metaphysics was Cosmology. The topics\nit embraced were the world, its contingency, necessity, eternity,\nlimitation in time and space: the laws (only formal) of its changes:\nthe freedom of man and the origin of evil.\nTo these topics it applied what were believed to be thorough-going\ncontrasts: such as contingency and necessity; external and internal\nnecessity; efficient and final cause, or causality in general and\ndesign; essence or substance and phenomenon; form and matter; freedom\nand necessity; happiness and pain; good and evil.\nThe object of Cosmology comprised not merely Nature, but Mind too, in\nits external complication in its phenomenon--in fact, existence in\ngeneral, or the sum of finite things. This object however it viewed not\nas a concrete whole, but only under certain abstract points of view.\nThus the questions Cosmology attempted to solve were such as these: Is\naccident or necessity dominant in the world? Is the world eternal or\ncreated? It was therefore a chief concern of this study to lay down\nwhat were called general Cosmological laws: for instance, that Nature\ndoes not act by fits and starts. And by fits and starts (_saltus_) they\nmeant a qualitative difference or qualitative alteration showing itself\nwithout any antecedent determining mean: whereas, on the contrary, a\ngradual change (of quantity) is obviously not without intermediation.\nIn regard to Mind as it makes itself felt in the world, the questions\nwhich Cosmology chiefly discussed turned upon the freedom of man and\nthe origin of evil. Nobody can deny that these are questions of the\nhighest importance. But to give them a satisfactory answer, it is above\nall things necessary not to claim finality for the abstract formulae\nof understanding, or to suppose that each of the two terms in an\nantithesis has an independent-subsistence or can be treated in its\nisolation as a complete and self-centred truth. This however is the\ngeneral position taken by the metaphysicians before Kant, and appears\nin their cosmological discussions, which for that reason were incapable\nof compassing their purpose, to understand the phenomena of the world.\nObserve how they proceed with the distinction between freedom and\nnecessity, in their application of these categories to Nature and\nMind. Nature they regard as subject in its workings to necessity;\nMind they hold to be free. No doubt there is a real foundation for\nthis distinction in the very core of the Mind itself: but freedom and\nnecessity, when thus abstractly opposed, are terms applicable only in\nthe finite world to which, as such, they belong. A freedom involving no\nnecessity, and mere necessity without freedom, are abstract and in this\nway untrue formulae of [thought. Freedom is no blank indeterminateness:\nessentially concrete, and unvaryingly self-determinate, it is so far at\nthe same time necessary. Necessity, again, in the ordinary acceptation\nof the term in popular philosophy, means determination from without\nonly,--as in finite mechanics, where a body moves only when it is\nstruck by another body, and moves in the direction communicated to it\nby the impact.--This however is a merely external necessity, not the\nreal inward necessity which is identical with freedom.\nThe case is similar with the contrast of Good and Evil,--the favourite\ncontrast of the introspective modern world. If we regard Evil as\npossessing a fixity of its own, apart and distinct from Good, we are\nto a certain extent right: there is an opposition between them: nor\ndo those who maintain the apparent and relative character of the\nopposition mean that Evil and Good in the Absolute are one, or, in\naccordance with the modern phrase, that a thing first becomes evil\nfrom our way of looking at it. The error arises when we take Evil as a\npermanent positive, instead of--what it really is--a negative which,\nthough it would fain assert itself, has no real persistence, and is, in\nfact, only the absolute sham-existence of negativity in itself.\n36.] The _fourth_ branch of metaphysics is Natural or Rational\nTheology. The notion of God, or God as a possible being, the proofs of\nhis existence, and his properties, formed the study of this branch.\n(a) When understanding thus discusses the Deity, its main purpose is\nto find what predicates correspond or not to the fact we have in our\nimagination as God. And in so doing it assumes the contrast between\npositive and negative to be absolute; and hence, in the long run,\nnothing is left for the notion as understanding takes it, but the empty\nabstraction of indeterminate Being, of mere reality or positivity, the\nlifeless product of modern 'Deism.'\n(b) The method of demonstration employed in finite knowledge must\nalways lead to an inversion of the true order. For it requires the\nstatement of some objective ground for God's being, which thus acquires\nthe appearance of being derived from something else. This mode of\nproof, guided as it is by the canon of mere analytical identity,\nis embarrassed by the difficulty of passing from the finite to the\ninfinite. Either the finitude of the existing world, which is left as\nmuch a fact as it was before, clings to the notion of Deity, and God\nhas to be defined as the immediate substance of that world,--which is\nPantheism: or He remains an object set over against the subject, and in\nthis way, finite,--which is Dualism.\n(c) The attributes of God which ought to be various and precise, had,\nproperly speaking, sunk and disappeared in the abstract notion of pure\nreality, of indeterminate Being. Yet in our material thought, the\nfinite world continues, meanwhile, to have a real being, with God as a\nsort of antithesis: and thus arises the further picture of different\nrelations of God to the world. These, formulated as properties, must,\non the one hand, as relations to finite circumstances, themselves\npossess a finite character (giving us such properties as just,\ngracious, mighty, wise, &c.); on the other hand they must be infinite.\nNow on this level of thought the only means, and a hazy one, of\nreconciling these opposing requirements was quantitative exaltation\nof the properties, forcing them into indeterminateness,--into the\n_sensus eminentior._ But it was an expedient which really destroyed the\nproperty and left a mere name.\nThe object of the old metaphysical theology was to see how far\nunassisted reason could go in the knowledge of God. Certainly a\nreason-derived knowledge of God is the highest problem of philosophy.\nThe earliest teachings of religion are figurate conceptions of God.\nThese conceptions, as the Creed arranges them, are imparted to us in\nyouth. They are the doctrines of our religion, and in so far as the\nindividual rests his faith on these doctrines and feels them to be\nthe truth, he has all he needs as a Christian. Such is faith: and the\nscience of this faith is Theology. But until Theology is something more\nthan a bare enumeration and compilation of these doctrines _ab extra,_\nit has no right to the title of science. Even the method so much in\nvogue at present--the purely historical mode of treatment--which for\nexample reports what has been said by this or the other Father of the\nChurch--does not invest theology with a scientific character. To get\nthat, we must go on to comprehend the facts by thought,--which is the\nbusiness of philosophy. Genuine theology is thus at the same time a\nreal philosophy of religion, as it was, we may add, in the Middle Ages.\nAnd now let us examine this rational theology more narrowly. It was\na science which approached God not by reason but by understanding,\nand, in its mode of thought, employed the terms without any sense of\ntheir mutual limitations and connexions. The notion of God formed the\nsubject of discussion; and yet the criterion of our knowledge was\nderived from such an extraneous source as the materialised conception\nof God. Now thought must be free in its movements. It is no doubt to\nbe remembered, that the result of independent thought harmonises with\nthe import of the Christian religion:--for the Christian religion is\na revelation of reason. But such a harmony surpassed the efforts of\nrational theology. It proposed to define the figurate conception of God\nin terms of thought; but it resulted in a notion of God which was what\nwe may call the abstract of positivity or reality, to the exclusion\nof all negation. God was accordingly defined to be the most real of\nall beings. Any one can see however that this most real of beings, in\nwhich negation forms no part, is the very opposite of what it ought\nto be and of what understanding supposes it to be. Instead of being\nrich and full above all measure, it is so narrowly conceived that it\nis, on the contrary, extremely poor and altogether empty. It is with\nreason that the heart craves a concrete body of truth; but without\ndefinite feature, that is, without negation, contained in the notion,\nthere can only be an abstraction. When the notion of God is apprehended\nonly as that of the abstract or most real being, God is, as it were,\nrelegated to another world beyond: and to speak of a knowledge of him\nwould be meaningless. Where there is no definite quality, knowledge is\nimpossible. Mere light is mere darkness.\nThe second problem of rational theology was to prove the existence\nof God. Now, in this matter, the main point to be noted is\nthat demonstration, as the understanding employs it, means the\ndependence of one truth on another. In such proofs we have a\npre-supposition--something firm and fast, from which something else\nfollows; we exhibit the dependence of some truth from an assumed\nstarting-point. Hence, if this mode of demonstration is applied to the\nexistence of God, it can only mean that the being of God is to depend\non other terms, which will then constitute the ground of his being.\nIt is at once evident that this will lead I to some mistake: for God\nmust be simply and solely the I ground of everything, and in so far\nnot dependent upon anything else. And a perception of this danger has\nin modern times led some to say that God's existence is not capable\nof proof, but must be immediately or intuitively apprehended. Reason,\nhowever, and even sound common sense give demonstration a meaning quite\ndifferent from that of the understanding. The demonstration of reason\nno doubt starts from something which is not God. But, as it advances,\nit does not leave the starting-point a mere unexplained fact, which is\nwhat it was. On the contrary it exhibits that point as derivative and\ncalled into being, and then God is seen to be primary, truly immediate\nand self-subsisting, with the means of derivation wrapt up and absorbed\nin himself. Those who say: 'Consider Nature, and Nature will-lead you\nto God; you will find an absolute final cause: 'do not mean that God\nis something derivative: they mean that it is we who proceed to God\nhimself from another; and in this way God, though the consequence, is\nalso the absolute' ground of the initial step. The relation of the two\nthings is reversed; and what came as a consequence, being shown to be\nan antecedent, the original antecedent is reduced to a consequence.\nThis is always the way, moreover, whenever reason demonstrates.\nIf in the light of the present discussion we cast one glance more on\nthe metaphysical method as a whole, we find its main characteristic\nwas to make abstract identity its principle and to try to apprehend\nthe objects of reason by the abstract and finite categories of the\nunderstanding. But this infinite of the understanding, this pure\nessence, is still finite: it has excluded all the variety of particular\nthings, which thus limit and deny it. Instead of winning a concrete,\nthis metaphysic stuck fast on an abstract, identity. Its good point was\nthe perception that thought alone constitutes the essence of all that\nis. It derived its materials from earlier philosophers, particularly\nthe Schoolmen. In speculative philosophy the understanding undoubtedly\nforms a stage, but not a stage at which we should keep for ever\nstanding. Plato is no metaphysician of this imperfect type, still less\nAristotle, although the contrary is generally believed.\nCHAPTER IV.\nSECOND ATTITUDE OF THOUGHT TO OBJECTIVITY.\nI. _Empiricism._\n37.] Under these circumstances a double want began to be felt. Partly\nit was the need of a concrete subject-matter, as a counterpoise to the\nabstract theories of the understanding, which is unable to advance\nunaided from its generalities to specialisation and determination.\nPartly, too, it was the demand for something fixed and secure, so as\nto exclude the possibility of proving anything and everything in the\nsphere, and according to the method, of the finite formulae of thought.\nSuch was the genesis of Empirical philosophy, which abandons the search\nfor truth in thought itself, and goes to fetch it from Experience, the\noutward and the inward present.\nThe rise of Empiricism is due to the need thus stated of concrete\ncontents, and a firm footing--needs which the abstract metaphysic of\nthe understanding failed to satisfy. Now by concreteness of contents\nit is meant that we must know the objects of consciousness as\nintrinsically determinate and as the unity of distinct characteristics.\nBut, as we have already seen, this is by no means the case with the\nmetaphysic of understanding, if it conform to its principle. With the\nmere understanding, thinking is limited to the form of an abstract\nuniversal, and can never advance to the particularisation of this\nuniversal. Thus we find the metaphysicians engaged in an attempt to\nelicit by the instrumentality of thought, what was the essence or\nfundamental attribute of the Soul The Soul, they said, is simple.\nThe simplicity thus ascribed to the Soul meant a mere and utter\nsimplicity, from which difference is excluded: difference, or in other\nwords composition, being made the fundamental attribute of body, or\nof matter in general. Clearly, in simplicity of this narrow type we\nhave a very shallow category, quite incapable of embracing the wealth\nof the soul or of the mind. When it thus appeared that abstract\nmetaphysical thinking was inadequate, it was felt that resource must be\nhad to empirical psychology. The same happened in the case of Rational\nPhysics. The current phrases there were, for instance, that space is\ninfinite, that Nature makes no leap, &c. Evidently this phraseology was\nwholly unsatisfactory in presence of the plenitude and life of nature.\n38.] To some extent this source from which Empiricism draws is common\nto it with metaphysic. It is in our materialised conceptions, _i.e._\nin facts which emanate, in the first instance, from experience,\nthat metaphysic also finds the guarantee for the correctness of its\ndefinitions (including both its initial assumptions and its more\ndetailed body of doctrine). But, on the other hand, it must be noted\nthat the single sensation is not the same thing as experience, and\nthat the Empirical School elevates the facts included under sensation,\nfeeling, and perception into the form of general ideas, propositions or\nlaws. This, however, it does with the reservation that these general\nprinciples (such as force), are to have no further import or validity\nof their own beyond that taken from the sense-impression, and that\nno connexion shall be deemed legitimate except what can be shown to\nexist in phenomena. And on the subjective side Empirical cognition has\nits stable footing in the fact that in a sensation consciousness is\ndirectly present and certain of itself.\nIn Empiricism lies the great principle that whatever is true must\nbe in the actual world and present to sensation. This principle\ncontradicts that 'ought to be' on the strength of which 'reflection'\nis vain enough to treat the actual present with scorn and to point to\na scene beyond--a scene which is assumed to have place and being only\nin the understanding of those who talk of it. No less than Empiricism,\nphilosophy (\u00a7 7) recognises only what is, and has nothing to do with\nwhat merely ought to be and what is thus confessed not to exist. On the\nsubjective side, too, it is right to notice the valuable principle of\nfreedom involved in Empiricism. For the main lesson of Empiricism is\nthat man must see for himself and feel that he is present in every fact\nof knowledge which he has to accept.\nWhen it is carried out to its legitimate consequences,\nEmpiricism--being in its facts limited to the finite sphere--denies the\nsuper-sensible in general, or at least any knowledge of it which would\ndefine its nature; it leaves thought no powers except abstraction and\nformal universality and identity. But there is a fundamental delusion\nin all scientific empiricism. It employs the metaphysical categories of\nmatter, force, those of one, many, generality, infinity, &c.; following\nthe clue given by these categories it proceeds to draw conclusions, and\nin so doing pre-supposes and applies the syllogistic form. And all the\nwhile it is unaware that it contains metaphysics--in wielding which, it\nmakes use of those categories and their combinations in a style utterly\nthoughtless and uncritical.\n*       *       *       *       *\nFrom Empiricism came the cry: 'Stop roaming in empty abstractions, keep\nyour eyes open, lay hold on man and nature as they are here before\nyou, enjoy the present moment.' Nobody can deny that there is a good\ndeal of truth in these words. The every-day world, what is here and\nnow, was a good exchange for the futile other-world--for the mirages\nand the chimeras of the abstract understanding. And thus was acquired\nan infinite principle,--that solid footing so much missed in the old\nmetaphysic. Finite principles are the most that the understanding\ncan pick out--and these being essentially unstable and tottering,\nthe structure they supported must collapse with a crash. Always the\ninstinct of reason was to find an infinite principle. As yet, the\ntime had not come for finding it in thought. Hence, this instinct\nseized upon the present, the Here, the This,--where doubtless there is\nimplicit infinite form, but not in the genuine existence of that form.\nThe external world is the truth, if it could but know it: for the truth\nis actual and must exist. The infinite principle, the self-centred\ntruth, therefore, is in the world for reason to discover: though it\nexists in an individual and sensible shape, and not in its truth.\nBesides, this school makes sense-perception the form in which fact\nis to be apprehended: and in this consists the defect of Empiricism.\nSense-perception as such is always individual, always transient: not\nindeed that the process of knowledge stops short at sensation: on the\ncontrary, it proceeds to find out the universal and permanent element\nin the individual apprehended by sense. This is the process leading\nfrom simple perception to experience.\nIn order to form experiences, Empiricism makes especial use of the\nform of Analysis. In the impression of sense we have a concrete of\nmany elements, the several attributes of which we are expected to\npeel off one by one, like the coats of an onion. In thus dismembering\nthe thing, it is understood that we disintegrate and take to pieces\nthese attributes which have coalesced, and add nothing but our own\nact of disintegration. Yet analysis is the process from the immediacy\nof sensation to thought: those attributes, which the object analysed\ncontains in union, acquire the form of universality by being separated.\nEmpiricism therefore labours under a delusion, if it supposes that,\nwhile analysing the objects, it leaves them as they were: it really\ntransforms the concrete into an abstract. And as a consequence of this\nchange the living thing is killed: life can exist only in the concrete\nand one. Not that we can do without this division, if it be our\nintention to comprehend. Mind itself is an inherent division. The error\nlies in forgetting that this is only one-half of the process, and that\nthe main point is the re-union of what has been parted. And it is where\nanalysis never gets beyond the stage of partition that the words of the\npoet are true:\n_'Encheiresin Naturae_ nennt's die Chemie,\nSpottet ihrer Selbst, und weiss nicht, wie:\nHat die Teile in Ihrer Hand\nFehlt leider nur das geistige Band.'\nAnalysis starts from the concrete; and the possession of this material\ngives it a considerable advantage over the abstract thinking of the\nold metaphysics. It establishes the differences in things: and this is\nvery important: but these very differences are nothing after all but\nabstract attributes, _e.g._ thoughts. These thoughts, it is assumed,\ncontain the real essence of the objects; and thus once more we see the\naxiom of bygone metaphysics reappear, that the truth of things lies in\nthought.\nLet us next compare the empirical theory with that of metaphysics in\nthe matter of their respective contents. We find the latter, as already\nstated, taking for its theme the universal objects of the reason, viz.\nGod, the Soul, and the World: and these themes, accepted from popular\nconception, it was the problem of philosophy to reduce into the form\nof thoughts. Another specimen of the same method was the Scholastic\nphilosophy, the theme pre-supposed by which was formed by the dogmas\nof the Christian Church: and it aimed at fixing their meaning and\ngiving them a systematic arrangement through thought.--The facts on\nwhich Empiricism is based are of entirely different kind. They are\nthe sensible facts of nature and the facts of the finite mind. In\nother words, Empiricism deals with a finite material--and the old\nmetaphysicians had an infinite,--though, let us add, they made this\ninfinite content finite by the finite form of the understanding. The\nsame finitude of form reappears in Empiricism--but here the facts are\nfinite also. To this exigent, then, both modes of philosophising have\nthe same method; both proceed from data or assumptions, which they\naccept as ultimate. Generally speaking, Empiricism finds the truth in\nthe outward world; and even if it allow a super-sensible world, it\nholds knowledge of that world to be impossible, and would restrict us\nto the province of sense-perception. This doctrine when systematically\ncarried out produces what has been latterly termed Materialism.\nMaterialism of this stamp looks upon matter, _qu\u00e2_ matter, as the\ngenuine objective world. But with matter we are at once introduced\nto an abstraction, which as such cannot be perceived: and it may be\nmaintained that there is no matter, because, as it exists, it is always\nsomething definite and concrete. Yet the abstraction we term matter is\nsupposed to lie at the basis of the whole world of sense, and expresses\nthe sense-world in its simplest terms as out-and-out individualisation,\nand hence a congeries of points in mutual exclusion. So long then as\nthis sensible sphere is and continues to be for Empiricism a mere\ndatum, we have a doctrine of bondage: for we become free, when we\nare confronted by no absolutely alien world, but depend upon a fact\nwhich we ourselves are. Consistently with the empirical point of view,\nbesides, reason and unreason can only be subjective: in other words,\nwe must take what is given just as it is, and we have no right to ask\nwhether and to what extent it is rational in its own nature.\n39.] Touching this principle it has been justly observed that in\nwhat we call Experience, as distinct from mere single perception of\nsingle facts, there are two elements. The one is the matter, infinite\nin its multiplicity, and as it stands a mere set of singulars: the\nother is the form, the characteristics of universality and necessity.\nMere experience no doubt offers many, perhaps innumerable cases of\nsimilar perceptions: but, after all, no multitude, however great,\ncan be the same thing as universality. Similarly, mere experience\naffords perceptions of changes succeeding each other and of objects in\njuxtaposition; but it presents no necessary connexion. If perception,\ntherefore, is to maintain its claim to be the sole basis of what\nmen hold for truth, universality and necessity appear something\nillegitimate: they become an accident of our minds, a mere custom, the\ncontent of which might be otherwise constituted than it is.\nIt is an important corollary of this theory, that on this empirical\nmode of treatment legal and ethical principles and laws, as well as the\ntruths of religion, are exhibited as the work of chance, and stripped\nof their objective character and inner truth.\nThe scepticism of Hume, to which this conclusion was chiefly due,\nshould be clearly marked off from Greek scepticism. Hume assumes the\ntruth of the empirical element, feeling and sensation, and proceeds to\nchallenge universal principles and laws, because they have no warranty\nfrom sense-perception. So far was ancient scepticism from making\nfeeling and sensation the canon of truth, that it turned against the\ndeliverances of sense first of all. (On Modern Scepticism as compared\nwith Ancient, see Schelling and Hegel's Critical Journal of Philosophy:\n1802, vol. I. i.)\nII. _The Critical Philosophy._\n40.] In common with Empiricism the Critical Philosophy assumes that\nexperience affords the one sole foundation for cognitions; which\nhowever it does not allow to rank as truths, but only as knowledge of\nphenomena.\nThe Critical theory starts originally from the distinction of elements\npresented in the analysis of experience, viz. the matter of sense, and\nits universal relations. Taking into account Hume's criticism on this\ndistinction as given in the preceding section, viz. that sensation\ndoes not explicitly apprehend more than an individual or more than a\nmere event, it insists at the same time on the _fact_ that universality\nand necessity are seen to perform a function equally essential in\nconstituting what is called experience. This element, not being derived\nfrom the empirical facts as such, must belong to the spontaneity of\nthought; in other words, it is _a priori._ The Categories or Notions\nof the Understanding constitute the _objectivity_ of experiential\ncognitions. In every case they involve a connective reference, and\nhence through their means are formed synthetic judgments _a priori,_\nthat is, primary and underivative connexions of opposites.\nEven Hume's scepticism does not deny that the characteristics of\nuniversality and necessity are found in cognition. And even in Kant\nthis fact remains a presupposition after all; it may be said, to use\nthe ordinary phraseology of the sciences, that Kant did no more than\noffer another _explanation_ of the fact.\n41.] The Critical Philosophy proceeds to test the value of the\ncategories employed in metaphysic, as well as in other sciences\nand in ordinary conception. This scrutiny however is not directed\nto the content of these categories, nor does it inquire into the\nexact relation they bear to one another: but simply considers them\nas affected by the contrast between subjective and objective. The\ncontrast, as we are to understand it here, bears upon the distinction\n(see preceding \u00a7) of the two elements in experience. The name of\nobjectivity is here given to the element of universality and necessity,\n_i.e._ to the categories themselves, or what is called the _a priori_\nconstituent. The Critical Philosophy however widened the contrast in\nsuch away, that the subjectivity comes to embrace the _ensemble_ of\nexperience, including both of the aforesaid elements; and nothing\nremains on the other side but the 'thing-in-itself.'\nThe special forms of the _a priori_ element, in other words, of\nthought, which in spite of its objectivity is looked upon as a purely\nsubjective act, present themselves as follows in a systematic order\nwhich, it may be remarked, is solely based upon psychological and\nhistorical grounds.\n*       *       *       *       *\n(1) A very important step was undoubtedly made, when the terms of the\nold metaphysic were subjected to scrutiny. The plain thinker pursued\nhis unsuspecting way in those categories which had offered themselves\nnaturally. It never occurred to him to ask to what extent these\ncategories had a value and authority of their own. If, as has been\nsaid, it is characteristic of free thought to allow no assumptions to\npass unquestioned, the old metaphysicians were not free thinkers. They\naccepted their categories as they were, without further trouble, as an\n_a priori_ datum, not yet tested by reflection. The Critical philosophy\nreversed this. Kant undertook to examine how far the forms of thought\nwere capable of leading to the knowledge of truth. In particular he\ndemanded a criticism of the faculty of cognition as preliminary to\nits exercise. That is a fair demand, if it mean that even the forms\nof thought must be made an object of investigation. Unfortunately\nthere soon creeps in the misconception of already knowing before _you_\nknow,--the error of refusing to enter the water until you have learnt\nto swim. True, indeed, the forms of thought should be subjected to a\nscrutiny before they are used: yet what is this scrutiny but _ipso\nfacto_ a cognition? So that what we want is to combine in our process\nof inquiry the action of the forms of thought with a criticism of\nthem. The forms of thought must be studied in their essential nature\nand complete development: they are at once the object of research and\nthe action of that object. Hence they examine themselves: in their own\naction they must determine their limits, and point out their defects.\nThis is that action of thought, which will hereafter be specially\nconsidered under the name of Dialectic, and regarding which we need\nonly at the outset observe that, instead of being brought to bear upon\nthe categories from without, it is immanent in their own action.\nWe may therefore state the first point in Kant's philosophy as follows:\nThought must itself investigate its own capacity of knowledge. People\nin the present day have got over Kant and his philosophy: everybody\nwants to get further. But there are two ways of going further--a\nback-, ward and a forward. The light of criticism soon shows that many\nof our modern essays in philosophy are mere repetitions of the old\nmetaphysical method, an endless and uncritical thinking in a groove\ndetermined by the natural bent of each man's mind.\n(2) Kant's examination of the categories suffers from the grave defect\nof viewing them, not absolutely and for their own sake, but in order to\nsee whether they are _subjective_ or _objective._ In the language of\ncommon life we mean by objective what exists outside of us and reaches\nus from without by means of sensation. What Kant did, was to deny that\nthe categories, such as cause and effect, were, in this sense of the\nword, objective, or given in sensation, and to maintain on the contrary\nthat they belonged to our own thought itself, to the spontaneity of\nthought. To that extent therefore, they were subjective. And yet in\nspite of this, Kant gives the name objective to what is thought, to the\nuniversal and necessary, while he describes as subjective whatever is\nmerely felt. This arrangement apparently reverses the first-mentioned\nuse of the word, and has caused Kant to be charged with confusing\nlanguage. But the charge is unfair if we more narrowly consider the\nfacts of the case. The vulgar believe that the objects of perception\nwhich confront them, such as an individual animal, or a single star,\nare independent and permanent existences, compared with which, thoughts\nare unsubstantial and dependent on something else. In fact however\nthe perceptions of sense are the properly dependent and secondary\nfeature, while the thoughts are really independent and primary. This\nbeing so, Kant gave the title objective to the intellectual factor, to\nthe universal and necessary: and he was quite justified in so doing.\nOur sensations on the other hand are subjective; for sensations lack\nstability in their own nature, and are no less fleeting and evanescent\nthan thought is permanent and self-subsisting. At the present day, the\nspecial line of distinction established by Kant between the subjective\nand objective is adopted by the phraseology of the educated world. Thus\nthe criticism of a work of art ought, it is said, to be not subjective,\nbut objective; in other words, instead of springing from the particular\nand accidental feeling or temper of the moment, it should keep its eye\non those general points of view which the laws of art establish. In\nthe same acceptation we can distinguish in any scientific pursuit the\nobjective and the subjective interest of the investigation.\nBut after all, objectivity of thought, in Kant's sense, is again to\na certain extent subjective. Thoughts, according to Kant, although\nuniversal and necessary categories, are _only our_ thoughts--separated\nby an impassable gulf from the thing, as it exists apart from our\nknowledge. But the true, objectivity of thinking means that the\nthoughts, far from being merely ours, must at the same time be the real\nessence of the things, and of whatever is an object to us.\nObjective and subjective are convenient expressions in current use,\nthe employment of which may easily lead to confusion. Up to this\npoint, the discussion has shown three meanings of objectivity. First,\nit means what has external existence, in distinction from which the\nsubjective is what is only supposed, dreamed, &c. Secondly, it has\nthe meaning, attached to it by Kant, of the universal and necessary,\nas distinguished from the particular, subjective and occasional\nelement which belongs to our sensations. Thirdly, as has been just\nexplained, it means the thought-apprehended essence of the existing\nthing, in contradistinction from what is merely _our_ thought, and what\nconsequently is still separated from the thing itself, as it exists in\nindependent essence.\n42.] (a) The Theoretical Faculty.--Cognition _qu\u00e2_ cognition.\nThe specific ground of the categories is declared by the Critical\nsystem to lie in the primary identity of the 'I' in thought,--what\nKant calls the 'transcendental unity of self-consciousness.'\nThe impressions from feeling and perception are, if we look to\ntheir contents, a multiplicity or miscellany of elements: and the\nmultiplicity is equally conspicuous in their form. For sense is marked\nby a mutual exclusion of members; and that under two aspects, namely\nspace and time, which, being the forms, that is to say, the universal\ntype of perception, are themselves _a priori._ This congeries,\nafforded by sensation and perception, must however be reduced to an\nidentity or primary synthesis. To accomplish this the 'I' brings it in\nrelation to itself and unites it there in _one_ consciousness which\nKant calls 'pure apperception.' The specific modes in which the Ego\nrefers to itself the multiplicity of sense are the pure concepts of the\nunderstanding, the Categories.\nKant, it is well known, did not put himself to much trouble in\ndiscovering the categories. 'I,' the unity of self-consciousness,\nbeing quite abstract and completely indeterminate, the question\narises, how are we to get at the specialised forms of the 'I,' the\ncategories? Fortunately, the common logic offers to our hand an\nempirical classification of the kinds of _judgment._ Now, to judge\nis the same as to _think_ of a determinate object. Hence the various\nmodes of judgment, as enumerated to our hand, provide us with the\nseveral categories of thought. To the philosophy of Fichte belongs\nthe great merit of having called attention to the need of exhibiting\nthe _necessity_ of these categories and giving a genuine _deduction_\nof them. Fichte ought to have produced at least one effect on the\nmethod of logic. One might have expected that the general laws of\nthought, the usual stock-in-trade of logicians, or the classification\nof notions, judgments, and syllogisms, would be no longer taken merely\nfrom observation and so only empirically treated, but be deduced from\nthought itself. If thought is to be capable of proving anything at all,\nif logic must insist upon the necessity of proofs, and if it proposes\nto teach the theory of demonstration, its first care should be to give\na reason for its own subject-matter, and to see that it is necessary.\n(i) Kant therefore holds that the categories have their source in the\n'Ego,' and that the 'Ego' consequently supplies the characteristics\nof universality and necessity. If we observe what we have before us\nprimarily, we may describe it as a congeries or diversity: and in the\ncategories we find the simple points or units, to which this congeries\nis made to converge. The world of sense is a scene of mutual exclusion:\nits being is outside itself. That is the fundamental feature of the\nsensible. 'Now' has no meaning except in reference to a before and a\nhereafter. Red, in the same way, only subsists by being opposed to\nyellow and blue. Now this other thing is outside the sensible; which\nlatter is, only in so far as it is not the other, and only in so far\nas that other is. But thought, or the 'Ego,' occupies a position the\nvery reverse of the sensible, with its mutual exclusions, and its\nbeing outside itself. The 'I' is the primary identity--at one with\nitself and all at home in itself. The word 'I' expresses the mere act\nof bringing-to-bear-upon-self: and whatever is placed in this unit or\nfocus, is affected _by_ it and transformed into it. The 'I' is as it\nwere the crucible and the fire which consumes the loose plurality of\nsense and reduces it to unity. This is the process which Kant calls\npure apperception in distinction from the common apperception, to\nwhich the plurality it receives is a plurality still; whereas pure\napperception is rather an act by which the 'I' makes the materials\n'mine.'\nThis view has at least the merit of giving a correct expression to the\nnature of all consciousness. The tendency of all man's endeavours is to\nunderstand the world, to appropriate and subdue it to himself: and to\nthis end the positive reality of the world must be as it were crushed\nand pounded, in other words, idealised. At the same time we must note\nthat it is not the mere act of _our_ personal self-consciousness, which\nintroduces an absolute unity into the variety of sense. Rather, this\nidentity is itself the absolute. The absolute is, as it were, so kind\nas to leave individual things to their own enjoyment, and it again\ndrives them back to the absolute unity.\n(2) Expressions like 'transcendental unity of self-consciousness' have\nan ugly look about them, and suggest a monster in the background:\nbut their meaning is not so abstruse as it looks. Kant's meaning of\ntranscendental may be gathered by the way he distinguishes it from\ntranscendent. The _transcendent_ may be said to be what steps out\nbeyond the categories of the understanding: a sense in which the term\nis first employed in mathematics. Thus in geometry you are told to\nconceive the circumference of a circle as formed of an infinite number\nof infinitely small straight lines. In other words, characteristics\nwhich the understanding holds to be totally different, the straight\nline and the curve, are expressly invested with identity. Another\ntranscendent of the same kind is the self-consciousness which is\nidentical with itself and infinite in itself, as distinguished from\nthe ordinary consciousness which derives its form and tone from finite\nmaterials. That unity of self-consciousness, however, Kant called\n_transcendental_ only; and he meant thereby that the unity was only in\nour minds and did not attach to the objects apart from our knowledge of\nthem.\n(3) To regard the categories as subjective only, _i.e._ as a part\nof ourselves, must seem very odd to the natural mind; and no doubt\nthere is something queer about it. It is quite true however that the\ncategories are not contained in the sensation as it is given us. When,\nfor instance, we look at a piece of sugar, we find it is hard, white,\nsweet, &c. All these properties we say are united in one object. Now\nit is this unity that is not found in the sensation. The same thing\nhappens if we conceive two events to stand in the relation of cause\nand effect. The senses only inform us of the two several occurrences\nwhich follow each other in time. But that the one is cause, the other\neffect,--in other words, the causal nexus between the two,--is not\nperceived by sense; it is only evident to thought. Still, though the\ncategories, such as unity, or cause and effect, are strictly the\nproperty of thought, it by no means follows that they must be ours\nmerely and not also characteristics of the objects. Kant however\nconfines them to the subject-mind, and his philosophy may be styled\nsubjective idealism: for he holds that both the form and the matter of\nknowledge are supplied by the Ego--or knowing subject--the form by our\nintellectual, the matter by our sentient ego.\nSo far as regards the content of this subjective idealism, not a word\nneed be wasted. It might perhaps at first sight be imagined, that\nobjects would lose their reality when their unity was transferred to\nthe subject. But neither we nor the objects would have anything to gain\nby the mere fact that they possessed being. The main point is not,\nthat they are, but what they are, and whether or not their content\nis true. It does no good to the things to say merely that they have\nbeing. What has being, will also cease to be when time creeps over it.\nIt might also be alleged that subjective idealism tended to promote\nself-conceit. But surely if a man's world be the sum of his sensible\nperceptions, he has no reason to be vain of such a world. Laying aside\ntherefore as unimportant this distinction between subjective and\nobjective, we are chiefly interested in knowing what a thing is: _i.e._\nits content, which is no more objective than it is subjective. If mere\nexistence be enough to make objectivity, even a crime is objective: but\nit is an existence which is nullity at the core, as is definitely made\napparent when the day of punishment comes.\n43.] The Categories may be viewed in two aspects. On the one hand it\nis by their instrumentality that the mere perception of sense rises to\nobjectivity and experience. On the other hand these notions are unities\nin our consciousness merely: they are consequently conditioned by the\nmaterial given to them, and having nothing of their own they can be\napplied to use only within the range of experience. But the other\nconstituent of experience, the impressions of feeling and perception,\nis not one whit less subjective than the categories.\nTo assert that the categories taken by themselves are empty can\nscarcely be right, seeing that they have a content, at all events, in\nthe special stamp and significance which they possess. Of course the\ncontent of the categories is not perceptible to the senses, nor is it\nin time and space: but that is rather a merit than a defect. A glimpse\nof this meaning of _content_ may be observed to affect our ordinary\nthinking. _A_ book or a speech for example is said to have a great\ndeal in it, to be full of content, in proportion to the greater number\nof thoughts and general results to be found in it: whilst, on the\ncontrary, we should never say that any book, _e.g._ novel, had much in\nit, because it included a great number of single incidents, situations,\nand the like. Even the popular voice thus recognises that something\nmore than the facts of sense is needed to make a work pregnant with\nmatter. And what is this additional desideratum but thoughts, or in the\nfirst instance the categories? And yet it is not altogether wrong, it\nshould be added, to call the categories of themselves empty, if it be\nmeant that they and the logical Idea, of which they are the members, do\nnot constitute the whole of philosophy, but necessarily lead onwards in\ndue progress to the real departments of Nature and Mind. Only let the\nprogress not be misunderstood. The logical Ideal does not thereby come\ninto possession of a content originally foreign to it: but by its own\nnative action is specialised and developed to Nature and Mind.\n44.] It follows that the categories are no fit terms to express\nthe Absolute--the Absolute not being given in perception;--and\nUnderstanding, or knowledge by means of the categories, is consequently\nincapable of knowing the Things-in-themselves.\nThe Thing-in-itself (and under 'thing' is embraced even Mind and God)\nexpresses the object when we leave out of sight all that consciousness\nmakes of it, all its emotional aspects, and all specific thoughts\nof it. It is easy to see what is left,--utter abstraction, total\nemptiness, only described still as an 'other-world'--the negative of\nevery image, feeling, and definite thought. Nor does it require much\npenetration to see that this _caput mortuum_ is still only a product\nof thought, such as accrues when thought is carried on to abstraction\nunalloyed: that it is the work of the empty 'Ego,' which makes an\nobject out of this empty self-identity of its own. The _negative_\ncharacteristic which this abstract identity receives as an _object,_ is\nalso enumerated among the categories of Kant, and is no less familiar\nthan the empty identity aforesaid. Hence one can only read with\nsurprise the perpetual remark that we do not know the Thing-in-itself.\nOn the contrary there is nothing we can know so easily.\n45.] It is Reason, the faculty of the Unconditioned, which discovers\nthe conditioned nature of the knowledge comprised in experience. What\nis thus called the object of Reason, the Infinite or Unconditioned,\nis nothing but self-sameness, or the primary identity of the 'Ego'\nin thought (mentioned in \u00a7 42). Reason itself is the name given to\nthe abstract 'Ego' or thought, which makes this pure identity its aim\nor object (cf. note to the preceding \u00a7). Now this identity, having\nno definite attribute at all, can receive no illumination from the\ntruths of experience, for the reason that these refer always to\ndefinite facts. Such is the sort of Unconditioned that is supposed to\nbe the absolute truth of Reason,--what is termed the _Idea;_ whilst\nthe cognitions of experience are reduced to the level of untruth and\ndeclared to be appearances.\nKant was the first definitely to signalise the distinction between\nReason and Understanding. The object of the former, as he applied the\nterm, was the infinite and unconditioned, of the latter the finite\nand conditioned. Kant did valuable service when he enforced the finite\ncharacter of the cognitions of the understanding founded merely upon\nexperience, and stamped their contents with the name of appearance.\nBut his mistake was to stop at the purely negative point of view, and\nto limit the unconditionality of Reason to an abstract self-sameness\nwithout any shade of distinction. It degrades Reason to a finite and\nconditioned thing, to identify it with a mere stepping beyond the\nfinite and conditioned range of understanding. The real infinite,\nfar from being a mere transcendence of the finite, always involves\nthe absorption of the finite into its own fuller nature. In the same\nway Kant restored the Idea to its proper dignity: vindicating it for\nReason, as a thing distinct from abstract analytic determinations or\nfrom the merely sensible conceptions which usually appropriate to\nthemselves the name of ideas. But as respects the Idea also, he never\ngot beyond its negative aspect, as what ought to be but is not.\nThe view that the objects of immediate consciousness, which constitute\nthe body of experience, are mere appearances (phenomena), was another\nimportant result of the Kantian philosophy. Common Sense, that mixture\nof sense and understanding, believes the objects of which it has\nknowledge to be severally independent and self-supporting; and when\nit becomes evident that they tend towards and limit one another, the\ninterdependence of one upon another is reckoned something foreign to\nthem and to their true nature. The very opposite is the truth. The\nthings immediately known are mere appearances--in other words, the\nground of their being is not in themselves but in something else.\nBut then comes the important step of defining what this something\nelse is. According to Kant, the things that we know about are _to us_\nappearances only, and we can never know their essential nature, which\nbelongs to another world we cannot approach. Plain minds have not\nunreasonably taken exception to this subjective idealism, with its\nreduction of the facts of consciousness to a purely personal world,\ncreated by ourselves alone. For the true statement of the case is\nrather as follows. The things of which we have direct consciousness\nare mere phenomena, not for us only, but in their own nature; and the\ntrue and proper case of these things, finite as they are, is to have\ntheir existence founded not in themselves but in the universal divine\nIdea. This view of things, it is true, is as idealist as Kant's;\nbut in contradistinction to the subjective idealism of the Critical\nphilosophy should be termed absolute idealism. Absolute idealism,\nhowever, though it is far in advance of vulgar realism, is by no means\nmerely restricted to philosophy. It lies at the root of all religion;\nfor religion too believes the actual world we see, the sum total of\nexistence, to be created and governed by God.\n46.] But it is not enough simply to indicate the existence of the\nobject of Reason. Curiosity impels us to seek for knowledge of this\nidentity, this empty thing-in-itself. Now _knowledge_ means such\nan acquaintance with the object as apprehends its distinct and\nspecial subject-matter. But such subject-matter involves a complex\ninter-connexion in the object itself, and supplies a ground of\nconnexion with many other objects. In the present case, to express the\nnature of the features of the Infinite or Thing-in-itself, Reason would\nhave nothing except the categories: and in any endeavour so to employ\nthem Reason becomes over-soaring or 'transcendent.'\nHere begins the second stage of the Criticism of Reason--which, as\nan independent piece of work, is more valuable than the first. The\nfirst part, as has been explained above, teaches that the categories\noriginate in the unity of self-consciousness; that any knowledge which\nis gained by their means has nothing objective in it, and that the\nvery objectivity claimed for them is only subjective. So far as this\ngoes, the Kantian Criticism presents that 'common' type of idealism\nknown as Subjective Idealism. It asks no questions about the meaning\nor scope of the categories, but simply considers the abstract form of\nsubjectivity and objectivity, and that even in such a partial way, that\nthe former aspect, that of subjectivity, is retained as a final and\npurely affirmative term of thought. In the second part, however, when\nKant examines the _application,_ as it is called, which Reason makes\nof the categories in order to know its objects, the content of the\ncategories, at least in some points of view, comes in for discussion:\nor, at any rate, an opportunity presented itself for a discussion of\nthe question. It is worth while to see what decision Kant arrives at on\nthe subject of metaphysic, as this application of the categories to the\nunconditioned is called. His method of procedure we shall here briefly\nstate and criticise.\n47.] (a) The first of the unconditioned entities which Kant examines\nis the Soul (see above, \u00a7 34). 'In my consciousness,' he says, 'I\nalways find that I (1) am the determining subject: (2) am singular, or\nabstractly simple: (3) am identical, or one and the same, in all the\nvariety of what I am conscious of: (4) distinguish myself as thinking\nfrom all the things outside me.'\nNow the method of the old metaphysic, as Kant correctly states it,\nconsisted in substituting for these statements of experience the\ncorresponding categories or metaphysical terms. Thus arise these four\nnew propositions: _(a)_ the Soul is a substance: _(b)_ it is a simple\nsubstance: _(c)_ it is numerically identical at the various periods of\nexistence: _(d)_ it stands in relation to space.\nKant discusses this translation, and draws attention to the Paralogism\nor mistake of confounding one kind of truth with another. He points out\nthat empirical attributes have here been replaced by categories: and\nshows that we are not entitled to argue from the former to the latter,\nor to put the latter in place of the former.\nThis criticism obviously but repeats the observation of Hume\n(\u00a7 39) that the categories as a whole,--ideas of universality\nand necessity,--are entirely absent from sensation; and that the\nempirical fact both in form and contents differs from its intellectual\nformulation.\nIf the purely empirical fact were held to constitute the credentials\nof the thought, then no doubt it would be indispensable to be able\nprecisely to identify the 'idea' in the 'impression.'\nAnd in order to make out, in his criticism of the metaphysical\npsychology, that the soul cannot be described as substantial, simple,\nself-same, and as maintaining its independence in intercourse with\nthe material world, Kant argues from the single ground, that the\nseveral attributes of the soul, which consciousness lets us feel in\n_experience,_ are not exactly the same attributes as result from the\naction of _thought_ thereon. But we have seen above, that according\nto Kant all knowledge, even experience, consists in thinking our\nimpressions--in other words, in transforming into intellectual\ncategories the attributes primarily belonging to sensation.\nUnquestionably one good result of the Kantian criticism was that\nit emancipated mental philosophy from the 'soul-thing,' from the\ncategories, and, consequently, from questions about the simplicity,\ncomplexity, materiality, &c. of the soul. But even for the common sense\nof ordinary men, the true point of view, from which the inadmissibility\nof these forms best appears, will be, not that they are thoughts, but\nthat thoughts of such a stamp neither can nor do contain truth.\nIf thought and phenomenon do not perfectly correspond to one another,\nwe are free at least to choose which of the two shall be held the\ndefaulter. The Kantian idealism, where it touches on the world of\nReason, throws the blame on the thoughts; saying that the thoughts are\ndefective, as not being exactly fitted to the sensations and to a mode\nof mind wholly restricted within the range of sensation, in which as\nsuch there are no traces of the presence of these thoughts. But as to\nthe actual content of the thought, no question is raised.\nParalogisms are a species of unsound syllogism, the especial vice of\nwhich consists in employing one and the same word in the two premisses\nwith a different meaning. According to Kant the method adopted by the\nrational psychology of the old metaphysicians, when they assumed that\nthe qualities of the phenomenal soul, as given in experience, formed\npart of its own real essence, was based upon such a Paralogism. Nor\ncan it be denied that predicates like simplicity, permanence, &c, are\ninapplicable to the soul. But their unfitness is not due to the ground\nassigned by Kant, that Reason, by applying them, would exceed its\nappointed bounds. The true ground is that this style of abstract terms\nis not good enough for the soul, which is very; much more than a mere\nsimple or unchangeable sort of thing. And thus, for example, while the\nsoul may be admitted to be simple self-sameness, it is at the same time\nactive and institutes distinctions in its own nature. But whatever\nis merely or abstractly simple is as such also a mere dead thing. By\nhis polemic against the metaphysic of the past Kant discarded those\npredicates from the soul or mind. He did well; but when he came to\nstate his reasons, his failure is apparent.\n48.] (\u00df) The second unconditioned object is the World (\u00a7 35). In the\nattempt which reason makes to comprehend the unconditioned nature of\nthe World, it falls into what are called Antinomies. In other words\nit maintains two opposite propositions about the same object, and in\nsuch a way that each of them has to be maintained with equal necessity.\nFrom this it follows that the body of cosmical fact, the specific\nstatements descriptive of which run into contradiction, cannot be a\nself-subsistent reality, but only an appearance. The explanation\noffered by Kant alleges that the contradiction does not affect the\nobject in its own proper essence, but attaches only to the Reason which\nseeks to comprehend it.\nIn this way the suggestion was broached that the contradiction is\noccasioned by the subject-matter itself, or by the intrinsic quality\nof the categories. And to offer the idea that the contradiction\nintroduced into the world of Reason by the categories of Understanding\nis inevitable and essential, was to make one of the most important\nsteps in the progress of Modern Philosophy. But the more important the\nissue thus raised the more trivial was the solution. Its only motive\nwas an excess of tenderness for the things of the world. The blemish\nof contradiction, it seems, could not be allowed to mar the essence of\nthe world: but there could be no objection to attach it to the thinking\nReason, to the essence of mind. Probably nobody will feel disposed to\ndeny that the phenomenal world presents contradictions to the observing\nmind; meaning by 'phenomenal' the world as it presents itself to the\nsenses and understanding, to the subjective mind. But if a comparison\nis instituted between the essence of the world and the essence of the\nmind, it does seem strange to hear how calmly and confidently the\nmodest dogma has been advanced by one, and repeated by others, that\nthought or Reason, and not the World, is the seat of contradiction.\nIt is no escape to turn round and explain that Reason falls into\ncontradiction only by applying the categories. For this application\nof the categories is maintained to be necessary, and Reason is not\nsupposed to be equipped with any other forms but the categories for\nthe purpose of cognition. But cognition is determining and determinate\nthinking: so that, if Reason be mere empty indeterminate thinking, it\nthinks nothing. And if in the end Reason be reduced to mere identity\nwithout diversity (see next \u00a7), it will in the end also win a happy\nrelease from contradiction at the slight sacrifice of all its facts and\ncontents.\nIt may also be noted that his failure to make a more thorough study\nof Antinomy was one of the reasons why Kant enumerated only _four_\nAntinomies. These four attracted his notice, because, as may be seen\nin his discussion of the so-called Paralogisms of Reason, he assumed\nthe list of the categories as a basis of his argument. Employing\nwhat has subsequently become a favourite fashion, he simply put the\nobject under a rubric otherwise ready to hand, instead of deducing\nits characteristics from its notion. Further deficiencies in the\ntreatment of the Antinomies I have pointed out, as occasion offered,\nin my 'Science of Logic' Here it will be sufficient to say that\nthe Antinomies are not confined to the four special objects taken\nfrom Cosmology: they appear in all objects of every kind, in all\nconceptions, notions and Ideas. To be aware of this and to know objects\nin this property of theirs, makes a vital part in a philosophical\ntheory. For the property thus indicated is what we shall afterwards\ndescribe as the Dialectical influence in logic.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe principles of the metaphysical philosophy gave rise to the belief\nthat, when cognition lapsed into contradictions, it was a mere\naccidental aberration, due to some subjective mistake in argument\nand inference. According to Kant, however, thought has a natural\ntendency to issue in contradictions or antinomies, whenever it seeks\nto apprehend the infinite. We have in the latter part of the above\nparagraph referred to the philosophical importance of the antinomies of\nreason, and shown how the recognition of their existence helped largely\nto get rid of the rigid dogmatism of the metaphysic of understanding,\nand to direct attention to the Dialectical movement of thought. But\nhere too Kant, as we must add, never got beyond the negative result\nthat the thing-in-itself is unknowable, and never penetrated to the\ndiscovery of what the antinomies really and positively mean. That true\nand positive meaning of the antinomies is this: that every actual\nthing involves a coexistence of opposed, elements. Consequently to\nknow, or, in other words, to comprehend an object is equivalent to\nbeing conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations.\nThe old. metaphysic, as we have already seen, when it studied the\nobjects of which it sought a metaphysical knowledge, went to work by\napplying categories abstractly and to the exclusion of their opposites.\nKant, on the other hand, tried to prove that the statements, issuing\nthrough this method, could be met by other statements of contrary\nimport with equal warrant and equal necessity. In the enumeration of\nthese antinomies he narrowed his ground to the cosmology of the old\nmetaphysical system, and in his discussion made out four antinomies, a\nnumber which rests upon the list of the categories. The first antinomy\nis on the question: Whether we are or are not to think the world\nlimited in space and time. In the second antinomy we have a discussion\nof the dilemma: Matter must be conceived either as endlessly divisible,\nor as consisting of atoms. The third antinomy bears upon the antithesis\nof freedom and necessity, to such extent as it is embraced in the\nquestion, Whether everything in the world must be supposed subject to\nthe condition of causality, or if we can also assume free beings, in\nother words, absolute initial points of action, in the world. Finally,\nthe fourth antinomy is the dilemma: Either the world as a whole has a\ncause or it is uncaused.\nThe method which Kant follows in discussing these antinomies is as\nfollows. He puts the two propositions implied in the dilemma over\nagainst each other as thesis and antithesis, and seeks to prove both:\nthat is to say he tries to exhibit them as inevitably issuing from\nreflection on the question. He particularly protests against the charge\nof being a special pleader and of grounding his reasoning on illusions.\nSpeaking honestly, however, the arguments which Kant offers for his\nthesis and antithesis are mere shams of demonstration. The thing to\nbe proved is invariably implied in the assumption he starts from, and\nthe speciousness of his proofs is only due to his prolix and apagogic\nmode of procedure. Yet it was, and still is, a great achievement for\nthe Critical philosophy, when it exhibited these antinomies: for\nin this way it gave some expression (at first certainly subjective\nand unexplained) to the actual unity of those categories which are\nkept persistently separate by the understanding. The first of the\ncosmological antinomies, for example, implies a recognition of the\ndoctrine that space and time present a discrete as well as a continuous\naspect: whereas the old metaphysic, laying exclusive emphasis on the\ncontinuity, had been led to treat the world as unlimited in space\nand time. It is quite correct to say that we can go beyond every\n_definite_ space and beyond every _definite_ time: but it is no less\ncorrect that space and time are real and actual only when they are\ndefined or specialised into 'here' and 'now,'--a specialisation which\nis involved in the very notion of them. The same observations apply to\nthe rest of the antinomies. Take, for example, the antinomy of freedom\nand necessity. The main gist of itis that freedom and necessity as\nunderstood by abstract thinkers are not independently real, as these\nthinkers suppose, but merely ideal factors (moments) of the true\nfreedom and the true necessity, and that to abstract and isolate either\nconception is to make it false.\n49.] (y) The third object of the Reason is God (\u00a736): He also must\nbe known and defined in terms of thought. But in comparison with\nan unalloyed identity, every defining term as such seems to the\nunderstanding to be only a limit and a negation: every reality\naccordingly must be taken as limitless, _i.e._ undefined. Accordingly\nGod, when He is defined to be the sum of all realities, the most real\nof beings, turns into a _mere abstract._ And the only term under which\nthat most real of real, things can be defined is that of Being--itself\nthe height of abstraction. These are the two elements, abstract\nidentity, on one hand, which is spoken of in this place as the notion;\nand Being on the other,--which Reason seeks to unify. And their union\nis the _Ideal_ of Reason.\n50.] To carry out this unification two ways or two forms are\nadmissible. Either we may begin with Being and proceed to the\n_abstraction_ of Thought: or the movement may begin with the\nabstraction and end in Being.\nWe shall, in the first place, start from Being. But Being, in its\nnatural aspect, presents itself to view as a Being of infinite variety,\na World in all its plenitude. And this world may be regarded in two\nways: first, as a collection of innumerable unconnected facts; and\nsecond, as a collection of innumerable facts in mutual relation,\ngiving evidence of design. The first aspect is emphasised in the\nCosmological proof: the latter in the proofs of Natural Theology.\nSuppose now that this fulness of being passes under the agency of\nthought. Then it is stripped of its isolation and unconnectedness, and\nviewed as a universal and absolutely necessary being which determines\nitself and acts by general purposes or laws. And this necessary and\nself-determined being, different from the being at the commencement, is\nGod.\nThe main force of Kant's criticism on this process attacks it for being\na syllogising, _i.e._ a transition. Perceptions, and that aggregate\nof perceptions we call the world, exhibit as they stand no traces of\nthat universality which they afterwards receive from the purifying act\nof thought. The empirical conception of the world therefore gives no\nwarrant for the idea of universality. And so any attempt on the part\nof thought to ascend from the empirical conception of the world to\nGod is checked by the argument of Hume (as in the paralogisms, \u00a7 47),\naccording to which we have no right to think sensations, that is, to\nelicit universality and necessity from them.\nMan is essentially a thinker: and therefore sound Common Sense, as well\nas Philosophy, will not yield up their right of rising to God from\nand out of the empirical view of the world. The only basis on which\nthis rise is possible is the thinking study of the world, not the bare\nsensuous, animal, attuition of it. Thought and thought alone has eyes\nfor the essence, substance, universal power, and ultimate design of the\nworld. And what men call the proofs of God's existence are, rightly\nunderstood, ways of describing and analysing the native course of the\nmind, the course of _thought_ thinking the _data_ of the senses. The\nrise of thought beyond the world of sense, its passage from the finite\nto the infinite, the leap into the super-sensible which it takes when\nit snaps asunder the chain of sense, all this transition is thought and\nnothing but thought. Say there is no such passage, and you say there is\nto be no thinking. And in sooth, animals make no such transition. They\nnever get further than sensation and the perception of the senses, and\nin consequence they have no religion.\nBoth on general grounds, and in the particular case, there are two\nremarks to be made upon the criticism of this exaltation in thought.\nThe first remark deals with the question of form. When the exaltation\nis exhibited in a syllogistic process, in the shape of what we call\n_proofs_ of the being of God, these reasonings cannot but start from\nsome sort of theory of the world, which makes it an aggregate either\nof contingent facts or of final causes and relations involving design.\nThe merely syllogistic thinker may deem this starting-point a solid\nbasis and suppose that it remains throughout in the same empirical\nlight, left at last as it was at the first. In this case, the bearing\nof the beginning upon the conclusion to which it leads has a purely\naffirmative aspect, as if we were only reasoning from one thing which\n_is_ and continues to _be,_ to another thing which in like manner\nis. But the great error is to restrict our notions of the nature\nof thought to its form in understanding alone. To think think the\nphenomenal world rather, means to re-cast its form, and transmute it\ninto a universal. And thus the action-of-thought, has also, _negative_\neffect upon its basis: and the matter of sensation, when it receives\nthe stamp of universality, at once loses its first and phenomenal\nshape. By the removal and negation of the shell, the kernel within the\nsense; v percept is brought to the light (\u00a7\u00a7 13 and 23). And it is\nbecause they do not, with sufficient prominence, express the negative\nfeatures implied in the exaltation of the mind from the world to God,\nthat the metaphysical proofs of the being of a God are defective\ninterpretations and descriptions of the process. If the world is only a\nsum of incidents, it follows that it is also deciduous and phenomenal,\nin _esse_ and _posse_ null. That upward spring of the mind signifies,\nthat the being which the world has is only a semblance, no real being,\nno absolute truth; it signifies that, beyond and above that appearance,\ntruth abides in God, so that true being is another name for God. The\nprocess of exaltation might thus appear to be transition and to involve\na means, but it is not a whit less true, that every trace of transition\nand means is absorbed; since the world, which might have seemed to be\nthe means of reaching God, is explained to be a nullity. Unless the\nbeing of the world is nullified, the _point d'appui_ for the exaltation\nis lost. In this way the apparent means vanishes, and the process\nof derivation is cancelled in the very act by which it proceeds. It\nis the affirmative aspect of this relation, as supposed to subsist\nbetween two things, either of which _is_ as much as the other, which\nJacobi mainly has in his eye when he attacks the demonstrations of the\nunderstanding. Justly censuring them for seeking conditions (_i.e._\nthe world) for the unconditioned, he remarks that the Infinite or\nGod must on such a method be presented as dependent and derivative.\nBut that elevation, as it takes place in the mind, serves to correct\nthis semblance: in fact, it has no other meaning than to correct that\nsemblance. Jacobi, however, failed to recognise the genuine nature of\nessential thought--by which it cancels the mediation in the very act of\nmediating; and consequently, his objection, though it tells against the\nmerely 'reflective' understanding, is false when applied to thought as\na whole, and in particular to reasonable thought.\nTo explain what we mean by the neglect of the negative factor in\nthought, we may refer by way of illustration to the charges of\nPantheism and Atheism brought against the doctrines of Spinoza. The\nabsolute Substance of Spinoza certainly falls short of absolute spirit,\nand it is a right and proper requirement that God should be defined\nas absolute spirit. But when the definition in Spinoza is said to\nidentify the world with God, and to confound God with nature and the\nfinite world, it is implied that the finite world possesses a genuine\nactuality and affirmative reality. If this assumption be admitted, of\ncourse a union of God with the world renders God completely finite,\nand degrades Him to the bare finite and adventitious congeries of\nexistence. But there are two objections to be noted. In the first place\nSpinoza does not define God as the unity of God with the world, but as\nthe union of thought with extension, that is, with the material world.\nAnd secondly, even if we accept this awkward popular statement as to\nthis unity, it would still be true that the system of Spinoza was not\nAtheism but Acosmism, defining the world to be an appearance lacking in\ntrue reality. A philosophy, which affirms that God and God-alone is,\nshould not be stigmatised as atheistic, when even those nations which\nworship the ape, the cow, or images of stone and brass, are credited\nwith some religion. But as things stand the imagination of ordinary men\nfeels a vehement reluctance to surrender its dearest conviction, that\nthis aggregate of finitude, which it calls a world, has actual reality;\nand to hold that there is no world is a way of thinking they are fain\nto believe impossible, or at least much less possible than to entertain\nthe idea that there is no God. Human nature, not much to its credit, is\nmore ready to believe that a system denies God, than that it denies the\nworld. A denial of God seems so much more intelligible than a denial of\nthe world.\nThe second remark bears on the criticism of the material propositions\nto which that elevation in thought in the first instance leads. If\nthese propositions have for their predicate such terms as substance of\nthe world, its necessary essence, cause which regulates and directs it\naccording to design, they are certainly inadequate to express what is\nor ought to be understood by God. Yet apart from the trick of adopting\na preliminary popular conception of God, and criticising a result by\nthis assumed standard, it is certain that these characteristics have\ngreat value, and are necessary factors in the idea of God. But if we\nwish in this way to bring before thought the genuine idea of God,\nand give its true value and expression to the central truth, we must\nbe careful not to start from a subordinate level of facts. To speak\nof the 'merely contingent' things of the world is a very inadequate\ndescription of the premisses. The organic structures, and the evidence\nthey afford of mutual adaptation, belong to a higher province, the\nprovince of animated nature. But even without taking into consideration\nthe possible blemish which the study of animated nature and of the\nother teleological aspects of existing things may contract from the\npettiness of the final causes, and from puerile instances of them and\ntheir bearings, merely animated nature is, at the best, incapable of\nsupplying the material for a truthful expression to the idea of God.\nGod is more than life: He is Spirit. And therefore if the thought of\nthe Absolute takes a starting-point for its rise, and desires to take\nthe nearest, the most true and adequate starting-point will be found in\nthe nature of spirit alone.\n51.] The other way of unification by which to realise the Ideal of\nReason is to set out from the _abstractum_ of Thought and seek to\ncharacterise it: for which purpose Being is the only available term.\nThis is the method of the Ontological proof. The opposition, here\npresented from a merely subjective point of view, lies between Thought\nand Being; whereas in the first way of junction, being is common to the\ntwo sides of the antithesis, and the contrast lies only between its\nindividualisation and universality. Understanding meets this second way\nwith what is implicitly the same objection, as it made to the first.\nIt denied that the empirical involves the universal: so it denies that\nthe universal involves the specialisation, which specialisation in this\ninstance is being. In other words it says: Being cannot be deduced from\nthe notion by any analysis.\nThe uniformly favourable reception and acceptance which attended\nKant's criticism of the Ontological proof was undoubtedly due to the\nillustration which he made use of. To explain the difference between\nthought and being, he took the instance of a hundred sovereigns,\nwhich, for anything it matters to the notion, are the same hundred\nwhether they are real or only possible, though the difference of the\ntwo cases is very perceptible in their effect on a man's purse. Nothing\ncan be more obvious than that anything we only think or conceive is not\non that account actual: that mental representation, and even notional\ncomprehension, always falls short of being. Still it may not unfairly\nbe styled a barbarism in language, when the name of notion is given\nto things like a hundred sovereigns. And, putting that mistake aside,\nthose who perpetually urge against the philosophic Idea the difference\nbetween Being and Thought, might have admitted that philosophers\nwere not wholly ignorant of the fact. Can there be any proposition\nmore trite than this? But after all, it is well to remember, when we\nspeak of God, that we have an object of another kind than any hundred\nsovereigns, and unlike any one particular notion, representation, or\nhowever else it may be styled. It is in fact this and this alone which\nmarks everything finite:--its being in time and space is discrepant\nfrom its notion. God, on the contrary, expressly has to be what can\nonly be 'thought as existing'; His notion involves being. It is this\nunity of the notion and being that constitutes the notion of God.\nIf this were all, we should have only a formal expression of the divine\nnature which would not really go beyond a statement of the nature of\nthe notion itself. And that the notion, in its most abstract terms,\ninvolves being is plain. For the notion, whatever other determination\nit may receive, is at least reference back on itself, which results\nby abolishing the intermediation, and thus is immediate. And what is\nthat reference to self, but being? Certainly it would be strange if the\nnotion, the very inmost of mind, if even the 'Ego,' or above all, the\nconcrete totality we call God, were not rich enough to include so poor\na category as being, the very poorest and most abstract of all. For,\nif we look at the thought it holds, nothing can be more insignificant\nthan being. And yet there may be something still more insignificant\nthan being,--that which at first sight is perhaps supposed to _be,_ an\nexternal and sensible existence, like that of the paper lying before\nme. However, in this matter, nobody proposes to speak of the sensible\nexistence of a limited and perishable thing. Besides, the petty\nstricture of the _Kritik_ that 'thought and being are different' can at\nmost molest the path of the human mind from the thought of God to the\ncertainty that He _is_: it cannot take it away. It is this process of\ntransition, depending on the absolute inseparability of the _thought_\nof God from His being, for which its proper authority has been\nre-vindicated in the theory of faith or immediate knowledge,--whereof\nhereafter.\n52.] In this way thought, at its highest pitch, has to go outside for\nany determinateness: and although it is continually termed Reason, is\nout-and-out abstract thinking. And the result of all is that Reason\nsupplies nothing beyond the formal unity required to simplify and\nsystematise experiences; it is a _canon,_ not an _organon_ of truth,\nand can furnish only a _criticism_ of knowledge, not a _doctrine_ of\nthe infinite. In its final analysis this criticism is summed up in the\nassertion that in strictness thought is only the indeterminate unity\nand the action of this indeterminate unity.\nKant undoubtedly held reason to be the faculty of the\nunconditioned; but if reason be reduced to abstract identity\nonly, it by implication renounces its unconditionality and is\nin reality no better than empty understanding. For reason is\nunconditioned, only in so far as its character and quality are not\ndue to an extraneous and foreign content, only in so far as it\nis self-characterising, and thus, in point of content, is its own\nmaster. Kant, however, expressly explains that the action of reason\nconsists solely in applying the categories to systematise the\nmatter given by perception, _e._ to place it in an outside order,\nunder the guidance of the principle of non-contradiction.\n53.] (b) The Practical Reason is understood by Kant to mean a\n_thinking_ Will, _i.e._ a Will that determines itself on universal\nprinciples. Its office is to give objective, imperative laws of\nfreedom,--laws, that is, which state what ought to happen. The warrant\nfor thus assuming thought to be an activity which makes itself felt\nobjectively, that is, to be really a Reason, is the alleged possibility\nof proving practical freedom by experience, that is, of showing it in\nthe phenomenon of self-consciousness. This experience in consciousness\nis at once met by all that the Necessitarian produces from contrary\nexperience, particularly by the sceptical induction (employed amongst\nothers by Hume) from the endless diversity of what men regard as right\nand duty,--_i.e._ from the diversity apparent in those professedly\nobjective laws of freedom.\n54.] What, then, is to serve as the law which the Practical\nReason embraces and obeys, and as the criterion in its act of\nself-determination? There is no rule at hand but the same abstract\nidentity of understanding as before: There must be no contradiction in\nthe act of self-determination. Hence the Practical Reason never shakes\noff the formalism which is represented as the climax of the Theoretical\nReason.\nBut this Practical Reason does not confine the universal principle of\nthe Good to its own inward regulation: it first becomes _practical,_\nin the true sense of the word, when it insists on the Good being\nmanifested in the world with an outward objectivity, and requires that\nthe thought shall be objective throughout, and not merely subjective.\nWe shall speak of this postulate of the Practical Reason afterwards.\nThe free self-determination which Kant denied to the speculative,\nhe has expressly vindicated for the practical reason. To many minds\nthis particular aspect of the Kantian philosophy made it welcome;\nand that for good reasons. To estimate rightly what we owe to\nKant in the matter, we ought to set before our minds the form of\npractical philosophy and in particular of 'moral philosophy,' which\nprevailed in his time. It may be generally described as a system\nof Eudaemonism, which, when asked what man's chief end ought to\nbe, replied Happiness. And by happiness Eudaemonism understood the\nsatisfaction of the private appetites, wishes and wants of the\nman: thus raising the contingent and particular into a principle\nfor the will and its actualisation. To this Eudaemonism, which was\ndestitute of stability and consistency, and which left the 'door\nand gate' wide open for every whim and caprice, Kant opposed the\npractical reason, and thus emphasised the need for a principle\nof will which should be universal and lay the same obligation\non all. The theoretical reason, as has been made evident in the\npreceding paragraphs, is identified by Kant with the negative\nfaculty of the infinite; and as it has no positive content of its\nown, it is restricted to the function of detecting the finitude of\nexperiential knowledge. To the practical reason, on the contrary,\nhe has expressly allowed a positive infinity, by ascribing to the\nwill the power of modifying itself in universal modes, _i.e._ by\nthought. Such a power the will undoubtedly has: and it is well\nto remember that man is free only in so far as he possesses it\nand avails himself of it in his conduct. But a recognition of the\nexistence of this power is not enough and does not avail to tell\nus what are the contents of the will or practical reason. Hence to\nsay, that a man must make the Good the content of his will, raises\nthe question, what that content is, and what are the means of\nascertaining what good is. Nor does one get over the difficulty by\nthe principle that the will must be consistent with itself, or by\nthe precept to do duty for the sake of duty.\n55.] (c) The Reflective Power of Judgment is invested by Kant\nwith the function of an Intuitive Understanding. That is to say,\nwhereas the particulars had hitherto appeared, so far as the universal\nor abstract identity was concerned, adventitious and incapable of\nbeing deduced from it, the _Intuitive_ Understanding apprehends the\nparticulars as moulded and formed by the universal itself. Experience\npresents such universalised particulars in the products of Art and of\n_organic_ nature.\nThe capital feature in Kant's Criticism of the Judgment is, that in\nit he gave a representation and a name, if not even an intellectual\nexpression, to the Idea. Such a representation, as an Intuitive\nUnderstanding, or an inner adaptation, suggests a universal which\nis at the same time apprehended as essentially a concrete unity, It\nis in these aper\u00e7us alone that the Kantian philosophy rises to the\nspeculative height. Schiller, and others, have found in the idea of\nartistic beauty, where thought and sensuous conception have grown\ntogether into one, a way of escape from the abstract and separatist\nunderstanding. Others have found the same relief in the perception\nand consciousness of life and of living things, whether that life\nbe natural or intellectual.--The work of Art, as well as the living\nindividual, is, it must be owned, of limited content. But in the\npostulated harmony of nature (or necessity) and free purpose,--in the\nfinal purpose of the world conceived as realised, Kant has put before\nus the Idea, comprehensive even in its content. Yet what may be called\nthe laziness of thought, when dealing with this supreme Idea, finds a\ntoo easy mode of evasion in the 'ought to be': instead of the actual\nrealisation of the ultimate end, it clings hard to the disjunction\nof the notion from reality. Yet if thought will not _think_ the ideal\nrealised, the senses and the intuition can at any rate _see_ it in the\npresent reality of living organisms and of the beautiful in Art. And\nconsequently Kant's remarks on these objects were well adapted to lead\nthe mind on to grasp and think the concrete Idea.\n56.] We are thus led to conceive a different relation between the\nuniversal of understanding and the particular of perception, than that\non which the theory of the Theoretical and Practical Reason is founded.\nBut while this is so, it is not supplemented by a recognition that the\nformer is the genuine relation and the very truth. Instead of that,\nthe unity (of universal with particular) is accepted only as it exists\nin finite phenomena, and is adduced only as a fact of experience.\nSuch experience, at first only personal, may come from two sources.\nIt may spring from Genius, the faculty which produces 'aesthetic\nideas'; meaning by aesthetic ideas, the picture-thoughts of the free\nimagination which subserve an idea and suggest thoughts, although their\ncontent is not expressed in a notional form, and even admits of no\nsuch expression. It may also be due to Taste, the feeling of congruity\nbetween the free play of intuition or imagination and the uniformity of\nunderstanding.\n57.] The principle by which the Reflective faculty of Judgment\nregulates and arranges the products of animated nature is described\nas the End or final cause,--the notion in action, the universal at\nonce determining and determinate in itself. At the same time Kant is\ncareful to discard the conception of external or finite adaptation, in\nwhich the End is only an adventitious form for the means and material\nin which it is realised. In the living organism, on the contrary, the\nfinal cause is a moulding principle and an energy immanent in the\nmatter, and every member is in its turn a means as well as an end.\n58.] Such an Idea evidently radically transforms the relation which the\nunderstanding institutes between means and ends, between subjectivity\nand objectivity. And yet in the face of this unification, the End or\ndesign is subsequently explained to be a cause which exists and acts\nsubjectively, _i.e._ as our idea only: and teleology is accordingly\nexplained to be only a principle of criticism, purely personal to _our_\nunderstanding.\nAfter the Critical philosophy had settled that Reason can know\nphenomena only, there would still have been an option for animated\nnature between two equally subjective modes of thought. Even according\nto Kant's own exposition, there would have been an obligation to admit,\nin the case of natural productions, a knowledge not confined to the\ncategories of quality, cause and effect, composition, constituents,\nand so on. The principle of inward adaptation or design, had it been\nkept to and carried out in scientific application, would have led to a\ndifferent and a higher method of observing nature.\n59.] If we adopt this principle, the Idea, when all limitations were\nremoved from it, would appear as follows. The universality moulded by\nReason, and described as the absolute and final end or the Good, would\nbe realised in the world, and realised moreover by means of a third\nthing, the power which proposes this End as well as realises it,--that\nis, God. Thus in Him, who is the absolute truth, those oppositions of\nuniversal and individual, subjective and objective, are solved and\nexplained to be neither self-subsistent nor true.\n80.] But Good,--which is thus put forward as the final cause of the\nworld,--has been already described as only _our_ good, the moral law\nof _our_ Practical Reason. This being so, the unity in question\ngoes no further than make the state of the world and the course of\nits events harmonise with our moral standards.[1] Besides, even with\nthis limitation, the final cause, or Good, is a vague abstraction,\nand the same vagueness attaches to what is to be Duty. But, further,\nthis harmony is met by the revival and re-assertion of the antithesis,\nwhich it by its own principle had nullified. The harmony is then\ndescribed as merely subjective, something which merely ought to be,\nand which at the same time is not real,--a mere article of faith,\npossessing a subjective certainty, but without truth, or that\nobjectivity which is proper to the Idea. This contradiction may seem\nto be disguised by adjourning the realisation of the Idea to a future,\nto a _time_ when the Idea will also be. But a sensuous condition like\ntime is the reverse of a reconciliation of the discrepancy; and an\ninfinite progression--which is the corresponding image adopted by the\nunderstanding--on the very face of it only repeats and re-enacts the\ncontradiction.\nA general remark may still be offered on the result to which the\nCritical philosophy led as to the nature of knowledge; a result\nwhich has grown one of the current 'idols' or axiomatic beliefs of\nthe day. In every dualistic system, and especially in that of Kant,\nthe fundamental defect makes itself visible in the inconsistency of\nunifying at one moment, what a moment before had been explained to\nbe independent and therefore incapable of unification. And then, at\nthe very moment after unification has been alleged to be the truth,\nwe suddenly come upon the doctrine that the two elements, which, in\ntheir true status of unification, had been refused all independent\nsubsistence, are only true and actual in their state of separation.\nPhilosophising of this kind wants the little penetration needed to\ndiscover, that this shuffling only evidences how unsatisfactory each\none of the two terms is. And it fails simply because it is incapable\nof bringing two thoughts together. (And in point of form there are\nnever more than two.) It argues an utter want of consistency to say,\non the one hand, that the understanding only knows phenomena, and, on\nthe other, assert the absolute character of this knowledge, by such\nstatements as 'Cognition can go no further'; 'Here is the _natural_ and\nabsolute limit of human knowledge.' But 'natural' is the wrong word\nhere. The things of nature are limited and are natural things only to\nsuch extent as they are not aware of their universal limit, or to such\nextent as their mode or quality is a limit from our point of view,\nand not from their own. No one knows, or even feels, that anything\nis a limit or defect, until he is at the same time above and beyond\nit. Living beings, for example, possess the privilege of pain which\nis denied to the inanimate: even with living beings, a single mode or\nquality passes into the feeling of a negative. For living beings as\nsuch possess within them a universal vitality, which overpasses and\nincludes the single mode; and thus, as they maintain themselves in\nthe negative of themselves, they feel the contradiction to _exist_\nwithin them. But the contradiction is within them, only in so far as\none and the same subject includes both the universality of their sense\nof life, and the individual mode which is in negation with it. This\nillustration will show how a limit or imperfection in knowledge comes\nto be termed a limit or imperfection, only when it is compared with the\nactually-present Idea of the universal, of a total and perfect. A very\nlittle consideration might show, that to call a thing finite or limited\nproves by implication the very presence of the infinite and unlimited,\nand that our knowledge of a limit can only be when the unlimited is _on\nthis side_ in consciousness.\nThe result however of Kant's view of cognition suggests a second\nremark. The philosophy of Kant could have no influence on the method of\nthe sciences. It leaves the categories and method of ordinary knowledge\nquite unmolested. Occasionally, it may be, in the first sections of a\nscientific work of that period, we find propositions borrowed from the\nKantian philosophy: but the course of the treatise renders it apparent\nthat these propositions were superfluous decoration, and that the few\nfirst pages might have been omitted without producing the least change\nin the empirical contents.[2]\nWe may next institute a comparison of Kant with the metaphysics of the\nempirical school. Natural plain Empiricism, though it unquestionably\ninsists most upon sensuous perception, still allows a super-sensible\nworld or spiritual reality, whatever may be its structure and\nconstitution, and whether derived from intellect, or from imagination,\n&c. So far as form goes, the facts of this super-sensible world rest on\nthe authority of mind, in the same way as the other facts, embraced\nin empirical knowledge, rest on the authority of external perception.\nBut when Empiricism becomes reflective and logically consistent, it\nturns its arms against this dualism in the ultimate and highest species\nof fact; it denies the independence of the thinking principle and of\na spiritual world which developes itself in thought. Materialism or\nNaturalism, therefore, is the consistent and thorough-going system\nof Empiricism. In direct opposition to such an Empiricism, Kant\nasserts the principle of thought and freedom, and attaches himself\nto the first-mentioned form of empirical doctrine, the general\nprinciples of which he never departed from. There is a dualism in\nhis philosophy also. On one side stands the world of sensation, and\nof the understanding which reflects upon it. This world, it is true,\nhe alleges to be a world of appearances. But that is only a title\nor formal description; for the source, the facts, and the modes of\nobservation continue quite the same as in Empiricism. On the other side\nand independent stands a self-apprehending thought, the principle of\nfreedom, which Kant has in common with ordinary and bygone metaphysic,\nbut emptied of all that it held, and without his being able to infuse\ninto it anything new. For, in the Critical doctrine, thought, or, as it\nis there called, Reason, is divested of every specific form, and thus\nbereft of all authority. The main effect of the Kantian philosophy has\nbeen to revive the consciousness of Reason, or the absolute inwardness\nof thought. Its abstractness indeed prevented that inwardness from\ndeveloping into anything, or from originating any special forms,\nwhether cognitive principles or moral laws; but nevertheless it\nabsolutely refused to accept or indulge anything possessing the\ncharacter of an externality. Henceforth the principle of the\nindependence of Reason, or of its absolute self-subsistence, is made\na general principle of philosophy, as well as a foregone conclusion of\nthe time.\n(1) The Critical philosophy has one great negative merit. It has\nbrought home the conviction that the categories of understanding are\nfinite in their range, and that any cognitive process confined within\ntheir pale falls short of the truth. But Kant had only a sight of\nhalf the truth. He explained the finite nature of the categories to\nmean that they were subjective only, valid only for our thought, from\nwhich the thing-in-itself was divided by an impassable gulf. In fact,\nhowever, it is not because they are subjective, that the categories are\nfinite: they are finite by their very nature, and it is on their own\nselves that it is requisite to exhibit their finitude. Kant however\nholds that what we think is false, because it is we who think it. A\nfurther deficiency in the system is that it gives only an historical\ndescription of thought, and a mere enumeration of the factors of\nconsciousness. The enumeration is in the main correct: but not a word\ntouches upon the necessity of what is thus empirically colligated. The\nobservations, made on the various stages of consciousness, culminate\nin the summary statement, that the content of all we are acquainted\nwith is only an appearance. And as it is true at least that all finite\nthinking is concerned with appearances, so far the conclusion is\njustified. This stage of 'appearance' however--the phenomenal world--is\nnot the terminus of thought: there is another and a higher region. But\nthat region was to the Kantian philosophy an inaccessible 'other world.'\n(2) After all it was only formally, that the Kantian system established\nthe principle that thought is spontaneous and self-determining. Into\ndetails of the manner and the extent of this self-determination of\nthought, Kant never went. It was Fichte who first noticed the omission;\nand who, after he had called attention to the want of a deduction for\nthe categories, endeavoured really to supply something of the kind.\nWith Fichte, the 'Ego' is the starting-point in the philosophical\ndevelopment: and the outcome of its action is supposed to be visible\nin the categories. But in Fichte the 'Ego' is not really presented\nas a free, spontaneous energy; it is supposed to receive its first\nexcitation by a shock or impulse from without. Against this shock\nthe 'Ego' will, it is assumed, react, and only through this reaction\ndoes it first become conscious of itself. Meanwhile, the nature of\nthe impulse remains a stranger beyond our pale: and the 'Ego,' with\nsomething else always confronting it, is weighted with a condition.\nFichte, in consequence, never advanced beyond Kant's conclusion, that\nthe finite only is knowable, while the infinite transcends the range\nof thought. What Kant calls the thing-by-itself, Fichte calls the\nimpulse from without--that abstraction of something else than 'I,' not\notherwise describable or definable than as the negative or non-Ego in\ngeneral. The 'I' is thus looked at as standing in essential relation\nwith the not-I, through which its act of self-determination is first\nawakened. And in this manner the 'I' is but the continuous act of\nself-liberation from this impulse, never gaining a real freedom,\nbecause with the surcease of the impulse the 'I,' whose being is\nits action, would also cease to be. Nor is the content produced by\nthe action of the 'I' at all different from the ordinary content of\nexperience, except by the supplementary remark, that this content is\nmere appearance.\n[1] Even Hermann's 'Handbook of Prosody' begins with paragraphs of\nKantian philosophy. In \u00a7 8 it is argued that a law of rhythm must be\n(1) objective, (a) formal, and (3) determined _\u00e0 priori._ With these\nrequirements and with the principles of Causality and Reciprocity which\nfollow later, it were well to compare the treatment of the various\nmeasures, upon which those formal principles do not exercise the\nslightest influence.\n[2] In Kant's own words (Criticism of the Power of Judgment, p. 427):\n'Final Cause is merely a notion of our practical reason. It cannot\nbe deduced from any data of experience as a theoretical criterion of\nnature, nor can it be applied to know nature. No employment of this\nnotion is possible except solely for the practical reason, by moral\nlaws. The final purpose of the Creation is that constitution of the\nworld which harmonises with that to which alone we can give definite\nexpression on universal principles, viz. the final purpose of our pure\npractical reason, and with that in so far as it means to be practical.'\nCHAPTER V.\nTHIRD ATTITUDE OF THOUGHT TO OBJECTIVITY.\n_Immediate or Intuitive Knowledge._\n61.] If we are to believe the Critical philosophy, thought is\nsubjective, and its ultimate and invincible mode is _abstract\nuniversality_ or formal identity. Thought is thus set in opposition\nto Truth, which is no abstraction, but concrete universality. In this\nhighest mode of thought, which is entitled Reason, the Categories\nare left out of account.--The extreme theory on the opposite side\nholds thought to be an act of the _particular_ only, and on that\nground declares it incapable of apprehending the Truth. This is the\nIntuitional theory.\n62.] According to this theory, thinking, a private and particular\noperation, has its whole scope and product in the Categories. But,\nthese Categories, as arrested by the understanding, are limited\nvehicles of thought, forms of the conditioned, of the dependent\nand derivative. A thought limited to these modes has no sense of\nthe Infinite and the True, and cannot bridge over the gulf that\nseparates it from them. (This stricture refers to the proofs of God's\nexistence.) These inadequate modes or categories are also spoken of as\n_notions_: and to get a notion of an object therefore can only mean,\nin this language, to grasp it under the form of being conditioned and\nderivative. Consequently, if the object in question be the True, the\nInfinite, the Unconditioned, we change it by our notions into a finite\nand conditioned; whereby, instead of apprehending the truth by thought,\nwe have perverted it into untruth.\nSuch is the one simple line of argument advanced for the thesis that\nthe knowledge of God and of truth must be immediate, or intuitive. At\nan earlier period all sort of anthropomorphic conceptions, as they\nare termed, were banished from God, as being finite and therefore\nunworthy of the infinite; and in this way God had been reduced to\na tolerably blank being. But in those days the thought-forms were\nin general not supposed to come under the head of anthropomorphism.\nThought was believed rather to strip finitude from the conceptions of\nthe Absolute,--in agreement with the above-mentioned conviction of all\nages, that reflection is the only road to truth. But now, at length,\neven the thought-forms are pronounced anthropomorphic, and thought\nitself is described as a mere faculty of finitisation.\nJacobi has stated this charge most distinctly in the seventh supplement\nto his Letters on Spinoza,--borrowing his line of argument from the\nworks of Spinoza himself, and applying it as a weapon against knowledge\nin general. In his attack knowledge is taken to mean knowledge of\nthe finite only, a process of thought from one condition in a series\nto another, each of which is at once conditioning and conditioned.\nAccording to such a view, to explain and to get the notion of\nanything, is the same as to show it to be derived from something else.\nWhatever such knowledge embraces, consequently, is partial, dependent\nand finite, while the infinite or true, _i.e._ God, lies outside\nof the mechanical inter-connexion to which knowledge is said to be\nconfined.--It is important to observe that, while Kant makes the finite\nnature of the Categories consist mainly in the formal circumstance\nthat they are subjective, Jacobi discusses the Categories in their\nown proper character, and pronounces them to be in their very import\nfinite. What Jacobi chiefly had before his eyes, when he thus described\nscience, was the brilliant successes of the physical or 'exact'\nsciences in ascertaining natural forces and laws. It is certainly not\non the finite ground occupied by these sciences that we can expect to\nmeet the in-dwelling presence of the infinite. Lalande was right when\nhe said he had swept the whole heaven with his glass, and seen no God.\n(See note to \u00a7 60.) In the field of physical science, the universal,\nwhich is the final result of analysis, is only the indeterminate\naggregate,--of the external finite,--in one word, Matter: and Jacobi\nwell perceived that there was no other issue obtainable in the way of a\nmere advance from one explanatory clause or law to another.\n63.] All the while the doctrine that truth exists for the mind was so\nstrongly maintained by Jacobi, that Reason alone is declared to be that\nby which man lives. This Reason is the knowledge of God. But, seeing\nthat derivative knowledge is restricted to the compass of finite facts,\nReason is knowledge underivative, or Faith.\nKnowledge, Faith, Thought, Intuition are the categories that we meet\nwith on this line of reflection. These terms, as presumably familiar to\nevery one, are only too frequently subjected to an arbitrary use, under\nno better guidance than the conceptions and distinctions of psychology,\nwithout any investigation into their nature and notion, which is the\nmain question after all. Thus, we often find knowledge contrasted with\nfaith, and faith at the same time explained to be an underivative\nor intuitive knowledge:--so that it must be at least some sort of\nknowledge. And, besides, it is unquestionably a fact of experience,\nfirstly, that what we believe is in our consciousness,---which implies\nthat we _know about it;_ and secondly, that this belief is a certainty\nin our consciousness,--which implies that we _know it._ Again, and\nespecially, we find thought opposed to immediate knowledge and faith,\nand, in particular, to intuition. But if this intuition be qualified\nas intellectual, we must really mean intuition which thinks, unless,\nin a question about the nature of God, we are willing to interpret\nintellect to mean images and representations of imagination. The word\nfaith or belief, in the dialect of this system, comes to be employed\neven with reference to common objects that are present to the senses.\nWe believe, says Jacobi, that we have a body,--we believe in the\nexistence of the things of sense. But if we are speaking of faith in\nthe True and Eternal, and saying that God is given and revealed to us\nin immediate knowledge OF intuition, we are concerned not with the\nthings of sense, but with objects special to our thinking mind, with\ntruths of inherently universal significance. And when the individual\n'I,' or in other words personality, is under discussion--not the 'I' of\nexperience, or a single private person--above all, when the personality\nof God is before us, we are speaking of personality unalloyed,--of a\npersonality in its own nature universal. Such personality is a thought,\nand falls within the province of thought only. More than this. Pure and\nsimple intuition is completely the same as pure and simple thought.\nIntuition and belief, in the first instance, denote the definite\nconceptions we attach to these words in our ordinary employment of\nthem: and to this extent they differ from thought in certain points\nwhich nearly every one can understand. But here they are taken in a\nhigher sense, and must be interpreted to mean a belief in God, or an\nintellectual intuition of God; in short, we must put aside all that\nespecially distinguishes thought on the one side from belief and\nintuition on the other. How belief and intuition, when transferred to\nthese higher regions, differ from thought, it is impossible for any one\nto say. And yet, such are the barren distinctions of words, with which\nmen fancy that they assert an important truth: even while the formulae\nthey maintain are identical with those which they impugn.\nThe term _Faith_ brings with it the special advantage of suggesting\nthe faith of the Christian religion; it seems to include Christian\nfaith, or perhaps even to coincide with it; and thus the Philosophy of\nFaith has a thoroughly orthodox and Christian look, on the strength of\nwhich it takes the liberty of uttering its arbitrary dicta with greater\npretension and authority. But we must not let ourselves be deceived by\nthe semblance surreptitiously secured by a merely verbal similarity.\nThe two things are radically distinct. Firstly, the Christian faith\ncomprises in it an authority of the Church: but the faith of Jacobi's\nphilosophy has no other authority than that of a personal revelation.\nAnd, secondly, the Christian faith is a copious body of objective\ntruth, a system of knowledge and doctrine: while the scope of the\nphilosophic faith is so utterly indefinite, that, while it has room for\nthe faith of the Christian, it equally admits a belief in the divinity\nof the Dalai-lama, the ox, or the monkey,--thus, so far as it goes,\nnarrowing Deity down to its simplest terms, a 'Supreme Being.' Faith\nitself, taken in this professedly philosophical sense, is nothing but\nthe sapless abstract of immediate knowledge,--a purely formal category\napplicable to very different facts; and it ought never to be confused\nor identified with the spiritual fulness of Christian faith, whether we\nlook at that faith in the heart of the believer and the in-dwelling of\nthe Holy Spirit, or in the system of theological doctrine.\nWith what is here called faith or immediate knowledge must also be\nidentified inspiration, the heart's revelations, the truths implanted\nin man by nature, and also in particular, healthy reason or Common\nSense, as it is called. All these forms agree in adopting as their\nleading principle the immediacy, or self-evident way, in which a fact\nor body of truths is presented in consciousness.\n84.] This immediate knowledge consists in knowing that the Infinite,\nthe Eternal, the God which is in our idea, really _is_: or, it asserts\nthat in our consciousness there is immediately and inseparably bound up\nwith this idea the certainty of its actual being.\nTo seek to controvert these maxims of immediate knowledge is the last\nthing philosophers would think of. They may rather find occasion for\nself-gratulation when these ancient doctrines, expressing as they\ndo the general tenor of philosophic teaching, have, even in this\nunphilosophical fashion, become to some extent universal convictions\nof the age. The true marvel rather is that any one could suppose that\nthese principles were opposed to philosophy,--the maxims, viz., that\nwhatever is held to be true is immanent in the mind, and that there\nis truth for the mind (\u00a7 63). From a formal point of view, there is a\npeculiar interest in the maxim that the being of God is immediately and\ninseparably bound up with the thought of God, that objectivity is bound\nup with the subjectivity which the thought originally presents. Not\ncontent with that, the philosophy of immediate knowledge goes so far in\nits one-sided view, as to affirm that the attribute of existence, even\nin perception, is quite as inseparably connected with the conception\nwe have of our own bodies and of external things, as it is with the\nthought of God. Now it is the endeavour of philosophy to _prove_ such\na unity, to show that it lies in the very nature of thought and\nsubjectivity, to be inseparable from being and objectivity. In these\ncircumstances therefore, philosophy, whatever estimate may be formed of\nthe character of these proofs, must in any case be glad to see it shown\nand maintained that its maxims are facts of consciousness, and thus\nin harmony with experience. The difference between philosophy and the\nasseverations of immediate knowledge rather centres in the exclusive\nattitude which immediate knowledge adopts, when it sets itself up\nagainst philosophy.\nAnd yet it was as a self-evident or immediate truth that the 'Cogito,\nergo sum,' of Descartes, the maxim on which may be said to hinge the\nwhole interest of Modern Philosophy, was first stated by its author.\nThe man who calls this a syllogism, must know little more about a\nsyllogism than that the word 'Ergo' occurs in it. Where shall we look\nfor the middle term? And a middle term is a much more essential point\nof a syllogism than the word 'Ergo.' If we try to justify the name, by\ncalling the combination of ideas in Descartes an 'immediate' syllogism,\nthis superfluous variety of syllogism is a mere name for an utterly\nunmediated synthesis of distinct terms of thought. That being so, the\nsynthesis of being with our ideas, as stated in the maxim of immediate\nknowledge, has no more and no less claim to the title of syllogism than\nthe axiom of Descartes has. From Hotho's 'Dissertation on the Cartesian\nPhilosophy' (published 1826), I borrow the quotation in which Descartes\nhimself distinctly declares that the maxim 'Cogito, ergo sum,' is no\nsyllogism. The passages are Respons. ad II Object.: De Methodo IV:\nEp. I. 118. From the first passage I quote the words more immediately\nto the point. Descartes says: 'That we are thinking beings is \"_prima\nquaedam notio quae ex nullo syllogismo concluditur_\"' (a certain\nprimary notion, which is deduced from no syllogism); and goes on:\n_'neque cum quis dicit; Ego cogito, ergo sum sive existo, existentiam\nex cogitatione per syllogismum deducit.'_ (Nor, when one says, I think,\ntherefore I am or exist, does he deduce existence from thought by means\nof a syllogism.) Descartes knew what it implied in a syllogism, and\nso he adds that, in order to make the maxim admit of a deduction by\nsyllogism, we should have to add the major premiss: _'Illud omne quod\ncogitat, est sive existit.'_ (Everything which thinks, is or exists.)\nOf course, he remarks, this major premiss itself has to be deduced from\nthe original statement.\nThe language of Descartes on the maxim that the 'I' which _thinks_ must\nalso at the same time _be,_ his saying that this connexion is given and\nimplied in the simple perception of consciousness,--that this connexion\nis the absolute first, the principle, the most certain and evident of\nall things, so that no scepticism can be conceived so monstrous as not\nto admit it:--all this language is so vivid and distinct, that the\nmodern statements of Jacobi and others on this immediate connexion can\nonly pass for needless repetitions.\n65.] The theory of which we are speaking is not satisfied when it has\nshown that mediate knowledge taken separately is an adequate vehicle\nof truth. Its distinctive doctrine is that immediate knowledge alone,\nto the total exclusion of mediation, can possess a content which is\ntrue. This exclusiveness is enough to show that the theory is a relapse\ninto the metaphysical understanding, with its pass-words 'Either--or.'\nAnd thus it is really a relapse into the habit of external mediation,\nthe gist of which consists in clinging to those narrow and one-sided\ncategories of the finite, which it falsely imagined itself to have left\nfor ever behind. This point, however, we shall not at present discuss\nin detail. An exclusively immediate knowledge is asserted as a fact\nonly, and in the present Introduction we can only study it from this\nexternal point of view. The real significance of such knowledge will\nbe explained, when we come to the logical question of the opposition\nbetween mediate and immediate. But it is characteristic of the view\nbefore us to decline to examine the nature of the fact, that is, the\nnotion of it; for such an examination would itself be a step towards\nmediation and even towards knowledge. The genuine discussion on logical\nground, therefore, must be deferred till we come to the proper province\nof Logic itself.\nThe whole of the second part of Logic, the Doctrine of Essential Being,\nis a discussion of the intrinsic and self-affirming unity of immediacy\nand mediation.\n66.] Beyond this point then we need not go: immediate knowledge is\nto be accepted as a _fact._ Under these circumstances examination is\ndirected to the field of experience, to a psychological phenomenon. If\nthat be so, we need only note, as the commonest of experiences, that\ntruths, which we well know to be results of complicated and highly\nmediated trains of thought, present themselves immediately and without\neffort to the mind of any man who is familiar with the subject. The\nmathematician, like every one who has mastered a particular science,\nmeets any problem with ready-made solutions which pre-suppose most\ncomplicated analyses: and every educated man has a number of general\nviews and maxims which he can muster without trouble, but which\ncan only have sprung from frequent reflection and long experience.\nThe facility we attain in any sort of knowledge, art, or technical\nexpertness, consists in having the particular knowledge or kind of\naction present to our mind in any case that occurs, even we may say,\nimmediate in our very limbs, in an out-going activity. In all these\ninstances, immediacy of knowledge is so far from excluding mediation,\nthat the two things are linked together,--immediate knowledge being\nactually the product and result of mediated knowledge.\nIt is no less obvious that immediate _existence_ is bound up with\nits mediation. The seed and the parents are immediate and initial\nexistences in respect of the off-spring which they generate. But the\nseed and the parents, though they exist and are therefore immediate,\nare yet in their turn generated: and the child, without prejudice to\nthe mediation of its existence, is immediate, because it _is._ The fact\nthat I am in Berlin, my immediate presence here, is mediated by my\nhaving made the journey hither.\n67.] One thing may be observed with reference to the immediate\nknowledge of God, of legal and ethical principles (including under\nthe head of immediate knowledge, what is otherwise termed Instinct,\nImplanted or Innate Ideas, Common Sense, Natural Reason, or whatever\nform, in short, we give to the original spontaneity). It is a matter\nof general experience that education or development is required to\nbring out into consciousness what is therein contained. It was so even\nwith the Platonic reminiscence; and the Christian rite of baptism,\nalthough a sacrament, involves the additional obligation of a Christian\nup-bringing. In short, religion and morals, however much they may be\nfaith or immediate knowledge, are still on every side conditioned by\nthe mediating process which is termed development, education, training.\nThe adherents, no less than the assailants, of the doctrine of Innate\nIdeas have been guilty throughout of the like exclusiveness and\nnarrowness as is here noted. They have drawn a hard and fast line\nbetween the essential and immediate union (as it may be described) of\ncertain universal principles with the soul, and another union which has\nto be brought about in an external fashion, and through the channel of\n_given_ objects and conceptions, There is one objection, borrowed from\nexperience, which was raised against the doctrine of Innate ideas. All\nmen, it was said, must have these ideas; they must have, for example,\nthe maxim of contradiction, present in the mind,--they must be aware\nof it; for this maxim and others like it were included in the class\nof Innate ideas. The objection may be set down to misconception; for\nthe principles in question, though innate, need not on that account\nhave the form of ideas or conceptions of something we are aware of.\nStill, the objection completely meets and overthrows the crude theory\nof immediate knowledge, which expressly maintains its formulae in so\nfar as they are in consciousness.--Another point calls for notice. We\nmay suppose it admitted by the intuitive school, that the special case\nof religious faith involves supplementing by a Christian or religious\neducation and development. In that case it is acting capriciously when\nit seeks to ignore this admission when speaking about faith, or it\nbetrays a want of reflection not to know, that, if the necessity of\neducation be once admitted, mediation is pronounced indispensable.\nThe reminiscence of ideas spoken of by Plato is equivalent to\nsaying that ideas implicitly exist in man, instead of being, as\nthe Sophists assert, a foreign importation into his mind. But to\nconceive knowledge as reminiscence does not interfere with, or\nset aside as useless, the development of what is implicitly in\nman;--which development is another word for mediation. The same\nholds good of the innate ideas that we find in Descartes and the\nScotch philosophers. These ideas are only potential in the first\ninstance, and should be looked at as being a sort of mere capacity\nin man.\n88.] In the case of these experiences the appeal turns upon something\nthat shows itself bound up with immediate consciousness. Even if\nthis combination be in the first instance taken as an external and\nempirical connexion, still, even for empirical observation, the fact\nof its being constant shows it to be essential and inseparable. But,\nagain, if this immediate consciousness, as exhibited in experience,\nbe taken separately, so far as it is a consciousness of God and\nthe divine nature, the state of mind which it implies is generally\ndescribed as an exaltation above the finite, above the senses, and\nabove the instinctive desires and affections of the natural heart:\nwhich exaltation passes over into, and terminates in, faith in God and\na divine order. It is apparent, therefore, that, though faith may be an\nimmediate knowledge and certainty, it equally implies the interposition\nof this process as its antecedent and condition.\nIt has been already observed, that the so-called proofs of the being\nof God, which start from finite being, give an expression to this\nexaltation. In that light they are no inventions of an over-subtle\nreflection, but the necessary and native channel in which the movement\nof mind runs: though it may be that, in their ordinary form, these\nproofs have not their correct and adequate expression.\n69.] It is the passage (\u00a7 64) from the subjective Idea to being which\nforms the main concern of the doctrine of immediate knowledge. A\nprimary and self-evident inter-connexion is declared to exist between\nour Idea and being. Yet precisely this central point of transition,\nutterly irrespective of any connexions which show in experience,\nclearly involves a mediation. And the mediation is of no imperfect or\nunreal kind, where the mediation takes place with and through something\nexternal, but one comprehending both antecedent and conclusion.\n70.] For, what this theory asserts is that truth lies neither in the\nIdea as a merely subjective thought, nor in mere being on its own\naccount;--that mere being _per se,_ a being that is not of the Idea,\nis the sensible finite being of the world. Now all this only affirms,\nwithout demonstration, that the Idea has truth only by means of being,\nand being has truth only by means of the Idea. The maxim of immediate\nknowledge rejects an indefinite empty immediacy (and such is abstract\nbeing, or pure unity taken by itself), and affirms in its stead the\nunity of the Idea with being. And it acts rightly in so doing. But it\nis stupid not to see that the unity of distinct terms or modes is not\nmerely a purely immediate unity, _i.e._ unity empty and indeterminate,\nbut that--with equal emphasis--the one term is shown to have truth only\nas mediated through the other;--or, if the phrase be preferred, that\neither term is only mediated with truth through the other. That the\nquality of mediation is involved in the very immediacy of intuition\nis thus exhibited as a fact, against which understanding, conformably\nto the fundamental maxim of immediate knowledge that the evidence of\nconsciousness is infallible, can have nothing to object. It is only\nordinary abstract understanding which takes the terms of mediation and\nimmediacy, each by itself absolutely, to represent an inflexible line\nof distinction, and thus draws upon its own head the hopeless task of\nreconciling them. The difficulty, as we have shown, has no existence in\nthe fact, and it vanishes in the speculative notion.\n71.] The one-sidedness of the intuitional school has certain\ncharacteristics attending upon it, which we shall proceed to point out\nin their main features, now that we have discussed the fundamental\nprinciple. The _first_ of these corollaries is as follows. Since the\ncriterion of truth is found, not in the nature of the content, but in\nthe mere fact of consciousness, every alleged truth has no other basis\nthan subjective certitude and the assertion that we discover a certain\nfact in our consciousness. What I discover in my consciousness is thus\nexaggerated into a fact of the consciousness of all, and even passed\noff for the very nature of consciousness.\nAmong the so-called proofs of the existence of God, there used to stand\nthe _consensus gentium,_ to which appeal is made as early as Cicero.\nThe _consensus gentium_ is a weighty authority, and the transition is\neasy and natural, from the circumstance that a certain fact is found\nin the consciousness of every one, to the conclusion that it is a\nnecessary element in the very nature of consciousness. In this category\nof general agreement there was latent the deep-rooted perception, which\ndoes not escape even the least cultivated mind, that the consciousness\nof the individual is at the same time particular and accidental. Yet\nunless we examine the nature of this consciousness itself, stripping\nit of its particular and accidental elements and, by the toilsome\noperation of reflection, disclosing the universal in its entirety and\npurity, it is only a _unanimous_ agreement upon a given point that can\nauthorize a decent presumption that that point is part of the very\nnature of consciousness. Of course, if thought insists on seeing the\nnecessity of what is presented as a fact of general occurrence, the\n_consensus gentium_ is certainly not sufficient. Yet even granting the\nuniversality of the fact to be a satisfactory proof, it has been found\nimpossible to establish the belief in God on such an argument, because\nexperience shows that there are individuals and nations without any\nsuch faith.[1] But there can be nothing shorter and more convenient\nthan to have the bare assertion to make, that we discover a fact in\nour consciousness, and are certain that it is true: and to declare\nthat this certainty, instead of proceeding from our particular mental\nconstitution only, belongs to the very nature of the mind.\n72.] A _second_ corollary which results from holding immediacy of\nconsciousness to be the criterion of truth is that all superstition\nor idolatry is allowed to be truth, and that an apology is prepared\nfor any contents of the will, however wrong and immoral. It is because\nhe believes in them, and not from the reasoning and syllogism of\nwhat is termed mediate knowledge, that the Hindoo finds God in the\ncow, the monkey, the Brahmin, or the Lama. But the natural desires\nand affections spontaneously carry and deposit their interests in\nconsciousness, where also immoral aims make themselves naturally at\nhome: the good or bad character would thus express the _definite being_\nof the will, which would be known, and that most immediately, in the\ninterests and aims.\n73.] _Thirdly_ and lastly, the immediate consciousness of God goes no\nfurther than to tell us _that_ He is: to tell us _what_ He is, would be\nan act of cognition, involving mediation. So that God as an object of\nreligion is expressly narrowed down to the indeterminate supersensible,\nGod in general: and the significance of religion is reduced to a\nminimum.\nIf it were really needful to win back and secure the bare belief that\nthere is a God, or even to create it, we might well wonder at the\npoverty of the age which can see a gain in the merest pittance of\nreligious consciousness, and which in its church has sunk so low as to\nworship at the altar that stood in Athens long ago, dedicated to the\n'Unknown God.'\n74.] We have still briefly to indicate the general nature of the\nform of immediacy. For it is the essential one-sidedness of the\ncategory, which makes whatever comes under it one sided and, for\nthat reason, finite. And, first, it makes the universal no better\nthan an abstraction external to the particulars, and God a being\nwithout determinate quality. But God can only be called a spirit\nwhen He is known to be at once the beginning and end, as well as\nthe mean, in the process of mediation. Without this unification of\nelements He is neither concrete, nor living, nor a spirit. Thus the\nknowledge of God as a spirit necessarily implies mediation. The form\nof immediacy, secondly, invests the particular with the character of\nindependent or self-centred being. But such predicates contradict the\nvery essence of the particular,--which is to be referred to something\nelse outside. They thus invest the finite with the character of an\nabsolute. But, besides, the form of immediacy is altogether abstract:\nit has no preference for one set of contents more than another,\nbut is equally susceptible of all: it may as well sanction what is\nidolatrous and immoral as the reverse. Only when we discern that the\ncontent,--the particular, is not self-subsistent, but derivative from\nsomething else, are its finitude and untruth shown in their proper\nlight. Such discernment, where the content we discern carries with\nit the ground of its dependent nature, is a knowledge which involves\nmediation. The only content which can be held to be the truth is one\nnot mediated with something else, not limited by other things: or,\notherwise expressed, it is one mediated by itself, where mediation and\nimmediate reference-to-self coincide. The understanding that fancies\nit has got clear of finite knowledge, the identity of the analytical\nmetaphysicians and the old 'rationalists,' abruptly takes again as\nprinciple and criterion of truth that immediacy which, as an abstract\nreference-to-self, is the same as abstract identity. Abstract thought\n(the scientific form used by 'reflective' metaphysic) and abstract\nintuition (the form used by immediate knowledge) are one and the same.\nThe stereotyped opposition between the form of immediacy and that\nof mediation gives to the former a halfness and inadequacy, that\naffects every content which is brought under it. Immediacy means,\nupon the whole, an abstract reference-to-self, that is, an abstract\nidentity or abstract universality. Accordingly the essential and\nreal universal, when taken merely in its immediacy, is a mere\nabstract universal; and from this point of view God is conceived\nas a being altogether without determinate quality. To call God\nspirit is in that case only a phrase: for the consciousness and\nself-consciousness, which spirit implies, are impossible without a\ndistinguishing of it from itself and from something else, _i.e._\nwithout mediation.\n75.] It was impossible for us to criticise this, the third attitude,\nwhich thought has been made to take towards objective truth, in any\nother mode than what is naturally indicated and admitted in the\ndoctrine itself. The theory asserts that immediate knowledge is a\nfact. It has been shown to be untrue in fact to say that there is an\nimmediate knowledge, a knowledge without mediation either by means of\nsomething else or in itself. It has also been explained to be false\nin fact to say that thought advances through finite and conditioned\ncategories only, which are always mediated by a something else, and to\nforget that in the very act of mediation the mediation itself vanishes.\nAnd to show that, in point of fact, there is a knowledge which advances\nneither by unmixed immediacy nor by unmixed mediation, we can point to\nthe example of Logic and the whole of philosophy.\n76.] If we view the maxims of immediate knowledge in connexion with the\nuncritical metaphysic of the past from which we started, we shall learn\nfrom the comparison the reactionary nature of the school of Jacobi. His\ndoctrine is a return to the modern starting-point of this metaphysic\nin the Cartesian philosophy. Both Jacobi and Descartes maintain the\nfollowing three points:\n(1) The simple inseparability of the thought and being of the\nthinker. '_Cogito, ergo sum_' is the same doctrine as that the being,\nreality, and existence of the 'Ego' is immediately revealed to me\nin consciousness. (Descartes, in fact, is careful to state that by\nthought he means consciousness in general. Princip. Phil. I. 9.) This\ninseparability is the absolutely first and most certain knowledge, not\nmediated or demonstrated.\n(2) The inseparability of existence from the conception of God: the\nformer is necessarily implied in the latter, or the conception never\ncan be without the attribute of existence, which is thus necessary and\neternal.[2]\n(3) The immediate consciousness of the existence of external things.\nBy this nothing more is meant than sense-consciousness. To have such\na thing is the slightest of all cognitions: and the only thing worth\nknowing about it is that such immediate knowledge of the being of\nthings external is error and delusion, that the sensible world as such\nis altogether void of truth; that the being of these external things is\naccidental and passes away as a show; and that their very nature is to\nhave only an existence which is separable from their essence and notion.\n77.] There is however a distinction between the two points of view:\n(1) The Cartesian philosophy, from these unproved postulates, which\nit assumes to be unprovable, proceeds to wider and wider details of\nknowledge, and thus gave rise to the sciences of modern times. The\nmodern theory (of Jacobi), on the contrary, (\u00a7 62) has come to what is\nintrinsically a most important conclusion that cognition, proceeding\nas it must by finite mediations, can know only the finite, and never\nembody the truth; and would fain have the consciousness of God go no\nfurther than the aforesaid very abstract belief that God _is_.[3]\n(2) The modern doctrine on the one hand makes no change in the\nCartesian method of the usual scientific knowledge, and conducts on\nthe same plan the experimental and finite sciences that have sprung\nfrom it. But, on the other hand, when it comes to the science which\nhas infinity for its scope, it throws aside that method, and thus,\nas it knows no other, it rejects all methods. It abandons itself to\nwild vagaries of imagination and assertion, to a moral priggishness\nand sentimental arrogance, or to a reckless dogmatising and lust\nof argument, which is loudest against philosophy and philosophic\ndoctrines. Philosophy of course tolerates no mere assertions or\nconceits, and checks the free play of argumentative see-saw.\n78.] We must then reject the opposition between an independent\nimmediacy in the contents or facts of consciousness and an equally\nindependent mediation, supposed incompatible with the former. The\nincompatibility is a mere assumption, an arbitrary assertion. All other\nassumptions and postulates must in like manner be left behind at the\nentrance to philosophy, whether they are derived from the intellect or\nthe imagination. For philosophy is the science, in which every such\nproposition must first be scrutinised and its meaning and oppositions\nbe ascertained.\nScepticism, made a negative science and systematically applied to all\nforms of knowledge, might seem a suitable introduction, as pointing out\nthe nullity of such assumptions. But a sceptical introduction would\nbe not only an ungrateful but also a useless course; and that because\nDialectic, as we shall soon make appear, is itself an essential element\nof affirmative science. Scepticism, besides, could only get hold of\nthe finite forms as they were suggested by experience, taking them\nas given, instead of deducing them scientifically. To require such\na scepticism accomplished is the same as to insist on science being\npreceded by universal doubt, or a total absence of presupposition.\nStrictly speaking, in the resolve that _wills pure thought,_ this\nrequirement is accomplished by freedom which, abstracting from\neverything, grasps its pure abstraction, the simplicity of thought.\n[1] In order to judge of the greater or less extent lo which Experience\nshows cases of Atheism or of the belief in God, it is all-important\nto know if the mere general conception of deity suffices, or if a\nmore definite knowledge of God is required. The Christian world would\ncertainly refuse the title of God to the idols of the Hindoos and the\nChinese, to the fetiches of the Africans, and even to the gods of\nGreece themselves. If so, a believer in these idols would not be a\nbeliever in God. If it were contended, on the other hand, that such\na belief in idols implies some sort of belief in God, as the species\nimplies the genus, then idolatry would argue not faith in an idol\nmerely, but faith in God. The Athenians took an opposite view. The\npoets and philosophers who explained Zeus to be a cloud, and maintained\nthat there was only one God, were treated as atheists at Athens.\nThe danger in these questions lies in looking at what the mind may make\nout of an object, and not what that object actually and explicitly\nis. If we fail to note this distinction, the commonest perceptions of\nmen's senses will be religion: for every such perception, and indeed\nevery act of mind, implicitly contains the principle which, when it\nis purified and developed, rises to religion. But to be capable of\nreligion is one thing, to have it another. And religion yet implicit is\nonly a capacity or a possibility.\nThus in modern times, travellers have found tribes (as Captains Ross\nand Parry found the Esquimaux) which, as they tell us, have not even\nthat small modicum of religion possessed by African sorcerers, the\n_go\u00ebtes_ of Herodotus. On the other hand, an Englishman, who spent the\nfirst months of the last Jubilee at Rome, says, in his account of the\nmodern Romans, that the common people are bigots, whilst those who can\nread and write are atheists to a man.\nThe charge of Atheism is seldom heard in modern times: principally\nbecause the facts and the requirements of religion are reduced to a\nminimum. (See \u00a7 73.)\n[2] Descartes, Princip. Phil. I. 15: _Magis hoc (ens summe perfectum\nexistere) credet, si attendat, nullius alterius rei ideam apud\nse inveniri, in qua eodem modo necessariam existentiam contineri\nanimadveriat;--intelliget illam ideam exhibere veram et immutabilem\nnaturam, quaeque non potest non existere, cum necessaria existentia in\nea contineatur._ (The reader will be more disposed to _believe_ that\nthere exists a being supremely perfect, if he notes that in the case\nof nothing else is there found in him an idea, in which he notices\nnecessary existence to be contained in the same way. He will see that\nthat idea exhibits a true and unchangeable nature,--a nature which\n_cannot but exist,_ since necessary existence is _contained in it._) A\nremark which immediately follows, and which sounds like mediation or\ndemonstration, does not really prejudice the original principle.\nIn Spinoza we come upon the same statement that the essence or\nabstract conception of God implies existence. The first of Spinoza's\ndefinitions, that of the _Causa Sui_ (or Self-Cause), explains it to\nbe _cujus essentia involvit existentiam, sive id cujus natura non\npotest concipi nisi existens_ (that of which the essence involves\nexistence, or that whose nature cannot be conceived except as\nexisting). The inseparability of the notion from being is the main\npoint and fundamental hypothesis in his system. But what notion is\nthus inseparable from being? Not the notion of finite things, for they\nare so constituted as to have a contingent and a created existence.\nSpinoza's 11th proposition, which follows with a proof that God exists\nnecessarily, and his 20th, showing that God's existence and his essence\nare one and the same, are really superfluous, and the proof is more\nin form than in reality. To say, that God is Substance, the only\nSubstance, and that, as Substance is _Causa Sui,_ God therefore exists\nnecessarily, is merely stating that God is that of which the notion and\nthe being are inseparable.\n[3] Anselm on the contrary says: _Negligentiae mihi videtur, si\npost-quam confirmati sumus in fide, non studemus, quod credimus,\nintelligere._ (Methinks it is _carelessness,_ if, after we have been\nconfirmed in the faith, we do not _exert ourselves to see the meaning\nof what we believe._) [Tractat. Cur Deus Homo?] These words of Anselm,\nin connexion with the concrete truths of Christian doctrine, offer a\nfar harder problem for investigation, than is contemplated by this\nmodern faith.\nCHAPTER VI.\nLOGIC FURTHER DEFINED AND DIVIDED.\n79.] In point of form Logical doctrine has three sides: (\u03b1) the\nAbstract side, or that of understanding: (_\u00df_) the Dialectical, or that\nof negative reason: (y) the Speculative, or that of positive reason.\nThese three sides do not make three _parts_ of logic, but are stages\nor 'moments' in every logical entity, that is, of every notion and\ntruth whatever. They may all be put under the first stage, that of\nunderstanding, and so kept isolated from each other; but this would\ngive an inadequate conception of them.--The statement of the dividing\nlines and the characteristic aspects of logic is at this point no more\nthan historical and anticipatory.\n80.] (\u03b1) Thought, as _Understanding,_ sticks to fixity of characters\nand their distinctness from one another: every such limited abstract it\ntreats as having a subsistence and being of its own.\nIn our ordinary usage of the term thought and even notion, we often\nhave before our eyes nothing more than the operation of Understanding.\nAnd no doubt thought is primarily an exercise of Understanding:--only\nit goes further, and the notion is not a function of Understanding\nmerely. The action of Understanding may be in general described as\ninvesting its subject-matter with the form of universality. But this\nuniversal is an abstract universal: that is to say, its opposition to\nthe particular is so rigorously maintained, that it is at the same\ntime also reduced to the character of a particular again. In this\nseparating and abstracting attitude towards its objects, Understanding\nis the reverse of immediate perception and sensation, which, as such,\nkeep completely to their native sphere of action in the concrete.\nIt is by referring to this opposition of Understanding to sensation or\nfeeling that we must explain the frequent attacks made upon thought\nfor being hard and narrow, and for leading, if consistently developed,\nto ruinous and pernicious results. The answer to these charges, in so\nfar as they are warranted by their facts, is, that they do not touch\nthinking in general, certainly not the thinking of Reason, but only the\nexercise of Understanding. It must be added however, that the merit and\nrights of the mere Understanding should unhesitatingly be admitted. And\nthat merit lies in the fact, that apart from Understanding there is no\nfixity or accuracy in the region either of theory or of practice.\nThus, in theory, knowledge begins by apprehending existing objects in\ntheir specific differences. In the study of nature, for example, we\ndistinguish matters, forces, genera and the like, and stereotype each\nin its isolation. Thought is here acting in its analytic capacity,\nwhere its canon is identity, a simple reference of each attribute to\nitself. It is under the guidance of the same identity that the process\nin knowledge is effected from one scientific truth to another. Thus,\nfor example, in mathematics magnitude is the feature which, to the\nneglect of any other, determines our advance. Hence in geometry we\ncompare one figure with another, so as to bring out their identity.\nSimilarly in other fields of knowledge, such as jurisprudence, the\nadvance is primarily regulated by identity. In it we argue from one\nspecific law or precedent to another: and what is this but to proceed\non the principle of identity?\nBut Understanding is as indispensable in practice as it is in theory.\nCharacter is an essential in conduct, and a man of character is an\nunderstanding man, who in that capacity has definite ends in view and\nundeviatingly pursues them. The man who will do something great must\nlearn, as Goethe says, to limit himself. The man who, on the contrary,\nwould do everything, really would do nothing, and fails. There is a\nhost of interesting things in the world: Spanish poetry, chemistry,\npolitics, and music are all very interesting, and if any one takes\nan interest in them we need not find fault. But for a person in a\ngiven situation to accomplish anything, he must stick to one definite\npoint, and not dissipate his' forces in many directions. In every\ncalling, too, the great thing is to pursue it with understanding. Thus\nthe judge must stick to the law, and give his verdict in accordance\nwith, it, undeterred by one motive or another, allowing no excuses;\nand looking neither left nor right. Understanding, too, is always an\nelement in thorough training. The trained-intellect is not satisfied\nwith cloudy and indefinite impressions, but grasps the objects in their\nfixed character: whereas the uncultivated man wavers unsettled, and it\noften costs a deal of trouble to come to an understanding with him on\nthe matter under discussion, and to bring him to fix his eye on the\ndefinite point in question.\nIt has been already explained that the Logical principle in general,\nfar from being merely a subjective action in our minds, is rather the\nvery universal, which as such is also objective. This doctrine is\nillustrated in the case of understanding, the first form of logical\ntruths. Understanding in this larger sense corresponds to what we call\nthe goodness of God, so far as that means that finite things are and\nsubsist. In nature, for example, we recognise the goodness of God in\nthe fact that the various classes or species of animals and plants are\nprovided with whatever they need for their preservation and welfare.\nNor is man excepted, who, both as an individual and as a nation,\npossesses partly in the given circumstances of climate, of quality\nand products of soil, and partly in his natural parts or talents, all\nthat is required for his maintenance and development. Under this shape\nUnderstanding is visible in every department of the objective world;\nand no object in that world can ever be wholly perfect which does\nnot give full satisfaction to the canons of understanding. A state,\nfor example, is imperfect, so long as it has not reached a clear\ndifferentiation of orders and callings, and so long as those functions\nof politics and government, which are different in principle, have not\nevolved for themselves special organs, in the same way as we see, for\nexample, the developed animal organism provided with separate organs\nfor the functions of sensation, motion, digestion, &c.\nThe previous course of the discussion may serve to show, that\nunderstanding is indispensable even in those spheres and regions of\naction which the popular fancy would deem furthest from it, and that in\nproportion as understanding, is absent from them, imperfection is the\nresult. This particularly holds good of Art, Religion, and Philosophy.\nIn Art, for example, understanding is visible where the forms of\nbeauty, which differ in principle, are kept distinct and exhibited in\ntheir purity. The same thing holds good also of single works of art.\nIt is part of the beauty and perfection of a dramatic poem that the\ncharacters of the several persons should be closely and faithfully\nmaintained, and that the different aims and interests involved should\nbe plainly and decidedly exhibited. Or again, take the province of\nReligion. The superiority of Greek over Northern mythology (apart from\nother differences of subject-matter and conception) mainly consists in\nthis: that in the former the individual gods are fashioned into forms\nof sculpture-like distinctness of outline, while in the latter the\nfigures fade away vaguely and hazily into one another. Lastly comes\nPhilosophy. That Philosophy never can get on without the understanding\nhardly calls for special remark after what has been said. Its foremost\nrequirement is that every thought shall be grasped in its full\nprecision, and nothing allowed to remain vague and indefinite.\nIt is usually added that understanding must not go too far. Which is\nso far correct, that understanding is not an ultimate, but on the\ncontrary finite, and so constituted that when carried to extremes it\nveers round to its opposite. It is the fashion of youth to dash about\nin abstractions: but the man who has learnt to know life steers clear\nof the abstract 'either--or,' and keeps to the concrete.\n81.] (\u00df) In the Dialectical stage these finite characterisations or\nformulae supersede themselves, and pass into their opposites.\n(1) But when the Dialectical principle is employed by the understanding\nseparately and independently,--especially as seen in its application\nto philosophical theories, Dialectic becomes Scepticism; in which the\nresult that ensues from its action is presented as a mere negation.\n(2) It is customary to treat Dialectic as an adventitious art, which\nfor very wantonness introduces confusion and a mere semblance of\ncontradiction into definite notions. And in that light, the semblance\nis the nonentity, while the true reality is supposed to belong to the\noriginal dicta of understanding. Often, indeed, Dialectic is nothing\nmore than a subjective see-saw of arguments _pro_ and _con,_ where\nthe absence of sterling thought is disguised by the subtlety which\ngives birth to such arguments. But in its true and proper character.\nDialectic is the very nature and essence of everything predicated by\nmere understanding,--the law of things and of the finite as a whole.\nDialectic is different from 'Reflection.' In the first instance,\nReflection is that movement out beyond the isolated predicate of a\nthing which gives it some reference, and brings out its relativity,\nwhile still in other respects leaving it its isolated validity. But\nby Dialectic is meant the in-dwelling tendency outwards by which the\none-sidedness and limitation of the predicates of understanding is seen\nin its true light, and shown to be the negation of them. For anything\nto be finite is just to suppress itself and put itself aside. Thus\nunderstood the Dialectical principle constitutes the life and soul of\nscientific progress, the dynamic which alone gives immanent connexion\nand necessity to the body of science; and, in a word, is seen to\nconstitute the real and true, as opposed to the external, exaltation\nabove the finite.\n(1) It is of the highest importance to ascertain and understand rightly\nthe nature of Dialectic. Wherever there is movement, wherever there is\nlife, wherever anything is carried into effect in the actual world,\nthere Dialectic is at work. It is also the soul of all knowledge\nwhich is truly scientific. In the popular way of looking at things,\nthe refusal to be bound by the abstract deliverances of understanding\nappears as fairness, which, according to the proverb Live and let\nlive, demands that each should have its turn; we admit the one, but\nwe admit the other also. But when we look more closely, we find that\nthe limitations of the finite do not merely come from without; that\nits own nature is the cause of its abrogation, and that by its own\nact it passes into its counterpart. We say, for instance, that man is\nmortal, and seem to think that the ground of his death is in external\ncircumstances only; so that if this way of looking were correct, man\nwould have two special properties, vitality and--also--mortality. But\nthe true view of the matter is that life, as life, involves the germ\nof death, and that the finite, being radically self-contradictory,\ninvolves its own self-suppression.\nNor, again, is Dialectic to be confounded with mere Sophistry. The\nessence of Sophistry lies in giving authority to a partial and abstract\nprinciple, in its isolation, as may suit the interest and particular\nsituation of the individual at the time. For example, a regard to my\nexistence, and my having the means of existence, is a vital motive\nof conduct, but if I exclusively emphasise this consideration or\nmotive of my welfare, and draw the conclusion that I may steal or\nbetray my country, we have a case of Sophistry. Similarly, it is a\nvital principle in conduct that I should be subjectively free, that\nis to say, that I should have an insight into what I am doing, and\na conviction that it is right. But if my pleading insists on this\nprinciple alone I fall into Sophistry, such as would overthrow all the\nprinciples of morality. From this sort of party-pleading Dialectic is\nwholly different; its purpose is to study things in their own being and\nmovement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories\nof understanding.\nDialectic, it may be added, is no novelty in philosophy. Among the\nancients Plato is termed the inventor of Dialectic; and his right to\nthe name rests on the fact, that the Platonic philosophy first gave\nthe free scientific, and thus at the same time the objective, form to\nDialectic. Socrates, as we should expect from the general character\nof his philosophising, has the dialectical element in a predominantly\nsubjective shape, that of Irony. He used to turn his Dialectic,\nfirst against ordinary consciousness, and then especially against\nthe Sophists. In his conversations he used to simulate the wish for\nsome clearer knowledge about the subject under discussion, and after\nputting all sorts of questions with that intent, he drew on those with\nwhom he conversed to the opposite of what their first impressions\nhad pronounced correct. If, for instance, the Sophists claimed to\nbe teachers, Socrates by a series of questions forced the Sophist\nProtagoras to confess that all learning is only recollection. In his\nmore strictly scientific dialogues Plato employs the dialectical method\nto show the finitude of all hard and fast terms of understanding.\nThus in the Parmenides he deduces the many from the one, and shows\nnevertheless that the many cannot but define itself as the one. In\nthis grand style did Plato treat Dialectic. In modern times it was,\nmore than any other, Kant who resuscitated the name of Dialectic, and\nrestored it to its post of honour. He did it, as we have seen (\u00a7 48),\nby working out the Antinomies of the reason. The problem of these\nAntinomies is no mere subjective piece of work oscillating between\none set of grounds and another; it really serves to show that every\nabstract proposition of understanding, taken precisely as it is given,\nnaturally veers round into its opposite.\nHowever reluctant Understanding may be to admit the action of\nDialectic, we must not suppose that the recognition if its existence\nis peculiarly confined to the philosopher. It would be truer to say\nthat Dialectic gives expression to a law which is felt in all other\ngrades of consciousness, and in general experience. Everything that\nsurrounds us may be viewed as an instance of Dialectic. We are aware\nthat everything finite, instead of being stable and ultimate, is rather\nchangeable and transient; and this is exactly what we mean by that\nDialectic of the finite, by which the finite, as implicitly other than\nwhat it is, is forced beyond its own immediate or natural being to\nturn suddenly into its opposite. We have before this (\u00a7 80) identified\nUnderstanding with what is implied in the popular idea of the goodness\nof God; we may now remark of Dialectic, in the same objective\nsignification, that its principle answers to the idea of his power.\nAll things, we say,--that is, the finite world as such,--are doomed;\nand in saying so, we have a vision of Dialectic as the universal and\nirresistible power before which nothing can stay, however secure and\nstable it may deem itself. The category of power does not, it is true,\nexhaust the depth of the divine nature or the notion of God; but it\ncertainly forms a vital element in all religious consciousness.\nApart from this general objectivity of Dialectic, we find traces of its\npresence in each of the particular provinces and phases of the natural\nand the spiritual world. Take as an illustration the motion of the\nheavenly bodies. At this moment the planet stands in this spot, but\nimplicitly it is the possibility of being in another spot; and that\npossibility of being otherwise the planet brings into existence by\nmoving. Similarly the 'physical' elements prove to be Dialectical. The\nprocess of meteorological action is the exhibition of their Dialectic.\nIt is the same dynamic that lies at the root of every other natural\nprocess, and, as it were, forces nature out of itself. To illustrate\nthe presence of Dialectic in the spiritual world, especially in the\nprovinces of law and morality, we have only to recollect how general\nexperience shows us the extreme of one state or action suddenly\nshifting into its opposite: a Dialectic which is recognised in many\nways in common proverbs. Thus _summum jus summa injuria:_ which means,\nthat to drive an abstract right to its extremity is to do a wrong.\nIn political life, as every one knows, extreme anarchy and extreme\ndespotism naturally lead to one another. The perception of Dialectic\nin the province of individual Ethics is seen in the well-known adages,\nPride comes before a fall: Too much wit outwits itself. Even feeling,\nbodily as well as mental, has its Dialectic. Every one knows how\nthe extremes of pain and pleasure pass into each other: the heart\noverflowing with joy seeks relief in tears, and the deepest melancholy\nwill at times betray its presence by a smile.\n(2) Scepticism should not be looked upon merely as a doctrine of doubt.\nIt would be more correct to say that the Sceptic has no doubt of his\npoint, which is the nothingness of all finite existence. He who only\ndoubts still clings to the hope that his doubt may be resolved, and\nthat one or other of the definite views, between which he wavers,\nwill turn out solid and true. Scepticism properly so called is a\nvery different thing: it is complete hopelessness about all which\nunderstanding counts stable, and the feeling to which it gives birth\nis one of unbroken calmness and inward repose. Such at least is the\nnoble Scepticism of antiquity, especially as exhibited in the writings\nof Sextus Empiricus, when in the later times of Rome it had been\nsystematised as a complement to the dogmatic systems of Stoic and\nEpicurean. Of far other stamp, and to be strictly distinguished from\nit, is the modern Scepticism already mentioned \u00a7 (39), which partly\npreceded the Critical Philosophy, and partly sprung out of it. That\nlater Scepticism consisted solely in denying the truth and certitude\nof the super-sensible, and in pointing to the facts of sense and of\nimmediate sensations as what we have to keep to.\nEven to this day Scepticism is often spoken of as the irresistible\nenemy of all positive knowledge, and hence of philosophy, in so far\nas philosophy is concerned with positive knowledge. But in these\nstatements there is a misconception. It is only the finite thought\nof abstract understanding which has to fear Scepticism, because\nunable to withstand it: philosophy includes the sceptical principle\nas a subordinate function of its own, in the shape of Dialectic. In\ncontradistinction to mere Scepticism, however, philosophy does not\nremain content with the purely negative result of Dialectic. The\nsceptic mistakes the true value of his result, when he supposes it to\nbe no more than a negation pure and simple. For the negative, which\nemerges as the result of dialectic, is, because a result, at the same\ntime the positive: it contains what it results from, absorbed into\nitself, and made part of its own nature. Thus conceived, however, the\ndialectical stage has the features characterising the third grade of\nlogical truth, the speculative form, or form of positive reason.\n82.] (y) The Speculative stage, or stage of Positive Reason,\napprehends the unity of terms (propositions) in their opposition,--the\naffirmative, which is involved in their disintegration and in their\ntransition.\n(1) The result of Dialectic is positive, because it has a definite\ncontent, or because its result is not empty and abstract nothing, but\nthe negation of certain specific propositions which are contained in\nthe result,--for the very reason that it is a resultant and not an\nimmediate nothing. (2) It follows from this that the 'reasonable'\nresult, though it be only a thought and abstract, is still a concrete,\nbeing not a plain formal unity, but a unity of distinct propositions.\nBare abstractions or formal thoughts are therefore no business of\nphilosophy, which has to deal only with concrete thoughts. (3) The\nlogic of mere Understanding is involved in Speculative logic, and\ncan at will be elicited from it, by the simple process of omitting\nthe dialectical and 'reasonable' element. When that is done, it\nbecomes what the common logic is, a descriptive collection of sundry\nthought-forms and rules which, finite though they are, are taken to be\nsomething infinite.\nIf we consider only what it contains, and not how it contains it,\nthe true reason-world, so far from being the exclusive property of\nphilosophy, is the right of every human being on whatever grade of\nculture or mental growth he may stand; which would justify man's\nancient title of rational being. The general mode by which experience\nfirst makes us aware of the reasonable order of things is by accepted\nand unreasoned belief; and the character of the rational, as already\nnoted (\u00a7 45), is to be unconditioned, and thus to be self-contained,\nself-determining. In this sense man above all things becomes aware of\nthe reasonable order, when he knows of God, and knows Him to be the\ncompletely self-determined. Similarly, the consciousness a citizen has\nof his country and its laws is a perception of the reason-world, so\nlong as he looks up to them as unconditioned and likewise universal\npowers, to which he must subject his individual will. And in the same\nsense, the knowledge and will of the child is rational, when he knows\nhis parents' will, and wills it.\nNow, to turn these rational (of course positively-rational) realities\ninto speculative principles, the only thing needed is that they be\n_thought._ The expression 'Speculation' in common life is often used\nwith a very vague and at the same time secondary sense, as when we\nspeak of a matrimonial or a commercial speculation. By this we only\nmean two things: first, that what is immediately at hand has to be\npassed and left behind; and secondly, that the subject-matter of such\nspeculations, though in the first place only subjective, must not\nremain so, but be realised or translated into objectivity.\nWhat was some time ago remarked respecting the Idea, may be applied\nto this common usage of the term 'speculation': and we may add that\npeople who rank themselves amongst the educated expressly speak of\nspeculation even as if it were something purely subjective. A certain\ntheory of some conditions and circumstances of nature or mind may be,\nsay these people, very fine and correct as a matter of speculation,\nbut it contradicts experience and nothing of the sort is admissible in\nreality. To this the answer is, that the speculative is in its true\nsignification, neither preliminarily nor even definitively, something\nmerely subjective: that, on the contrary, it expressly rises above\nsuch oppositions as that between subjective and objective, which the\nunderstanding cannot get over, and absorbing them in itself, evinces\nits own concrete and all-embracing nature. A one-sided proposition\ntherefore can never even give expression to a speculative truth. If\nwe say, for example, that the absolute is the unity of subjective and\nobjective, we are undoubtedly in the right, but so far one-sided, as we\nenunciate the unity only and lay the accent upon it, forgetting that in\nreality the subjective and objective are not merely identical but also\ndistinct.\nSpeculative truth, it may also be noted, means very much the same as\nwhat, in special connexion with religious experience and doctrines,\nused to be called Mysticism. The term Mysticism is at present used,\nas a rule, to designate what is mysterious and incomprehensible: and\nin proportion as their general culture and way of thinking vary, the\nepithet is applied by one class to denote the real and the true, by\nanother to name everything connected with superstition and deception.\nOn which we first of all remark that there is mystery in the mystical,\nonly however for the understanding which is ruled by the principle\nof abstract identity; whereas the mystical, as synonymous with the\nspeculative, is the concrete unity of those propositions, which\nunderstanding only accepts in their separation and opposition. And if\nthose who recognise Mysticism as the highest truth are content to leave\nit in its original utter mystery, their conduct only proves that for\nthem too, as well as for their antagonists, thinking means abstract\nidentification, and that in their opinion, therefore, truth can only be\nwon by renouncing thought, or as it is frequently expressed, by leading\nthe reason captive. But, as we have seen, the abstract thinking of\nunderstanding is so far from being either ultimate or stable, that it\nshows a perpetual tendency to work its own dissolution and swing round\ninto its opposite. Reasonableness, on the contrary, just, consists in\nembracing within itself these opposites as unsubstantial elements. Thus\nthe reason-world may be equally styled mystical,--not however because\nthought cannot both reach and comprehend it, but merely because it lies\nbeyond the compass of understanding.\n83.] Logic is subdivided into three parts:--\nI. The Doctrine of Being:\nII. The Doctrine of Essence:\nIII. The Doctrine of Notion and Idea.\nThat is, into the Theory of Thought:\nI. In its immediacy: the notion implicit and in germ.\nII. In its reflection and mediation: the being-for-self and show of the\nnotion.\nIII. In its return into itself, and its developed abiding by itself:\nthe notion in and for itself.\nThe division of Logic now given, as well as the whole of the previous\ndiscussion on the nature of thought, is anticipatory: and the\njustification, or proof of it, can only result from the detailed\ntreatment of thought itself. For in philosophy, to prove means to\nshow how the subject by and from itself makes itself what it is. The\nrelation in which these three leading grades of thought, or of the\nlogical Idea, stand to each other must be conceived as follows. Truth\ncomes only with the notion: or, more precisely, the notion is the\ntruth of being and essence, both of which, when separately maintained\nin their isolation, cannot but be untrue, the former because it is\nexclusively immediate, and the latter because it is exclusively\nmediate. Why then, it may be asked, begin with the false and not at\nonce with the true? To which we answer that truth, to deserve the name,\nmust authenticate its own truth: which authentication, here within the\nsphere of logic, is given, when the notion demonstrates itself to be\nwhat is mediated by and with itself, and thus at the same time to be\ntruly immediate. This relation between the three stages of the logical\nIdea appears in a real and concrete shape thus: God, who is the truth,\nis known by us in His truth, that is, as absolute spirit, only in so\nfar as we at the same time recognise that the world which He created,\nnature and the finite spirit, are, in their difference from God,\nuntrue.\nCHAPTER VII.\nFIRST SUB-DIVISION OF LOGIC.\nTHE DOCTRINE OF BEING.\n84.] Being is the notion implicit only: its special forms have the\npredicate 'is'; when they are distinguished they are each of them an\n'other': and the shape which dialectic takes in them, _i.e._ their\nfurther specialisation, is a passing over into another. This further\ndetermination, or specialisation, is at once a forth-putting and in\nthat way a disengaging of the notion implicit in being; and at the\nsame time the withdrawing of being inwards, its sinking deeper into\nitself. Thus the explication of the notion in the sphere of being does\ntwo things: it brings out the totality of being, and it abolishes the\nimmediacy of being, or the form of being as such.\n85.] Being itself and the special sub-categories of it which\nfollow, as well as those of logic in general, may be looked upon as\ndefinitions of the Absolute, or metaphysical definitions of God: at\nleast the first and third category in every triad may,--the first,\nwhere the thought-form of the triad is formulated in its simplicity,\nand the third, being the return from differentiation to a simple\nself-reference. For a metaphysical definition of God is the expression\nof His nature in thoughts as such: and logic embraces all thoughts so\nlong as they continue in the thought-form. The second sub-category in\neach triad, where the grade of thought is in its differentiation,\ngives, on the other hand, a definition of the finite. The objection to\nthe form of definition is that it implies a something in the mind's eye\non which these predicates may fasten. Thus even the Absolute (though\nit purports to express God in the style and character of thought) in\ncomparison with its predicate (which really and distinctly expresses\nin thought what the subject does not), is as yet only an inchoate\npretended thought--the indeterminate subject of predicates yet to\ncome. The thought, which is here the matter of sole importance, is\ncontained only in the predicate: and hence the propositional form, like\nthe said subject, viz. the Absolute, is a mere superfluity (cf. \u00a7 31,\nand below, on the Judgment).\nEach of the three spheres of the logical idea proves to be a systematic\nwhole of thought-terms, and a phase of the Absolute. This is the case\nwith Being, containing the three grades of quality, quantity, and\nmeasure. Quality is, in the first place, the character identical with\nbeing: so identical, that a thing ceases to be what it is, if it loses\nits quality. Quantity, on the contrary, is the character external\nto being, and does not affect the being at all. Thus _e.g._ a house\nremains what it is, whether it be greater or smaller; and red remains\nred, whether it be brighter or darker. Measure, the third grade of\nbeing, which is the unity of the first two, is a qualitative quantity.\nAll things have their measure: _i.e._ the quantitative terms of their\nexistence, their being so or so great, does not matter within certain\nlimits; but when these limits are exceeded by an additional more or\nless, the things cease to be what they were. From measure follows the\nadvance to the second sub-division of the idea, Essence.\nThe three forms of being here mentioned, just because they are the\nfirst, are also the poorest, _i.e._ the most abstract. Immediate\n(sensible) consciousness, in so far as it simultaneously includes\nan intellectual element, is especially restricted to the abstract\ncategories of quality and quantity. The sensuous consciousness is in\nordinary estimation the most concrete and thus also the richest; but\nthat is only true as regards materials, whereas, in reference to the\nthought it contains, it is really the poorest and most abstract.\nA.--QUALITY.\n(a) Being.\n86.] Pure Being makes the beginning: because it is on one hand pure\nthought, and on the other immediacy itself, simple and indeterminate;\nand the first beginning cannot be mediated by anything, or be further\ndetermined.\nAll doubts and admonitions, which might be brought against beginning\nthe science with abstract empty being, will disappear, if we only\nperceive what a beginning naturally implies. It is possible to define\nbeing as 'I = I,' as 'Absolute Indifference' or Identity, and so on.\nWhere it is felt necessary to begin either with what is absolutely\ncertain, _i.e._ the certainty of oneself, or with a definition or\nintuition of the absolute truth, these and other forms of the kind\nmay be looked on as if they must be the first. But each of these\nforms contains a mediation, and hence cannot be the real first: for\nall mediation implies advance made from a first on to a second, and\nproceeding from something different. If I = I, or even the intellectual\nintuition, are really taken to mean no more than the first, they are in\nthis mere immediacy identical with being: while conversely, pure being,\nif abstract no longer, but including in it mediation, is pure thought\nor intuition.\nIf we enunciate Being as a predicate of the Absolute, we get the first\ndefinition of the latter. The Absolute is Being. This is (in thought)\nthe absolutely initial definition, the most abstract and stinted.\nIt is the definition given by the Eleatics, but at the same time is\nalso the well-known definition of God as the sum of all realities. It\nmeans, in short, that we are to set aside that limitation which is in\nevery reality, so that God shall be only the real in all reality, the\nsuperlatively real. Or, if we reject reality, as implying a reflection,\nwe get a more immediate or unreflected statement of the same thing,\nwhen Jacobi says that the God of Spinoza is the _principium_ of being\nin all existence.\n(1) When thinking is to begin, we have nothing but thought in its\nmerest indeterminateness: for we cannot determine unless there is\nboth one and another; and in the beginning there is yet no other. The\nindeterminate, as we here have it, is the blank we begin with, not a\nfeaturelessness reached by abstraction, not the elimination of all\ncharacter, but the original featurelessness which precedes all definite\ncharacter and is the very first of all. And this we call Being. It is\nnot to be felt, or perceived by sense, or pictured in imagination:\nit is only and merely thought, and as such it forms the beginning.\nEssence also is indeterminate, but in another sense: it has traversed\nthe process of mediation and contains implicit the determination it has\nabsorbed.\n(2) In the history of philosophy the different stages of the logical\nIdea assume the shape of successive systems, each based on a particular\ndefinition of the Absolute. As the logical Idea is seen to unfold\nitself in a process from the abstract to the concrete, so in the\nhistory of philosophy the earliest systems are the most abstract, and\nthus at the same time the poorest. The relation too of the earlier\nto the later; systems of philosophy is much like the relation of the\ncorresponding stages of the logical Idea: in other words, the earlier\nare preserved in the later; but subordinated and submerged. This is\nthe true meaning of a much misunderstood phenomenon in the history of\nphilosophy--the refutation of one system by another, of an earlier by\na later. Most commonly the refutation is taken in a purely negative\nsense to mean that the system refuted has ceased to count for anything,\nhas been set aside and done for. Were it so, the history of philosophy\nwould be of all studies most saddening, displaying, as it does,\nthe refutation of every system which time has brought forth. Now,\nalthough it may be admitted that every philosophy has been refuted,\nit must be in an equal degree maintained, that no philosophy has been\nrefuted, nay, or can be refuted. And that in two ways. For first,\nevery philosophy that deserves the name always embodies the Idea: and\nsecondly, every system represents one particular factor or particular\nstage in the evolution of the Idea. The refutation of a philosophy,\ntherefore, only means that its barriers are crossed, and its special\nprinciple reduced to a factor in the completer principle that follows.\nThus the history of philosophy, in its true meaning, deals not with a\npast, but with an eternal and veritable present: and, in its results,\nresembles not a museum of the aberrations of the human intellect,\nbut a Pantheon of Godlike figures. These figures of Gods are the\nvarious stages of the Idea, as they come forward one after another in\ndialectical development. To the historian of philosophy it belongs to\npoint out more precisely, how far the gradual evolution of his theme\ncoincides with, or swerves from, the dialectical unfolding of the pure\nlogical Idea. It is sufficient to mention here, that logic begins\nwhere the proper history of philosophy begins. Philosophy began in the\nEleatic school, especially with Parmenides. Parmenides, who conceives\nthe absolute as Being, says that 'Being alone is and Nothing is not.'\nSuch was the true starting-point of philosophy, which is always\nknowledge by thought: and here for the first time we find pure thought\nseized and made an object to itself.\nMen indeed thought from the beginning: (for thus only were they\ndistinguished from the animals). But thousands of years had to elapse\nbefore they came to apprehend thought in its purity, and to see in it\nthe truly objective. The Eleatics are celebrated as daring thinkers.\nBut this nominal admiration is often accompanied by the remark that\nthey went too far, when they made Being alone true, and denied the\ntruth of every other object of consciousness. We must go further than\nmere Being, it is true: and yet it is absurd to speak of the other\ncontents of our consciousness as somewhat as it were outside and beside\nBeing, or to say that there are other things, as well as Being. The\ntrue state of the case is rather as follows. Being, as Being, is\nnothing fixed or ultimate: it yields to dialectic and sinks into its\nopposite, which, also taken immediately, is Nothing. After all, the\npoint is, that Being is the first pure Thought; whatever else you may\nbegin with (the I = I, the absolute indifference, or God Himself),\nyou begin with a figure of materialised conception, not a product of\nthought; and that, so far as its thought content is concerned, such\nbeginning is merely Being.\n87.] But this mere Being, as it is mere abstraction, is therefore the\nabsolutely negative: which, in a similarly immediate aspect, is just\nNothing.\n(1) Hence was derived the second definition of the Absolute; the\nAbsolute is the Nought. In fact this definition is implied in saying\nthat the thing-in-itself is the indeterminate, utterly without form\nand so without content,--or in saying that God is only the supreme\nBeing and nothing more; for this is really declaring Him to be the same\nnegativity as above. The Nothing which the Buddhists make the universal\nprinciple, as well as the final aim and goal of everything, is the same\nabstraction.\n(2) If the opposition in thought is stated in this immediacy as Being\nand Nothing, the shock of its nullity is too great not to stimulate\nthe attempt to fix Being and secure it against the transition into\nNothing. With this intent, reflection has recourse to the plan of\ndiscovering some fixed predicate for Being, to mark it off from\nNothing. Thus we find Being identified with what persists amid all\nchange, with _matter,_ susceptible of innumerable determinations,--or\neven, unreflectingly, with a single existence, any chance object of\nthe senses or of the mind. But every additional and more concrete\ncharacterisation causes Being to lose that integrity and simplicity it\nhas in the beginning. Only in, and by virtue of, this mere generality\nis it Nothing, something inexpressible, whereof the distinction from\nNothing is a mere intention or _meaning._\nAll that is wanted is to realise that these beginnings are nothing but\nthese empty abstractions, one as empty as the other. The instinct that\ninduces us to attach a settled import to Being, or to both, is the very\nnecessity which leads to the onward movement of Being and Nothing,\nand gives them a true or concrete significance. This advance is the\nlogical deduction and the movement of thought exhibited in the sequel.\nThe reflection which finds a profounder connotation for Being and\nNothing is nothing but logical thought, through which such connotation\nis evolved, not, however, in an accidental, but a necessary way. Every\nsignification, therefore, in which they afterwards appear, is only a\nmore precise specification and truer definition of the Absolute. And\nwhen that is done, the mere abstract Being and Nothing are replaced\nby a concrete in which both these elements form an organic part.--The\nsupreme form of Nought as a separate principle would be Freedom: but\nFreedom is negativity in that stage, when it sinks self-absorbed to\nsupreme intensity, and is itself an affirmation, and even absolute\naffirmation.\nThe distinction between Being and Nought is, in the first place,\nonly implicit, and not yet actually made: they only _ought_ to be\ndistinguished. A distinction of course implies two things, and that one\nof them possesses an attribute which is not found in the other. Being\nhowever is an absolute absence of attributes, and so is Nought. Hence\nthe distinction between the two is only meant to be; it is a quite\nnominal distinction, which is at the same time no distinction. In all\nother cases of difference there is some common point which comprehends\nboth things. Suppose _e.g._ we speak of two different species: the\ngenus forms a common ground for both. But in the case of mere Being and\nNothing, distinction is without a bottom to stand upon: hence there can\nbe no distinction, both determinations being the same bottomlessness.\nIf it be replied that Being and Nothing are both of them thoughts, so\nthat thought may be reckoned common ground, the objector forgets that\nBeing is not a particular or definite thought, and hence, being quite\nindeterminate, is a thought not to be distinguished from Nothing.--It\nis natural too for us to represent Being as absolute riches, and\nNothing as absolute poverty. But if when we view the whole world we\ncan only say that everything _is,_ and nothing more, we are neglecting\nall speciality and, instead of absolute plenitude, we have absolute\nemptiness. The same stricture is applicable to those who define God\nto be mere Being; a definition not a whit better than that of the\nBuddhists, who make God to be Nought, and who from that principle draw\nthe further conclusion that self-annihilation is the means by which man\nbecomes God.\n88.] Nothing, if it be thus immediate and equal to itself, is also\nconversely the same as Being is. The truth of Being and of Nothing is\naccordingly the unity of the two: and this unity is Becoming.\n(1) The proposition that Being and Nothing is the same seems so\nparadoxical to the imagination or understanding, that it is perhaps\ntaken for a joke. And indeed it is one of the hardest things thought\nexpects itself to do: for Being and Nothing exhibit the fundamental\ncontrast in all its immediacy,--that is, without the one term being\ninvested with any attribute which would involve its connexion with\nthe other. This attribute however, as the above paragraph points out,\nis implicit in them--the attribute which is just the same in both. So\nfar the deduction of their unity is completely analytical: indeed the\nwhole progress of philosophising in every case, if it be a methodical,\nthat is to say a necessary, progress, merely renders explicit what\nis implicit in a notion.--It is as correct however to say that Being\nand Nothing are altogether different, as to assert their unity. The\none is _not_ what the other is. But since the distinction has not at\nthis point assumed definite shape (Being and Nothing are still the\nimmediate), it is, in the way that they have it, something unutterable,\nwhich we merely _mean._\n(2) No great expenditure of wit is needed to make fun of the maxim that\nBeing and Nothing are the same, or rather to adduce absurdities which,\nit is erroneously asserted, are the consequences and illustrations of\nthat maxim.\nIf Being and Nought are identical, say these objectors, it follows that\nit makes no difference whether my home, my property, the air I breathe,\nthis city, the sun, the law, mind, God, are or are not. Now in some of\nthese cases, the objectors foist in private aims, the utility a thing\nhas for me, and then ask, whether it be all the same to me if the\nthing exist and if it do not. For that matter indeed, the teaching of\nphilosophy is precisely what frees man from the endless crowd of finite\naims and intentions, by making him so insensible to them, that their\nexistence or non-existence is to him a matter of indifference. But it\nis never to be forgotten that, once mention something substantial, and\nyou thereby create a connexion with other existences and other purposes\nwhich are _ex hypothesi_ worth having: and on such hypothesis it comes\nto depend whether the Being and not-Being of a determinate subject are\nthe same or not. A substantial distinction is in these cases secretly\nsubstituted for the empty distinction of Being and Nought. In others\nof the cases referred to, it is virtually absolute existences and\nvital ideas and aims, which are placed under the mere category of\nBeing or not-Being. But there is more to be said of these concrete\nobjects, than that they merely are or are not. Barren abstractions,\nlike Being and Nothing--the initial categories which, for that reason,\nare the scantiest anywhere to be found--are utterly inadequate to\nthe nature of these objects. Substantial truth is something far\nabove these abstractions and their oppositions.--And always when a\nconcrete existence is disguised under the name of Being and not-Being,\nempty-headedness makes its usual mistake of speaking about, and having\nin the mind an image of, something else than what is in question: and\nin this place the question is about abstract Being and Nothing.\n(3) It may perhaps be said that nobody can form a notion of the\nunity of Being and Nought. As for that, the notion of the unity is\nstated in the sections preceding, and that is all: apprehend that,\nand you have comprehended this unity. What the objector really means\nby comprehension--by a notion--is more than his language properly\nimplies: he wants a richer and more complex state of mind, a pictorial\nconception which will propound the notion as a concrete case and one\nmore familiar to the ordinary operations of thought. And so long as\nincomprehensibility means only the want of habituation for the effort\nneeded to grasp an abstract thought, free from all sensuous admixture,\nand to seize a speculative truth, the reply to the criticism is, that\nphilosophical knowledge is undoubtedly distinct in kind from the\nmode of knowledge best known in common life, as well as from that\nwhich reigns in the other sciences. But if to have no notion merely\nmeans that we cannot represent in imagination the oneness of Being\nand Nought, the statement is far from being true; for every one has\ncountless ways of envisaging this unity. To say that we have no such\nconception can only mean, that in none of these images do we recognise\nthe notion in question, and that we are not aware that they exemplify\nit. The readiest example of it is Becoming.; Every one has a mental\nidea of Becoming, and will even allow that it is _one_ idea: he will\nfurther allow that, when it is analysed, it involves the attribute\nof Being, and also what is the very reverse of Being, viz. Nothing:\nand that these two attributes lie undivided in the one idea: so that\nBecoming is the unity of Being and Nothing.--Another tolerably plain\nexample is a Beginning. In its beginning, the thing is not yet, but\nit is more than merely nothing, for its Being is already in the\nbeginning. Beginning is itself a case of Becoming; only the former term\nis employed with an eye to the further advance.--If we were to adapt\nlogic to the more usual method of the sciences, we might start with the\nrepresentation of a Beginning as abstractly thought, or with Beginning\nas such, and then analyse this representation, and perhaps people\nwould more readily admit, as a result of this analysis, that Being and\nNothing present themselves as undivided in unity.\n(4) It remains to note that such phrases as 'Being and Nothing are\nthe same,' or 'The unity of Being and Nothing'--like all other\nsuch unities, that of subject and object, and others--give rise to\nreasonable objection. They misrepresent the facts, by giving an\nexclusive prominence to the unity, and leaving the difference which\nundoubtedly exists in it (because it is Being and Nothing, for example,\nthe unity of which is declared) without any express mention or notice.\nIt accordingly seems as if the diversity had been unduly put out of\ncourt and neglected. The fact is, no speculative principle can be\ncorrectly expressed by any such propositional form, for the unity has\nto be conceived _in_ the diversity, which is all the while present and\nexplicit. 'To become' is the true expression for the resultant of 'To\nbe' and 'Not to be'; it is the unity of the two; but not only is it\nthe unity, it is also inherent unrest,--the unity, which is no mere\nreference-to-self and therefore without movement, but which, through\nthe diversity of Being and Nothing that is in it, is at war within\nitself.--Determinate being, on the other hand, is this unity, or\nBecoming in this form of unity: hence all that 'is there and so,' is\none-sided and finite. The opposition between the two factors seems to\nhave vanished; it is only implied in the unity, it is not explicitly\nput in it.\n(5) The maxim of Becoming, that Being is the passage into Nought,\nand Nought the passage into Being, is controverted by the maxim of\nPantheism, the doctrine of the eternity of matter, that from nothing\ncomes nothing, and that something can only come out of something. The\nancients saw plainly that the maxim, 'From nothing comes nothing,\nfrom something something,' really abolishes Becoming: for what it\ncomes from and what it becomes are one and the same. Thus explained,\nthe proposition is the maxim of abstract identity as upheld by the\nunderstanding. It cannot but seem strange, therefore, to hear such\nmaxims as, 'Out of nothing comes nothing: Out of something comes\nsomething,' calmly taught in these days, without the teacher being in\nthe least aware that they are the basis of Pantheism, and even without\nhis knowing that the ancients have exhausted all that is to be said\nabout them.\nBecoming is the first concrete thought, and therefore the first\nnotion: whereas Being and Nought are empty abstractions. The notion\nof Being, therefore, of which we sometimes speak, must mean Becoming;\nnot the mere point of Being, which is empty Nothing, any more than\nNothing, which is empty Being. In Being then we have Nothing, and in\nNothing Being: but this Being which does not lose itself in Nothing\nis Becoming. Nor must we omit the distinction, while we emphasise the\nunity of Becoming: without that distinction we should once more return\nto abstract Being. Becoming is only the explicit statement of what\nBeing is in its truth.\nWe often hear it maintained that thought is opposed to being. Now in\nthe face of such a statement, our first question ought to be, what is\nmeant by being. If we understand being as it is defined by reflection,\nall that we can say of it is that it is what is wholly identical and\naffirmative. And if we then look at thought, it cannot escape us that\nthought also is at least what is absolutely identical with itself. Both\nI therefore, being as well as thought, have the same attribute.\nThis identity of being and thought is not however to be I taken in\na concrete sense, as if we could say that a stone, so far as it has\nbeing, is the same as a thinking man. A concrete thing is always very\ndifferent from the abstract category as such. And in the case of being,\nwe are speaking of nothing concrete: for being is the utterly abstract.\nSo far then the question regarding the _being_ of God--a being which is\nin itself concrete above all measure--is of slight importance.\nAs the first concrete thought-term, Becoming is the first adequate\nvehicle of truth. In the history of philosophy, this stage of the\nlogical Idea finds its analogue in the system of Heraclitus. When\nHeraclitus says 'All is flowing' (\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6), he enunciates Becoming\nas the fundamental feature of all existence, whereas the Eleatics,\nas already remarked, saw the only truth in Being, rigid processless\nBeing. Glancing at the principle of the Eleatics, Heraclitus then goes\non to say: Being no more is than not-Being (\u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bbon \u03c4\u1f78 \u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u1f74\n\u1f45\u03bd\u03c4os \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af): a statement expressing the negativity of abstract Being,\nand its identity with not-Being, as made explicit in Becoming: both\nabstractions being alike untenable. This maybe looked at as an instance\nof the real refutation of one system by another. To refute a Philosophy\nis to exhibit the dialectical movement in its principle, and thus\nreduce it to a constituent member of a higher concrete form of the?\nIdea. Even Becoming however, taken at its best on its own ground, is an\nextremely poor term: it needs to grow in depth and weight of meaning.\nSuch deepened force we find _e.g._ in Life. Life is a Becoming; but\nthat is not enough to exhaust the notion of life. A still higher form\nis found in Mind. Here too is Becoming, but richer and more intensive\nthan mere logical Becoming. The elements, whose unity constitutes\nmind, are not the bare abstracts of Being and of Nought, but the system\nof the logical Idea and of Nature.\n(b) _Being Determinate._\n89.] In Becoming the Being which is one with Nothing, and the Nothing\nwhich is one with Being, are only vanishing factors; they are and\nthey are not. Thus by its inherent contradiction Becoming collapses\ninto the unity in which the two elements are absorbed. This result is\naccordingly Being Determinate (Being there and so).\nIn this first example we must call to mind, once for all, what was\nstated in \u00a7 82 and in the note there: the only way to secure any growth\nand progress in knowledge is to hold results fast in their truth. There\nis absolutely nothing whatever in which we cannot and must not point\nto contradictions or opposite attributes; and the abstraction made by\nunderstanding therefore means a forcible insistence on a single aspect,\nand a real effort to obscure and remove all consciousness of the other\nattribute which is involved. Whenever such contradiction, then, is\ndiscovered in any object or notion, the usual inference is, _Hence_\nthis object is _nothing._ Thus Zeno, who first showed the contradiction\nnative to motion, concluded that there is no motion: and the ancients,\nwho recognised origin and decease, the two species of Becoming, as\nuntrue categories, made use of the expression that the One or Absolute\nneither arises nor perishes. Such a style of dialectic looks only at\nthe negative aspect of its result, and fails to notice, what is at the\nsame time really present, the definite result, in the present case a\npure nothing, but a Nothing which includes Being, and, in like manner,\na Being which includes Nothing. Hence Being Determinate is (1) the\nunity of Being and Nothing, in which we get rid of the immediacy in\nthese determinations, and their contradiction vanishes in their mutual\nconnexion,--the unity in which they are only constituent elements. And\n(2) since the result is the abolition of the contradiction, it comes\nin the shape of a simple unity with itself: that is to say, it also\nis Being, but Being with negation or determinateness: it is Becoming\nexpressly put in the form of one of its elements, viz. Being.\nEven our ordinary conception of Becoming implies that somewhat\ncomes out of it, and that Becoming therefore has a result. But this\nconception gives rise to the question, how Becoming does not remain\nmere Becoming, but has a result The answer to this question follows\nfrom what Becoming has already shown itself to be. Becoming always\ncontains Being and Nothing in such a way, that these two are always\nchanging into each other, and reciprocally cancelling each other.\nThus Becoming stands before us in utter restlessness--unable however\nto maintain itself in this abstract restlessness: for since Being and\nNothing vanish in Becoming (and that is the very notion of Becoming),\nthe latter must vanish also. Becoming is as it were a fire, which\ndies out in itself, when it consumes its material. The result of this\nprocess however is not an empty Nothing but Being identical with the\nnegation,--what we call Being Determinate (being then and there): the\nprimary import of which evidently is that it _has become._\n90.] (\u03b1) Determinate Being is Being with a character or mode--which\nsimply _is_; and such un-mediated character is Quality. And as\nreflected into itself in this its character or mode, Determinate Being\nis a somewhat, an existent.--The categories, which issue by a closer\nanalysis of Determinate Being, need only be mentioned briefly.\nQuality may be described as the determinate mode immediate and\nidentical with Being--as distinguished from Quantity (to come\nafterwards), which, although a mode of Being, is no longer immediately\nidentical with Being, but a mode indifferent and external to it. A\nSomething is what it is in virtue of its quality, and losing its\nquality it ceases to be what it is. Quality, moreover, is completely a\ncategory only of the finite, and for that reason too it has its proper\nplace in Nature, not in the world of Mind. Thus, for example, in Nature\nwhat are styled the elementary bodies, oxygen, nitrogen, &c, should\nbe regarded as existing qualities. But in the sphere of mind, Quality\nappears in a subordinate way only, and not as if its qualitativeness\ncould exhaust any specific aspect of mind. If, for example, we consider\nthe subjective mind, which forms the object of psychology, we may\ndescribe what is called (moral and mental) character, as in logical\nlanguage identical with Quality. This however does not mean that\ncharacter is a mode of being which pervades the soul and is immediately\nidentical with it, as is the case in the natural world with the\nelementary bodies before mentioned. Yet a more distinct manifestation\nof Quality as such, in mind even, is found in the case of besotted or\nmorbid conditions, especially in states of passion and when the passion\nrises to derangement. The state of mind of a deranged person, being one\nmass of jealousy, fear, &c, may suitably be described as Quality.\n91.] Quality, as determinateness which _is,_ as contrasted with the\nNegation which is involved in it but distinguished from it, is\nReality. Negation is no longer an abstract nothing, but, as\na determinate being and somewhat, is only a form on such being--it\nis as Otherness. Since this otherness, though a determination of\nQuality itself, is in the first instance distinct from it, Quality is\nBeing-for-another--an expansion of the mere point of Determinate\nBeing, or of Somewhat. The Being as such of Quality, contrasted with\nthis reference to somewhat else, is Being-by-self.\nThe foundation of all determinateness is negation (as Spinoza says,\n_Omnis determinatio est negatio_). The unreflecting observer supposes\nthat determinate things are merely positive, and pins them down under\nthe form of being. Mere being however is not the end of the matter:--it\nis, as we have already seen, utter emptiness and instability besides.\nStill, when abstract being is contused in this way with being modified\nand determinate, it implies some perception of the fact that, though\nin determinate being there is involved an element of negation, this\nelement is at first wrapped up, as it were, and only comes to the\nfront and receives its due in Being-for-self.--If we go on to consider\ndeterminate Being as a determinateness which _is,_ we get in this way\nwhat is called Reality. We speak, for example, of the reality of a\nplan or a purpose, meaning thereby that they are no longer inner and\nsubjective, but have passed into being-there-and-then. In the same\nsense the body may be called the reality of the soul, and the law the\nreality of freedom, and the world altogether the reality of the divine\nidea. The word 'reality' is however used in another acceptation to mean\nthat something behaves conformably to its essential characteristic or\nnotion. For example, we use the expression: This is a real occupation:\nThis is a real man. Here the term does not merely mean outward and\nimmediate existence: but rather that some existence agrees with its\nnotion. In which sense, be it added, reality is not distinct from the\nideality which we shall in the first instance become acquainted with in\nthe shape of Being-for-self.\n92.] (\u00df) Being, if kept distinct and apart from its determinate\nmode, as it is in Being-by-self (Being implicit), would be only the\nvacant abstraction of Being. In Being (determinate there and then),\nthe determinateness is one with Being; yet at the same time, when\nexplicitly made a negation, it is a Limit, a Barrier. Hence the\notherness is not something indifferent and outside it, but a function\nproper to it. Somewhat is by its quality,--firstly finite,--secondly\nalterable; so that finitude and variability appertain to its being.\nIn Being-there-and-then, the negation is still directly one with the\nBeing, and this negation is what we call a Limit (Boundary). A thing\nis what it is, only in and by reason of its limit. We cannot therefore\nregard the limit as only paternal to being which is then and there. It\nrather goes through and through the whole of such existence. The view\nof limit, as merely an external characteristic of being-there-and-then,\narises from a confusion of quantitative with qualitative limit. Here\nwe are speaking primarily of the qualitative limit. If, for example,\nwe observe a piece of ground, three acres large, that circumstance is\nits quantitative limit. But, in addition, the ground is, it may be, a\nmeadow, not a wood or a pond. This is its qualitative limit.--Man,\nif he wishes to be actual, must be-there-and-then, and to this end he\nmust set a limit to himself. People who are too fastidious towards the\nfinite never reach actuality, but linger lost in abstraction, and their\nlight dies away.\nIf we take a closer look at what a limit implies, we see it involving a\ncontradiction in itself, and thus evincing its dialectical nature. On\nthe one side the limit makes the reality of a thing; on the other it\nis its negation. But, again, the limit, as the negation of something,\nis not an abstract nothing but a nothing which _is,--_what we call an\n'other.' Given something, and up starts an other to us: we know that\nthere is not something only, but an other as well. Nor, again, is the\nother of such a nature that we can think something apart from it; a\nsomething is implicitly the other of itself, and the somewhat sees\nits limit become objective to it in the other. If we now ask for the\ndifference between something and another, it turns out that they are\nthe same: which sameness is expressed in Latin by calling the pair\n_aliud--aliud._ The other, as opposed to the something, is itself a\nsomething, and hence we say some other, or something else; and so on\nthe other hand the first something when opposed to the other, also\ndefined as something, is itself an other. When we say 'something\nelse' our first impression is that something taken separately is only\nsomething, and that the quality of being another attaches to it only\nfrom outside considerations. Thus we suppose that the moon, being\nsomething else than the sun, might very well exist without the sun.\nBut really the moon, as a something, has its other implicit in it:\nPlato says: God made the world out of the nature of the 'one' and the\n'other' (\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f11\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5): having brought these together, he formed from\nthem a third, which is of the nature of the 'one' and the 'other.'\nIn these words we have in general terms a statement of the nature\nof the finite, which, as something, does not meet the nature of the\nother as if it had no affinity to it, but, being implicitly the other\nof itself, thus undergoes alteration. Alteration thus exhibits the\ninherent contradiction which originally attaches to determinate being,\nand which forces it out of its own bounds. To materialised conception\nexistence stands in the character of something solely positive, and\nquietly abiding within its own limits: though we also know, it is\ntrue, that everything finite (such as existence) is subject to change.\nSuch changeableness in existence is to the superficial eye a mere\npossibility, the realisation of which is not a consequence of its own\nnature. But the fact is, mutability lies in the notion of existence,\nand change is only the manifestation of what it implicitly is. The\nliving die, simply because as living they bear in themselves the germ\nof death.\n93.] Something becomes an other: this other is itself somewhat:\ntherefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on _ad infinitum._\n94.] This Infinity is the wrong or negative infinity: it is only a\nnegation of a finite: but the finite rises again the same as ever, and\nis never got rid of and absorbed. In other words, this infinite only\nexpresses the _ought-to-be_ elimination of the finite. The progression\nto infinity never gets further than a statement of the contradiction\ninvolved in the finite, viz. that it is somewhat as well as somewhat\nelse. It sets up with endless iteration the alternation between these\ntwo terms, each of which calls up the other.\nIf we let somewhat and another, the elements of determinate Being,\nfall asunder, the result is that some becomes other, and this other\nis itself a somewhat, which then as such changes likewise, and so\non _ad infinitum._ This result seems to superficial reflection\nsomething very grand, the grandest possible. Besuch a progression to\ninfinity is not the real infinite. That consists in being at home\nwith itself in its other, or, if enunciated as a process, in coming\nto itself in its other. Much depends on rightly apprehending the\nnotion of infinity, and not stopping short at the wrong infinity of\nendless progression. When time and space, for example, are spoken of\nas infinite, it is in the first place the infinite progression on\nwhich our thoughts fasten. We say, Now, This time, and then we keep\ncontinually going forwards and backwards beyond this limit. The case\nis the same with space, the infinity of which has formed the theme of\nbarren declamation to astronomers with a talent for edification. In the\nattempt to contemplate such an infinite, our thought, we are commonly\ninformed, must sink exhausted. It is true indeed that we must abandon\nthe unending contemplation, not however because the occupation is too\nsublime, but because it is too tedious. It is tedious to expatiate in\nthe contemplation of this infinite progression, because the same thing\nis constantly recurring. We lay down a limit: then we pass it: next we\nhave a limit once more, and so on for ever. All this is but superficial\nalternation, which never leaves the region of the finite behind. To\nsuppose that by stepping out and away into that infinity we release\nourselves from the finite, is in truth but to seek the release which\ncomes by flight. But the man who flees is not yet free: in fleeing he\nis still conditioned by that from which he flees. If it be also said,\nthat the infinite is unattainable, the statement is true, but only\nbecause to the idea of infinity has been attached the circumstance\nof being simply and solely negative. With such empty and other world\nstuff philosophy has nothing to do. What philosophy has to do with is\nalways--something concrete and in the highest sense present.\nNo doubt philosophy has also sometimes been set the task of finding\nan answer to the question, how the infinite comes to the resolution\nof issuing out of itself. This question, founded, as it is, upon the\nassumption of a rigid opposition between finite and infinite, may be\nanswered by saying that the opposition is false, and that in point\nof fact the infinite eternally proceeds out of itself, and yet does\nnot proceed out of itself. If we further say that the infinite is the\nnot-finite, we have in point of fact virtually expressed the truth:\nfor as the finite itself is the first negative, the not-finite is the\nnegative of that negation, the negation which is identical with itself\nand thus at the same time a true affirmation.\nThe infinity of reflection here discussed is only an _attempt_ to\nreach the true Infinity, a wretched neither-one-thing-nor-another.\nGenerally speaking, it is the point of view which has in recent times\nbeen emphasised in Germany. The finite, this theory tells us, _ought_\nto be absorbed; the infinite _ought_ not to be a negative merely, but\nalso a positive. That 'ought to be' betrays the incapacity of actually\nmaking good a claim which is at the same time recognised to be right.\nThis stage was never passed by the systems of Kant and Fichte, so far\nas ethics are concerned. The utmost to which this way brings us is only\nthe postulate of a never-ending approximation to the law of Reason:\nwhich postulate has been made an argument for the immortality of the\nsoul.\n95.] (\u03b3) What we now in point of fact have before us, is that somewhat\ncomes to be an other, and that the other generally comes to be an\nother. Thus essentially relative to another, somewhat is virtually an\nother against it: and since what is passed into is quite the same as\nwhat passes over, since both have one and the same attribute, viz.\nto be an other, it follows that something in its passage into other\nonly joins with itself. To be thus self-related in the passage, and\nin the other, is the genuine Infinity. Or, under a negative aspect:\nwhat is altered is the other, it becomes the other of the other. Thus\nBeing, but as negation of the negation, is restored again: it is now\nBeing-for-self.\nDualism, in putting an insuperable opposition between finite and\ninfinite, fails to note the simple circumstance that the infinite is\nthereby only one of two, and is reduced to a particular, to which the\nfinite forms the other particular. Such an infinite, which is only a\nparticular, is co-terminous with the finite which makes for it a limit\nand a barrier: it is not what it ought to be, that is, the infinite,\nbut is only finite. In such circumstances, where the finite is on this\nside, and the infinite on that,--this world as the finite and the other\nworld as the infinite,--an equal dignity of permanence and independence\nis ascribed to finite and to infinite. The being of the finite is made\nan absolute being, and by this dualism gets independence and stability.\nTouched, so to speak, by the infinite, it would be annihilated. But\nit must not be touched by the infinite. There must be an abyss, an\nimpassable gulf between the two, with the infinite abiding on yonder\nside and the finite steadfast on this. Those who attribute to the\nfinite this inflexible persistence in comparison with the infinite\nare not, as they imagine, far above metaphysic: they are still on the\nlevel of the most ordinary metaphysic of understanding. For the same\nthing occurs here as in the infinite progression. At one time it is\nadmitted that the finite has no independent actuality, no absolute\nbeing, no root and development of its own, but is only a transient.\nBut next moment this is straightway forgotten; the finite, made a mere\ncounterpart to the infinite, wholly separated from it, and rescued from\nannihilation, is conceived to be persistent in its independence. While\nthought thus imagines itself elevated to the infinite, it meets with\nthe opposite fate: it comes to an infinite which is only a finite, and\nthe finite, which it had left behind, has always to be retained and\nmade into an absolute.\nAfter this examination (with which it were well to compare Plato's\nPhilebus), tending to show the nullity of the distinction made by\nunderstanding between the finite and the infinite, we are liable\nto glide into the statement that the infinite and the finite are\ntherefore one, and that the genuine infinity, the truth, must be\ndefined and enunciated as the unity of the finite and infinite. Such\na statement would be to some extent correct; but is just as open to\nperversion and falsehood as the unity of Being and Nothing already\nnoticed. Besides it may very fairly be charged with reducing the\ninfinite to finitude and making a finite infinite. For, so far as\nthe expression goes, the finite seems left in its place,--it is not\nexpressly stated to be absorbed. Or, if we reflect that the finite,\nwhen identified with the infinite, certainly cannot remain what it\nwas out of such unity, and will at least suffer some change in its\ncharacteristics--as an alkali, when combined with an acid, loses some\nof its properties, we must see that, the same fate awaits the infinite,\nwhich, as the negative, will on its part likewise have its edge, as\nit were, taken off on the other. And this does really happen with the\nabstract one-sided infinite of understanding. The genuine infinite\nhowever is not merely in the position of the one-sided acid, and so\ndoes not lose itself. The negation of negation is not a neutralisation:\nthe infinite is the affirmative, and it is only the finite which is\nabsorbed.\nIn Being-for-self enters the category of Ideality.\nBeing-there-and-then, as in the first instance apprehended in its being\nor affirmation, has reality (\u00a7 91): and thus even finitude in the first\ninstance is in the category of reality. But the truth of the finite is\nrather its ideality. Similarly, the infinite of understanding, which\nis co-ordinated with the finite, is itself only one of two finites,\nno whole truth, but a non-substantial element. This ideality of the\nfinite is the chief maxim of philosophy; and for that reason every\ngenuine philosophy is idealism. But everything depends upon not taking\nfor the infinite what, in the very terms of its characterisation, is.\nat the same time made a particular and finite.--For this reason we\nhave bestowed a greater amount of attention on this distinction. The\nfundamental notion of philosophy, the genuine infinite, depends upon\nit. The distinction is cleared up by the simple, and for that reason\nseemingly insignificant, but incontrovertible reflections, contained in\nthe first paragraph of this section.\n(c) _Being-for-self._\n96.] (\u03b1) Being-for self, as reference to itself, is immediacy, and\nas reference of the negative to itself, is a self-subsistent, the\nOne. This unit, being without distinction in itself, thus\nexcludes the other from itself.\nTo be for self--to be one--is completed Quality, and as such, contains\nabstract Being and Being modified as non-substantial elements. As\nsimple Being, the One is simple self-reference; as Being modified it\nis determinate: but the determinateness is not in this case a finite\ndeterminateness--a somewhat in distinction from an other--but infinite,\nbecause it contains distinction absorbed and annulled in itself.\nThe readiest instance of Being-for-self is found in the 'I.' We know\nourselves as existents, distinguished in the first place from other\nexistents, and with certain relations thereto. But we also come to\nknow this expansion of existence (in these relations) reduced, as it\nwere, to a point in the simple form of being-for-self. When we say 'I,'\nwe express the reference-to-self which is infinite, and at the same\ntime negative. Man, it may be said, is distinguished from the animal\nworld, and in that way from nature altogether, by knowing himself as\n'I': which amounts to saying that natural things never attain a free\nBeing-for-self, but as limited to Being-there-and-then, are always and\nonly Being for an other.--Again, Being-for-self may be described as\nideality, just as Being-there-and-then was described as reality. It is\nsaid, that besides reality there is _also_ an ideality. Thus the two\ncategories are made equal and parallel. Properly speaking, ideality is\nnot somewhat outside of and beside reality: the notion of ideality\njust lies in its being the truth of reality. That is to say, when\nreality is explicitly put as what it implicitly is, it is at once seen\nto be ideality. Hence ideality has not received its proper estimation,\nwhen you allow that reality is not all in all, but that an ideality\nmust be recognised outside of it. Such an ideality, external to or it\nmay be even beyond reality, would be no better than an empty name.\nIdeality only has a meaning when it is the ideality of something: but\nthis something is not a mere indefinite this or that, but existence\ncharacterised as reality, which, if retained in isolation, possesses\nno truth. The distinction between Nature and Mind is not improperly\nconceived, when the former is traced back to reality, and the latter\nto ideality as a fundamental category. Nature however is far from\nbeing so fixed and complete, as to subsist even without Mind: in Mind\nit first, as it were, attains its goal and its truth. And similarly,\nMind on its part is not merely a world beyond Nature and nothing more:\nit is really, and with full proof, seen to be mind, only when it\ninvolves Nature as absorbed in itself.--_Apropos_ of this, we should\nnote the double meaning of the German word _aufheben_ (to put by, or\nset aside). We mean by it (1) to clear away, or annul: thus, we say, a\nlaw or a regulation is set aside: (2) to keep, or preserve: in which\nsense we use it when we say: something is well put by. This double\nusage of language, which gives to the same word a positive and negative\nmeaning, is not an accident, and gives no ground for reproaching\nlanguage as a cause of confusion. We should rather recognise in it the\nspeculative spirit of our language rising above the mere 'Either--or'\nof understanding.\n97.] (\u03b2) The relation of the negative to itself is a negative relation,\nand so a distinguishing of the One from itself, the repulsion of\nthe One; that is, it makes Many Ones. So far as regards the\nimmediacy of the self-existents, these Many _are:_ and the repulsion of\nevery One of them becomes to that extent their repulsion against each\nother as existing units,--in other words, their reciprocal exclusion.\nWhenever we speak of the One, the Many usually come into our mind at\nthe same time. Whence, then, we are forced to ask, do the Many come?\nThis question is unanswerable by the consciousness which pictures the\nMany as a primary datum, and-treats the One as only one among the Many.\nBut the philosophic notion teaches, contrariwise, that the One forms\nthe pre-supposition of the Many: and in the thought of the One is\nimplied that it explicitly make itself Many. The self-existing unit is\nnot, like Being, void of all connective reference: it is a reference,\nas well as Being-there-and-then was, not however a reference connecting\nsomewhat with an other, but, as unity of the some and the other, it is\na connexion with itself, and this connexion be it noted is a negative\nconnexion. Hereby the One manifests an utter incompatibility with\nitself, a self-repulsion: and what it makes itself explicitly be, is\nthe Many. We may denote this side in the process of Being-for-self\nby the figurative term Repulsion. Repulsion is a term originally\nemployed in the study of matter, to mean that matter, as a Many, in\neach of these many Ones, behaves as exclusive to all the others. It\nwould be wrong however to view the process of repulsion, as if the\nOne were the repellent and the Many the repelled. The One, as already\nremarked, just is self-exclusion and explicit putting itself as the\nMany. Each of the Many however is itself a One, and in virtue of its so\nbehaving, this all-round repulsion is by one stroke converted into its\nopposite,--Attraction.\n98.] (\u03b3) But the Many are one the same as another: each is One, or\neven one of the Many; they are consequently one and the same. Or when\nwe study all that Repulsion involves, we see that as a negative\nattitude of many Ones to one another, it is just as essentially a\nconnective reference of them to each other; and as those to which the\nOne is related in its act of repulsion are ones, it is in them thrown\ninto relation with itself. The repulsion therefore has an equal right\nto be called Attraction; and the exclusive One, or Being-for-self,\nsuppresses itself. The qualitative character, which in the One or unit\nhas reached the extreme point of its characterisation, has thus passed\nover into determinateness (quality) suppressed, _i.e._ into Being as\nQuantity.\nThe philosophy of the Atomists is the doctrine in which the Absolute\nis formulated as Being-for-self, as One, and many ones. And it is\nthe repulsion, which shows itself in the notion of the One, which\nis assumed as the fundamental force in these atoms. But instead of\nattraction, it is Accident, that is, mere unintelligence, which\nis expected to bring them together. So long as the One is fixed\nas one, it is certainly impossible to regard its congression with\nothers as anything but external and mechanical. The Void, which is\nassumed as the complementary principle to the atoms, is repulsion\nand nothing else, presented under the image of the nothing existing\nbetween the atoms.--Modern Atomism--and physics is still in principle\natomistic--has surrendered the atoms so far as to pin its faith\non molecules or particles. In so doing, science has come closer\nto sensuous conception, at the cost of losing the precision of\nthought.--To put an attractive by the side of a repulsive force, as\nthe moderns have done, certainly gives completeness to the contrast:\nand the discovery of this natural force, as it is called, has been a\nsource of much pride. But the mutual implication of the two, which\nmakes what is true and concrete in them, would have to be wrested from\nthe obscurity and confusion in which they were left even in Kant's\nMetaphysical Rudiments of Natural Science.--In modern times the\nimportance of the atomic theory is even more evident in political than\nin physical science. According to it, the will of individuals as such\nis the creative principle of the State: the attracting force is the\nspecial wants and inclinations of individuals; and the Universal, or\nthe State itself, is the external nexus of a compact.\n(1) The Atomic philosophy forms a vital stage in the historical\nevolution of the Idea. The principle of that system may be described\nas Being-for-self in the shape of the Many. At present, students of\nnature who are anxious to avoid metaphysics turn a favourable ear to\nAtomism. But it is not possible to escape metaphysics and cease to\ntrace nature back to terms of thought, by throwing ourselves into the\narms of Atomism. The atom, in fact, is itself a thought; and hence the\ntheory which holds matter to consist of atoms is a metaphysical theory.\nNewton gave physics an express warning to beware of metaphysics, it is\ntrue; but, to his honour be it said, he did not by any means obey his\nown warning. The only mere physicists are the animals: they alone do\nnot think: while man is a thinking being and a born metaphysician. The\nreal question is not whether we shall apply metaphysics, but whether\nour metaphysics are of the right kind: in other words, whether we are\nnot, instead of the concrete logical Idea, adopting one-sided forms of\nthought, rigidly fixed by understanding, and making these the basis of\nour theoretical as well as our practical work. It is on this ground\nthat one objects to the Atomic philosophy. The old Atomists viewed the\nworld as a many, as their successors often do to this day. On chance\nthey laid the task of collecting the atoms which float about in the\nvoid. But, after all, the nexus binding the many with one another is\nby no means a mere accident: as we have already remarked, the nexus is\nfounded on their very nature. To Kant we owe the completed theory of\nmatter as the unity of repulsion and attraction. The theory is correct,\nso far as it recognises attraction to be the other of the two elements\ninvolved in the notion of Being-for-self: and to be an element no less\nessential than repulsion to constitute matter. Still this dynamical\nconstruction of matter, as it is termed, has the fault of taking for\ngranted, instead of deducing, attraction and repulsion. Had they been\ndeduced, we should then have seen the How and the Why of a unity which\nis merely asserted. Kant indeed was careful to inculcate that Matter\nmust not be taken to be in existence _per se,_ and then as it were\nincidentally to be provided with the two forces mentioned, but must\nbe regarded as consisting solely in their unity. German physicists\nfor some time accepted this pure dynamic. But in spite of this, the\nmajority of these physicists i n modern times have found it more\nconvenient to return to the Atomic point of view, and in spite of the\nwarnings of K\u00e4stner, one of their number, have begun to regard Matter\nas consisting of infinitesimally small particles, termed 'atoms'--which\natoms have then to be brought into relation with one another by the\nplay of forces attaching to them,--attractive, repulsive, or whatever\nthey may be. This too is metaphysics; and metaphysics which, for its\nutter unintelligence, there would be sufficient reason to guard against.\n(2) The transition from Quality to Quantity, indicated in the paragraph\nbefore us, is not found in our ordinary way of thinking, which deems\neach of these categories to exist independently beside the other. We\nare in the habit of saying that things are not merely qualitatively,\nbut also quantitatively defined; but whence these categories originate,\nand how they are related to each other, are questions not further\nexamined. The fact is, quantity just means quality superseded and\nabsorbed: and it is by the dialectic of quality here examined that this\nsupersession is effected. First of all, we had Being: as the truth of\nBeing, came Becoming: which formed the passage to Being Determinate:\nand the truth of that we found to be Alteration. And in its result\nAlteration showed itself to be Being-for-self, exempt from implication\nof another and from passage into another;--which Being-for-self,\nfinally, in the two sides of its process, Repulsion and Attraction,\nwas clearly seen to annul itself, and thereby to annul quality in the\ntotality of its stages. Still this superseded and absorbed quality is\nneither an abstract nothing, nor an equally abstract and featureless\nbeing: it is only being as indifferent to determinateness or character.\nThis aspect of being is also what appears as quantity in our ordinary\nconceptions. We observe things, first of all, with an eye to their\nquality--which we take to be the character identical with the being\nof the thing. If we proceed to consider their quantity, we get the\nconception of an indifferent and external character or mode, of such a\nkind that a thing remains what it is, though its quantity is altered,\nand the thing becomes greater or less.\nB.--QUANTITY.\n(\u03b1) _Pure Quantity._\n99.] Quantity is pure being, where the mode or character is\nno longer taken as one with the being itself, but explicitly put as\nsuperseded or indifferent.\n(i) The expression Magnitude especially marks _determinate_\nQuantity, and is for that reason not a suitable name for Quantity\nin general. (2) Mathematics usually define magnitude as what can be\nincreased or diminished. This definition has the defect of containing\nthe thing to be defined over again: but it may serve to show that the\ncategory of magnitude is explicitly understood to be changeable and\nindifferent, so that, in spite of its being altered by an increased\nextension or intension, the thing, a house, for example, does not cease\nto be a house, and red to be red. (3) The Absolute is pure Quantity.\nThis point of view is upon the whole the same as when the Absolute is\ndefined to be Matter, in which, though form undoubtedly is present, the\nform is a characteristic of no importance one way or another. Quantity\ntoo constitutes the main characteristic of the Absolute, when the\nAbsolute is regarded as absolute indifference, and only admitting of\nquantitative distinction.--Otherwise pure space, time, &c. may be taken\nas examples of Quantity, if we allow ourselves to regard the real as\nwhatever fills up space and time, it matters not with what.\nThe mathematical definition of magnitude as what may be increased\nor diminished, appears at first sight to be more plausible and\nperspicuous than the exposition of the notion in the present\nsection. When closely examined, however, it involves, under cover\nof pre-suppositions and images, the same elements as appear in the\nnotion of quantity reached by the method of logical development. In\nother words, when we say that the notion of magnitude lies in the\npossibility of being increased or diminished, we state that magnitude\n(or more correctly, quantity), as distinguished from quality, is a\ncharacteristic of such kind that the characterised thing is not in the\nleast affected by any change in it. What then, it may be asked, is\nthe fault which we have to find with this definition? It is that to\nincrease and to diminish is the same thing as to characterise magnitude\notherwise. If this aspect then were an adequate account of it, quantity\nwould be described merely as whatever can be altered. But quality is\nno less than quantity open to alteration; and the distinction here\ngiven between quantity and quality is expressed by saying increase\n_or_ diminution: the meaning being that, towards whatever side the\ndetermination of magnitude be altered, the thing still remains what it\nis.\nOne remark more. Throughout philosophy we do not seek merely for\ncorrect, still less for plausible definitions, whose correctness\nappeals directly to the popular imagination; we seek approved or\nverified definitions, the content of which is not assumed merely as\ngiven, but is seen and known to warrant itself, because warranted\nby the free self-evolution of thought. To apply this to the present\ncase. However correct and self-evident the definition of quantity\nusual in Mathematics may be, it will still fail to satisfy the wish to\nsee how far this particular thought is founded in universal thought,\nand in that way necessary. This difficulty, however, is not the only\none. If quantity is not reached through the action of thought, but\ntaken uncritically from our generalised image of it, we are liable\nto exaggerate the range of its validity, or even to raise it to the\nheight of an absolute category. And that such a danger is real, we see\nwhen the title of exact science is restricted to those sciences the\nobjects of which can be submitted to mathematical calculation. Here we\nhave another trace of the bad metaphysics (mentioned in \u00a7 98, note)\nwhich replace the concrete idea by partial and inadequate categories of\nunderstanding. Our knowledge would be in a very awkward predicament if\nsuch objects as freedom, law, morality, or even God Himself, because\nthey cannot be measured and calculated, or expressed in a mathematical\nformula, were to be reckoned beyond the reach of exact knowledge, and\nwe had to put up with a vague generalised image of them, leaving their\ndetails or particulars to the pleasure of each individual, to make\nout of them what he will. The pernicious consequences, to which such\na theory gives rise in practice, are at once evident. And this mere\nmathematical view, which identifies with the Idea one of its special\nstages, viz. quantity, is no other than the principle of Materialism.\nWitness the history of the scientific modes of thought, especially in\nFrance since the middle of last century. Matter, in the abstract, is\njust what, though of course there is form in it, has that form only as\nan indifferent and external attribute.\nThe present explanation would be utterly misconceived if it were\nsupposed to disparage mathematics. By calling the quantitative\ncharacteristic merely external and indifferent, we provide no excuse\nfor indolence and superficiality, nor do we assert that quantitative\ncharacteristics may be left to mind themselves, or at least require no\nvery careful handling. Quantity, of course, is a stage of the Idea: and\nas such it must have its due, first as a logical category, and then\nin the world of objects, natural as well as spiritual. Still even so,\nthere soon emerges the different importance attaching to the category\nof quantity according as its objects belong to the natural or to the\nspiritual world. For in Nature, where the form of the Idea is to be\nother than, and at the same time outside, itself, greater importance is\nfor that very reason attached to quantity than in the spiritual world,\nthe world of free inwardness. No doubt we regard even spiritual facts\nunder a quantitative point of view; but it is at once apparent that in\nspeaking of God as a Trinity, the number three has by no means the same\nprominence, as when we consider the three dimensions of space or the\nthree sides of a triangle;--the fundamental feature of which last is\njust to be a surface bounded by three lines. Even inside the realm of\nNature we find the same distinction of greater or less importance of\nquantitative features. In the inorganic world, Quantity plays, so to\nsay, a more prominent part than in the organic. Even in organic nature\nwhen we distinguish mechanical functions from what are called chemical,\nand in the narrower sense, physical, there is the same difference.\nMechanics is of all branches of science, confessedly, that in which the\naid of mathematics can be least dispensed with,--where indeed we cannot\ntake one step without them. On that account mechanics is regarded next\nto mathematics as the science _par excellence_; which leads us to\nrepeat the remark about the coincidence of the materialist with the\nexclusively mathematical point of view. After all that has been said,\nwe cannot but hold it, in the interest of exact and thorough knowledge,\none of the most hurtful prejudices, to seek all distinction and\ndeterminateness of objects merely in quantitative considerations. Mind\nto be sure is more than Nature and the animal is more than the plant:\nbut we know very little of these objects and the distinction between\nthem, if a more and less is enough for us, and if we do not proceed to\ncomprehend them in their peculiar, that is their qualitative character.\n100.] Quantity, as we saw, has two sources: the exclusive unit, and\nthe identification or equalisation of these units. When we look\ntherefore at its immediate relation to self, or at the characteristic\nof self-sameness made explicit by attraction, quantity is Continuous\nmagnitude; but when we look at the other characteristic, the One\nimplied in it, it is Discrete magnitude. Still continuous quantity has\nalso a certain discreteness, being but a continuity of the Many: and\ndiscrete quantity is no less continuous, its continuity being the One\nor Unit, that is, the self-same point of the many Ones.\n(1) Continuous and Discrete magnitude, therefore, must not be supposed\ntwo species of magnitude, as if the characteristic of the one did not\nattach to the other. The only distinction between them is that the\nsame whole (of quantity) is at one time explicitly put under the one,\nat another under the other of its characteristics. (2) The Antinomy of\nspace, of time, or of matter, which discusses the question of their\nbeing divisible for ever, or of consisting of indivisible units, just\nmeans that we maintain quantity as at one time Discrete, at\nanother Continuous. If we explicitly invest time, space, or matter with\nthe attribute of Continuous quantity alone, they are divisible _ad\ninfinitum._ When, on the contrary, they are invested with the attribute\nof Discrete quantity, they are potentially divided already, and consist\nof indivisible units. The one view is as inadequate as the other.\nQuantity, as the proximate result of Being-for-self, involves the\ntwo sides in the process of the latter, attraction and repulsion, as\nconstitutive elements of its own idea. It is consequently Continuous\nas well as Discrete. Each of these two elements involves the other\nalso, and hence there is no such thing as a merely Continuous or a\nmerely Discrete quantity. We may speak of the two as two particular and\nopposite species of magnitude; but that is merely the result of our\nabstracting reflection, which in viewing definite magnitudes waives now\nthe one, now the other, of the elements contained in inseparable unity\nin the notion of quantity. Thus, it may be said, the space occupied by\nthis room is a continuous magnitude, and the hundred men, assembled\nin it, form a discrete magnitude. And yet the space is continuous and\ndiscrete at the same time; hence we speak of points of space, or we\ndivide space, a certain length, into so many feet, inches, &c, which\ncan be done only on the hypothesis that space is also potentially\ndiscrete. Similarly, on the other hand, the discrete magnitude, made\nup of a hundred men, is also continuous: and the circumstance on which\nthis continuity depends, is the common element, the species man, which\npervades all the individuals and unites them with each other.\n(b) _Quantum (How Much)._\n101.] Quantity, essentially invested with the exclusionist character\nwhich it involves, is Quantum (or How Much): _i.e._ limited\nquantity.\nQuantum is, as it were, the determinate Being of quantity: whereas mere\nquantity corresponds to abstract Being, and the Degree, which is next\nto be considered, corresponds to Being-for-self. As for the details\nof the advance from mere quantity to quantum, it is founded on this:\nthat whilst in mere quantity the distinction, as a distinction of\ncontinuity and discreteness, is at first only implicit, in a quantum\nthe distinction is actually made, so that quantity in general now\nappears as distinguished or limited. But in this way the quantum breaks\nup at the same time into an indefinite multitude of Quanta or definite\nmagnitudes. Each of these definite magnitudes, as distinguished from\nthe others, forms a unity, while on the other hand, viewed _per se,_ it\nis a many. And, when that is done, the quantum is described as Number.\n102.] In Number the quantum reaches its development and perfect\nmode. Like the One, the medium in which it exists, Number involves two\nqualitative factors or functions; Annumeration or Sum, which depends on\nthe factor discreteness, and Unity, which depends on continuity.\nIn arithmetic the several kinds of operation are usually presented as\naccidental modes of dealing with numbers. If necessity and meaning\nis to be found in these operations, it must be by a principle: and\nthat must come from the characteristic elements in the notion of\nnumber itself. (This principle must here be briefly exhibited.) These\ncharacteristic elements are Annumeration on the one hand, and Unity on\nthe other, which together constitute number. But Unity, when applied\nto empirical numbers, is only the equality of these numbers: hence the\nprinciple of arithmetical operations must be to put numbers in the\nratio of Unity and Sum (or amount), and to elicit the equality of these\ntwo modes.\nThe Ones or the numbers themselves are indifferent towards each other,\nand hence the unity into which they are translated by the arithmetical\noperation takes the aspect of an external colligation. All reckoning is\ntherefore making up the tale: and the difference between the species of\nit lies only in the qualitative constitution of the numbers of which we\nmake up the tale. The principle for this constitution is given by the\nway we fix Unity and Annumeration.\nNumeration comes first: what we may call, making number; a colligation\nof as many units as we please. But to get a _species_ of calculation,\nit is necessary that what we count up should be numbers already, and no\nlonger a mere unit.\nFirst, and as they naturally come to hand, Numbers are quite vaguely\nnumbers in general, and so, on the whole, unequal. The colligation, or\ntelling the tale of these, is Addition.\nThe second point of view under which we regard numbers is as equal,\nso that they make one unity, and of such there is an annumeration or\nsum before us. To tell the tale of these is Multiplication. It makes\nno matter in the process, how the functions of Sum and Unity are\ndistributed between the two numbers, or factors of the product; either\nmay be Sum and either may be Unity.\nThe third and final point of view is the equality of Sum (amount) and\nUnity. To number together numbers when so characterised is Involution;\nand in the first instance raising them to the square power. To\nraise the number to \u00e4 higher power means in point of form to go on\nmultiplying a number with itself an indefinite amount of times.--Since\nthis third type of calculation exhibits the complete equality of the\nsole existing distinction in number, viz. the distinction between Sum\nor amount and Unity, there can be no more than these three modes of\ncalculation. Corresponding to the integration we have the dissolution\nof numbers according to the same features. Hence besides the three\nspecies mentioned, which may to that extent be called positive, there\nare three negative species of arithmetical operation.\nNumber, in general, is the quantum in its complete specialisation.\nHence we may employ it not only to determine what we call discrete, but\nwhat are called continuous magnitudes as well. For that reason even\ngeometry must call in the aid of number, when it is required to specify\ndefinite figurations of space and their ratios.\n(c) _Degree._\n103.] The limit (in a quantum) is identical with the whole of the\nquantum itself. As _in itself_ multiple, the limit is Extensive\nmagnitude; as in itself _simple_ determinateness (qualitative\nsimplicity), it is Intensive magnitude or Degree.\nThe distinction between Continuous and Discrete magnitude differs\nfrom that between Extensive and Intensive in the circumstance that\nthe former apply to quantity in general, while the latter apply to\nthe limit or determinateness of it as such. Intensive and Extensive\nmagnitude are not, any more than the other, two species, of which the\none involves a character not possessed by the other: what is Extensive\nmagnitude is just as much Intensive, and _vice vers\u00e2._\nIntensive magnitude or Degree is in its notion distinct from Extensive\nmagnitude or the Quantum. It is therefore inadmissible to refuse,\nas many do, to recognise this distinction, and without scruple to\nidentify the two forms of magnitude. They are so identified in\nphysics, when difference of specific gravity is explained by saying,\nthat a body, with a specific gravity twice that of another, contains\nwithin the same space twice as many material parts (or atoms) as the\nother. So with heat and light, if the various degrees of temperature\nand brilliancy were to be explained by the greater or less number of\nparticles (or molecules) of heat and light. No doubt the physicists,\nwho employ such a mode of explanation, usually excuse themselves, when\nthey are remonstrated with on its untenableness, by saying that the\nexpression is without prejudice to the confessedly unknowable essence\nof such phenomena, and employed merely for greater convenience. This\ngreater convenience is meant to point to the easier application of the\ncalculus: but it is hard to see why Intensive magnitudes, having, as\nthey do, a definite numerical expression of their own, should not be\nas convenient for calculation as Extensive magnitudes. If convenience\nbe all that is desired, surely it would be more convenient to banish\ncalculation and thought altogether. A further point against the apology\noffered by the physicists is, that, to engage in explanations of this\nkind, is to overstep the sphere of perception and experience, and\nresort to the realm of metaphysics and of what at other times would be\ncalled idle or even pernicious speculation. It is certainly a fact of\nexperience that, if one of two purses filled with shillings is twice\nas heavy as the other, the reason must be, that the one contains, say\ntwo hundred, and the other only one hundred shillings. These pieces\nof money we can see and feel with our senses: atoms, molecules, and\nthe like, are on the contrary beyond the range of sensuous perception;\nand thought alone can decide whether they are admissible, and have\na meaning. But (as already noticed in \u00a7 98, note) it is abstract\nunderstanding which stereotypes the factor of multeity (involved in the\nnotion of Being-for-self) in the shape of atoms, and adopts it as an\nultimate principle. It is the same abstract understanding which, in\nthe present instance, at equal variance with unprejudiced perception\nand with real concrete thought, regards Extensive magnitude as the\nsole form of quantity, and, where Intensive magnitudes occur, does not\nrecognise them in their own character, but makes a violent attempt by a\nwholly untenable hypothesis to reduce them to Extensive magnitudes.\nAmong the charges made against modern philosophy, one is heard more\nthan another. Modern philosophy, it is said, reduces everything to\nidentity. Hence its nickname, the Philosophy of Identity. But the\npresent discussion may teach that it is philosophy, and philosophy\nalone, which insists on distinguishing what is logically as well as\nin experience different; while the professed devotees of experience\nare the people who erect abstract identity into the chief principle\nof knowledge. It is their philosophy which might more appropriately\nbe termed one of identity. Besides it is quite correct that there are\nno merely Extensive and merely Intensive magnitudes, just as little\nas there are merely continuous and merely discrete magnitudes. The\ntwo characteristics of quantity are not opposed as independent kinds.\nEvery Intensive magnitude is also Extensive, and _vice vers\u00e2._ Thus a\ncertain degree of temperature is an Intensive magnitude, which has a\nperfectly simple sensation corresponding to it as such. If we look at a\nthermometer, we find this degree of temperature has a certain expansion\nof the column of mercury corresponding to it; which Extensive magnitude\nchanges simultaneously with the temperature or Intensive magnitude. The\ncase is similar in the world of mind: a more intensive character has a\nwider range with its effects than a less intensive.\n104.] In Degree the notion of quantum is explicitly put. It is\nmagnitude as indifferent on its own account and simple: but in such\na way that the character (or modal being) which makes it a quantum\nlies quite outside it in other magnitudes. In this contradiction,\nwhere the _independent_ indifferent limit is absolute _externality,_\nthe Infinite Quantitative Progression is made explicit--an immediacy\nwhich immediately veers round into its counterpart, into mediation (the\npassing beyond and over the quantum just laid down), and _vice vers\u00e2._\nNumber is a thought, but thought in its complete self-externalisation.\nBecause it is a thought, it does not belong to perception: but it is a\nthought which is characterised by the externality of perception.--Not\nonly therefore _may_ the quantum be increased or diminished without\nend: the very notion of quantum is thus to push out and out beyond\nitself. The infinite quantitative progression is only the meaningless\nrepetition of one and the same contradiction, which attaches to the\nquantum, both generally and, when explicitly invested with its special\ncharacter, as degree. Touching the futility of enunciating this\ncontradiction in the form of infinite progression, Zeno, as quoted by\nAristotle, rightly says, 'It is the same to say a thing once, and to\nsay it for ever.'\n(1) If we follow the usual definition of the mathematicians, given in\n\u00a7 99, and say that magnitude is what can be increased or diminished,\nthere may be nothing to urge against the correctness of the perception\non which it is founded; but the question remains, how we come to\nassume such a capacity of increase or diminution. If we simply appeal\nfor an answer to experience, we try an unsatisfactory course; because\napart from the fact that we should merely have a material image of\nmagnitude, and not the thought of it, magnitude would come out as a\nbare possibility (of increasing or diminishing) and we should have no\nkey to the necessity for its exhibiting this behaviour. In the way of\nour logical evolution, on the contrary, quantity is obviously a grade\nthe process of self-determining thought; and it has been shown that it\nlies in the very notion of quantity to shoot out beyond itself. In that\nway, the increase or diminution (of which we have heard) is not merely\npossible, but necessary.\n(2) The quantitative infinite progression is what the reflective\nunderstanding usually relies upon when it is engaged with the\ngeneral question of Infinity. The same thing however holds good of\nthis progression, as was already remarked on the occasion of the\nqualitatively, infinite progression. As was then said, it is not the\nexpression of a true, but of a wrong infinity; it never gets further\nthan a bare 'ought,' and thus really remains within the limits\nof finitude. The quantitative form of this infinite progression,\nwhich Spinoza rightly calls a mere imaginary infinity (_infinitum\nimaginationis,_) is an image often employed by poets, such as Haller\nand Klopstock, to depict the infinity, not of Nature merely, but even\nof God Himself. Thus we find Haller, in a famous description of God's\ninfinity, saying:\nIch h\u00e4ufe ungeheure Zahlen,\nGebirge Millionen auf,\nIch sesse Zeit auf Zeit\nUnd Welt auf Welt zu Hauf,\nUnd wenn ich von der grausen H\u00f6h'\nMit Schwindel wieder nach Dir seh:\nIst alle Macht der Zahl,\nVermehrt zu Tausendmal,\nNoch nicht ein Theil von Dir.\n[I heap up monstrous numbers, mountains of millions; I pile time upon\ntime, and world on the top of world; and when from the awful height I\ncast a dizzy look towards Thee, all the power of number, multiplied a\nthousand times, is not yet one part of Thee.]\nHere then we meet, in the first place, that continual extrusion of\nquantity, and especially of number, beyond itself, which Kant describes\nas 'eery.' The only really 'eery' thing about it is the wearisomeness\nof ever fixing, and anon unfixing a limit, without advancing a single\nstep. The same poet however well adds to that description of false\ninfinity the closing line:\nIch zieh sie ab, und Du liegst ganz vor mir.\n[These I remove, and Thou liest all before me.]\nWhich means, that the true infinite is more than a mere world beyond\nthe finite, and that we, in order to become conscious of it, must\nrenounce that _progressus in infinitum._\n(3) Pythagoras, as is well known, philosophised in numbers, and\nconceived number as the fundamental principle of things. To the\nordinary mind this view must at first glance seem an utter paradox,\nperhaps a mere craze. What, then, are we to think of it? To answer\nthis question, we must, in the first place, remember that the problem\nof philosophy consists in tracing back things to thoughts, and, of\ncourse, to definite thoughts. Now, number is undoubtedly a thought: it\nis the thought nearest the sensible, or, more precisely expressed, it\nis the thought of the sensible itself, if we take the sensible to mean\nwhat is many, and in reciprocal exclusion. The attempt to apprehend\nthe universe as number is therefore the first step to metaphysics. In\nthe history of philosophy, Pythagoras, as we know, stands between the\nIonian philosophers and the Eleatics. While the former, as Aristotle\nsays, never get beyond viewing the essence of things as material (\u1f55\u03bb\u03b7),\nand the latter, especially Parmenides, advanced as far as pure thought,\nin the shape of Being, the principle of the Pythagorean philosophy\nforms, as it were, the bridge from the sensible to the super-sensible.\nWe may gather from this, what is to be said of those who suppose that\nPythagoras undoubtedly went too far, when he conceived the essence\nof things as mere number. It is true, they admit, that we can number\nthings; but, they contend, things are far more than mere numbers. But\nin what respect are they more? The ordinary sensuous consciousness,\nfrom its own point of view, would not hesitate to answer the question\nby handing us over to sensuous perception, and remarking, that things\nare not merely numerable, but also visible, odorous, palpable, &c. In\nthe phrase of modern times, the fault of Pythagoras would be described\nas an excess of idealism. As may be gathered from what has been said\non the historical position of the Pythagorean school, the real state\nof the case is quite the reverse. Let it be conceded that things are\nmore than numbers; but the meaning of that admission must be that the\nbare thought of number is still insufficient to enunciate the definite\nnotion or essence of things. Instead, then, of saying that Pythagoras\nwent too far with his philosophy of number, it would be nearer the\ntruth to say that he did not go far enough; and in fact the Eleatics\nwere the first to take the further step to pure thought.\nBesides, even if there are not things, there are states of things, and\nphenomena of nature altogether, the character of which mainly rests on\ndefinite numbers and proportions. This is especially the case with the\ndifference of tones and their harmonic concord, which, according to a\nwell-known tradition, first suggested to Pythagoras to conceive the\nessence of things as number. Though it is unquestionably important to\nscience to trace back these phenomena to the definite numbers on which\nthey are based, it is wholly inadmissible to view the characterisation\nby thought as a whole, as merely numerical. We may certainly feel\nourselves prompted to associate the most general characteristics of\nthought with the first numbers: saying, 1 is the simple and immediate;\n2 is difference and mediation; and 3 the unity of both of these. Such\nassociations however are purely external: there is nothing in the mere\nnumbers to make them express these definite thoughts. With every step\nin this method, the more arbitrary grows the association of definite\nnumbers with definite thoughts. Thus, we may view 4 as the unity of\n1 and 3, and of the thoughts associated with them, but 4 is just as\nmuch the double of 2; similarly 9 is not merely the square of 3, but\nalso the sum of 8 and I, of 7 and 2, and so on. To attach, as do some\nsecret societies of modern times, importance to all sorts of numbers\nand figures, is to some extent an innocent amusement, but it is also a\nsign of deficiency of intellectual resource. These numbers, it is said,\nconceal a profound meaning, and suggest a deal to think about. But the\npoint in philosophy is, not what you may think, but what you do think:\nand the genuine air of thought is to be sought in thought itself, and\nnot in arbitrarily selected symbols.\n105.] That the Quantum in its independent character is external to\nitself, is what constitutes its quality. In that externality it\nis itself and referred connectively to itself. There is a union in\nit of externality, _i.e._ the quantitative, and of independency\n(Being-for-self),--the qualitative. The Quantum when explicitly put\nthus in its own self, is the Quantitative Ratio, a mode of being\nwhich, while, in its Exponent, it is an immediate quantum, is also\nmediation, viz. the reference of some one quantum to another, forming\nthe two sides of the ratio. But the two quanta are not reckoned at\ntheir immediate value: their value is only in this relation.\nThe quantitative infinite progression appears at first as a continual\nextrusion of number beyond itself. On looking closer, it is, however,\napparent that in this progression quantity returns to itself: for\nthe meaning of this progression, so far as thought goes, is the fact\nthat number is determined by number. And this gives the quantitative\nratio. Take, for example, the ratio 2:4. Here we have two magnitudes\n(not counted in their several immediate values) in which we are only\nconcerned with their mutual relations. This relation of the two terms\n(the exponent of the ratio) is itself a magnitude, distinguished from\nthe related magnitudes by this, that a change in it is followed by a\nchange of the ratio, whereas the ratio is unaffected by the change of\nboth its sides, and remains the same so long as the exponent is not\nchanged. Consequently, in place of 2:4, we can put 3:6 without changing\nthe ratio; as the exponent 2 remains the same in both cases.\n106.] The two sides of the ratio are still immediate quanta: and the\nqualitative and quantitative characteristics still external to one\nanother. But in their truth, seeing that the quantitative itself in its\nexternality is relation to self, or seeing that the independence and\nthe indifference of the character are combined, it is Measure.\nThus quantity by means of the dialectical movement so far studied\nthrough its several stages, turns out to be a return to quality. The\nfirst notion of quantity presented to us was that of quality abrogated\nand absorbed. That is to say, quantity seemed an external character not\nidentical with Being, to which it is quite immaterial. This notion, as\nwe have seen, underlies the mathematical definition of magnitude as\nwhat can be increased or diminished. At first sight this definition\nmay create the impression that quantity is merely whatever can be\naltered:--increase and diminution alike implying determination of\nmagnitude otherwise--and may tend to confuse it with determinate Being,\nthe second stage of quality, which in its notion is similarly conceived\nas alterable. We can, however, complete the definition by adding, that\nin quantity we have an alterable, which in spite of alterations still\nremains the same. The notion of quantity, it thus turns out, implies an\ninherent contradiction. This, contradiction is what forms the dialectic\nof quantity. The result of the dialectic however is not a mere return\nto quality, as if that were the true and quantity the false notion, but\nan advance to the unity and truth of both, to qualitative quantity, or\nMeasure.\nIt may be well therefore at this point to observe that whenever in\nour study of the objective world we are engaged in quantitative\ndeterminations, it is in all cases Measure which we have in view, as\nthe goal of our operations. This is hinted at even in language, when\nthe ascertainment of quantitative features and relations is called\nmeasuring. We measure, _e.g._ the length of different chords that have\nbeen put into a state of vibration, with an eye to the qualitative\ndifference of the tones caused by their vibration, corresponding to\nthis difference of length. Similarly, in chemistry, we try to ascertain\nthe quantity of the matters brought into combination, in order to find\nout the measures or proportions conditioning such combinations, that\nis to say, those quantities which give rise to definite qualities.\nIn statistics, too, the numbers with which the study is engaged are\nimportant only from the qualitative results conditioned by them. Mere\ncollection of numerical facts, prosecuted without regard to the ends\nhere noted, is justly called an exercise of idle curiosity, of neither\ntheoretical nor practical interest.\n107.] Measure is the qualitative quantum, in the first place as\nimmediate,--a quantum, to which a determinate being or a quality is\nattached.\nMeasure, where quality and quantity are in one, is thus the completion\nof Being. Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly\nabstract and characterless: but it is the very essence of Being to\ncharacterise itself, and its complete characterisation is reached\nin Measure. Measure, like the other stages of Being, may serve as a\ndefinition of the Absolute: God, it has been said, is the Measure of\nall things. It is this idea which forms the ground-note of many of the\nancient Hebrew hymns, in which the glorification of God tends in the\nmain to show that He has appointed to everything its bound: to the\nsea and the solid land, to the rivers and mountains; and also to the\nvarious kinds of plants and animals. To the religious sense of the\nGreeks the divinity of measure, especially in respect of social ethics,\nwas represented by Nemesis. That conception implies a general theory\nthat all human things, riches, honour, and power, as well as joy and\npain, have their definite measure, the transgression of which brings\nruin and destruction. In the world of objects, too, we have measure. We\nsee, in the first place, existences in Nature, of which measure forms\nthe essential structure. This is the case, for example, with the solar\nsystem, which may be described as the realm of free measures. As we\nnext proceed to the study of inorganic nature, measure retires, as it\nwere, into the background; at least we often find the quantitative and\nqualitative characteristics showing indifference to each other. Thus\nthe quality of a rock or a river is not tied to a definite magnitude.\nBut even these objects when closely inspected are found not to be quite\nmeasureless: the water of a river, and the single constituents of a\nrock, when chemically analysed, are seen to be qualities conditioned\nby quantitative ratios between the matters they contain. In organic\nnature, however, measure again rises full into immediate perception.\nThe various kinds of plants and animals, in the whole as well as in\ntheir parts, have a certain measure: though it is worth noticing that\nthe more imperfect forms, those which are least removed from inorganic\nnature, are partly distinguished from the higher forms by the greater\nindefiniteness of their measure. Thus among fossils, we find some\nammonites discernible only by the microscope, and others as large as a\ncart-wheel. The same vagueness of measure appears in several plants,\nwhich stand on a low level of organic development,--for instance, ferns.\n108.] In so far as in Measure quality and quantity are only in\n_immediate_ unity, to that extent their difference presents itself in\na manner equally immediate. Two cases are then possible. Either the\nspecific quantum or measure is a bare quantum, and the definite being\n(there-and-then) is capable of an increase or a diminution, without\nMeasure (which to that extent is a Rule) being thereby set completely\naside. Or the alteration of the quantum is also an alteration of the\nquality.\nThe identity between quantity and quality, which is found in Measure,\nis at first only implicit, and not yet explicitly realised. In other\nwords, these two categories, which unite in Measure, each claim an\nindependent authority. On the one hand, the quantitative features of\nexistence may be altered, without affecting its quality. On the other\nhand, this increase and diminution, immaterial though it be, has\nits limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change. Thus the\ntemperature of water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence\nin respect of its liquidity: still with the increase or diminution\nof the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where\nthis state of cohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water\nis converted into steam or ice. A quantitative change takes place,\napparently without any further significance: but there is something\nlurking behind, and a seemingly innocent change of quantity acts as a\nkind of snare, to catch hold of the quality. The antinomy of Measure\nwhich this implies was exemplified under more than one garb among the\nGreeks. It was asked, for example, whether a single grain makes a heap\nof wheat, or whether it makes a bald-tail to tear out a single hair\nfrom the horse's tail. At first, no doubt, looking at the nature of\nquantity as an indifferent and external character of Being, we are\ndisposed to answer these questions in the negative. And yet, as we\nmust admit, this indifferent increase and diminution has its limit:\na point is finally reached, where a single additional grain makes a\nheap of wheat; and the bald-tail is produced, if we continue plucking\nout single hairs. These examples find a parallel in the story of the\npeasant who, as his ass trudged cheerfully along, went on adding ounce\nafter ounce to its load, till at length it sunk under the unendurable\nburden. It would be a mistake to treat these examples as pedantic\nfutility; they really turn on thoughts, an acquaintance with which is\nof great importance in practical life, especially in ethics. Thus in\nthe matter of expenditure, there is a certain latitude within which\na more or less does not matter; but when the Measure, imposed by the\nindividual circumstances of the special case, is exceeded on the one\nside or the other, the qualitative nature of Measure (as in the above\nexamples of the different temperature of water) makes itself felt,\nand a course, which a moment before was held good economy, turns into\navarice or prodigality. The same principle may be applied in politics,\nwhen the constitution of a state has to be looked at as independent of,\nno less than as dependent on, the extent of its territory, the number\nof its inhabitants, and other quantitative points of the same kind. If\nwe look _e.g._ at a state with a territory of ten thousand square miles\nand a population of four millions, we should, without hesitation, admit\nthat a few square miles of land or a few thousand inhabitants more or\nless could exercise no essential influence on the character of its\nconstitution. But, on the other hand, we must not forget, that by the\ncontinual increase or diminishing of a state, we finally get to a point\nwhere, apart from all other circumstances, this quantitative alteration\nalone necessarily draws with it an alteration in the quality of the\nconstitution. The constitution of a little Swiss canton does not suit\na great kingdom; and, similarly, the constitution of the Roman republic\nwas unsuitable when transferred to the small imperial towns of Germany.\n109.] In this second case, when a measure through its quantitative\nnature has gone in excess of its qualitative character, we meet, what\nis at first an absence of measure, the Measureless. But seeing\nthat the second quantitative ratio, which in comparison with the first\nis measureless, is none the less qualitative, the measureless is also a\nmeasure. These two transitions, from quality to quantum, and from the\nlatter back again to quality, may be represented under the image of an\ninfinite progression--as the self-abrogation and restoration of measure\nin the measureless.\nQuantity, as we have seen, is not only capable of alteration, _i.e._\nof increase or diminution: it is naturally and necessarily a tendency\nto exceed itself. This tendency is maintained even in measure. But if\nthe quantity present in measure exceeds a certain limit, the quality\ncorresponding to it is also put in abeyance. This however is not a\nnegation of quality altogether, but only of this definite quality, the\nplace of which is at once occupied by another. This process of measure,\nwhich appears alternately as a mere change in quantity, and then as a\nsudden revulsion of quantity into quality, may be envisaged under the\nfigure of a nodal (knotted) line. Such lines we find in Nature under\na variety of forms. We have already referred to the qualitatively\ndifferent states of aggregation water exhibits under increase or\ndiminution of temperature. The same phenomenon is presented by the\ndifferent degrees in the oxidation of metals. Even the difference of\nmusical notes may be regarded as an example of what takes place in\nthe process of measure,--the revulsion from what is at first merely\nquantitative into qualitative alteration.\n110.] What really takes place here is that the immediacy, which still\nattaches to measure as such, is set aside. In measure, at first,\nquality and quantity itself are immediate, and measure is only their\n'relative' identity. But measure shows itself absorbed and superseded\nin the measureless: yet the measureless, although it be the negation\nof measure, is itself a unity of quantity and quality. Thus in the\nmeasureless the measure is still seen to meet only with itself.\n111.] Instead of the more abstract factors, Being and Nothing, some\nand other, &c., the Infinite, which is affirmation as a negation\nof negation, now finds its factors in quality and quantity. These\n(\u03b1) have in the first place passed over, quality into quantity, (\u00a7\n98), and quantity into quality (\u00a7 105), and thus are both shown up\nas negations, (\u00df) But in their unity, that is, in measure, they are\noriginally distinct, and the one is only through the instrumentality of\nthe other. And (\u03b3) after the immediacy of this unity has turned out to\nbe self-annulling, the unity is explicitly put as what it implicitly\nis, simple relation-to-self, which contains in it being and all its\nforms absorbed.--Being or immediacy, which by the negation of itself\nis a mediation with self and a reference to self,--which consequently\nis also a mediation which cancels itself into reference-to-self, or\nimmediacy,--is Essence.\nThe process of measure, instead of being only the wrong infinite of\nan endless progression, in the shape of an ever-recurrent recoil\nfrom quality to quantity, and from quantity to quality, is also\nthe true infinity of coincidence with self in another. In measure,\nquality and quantity originally confront each other, like some and\nother. But quality is implicitly quantity, and conversely quantity\nis implicitly quality. In the process of measure, therefore, these\ntwo pass into each other: each of them becomes what it already was\nimplicitly: and thus we get Being thrown into abeyance and absorbed,\nwith its several characteristics negatived. Such Being is Essence.\nMeasure is implicitly Essence; and its process consists in realising\nwhat it is implicitly.--The ordinary consciousness conceives things\nas being, and studies them in quality, quantity, and measure. These\nimmediate characteristics however soon show themselves to be not fixed\nbut transient; and Essence is the result of their dialectic. In the\nsphere of Essence one category does not pass into another, but refers\nto another merely. In Being, the form of reference is purely due to\nour reflection on what takes place: but it is the special and proper\ncharacteristic of Essence. In the sphere of Being, when somewhat\nbecomes another, the somewhat has vanished. Not so in Essence: here\nthere is no real other, but only diversity, reference of the one\nto _its_ other. The transition of Essence is therefore at the same\ntime no transition: for in the passage of different into different,\nthe different does not vanish: the different terms remain in their\nrelation. When we speak of Being and Nought, Being is independent, so\nis Nought. The case is otherwise with the Positive and the Negative.\nNo doubt these possess the characteristic of Being and Nought. But\nthe positive by itself has no sense; it is wholly in reference to the\nnegative. And it is the same with the negative. In the sphere of Being\nthe reference of one term to another is only implicit; in Essence on\nthe contrary it is explicit And this in general is the distinction\nbetween the forms of Being and Essence: in Being everything is\nimmediate, in Essence everything is relative.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nSECOND SUB-DIVISION OF LOGIC.\nTHE DOCTRINE OF ESSENCE.\n112.] The terms in Essence are always mere pairs of correlatives, and\nnot yet absolutely reflected in themselves: hence in essence the actual\nunity of the notion is not realised, but only postulated by reflection.\nEssence,--which is Being coming into mediation with itself through the\nnegativity of itself--is self-relatedness, only in so far as it is\nrelation to an Other,--this Other however coming to view at first not\nas something which _is,_ but as postulated and hypothetised.--Being has\nnot vanished: but, firstly, Essence, as simple self-relation, is Being,\nand secondly as regards its one-sided characteristic of immediacy,\nBeing is deposed to a mere negative, to a seeming or reflected\nlight--Essence accordingly is Being thus reflecting light into itself.\nThe Absolute is the Essence. This is the same definition as the\nprevious one that the Absolute is Being, in so far as Being likewise\nis simple self-relation. But it is at the same time higher, because\nEssence is Being that has gone into itself: that is to say, the\nsimple self-relation (in Being) is expressly put as negation of\nthe negative, as immanent self-mediation.--Unfortunately when the\nAbsolute is defined to be the Essence, the negativity which this\nimplies is often taken only to mean the withdrawal of all determinate\npredicates. This negative action of withdrawal or abstraction thus\nfalls outside of the Essence--which is thus left as a mere result apart\nfrom its premisses,--the _caput mortuum_ of abstraction. But as this\nnegativity, instead of being external to Being, is its own dialectic,\nthe truth of the latter, viz. Essence, will be Being as retired within\nitself,--immanent Being. That reflection, or light thrown into itself,\nconstitutes the distinction between Essence and immediate Being, and is\nthe peculiar characteristic of Essence itself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAny mention of Essence implies that we distinguish it from Being:\nthe latter is immediate, and, compared with the Essence, we look upon\nit as mere seeming. But this seeming is not an utter nonentity and\nnothing at all, but Being superseded and put by. The point of view\ngiven by the Essence is in general the standpoint of 'Reflection.'\nThis word 'reflection' is originally applied, when a ray of light in\na straight line impinging upon the surface of a mirror is thrown back\nfrom it. In this phenomenon we have two things,--first an immediate\nfact which is, and secondly the deputed, derivated, or transmitted\nphase of the same.--Something of this sort takes place when we reflect,\nor think upon an object; for here we want to know the object, not in\nits immediacy, but as derivative or mediated. The problem or aim of\nphilosophy is often represented as the ascertainment of the essence of\nthings: a phrase which only means that things instead of being left\nin their immediacy, must be shown to be mediated by, or based upon,\nsomething else. The immediate Being of things is thus conceived under\nthe image of a rind or curtain behind which the Essence lies hidden.\nEverything, it is said, has an Essence; that is, things really are not\nwhat they immediately show themselves. There is therefore something\nmore to be done than merely rove from one quality to another, and\nmerely to advance from qualitative to quantitative, and _vice vers\u00e2:_\nthere is a permanent in things, and that permanent is in the first\ninstance their Essence. With respect to other meanings and uses of the\ncategory of Essence, we may note that in the German auxiliary verb\n_'sein'_ the past tense is expressed by the term for Essence (_Wesen_):\nwe designate past being as _gewesen._ This anomaly of language implies\nto some extent a correct perception of the relation between Being and\nEssence. Essence we may certainly regard as past Being, remembering\nhowever meanwhile that the past is not utterly denied, but only laid\naside and thus at the same time preserved. Thus, to say, Caesar _was_\nin Gaul, only denies the immediacy of the event, but not his sojourn\nin Gaul altogether. That sojourn is just what forms the import of\nthe proposition, in which however it is represented as over and\ngone.--'_Wesen_' in ordinary life frequently means only a collection\nor aggregate: Zeitungswesen (the Press), Postwesen (the Post-Office),\nSteuerwesen (the Revenue). All that these terms mean is that the things\nin question are not to be taken single, in their immediacy, but as a\ncomplex, and then, perhaps, in addition, in their various bearings.\nThis usage of the term is not very different in its implication from\nour own.\nPeople also speak of _finite_ Essences, such as man. But the very term\nEssence implies that we have made a step beyond finitude: and the title\nas applied to man is so far inexact. It is often added that there is\na supreme Essence (Being): by which is meant God. On this two remarks\nmay be made. In the first place the phrase 'there is' suggests a\nfinite only: as when we say, there are so many planets, or, there are\nplants of such a constitution and plants of such an other. In these\ncases we are speaking of something which has other things beyond and\nbeside it. But God, the absolutely infinite, is not something outside\nand beside whom there are other essences. All else outside f God, if\nseparated from Him, possesses no essentiality: in its I isolation it\nbecomes a mere show or seeming, without stay or essence of its own.\nBut, secondly, it is a poor way of talking to call God the _highest_\nor supreme Essence. The category of quantity which the phrase employs\nhas its proper place within the compass of the finite. When we call\none mountain the highest on the earth, we have a vision of other\nhigh mountains beside it. So too when we call any one the richest or\nmost learned in his country. But God, far from being _a_ Being, even\nthe highest, is _the_ Being. This definition, however, though such\na representation of God is an important and necessary stage in the\ngrowth of the religious consciousness, does not by any means exhaust\nthe depth of the ordinary Christian idea of God. If we consider God as\nthe Essence only, and nothing more, we know Him only as the universal\nand irresistible Power; in other words, as the Lord. Now the fear of\nthe Lord is, doubtless, the beginning,--but _only_ the beginning, of\nwisdom. To look at God in this light, as the Lord, and the Lord alone,\nis especially characteristic of Judaism and also of Mohammedanism.\nThe defect of these religions lies in their scant recognition of the\nfinite, which, be it as natural things or as finite phases of mind,\nit is characteristic of the heathen and (as they also for that reason\nare) polytheistic religions to maintain intact. Another not uncommon\nassertion is that God, as the supreme Being, cannot be known. Such is\nthe view taken by modern 'enlightenment' and abstract understanding,\nwhich is content to say, _Il y a un \u00eatre supr\u00eame_: and there lets\nthe matter rest. To speak thus, and treat God merely as the supreme\nother-world Being, implies that we look upon the world before us in\nits immediacy as something permanent and positive, and forget that\ntrue Being is just the superseding of all that is immediate. If God\nbe the abstract super-sensible Being, outside whom therefore lies all\ndifference and all specific character, He is only a bare name, a mere\n_caput mortuum_ of abstracting understanding. The true knowledge of God\nbegins when we know that things, as they immediately are, have no truth.\nIn reference also to other subjects besides God the category of Essence\nis often liable to an abstract use, by which, in the study of anything,\nits Essence is held to be something unaffected by, and subsisting in\nindependence of, its definite phenomenal embodiment. Thus we say, for\nexample, of people, that the great thing is not what they do or how\nthey behave, but what they are. This is correct, if it means that a\nman's conduct should be looked at, not in its immediacy, but only as\nit is explained by his inner self, and as a revelation of that inner\nself. Still it should be remembered that the only means by which the\nEssence and the inner self can be verified, is their appearance in\noutward reality; whereas the appeal which men make to the essential\nlife, as distinct from the material facts of conduct, is generally\nprompted by a desire to assert their own subjectivity and to elude an\nabsolute and objective judgment.\n113.] Self-relation in Essence is the form of Identity or of\nreflection-into-self, which has here taken the place of the immediacy\nof Being. They are both the same abstraction,--self-relation.\nThe unintelligence of sense, to take everything limited and finite for\nBeing, passes into the obstinacy of understanding, which views the\nfinite as self-identical, not inherently self-contradictory.\n114.] This identity, as it has descended from Being, appears in the\nfirst place only charged with the characteristics of Being, and\nreferred to Being as to something external. This external Being, if\ntaken in separation from the true Being (of Essence), is called the\nUnessential. But that turns out a mistake. Because Essence is\nBeing-in-self, it is essential only to the extent that it has in itself\nits negative, _e._ reference to another, or mediation. Consequently,\nit has the unessential as its own proper seeming (reflection) in\nitself. But in seeming or mediation there is distinction involved:\nand since what is distinguished (as distinguished from the identity\nout of which it arises, and in which it is not, or lies as seeming,)\nreceives itself the form of identity, the semblance is still in the\nmode of Being, or of self-related immediacy. The sphere of Essence\nthus turns out to be a still imperfect combination of immediacy and\nmediation. In it every term is expressly invested with the character\nof self-relatedness, while yet at the same time one is forced beyond\nit. It has Being,--reflected being, a being in which another shows,\nand which shows in another. And so it is also the sphere in which the\ncontradiction, still implicit in the sphere of Being, is made explicit.\nAs the one notion is the common principle underlying all logic, there\nappear in the development of Essence the same attributes or terms as\nin the development of Being, but in a reflex form. Instead of Being\nand Nought we have now the forms of Positive and Negative; the former\nat first as Identity corresponding to pure and uncontrasted Being, the\nlatter developed (showing in itself) as Difference. So also, we have\nBecoming represented by the Ground of determinate Being: which itself,\nwhen reflected upon the Ground, is Existence.\nThe theory of Essence is the most difficult branch of Logic. It\nincludes the categories of metaphysic and of the sciences in general.\nThese are products of reflective understanding, which, while it assumes\nthe differences to possess a footing of their own, and at the same\ntime also expressly affirms their relativity, still combines the two\nstatements, side by side, or one after the other, by an 'Also,' without\nbringing these thoughts into one, or unifying them into the notion.\nA.--ESSENCE AS GROUND OF EXISTENCE.\n(a) _The pure principles or categories of Reflection._\n(\u03b1) Identity.\n115.] The Essence lights up _in itself_ or is mere reflection: and\ntherefore is only self-relation, not as immediate but as reflected. And\nthat reflex relation is self-Identity.\nThis Identity becomes an Identity in form only, or of the\nunderstanding, if it be held hard and fast, quite aloof from\ndifference. Or, rather, abstraction is the imposition of this Identity\nof form, the transformation of something inherently concrete into this\nform of elementary simplicity. And this may be done in two ways. Either\nwe may neglect a part of the multiple features which are found in the\nconcrete thing (by what is called analysis) and select only one of\nthem; or, neglecting their variety, we may concentrate the multiple\ncharacters into one.\nIf we associate Identity with the Absolute, making the Absolute the\nsubject of a proposition, we get: The Absolute is what is identical\nwith itself. However true this proposition may be, it is doubtful\nwhether it be meant in its truth: and therefore it is at least\nimperfect in the expression. For it is left undecided, whether it means\nthe abstract Identity of understanding,--abstract, that is, because\ncontrasted with the other characteristics of Essence, or the Identity\nwhich is inherently concrete. In the latter case, as will be seen,\ntrue Identity is first discoverable in the Ground, and, with a higher\ntruth, in the Notion.--Even the word Absolute is often used to mean no\nmore than 'abstract.' Absolute space and absolute time, for example, is\nanother way of saying abstract space and abstract time.\nWhen the principles of Essence are taken as essential principles of\nthought they become predicates of a pre-supposed subject, which,\nbecause they are essential, is 'Everything,' The propositions thus\narising have been stated as universal Laws of Thought. Thus the first\nof them, the maxim of Identity, reads: Everything is identical with\nitself, A=A: and, negatively, A cannot at the same time be A and not\nA.--This maxim, instead of being a true law of thought, is nothing\nbut the law of abstract understanding. The propositional form itself\ncontradicts it: for a proposition always promises a distinction\nbetween subject and predicate; while the present one does not fulfil\nwhat its form requires. But the Law is particularly set aside by\nthe following so-called Laws of Thought, which make laws out of its\nopposite.--It is asserted that the maxim of Identity, though it\ncannot be proved, regulates the procedure of every consciousness,\nand that experience shows it to be accepted as soon as its terms\nare apprehended. To this alleged experience of the logic-books may\nbe opposed the universal experience that no mind thinks or forms\nconceptions or speaks, in accordance with this law, and that no\nexistence of any kind whatever conforms to it. Utterances after the\nfashion of this pretended law (A planet is--a planet; Magnetism\nis--magnetism; Mind is--mind) are, as they deserve to be, reputed\nsilly. That is certainly matter of general experience. The logic which\nseriously propounds such laws and the scholastic world in which alone\nthey are valid have long been discredited with practical common sense\nas well as with the philosophy of reason.\n*       *       *       *       *       *\nIdentity is, in the first place, the repetition of what we had earlier\nas Being, but as _become,_ through supersession of its character of\nimmediateness. It is therefore Being as Ideality.--It is important\nto come to a proper understanding on the true meaning of Identity:\nand, for that purpose, we must especially guard against taking it\nas abstract Identity, to the exclusion of all Difference. That is\nthe touchstone for distinguishing all bad philosophy from what alone\ndeserves the name of philosophy. Identity in its truth, as an Ideality\nof what immediately is, is a high category for our religious modes\nof mind as well as all other forms of thought and mental activity.\nThe true knowledge of God, it may be said, begins when we know Him as\nidentity,--as absolute identity. To know so much is to see that all\nthe power and glory of the world sinks into nothing in God's presence,\nand subsists only as the reflection of His power and His glory. In\nthe same way, Identity, as self-consciousness, is what distinguishes\nman from nature, particularly from the brutes which never reach the\npoint of comprehending themselves as 'I,' that is, pure self-contained\nunity. So again, in connexion with thought, the main thing is not to\nconfuse the true Identity, which contains Being and its characteristics\nideally transfigured in it, with an abstract Identity, identity of bare\nform. All the charges of narrowness, hardness, meaninglessness, which\nare so often directed against thought from the quarter of feeling and\nimmediate perception, rest on the perverse assumption that thought\nacts only as a faculty of abstract Identification. The Formal Logic\nitself confirms this assumption by laying down the supreme law of\nthought (so-called) which has been discussed above. If thinking were no\nmore than an abstract Identity, we could not but own it to be a most\nfutile and tedious business. No doubt the notion, and the idea too, are\nidentical with themselves: but identical only in so far as they at the\nsame time involve distinction.\n(\u03b2) _Difference._\n116.] Essence is mere Identity and reflection in itself only as it is\nself-relating negativity, and in that way self-repulsion. It contains\ntherefore essentially the characteristic of Difference.\nOther-being is here no longer qualitative, taking the shape of the\ncharacter or limit. It is now in Essence, in self-relating essence, and\ntherefore the negation is at the same time a relation,--is, in short,\nDistinction, Relativity, Mediation.\nTo ask, 'How Identity comes to Difference,' assumes that Identity as\nmere abstract Identity is something of itself, and Difference also\nsomething else equally independent. This supposition renders an answer\nto the question impossible. If Identity is viewed as diverse from\nDifference, all that we have in this way is but Difference; and hence\nwe cannot demonstrate the advance to difference, because the person\nwho asks for the How of the progress thereby implies that for him\nthe starting-point is non-existent. The question then when put to\nthe test has obviously no meaning, and its proposer may be met with\nthe question what he means by Identity; whereupon we should soon see\nthat he attaches no idea to it at all, and that Identity is for him\nan empty name. As we have seen, besides, Identity is undoubtedly a\nnegative,--not however an abstract empty Nought, but the negation of\nBeing and its characteristics. Being so, Identity is at the same time\nself-relation, and, what is more, negative self-relation; in other\nwords, it draws a distinction between it and itself.\n117.] Difference is, first of all, (1) immediate difference, _e.g._\nDiversity or Variety. In Diversity the different things are each\nindividually what they are, and unaffected by the relation in which\nthey stand to each other. This relation is therefore external to them.\nIn consequence of the various things being thus indifferent to the\ndifference between them, it falls outside them into a third thing, the\nagent of Comparison. This external difference, as an identity of the\nobjects related, is Likeness; as a non-identity of them, is Unlikeness.\nThe gap which understanding allows to divide these characteristics, is\nso great, that although comparison has one and the same substratum for\nlikeness and unlikeness, which are explained to be different aspects\nand points of view in it, still likeness by itself is the first of the\nelements alone, viz. identity, and unlikeness by itself is difference.\nDiversity has, like Identity, been transformed into a maxim:\n'Everything is various or different': or,'There are no two things\ncompletely like each other.' Here Everything is put under a predicate,\nwhich is the reverse of the identity attributed to it in the first\nmaxim; and therefore under a law contradicting the first. However there\nis an explanation. As the diversity is supposed due only to external\ncomparison, anything taken _per se_ is expected and understood always\nto be identical with itself, so that the second law need not interfere\nwith the first. But, in that case, variety does not belong to the\nsomething or everything in question: it constitutes no intrinsic\ncharacteristic of the subject: and the second maxim on this showing\ndoes not admit of being stated at all. If, on the other hand, the\nsomething _itself_ is as the maxim says diverse, it must be in virtue\nof its own proper character: but in this case the specific difference,\nand not variety as such, is what is intended. And this is the meaning\nof the maxim of Leibnitz.\nWhen understanding sets itself to study Identity, it has already passed\nbeyond it, and is looking at Difference in the shape of bare Variety.\nIf we follow the so-called law of Identity, and say,--The sea is the\nsea, The air is the air, The moon is the moon, these objects pass for\nhaving no bearing on one another. What we have before us therefore is\nnot Identity, but Difference. We do not stop at this point however, or\nregard things merely as different. We compare them one with another,\nand thus discover the features of likeness and unlikeness. The work of\nthe finite sciences lies to a great extent in the application of these\ncategories, and the phrase 'scientific treatment' generally means no\nmore than the method which has for its aim comparison of the objects\nunder examination. This method has undoubtedly led to some important\nresults;--we may particularly mention the great advance of modern times\nin the provinces of comparative anatomy and comparative linguistic.\nBut it is going too far to suppose that the comparative method can be\nemployed with equal success in all branches of knowledge. Nor--and this\nmust be emphasised--can mere comparison ever ultimately satisfy the\nrequirements of science. Its results are indeed indispensable, but they\nare still labours only preliminary to truly intelligent cognition.\nIf it be the office of comparison to reduce existing differences to\nIdentity, the science, which most perfectly fulfils that end, is\nmathematics. The reason of that is, that quantitative difference is\nonly the difference which is quite external. Thus, in geometry, a\ntriangle and a quadrangle, figures qualitatively different, have this\nqualitative difference discounted by abstraction, and are equalised to\none another in magnitude. It follows from what has been formerly said\nabout the mere Identity of understanding that, as has also been pointed\nout (\u00a7 99, note), neither philosophy nor the empirical sciences need\nenvy this superiority of Mathematics.\nThe story is told that, when Leibnitz propounded the maxim of Variety,\nthe cavaliers and ladies of the court, as they walked round the garden,\nmade efforts to discover two leaves indistinguishable from each other,\nin order to confute the law stated by the philosopher. Their device was\nunquestionably a convenient method of dealing with metaphysics,--one\nwhich has not ceased to be fashionable. All the same, as regards the\nprinciple of Leibnitz, difference must be understood to mean not an\nexternal and indifferent diversity merely, but difference essential.\nHence the very nature of things implies that they must be different.\n118.] Likeness is an Identity only of those things which are not\nthe same, not identical with each other: and Unlikeness is a\nrelation of things unlike. The two therefore do not fall on different\naspects or points of view in the thing, without any mutual affinity:\nbut one throws light into the other. Variety thus comes to be reflexive\ndifference, or difference (distinction) implicit and essential,\ndeterminate or specific difference.\n*       *       *       *       *       *\nWhile things merely various show themselves unaffected by each other,\nlikeness and unlikeness on the contrary are a pair of characteristics\nwhich are in completely reciprocal relation. The one of them cannot\nbe thought without the other. This advance from simple variety to\nopposition appears in our common acts of thought, when we allow that\ncomparison has a meaning only upon the hypothesis of an existing\ndifference, and that on the other hand we can distinguish only on the\nhypothesis of existing similarity.\nHence, if the problem be the discovery of a difference, we attribute\nno great cleverness to the man who only distinguishes those objects,\nof which the difference is palpable, _e.g._ a pen and a camel:\nand similarly, it implies no very advanced faculty of comparison,\nwhen the objects compared, _e.g._ a beech and an oak, a temple and\na church, are near akin. In the case of difference, in short, we\nlike to sec identity, and in the case of identity we like to see\ndifference. Within the range of the empirical sciences however, the\none of these two categories is often allowed to put the other out of\nsight and mind. Thus the scientific problem at one time is to reduce\nexisting differences to identity; on another occasion, with equal\none-sidedness, to discover new differences. We see this especially in\nphysical science. There the problem consists, in the first place, in\nthe continual search for new 'elements,' new forces, new genera, and\nspecies. Or, in another direction, it seeks to show that all bodies\nhitherto believed to be simple are compound: and modern physicists and\nchemists smile at the ancients, who were satisfied with four elements,\nand these not simple. Secondly, and on the other hand, mere identity\nis made the chief question. Thus electricity and chemical affinity\nare regarded as the same, and even the organic processes of digestion\nand assimilation are looked upon as a mere chemical operation. Modern\nphilosophy has often been nicknamed the Philosophy of Identity. But, as\nwas already remarked (\u00a7 103, note), it is precisely philosophy, and in\nparticular speculative logic, which lays bare the nothingness of the\nabstract, undifferentiated identity, known to understanding; though it\nalso undoubtedly urges its disciples not to rest at mere diversity, but\nto ascertain the inner unity of all existence.\n119.] Difference implicit is essential difference, the Positive\nand the Negative: and that is this way. The Positive is the\nidentical self-relation in such a way as not to be the Negative, and\nthe Negative is the different by itself so as not to be the Positive.\nThus either has an existence of its own in proportion as it is not the\nother. The one is made visible in the other, and is only in so far as\nthat other is. Essential difference is therefore Opposition; according\nto which the different is not confronted by _any_ other but by _its_\nother. That is, either of these two (Positive and Negative) is stamped\nwith a characteristic of its own only in its relation to the other: the\none is only reflected into itself as it is reflected into the other.\nAnd so with the other. Either in this way is the other's _own_ other.\nDifference implicit or essential gives the maxim, Everything is\nessentially distinct; or, as it has also been expressed, Of two\nopposite predicates the one only can be assigned to anything, and\nthere is no third possible. This maxim of Contrast or Opposition\nmost expressly controverts the maxim of Identity: the one says a\nthing should be only self-relation, the other says that it must be\nan opposite, a relation to its other. The native unintelligence of\nabstraction betrays itself by setting in juxtaposition two contrary\nmaxims, like these, as laws, without even so much as comparing\nthem.--The Maxim of Excluded Middle is the maxim of the definite\nunderstanding, which would fain avoid contradiction, but in so doing\nfalls into it. A must be either + A or - A, it says. It virtually\ndeclares in these words a third A which is neither + nor--, and which\nat the same time is yet invested with + and - characters. If + W mean\n6 miles to the West, and - W mean 6 miles to the East, and if the +\nand - cancel each other, the 6 miles of way or space remain what they\nwere with and without the contrast. Even the mere _plus_ and _minus_ of\nnumber or abstract direction have, if we like, zero, for their third:\nbut it need not be denied that the empty contrast, which understanding\ninstitutes between _plus_ and _minus,_ is not without its value in such\nabstractions as number, direction, &c.\nIn the doctrine of contradictory concepts, the one notion is, say,\nblue (for in this doctrine even the sensuous generalised image of a\ncolour is called a notion) and the other not-blue. This other then\nwould not be an affirmative, say, yellow, but would merely be kept at\nthe abstract negative.--That the Negative in its own nature is quite as\nmuch Positive (see next \u00a7), is implied in saying that what is opposite\nto another is _its_ other. The inanity of the opposition between what\nare called contradictory notions is fully exhibited in what we may call\nthe grandiose formula of a general law, that Everything has the one and\nnot the other of _all_ predicates which are in such opposition. In this\nway, mind is either white or not-white, yellow or not-yellow, &c, _ad\ninfinitum._\nIt was forgotten that Identity and Opposition are themselves opposed,\nand the maxim of Opposition was taken even for that of Identity,\nin the shape of the principle of Contradiction. A notion, which\npossesses neither or both of two mutually contradictory marks, _e.g._\na quadrangular circle, is held to be logically false. Now though a\nmultangular circle and a rectilineal arc no less contradict this\nmaxim, geometers never hesitate to treat the circle as a polygon with\nrectilineal sides. But anything like a circle (that is to say its mere\ncharacter or nominal definition) is still no notion. In the notion\nof a circle, centre and circumference are equally essential: both\nmarks belong to it: and yet centre and circumference are opposite and\ncontradictory to each other.\nThe conception of Polarity, which is so dominant in physics, contains\nby implication the more correct definition of Opposition. But physics\nfor its theory of the laws of thought adheres to the ordinary logic; it\nmight therefore well be horrified in case it should ever work out the\nconception of Polarity, and get at the thoughts which are implied in it.\n(1) With the positive we return to identity, but in its higher truth\nas identical self-relation, and at the same time with the note that it\nis not the negative. The negative _per se_ is the same as difference\nitself. The identical as such is primarily the yet uncharacterised:\nthe positive on the other hand is what is self-identical, but with the\nmark of antithesis to an other. And the negative is difference as such,\ncharacterised as not identity. This is the difference of difference\nwithin its own self.\nPositive and negative are supposed to express an absolute difference.\nThe two however are at bottom the same: the name of either might be\ntransferred to the other. Thus, for example, debts and assets are not\ntwo particular, self-subsisting species of property. What is negative\nto the debtor, is positive to the creditor. A way to the east is also\na way to the west. Positive and negative are therefore intrinsically\nconditioned by one another, and are only in relation to each other. The\nnorth pole of the magnet cannot be without the south pole, and _vice\nvers\u00e2._ If we cut a magnet in two, we have not a north pole in one\npiece, and a south pole in the other. Similarly, in electricity, the\npositive and the negative are not two diverse and independent fluids.\nIn opposition, the different is not confronted by any other, but by\n_its_ other. Usually we regard different things as unaffected by each\nother. Thus we say: I am a human being, and around me are air, water,\nanimals, and all sorts of things. Everything is thus put outside of\nevery other. But the aim of philosophy is to banish indifference, and\nto ascertain the necessity of things. By that means the other is seen\nto stand over against _its_ other. Thus, for example, inorganic nature\nis not to be considered merely something else than organic nature, but\nthe necessary antithesis of it. Both are in essential relation to one\nanother; and the one of the two is, only in so far as it excludes the\nother from it, and thus relates itself thereto. Nature in like manner\nis not without mind, nor mind without nature. An important step has\nbeen taken, when we cease in thinking to use phrases like: Of course\nsomething else is also possible. While we so speak, we are still\ntainted with contingency: and all true thinking, we have already said,\nis a thinking of necessity.\nIn modern physical science the opposition, first observed to exist\nin magnetism as polarity, has come to be regarded as a universal law\npervading the whole of nature. This would be a real scientific advance,\nif care were at the same time taken not to let mere variety revert\nwithout explanation, as a valid category, side by side with opposition.\nThus at one time the colours are regarded as in polar opposition to one\nanother, and called complementary colours: at another time they are\nlooked at in their indifferent and merely quantitative difference of\nred, yellow, green, &c.\n(2) Instead of speaking by the maxim of Excluded Middle (which is the\nmaxim of abstract understanding) we should rather say: Everything is\nopposite. Neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of\nmind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'Either--or'\nas the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with\ndifference and opposition in itself. The finitude of things will then\nlie in the want of correspondence between their immediate being, and\nwhat they essentially are. Thus, in inorganic nature, the acid is\nimplicitly at the same time the base: in other words, its only being\nconsists in its relation to its other. Hence also the acid is not\nsomething that persists quietly in the contrast: it is always in effort\nto realise what it potentially is. Contradiction is the very moving\nprinciple of the world: and it is ridiculous to say that contradiction\nis unthinkable. The only thing correct in that statement is that\ncontradiction is not the end of the matter, but cancels itself. But\ncontradiction, when cancelled, does not leave abstract identity; for\nthat is itself only one side of the contrariety. The proximate result\nof opposition (when realised as contradiction) is the Ground, which\ncontains identity as well as difference superseded and deposed to\nelements in the completer notion.\n120.] Contrariety then has two forms. The Positive is the aforesaid\nvarious (different) which is understood to be independent, and yet\nat the same not to be unaffected by its relation to its other. The\nNegative is to be, no less independently, negative self-relating,\nself-subsistent, and yet at the same time as Negative must on every\npoint have this its self-relation, _i.e._ its Positive, only in the\nother. Both Positive and Negative are therefore explicit contradiction;\nboth are potentially the same. Both are so actually also; since either\nis the abrogation of the other and of itself. Thus they fall to the\nGround.--Or as is plain, the essential difference, as a difference, is\nonly the difference of it from itself, and thus contains the identical:\nso that to essential and actual difference there belongs itself as\nwell as identity. As self-relating difference it is likewise virtually\nenunciated as the self-identical. And the opposite is in general that\nwhich includes the one and its other, itself and its opposite. The\nimmanence of essence thus defined is the Ground.\n(\u03b3) _The Ground._\n121.] The Ground is the unity of identity and difference, the\ntruth of what difference and identity have turned out to be,--the\nreflection-into-self, which is equally a reflection-into-an-other, and\n_vice vers\u00e2._ It is essence put explicitly as a totality.\nThe maxim of the Ground runs thus: Everything has its Sufficient\nGround: that is, the true essentiality of any thing is not the\npredication of it as identical with itself, or as different (various),\nor merely positive, or merely negative, but as having its Being in\nan other, which, being its self-same, is its essence. And to this\nextent the essence is not abstract reflection into self, but into an\nother. The Ground is the essence in its own inwardness; the essence is\nintrinsically a ground; and it is a ground only when it is a ground of\nsomewhat, of an other.\nWe must be careful, when we say that the ground is the unity of\nidentity and difference, not to understand by this unity an abstract\nidentity. Otherwise we only change the name, while we still think the\nidentity (of understanding) already seen to be false. To avoid this\nmisconception we may say that the ground, besides being the unity,\nis also the difference of identity and difference. In that case in\nthe ground, which promised at first to supersede contradiction, a new\ncontradiction seems to arise. It is however a contradiction which, so\nfar from persisting quietly in itself, is rather the expulsion of it\nfrom itself. The ground is a ground only to the extent that it affords\nground: but the result which thus issued from the ground is only\nitself. In this lies its formalism. The ground and what is grounded are\none and the same content: the difference between the two is the mere\ndifference of form which separates simple self-relation, on the one\nhand, from mediation or derivativeness on the other. Inquiry into the\ngrounds of things goes with the point of view which, as already noted\n(note to \u00a7 112), is adopted by Reflection. We wish, as it were, to see\nthe matter double, first in its immediacy, and secondly in its ground,\nwhere it is no longer immediate. This is the plain meaning of the law\nof sufficient ground, as it is called; it asserts that things should\nessentially be viewed as mediated. The manner in which Formal Logic\nestablishes this law of thought, sets a bad example to other sciences.\nFormal Logic asks these sciences not to accept their subject-matter as\nit is immediately given; and yet herself lays down a law of thought\nwithout deducing it,--in other words, without exhibiting its mediation.\nWith the same justice as the logician maintains our faculty of thought\nto be so constituted that we must ask for the ground of everything,\nmight the physicist, when asked why a man who falls into water is\ndrowned, reply that man happens to be so organised that he cannot live\nunder water; or the jurist, when asked why a criminal is punished,\nreply that civil society happens to be so constituted that crimes\ncannot be left unpunished.\nYet even if logic be excused the duty of giving a ground for the law\nof the sufficient ground, it might at least explain what is to be\nunderstood by a ground. The common explanation, which describes the\nground as what has a consequence, seems at the first glance more lucid\nand intelligible than the preceding definition in logical terms. If you\nask however what the consequence is, you are told that it is what has\na ground; and it becomes obvious that the explanation is intelligible\nonly because it assumes what in our case has been reached as the\ntermination of an antecedent movement of thought. And this is the\ntrue business of logic: to show that those thoughts, which as usually\nemployed merely float before consciousness neither understood nor\ndemonstrated, are really grades in the self-determination of thought.\nIt is by this means that they are understood and demonstrated.\nIn common life, and it is the same in the finite sciences, this\nreflective form is often employed as a key to the secret of the real\ncondition of the objects under investigation. So long as we deal with\nwhat may be termed the household needs of knowledge, nothing can be\nurged against this method of study. But it can never afford definitive\nsatisfaction, either in theory or practice. And the reason why it\nfails is that the ground is yet without a definite content of its own;\nI so that to regard anything as resting upon a ground merely gives\nthe formal difference of mediation in place of immediacy. We see an\nelectrical phenomenon, for example, and we ask for its ground (or\nreason): we are told that electricity is the ground of this phenomenon.\nWhat is this but the same content as we had immediately before us, only\ntranslated into the form of inwardness?\nThe ground however is not merely simple self-identity, but also\ndifferent: hence various grounds may be alleged for the same sum\nof fact. This variety of grounds, again, following the logic of\ndifference, culminates in opposition of grounds _pro_ and _contra._\nIn any action, such as a theft, there is a sum of fact in which\nseveral aspects may be distinguished. The theft has violated the\nrights of property: it has given the means of satisfying his wants to\nthe needy thief: possibly too the man, from whom the theft was made,\nmisused his property. The violation of property is unquestionably\nthe decisive point of view before which the others must give way:\nbut the bare law of the ground cannot settle that question. Usually\nindeed the law is interpreted to speak of a sufficient ground, not\nof any ground whatever: and it might be supposed therefore, in the\naction referred to, that, although other points of view besides the\nviolation of property might be held as grounds, yet they would not be\nsufficient grounds. But here comes a dilemma. If we use the phrase\n'sufficient ground,' the epithet is either otiose, or of such a kind\nas to carry us past the mere category of ground. The predicate is\notiose and tautological, if it only states the capability of giving a\nground or reason: for the ground is a ground, only in so far as it has\nthis capability. If a soldier runs away from battle to save his life,\nhis conduct is certainly a violation of duty: but it cannot be held\nthat the ground which led him so to act was insufficient, otherwise\nhe would have remained at his post. Besides, there is this also to\nbe said. On one hand any ground suffices: on the other no ground\nsuffices as mere ground; because, as already said, it is yet void of\na content objectively and intrinsically determined, and is therefore\nnot self-acting and productive. A content thus objectively and\nintrinsically determined, and hence self-acting, will hereafter come\nbefore us as the notion: and it is the notion which Leibnitz had in his\neye when he spoke of sufficient ground, and urged the study of things\nunder its point of view. His remarks were originally directed against\nthat merely mechanical method of conceiving things so much in vogue\neven now; a method which he justly pronounces insufficient. We may\nsee an instance of this mechanical theory of investigation, when the\norganic process of the circulation of the blood is traced back merely\nto the contraction of the heart; or when certain theories of criminal\nlaw explain the purpose of punishment to lie in deterring people from\ncrime, in rendering the criminal harmless, or in other extraneous\ngrounds of the same kind. It is unfair to Leibnitz to suppose that he\nwas content with anything so poor as this formal law of the ground. The\nmethod of investigation which he inaugurated is the very reverse of a\nformalism which acquiesces in mere grounds, where a full and concrete\nknowledge is sought. Considerations to this effect led Leibnitz to\ncontrast _causae efficientes_ and _causae finales,_ and to insist in\nthe place of final causes as the conception to which the efficient were\nto lead up. If we adopt this distinction, light, heat, and moisture\nwould be the _causae efficientes,_ not the _causa finalis_ of the\ngrowth of plants: the _causa finalis_ is the notion of the plant itself.\nTo get no further than mere grounds, especially on questions of law and\nmorality, is the position and principle of the Sophists. Sophistry,\nas we ordinarily conceive it, is a method of investigation which aims\nat distorting what is just and true, and exhibiting things in a false\nlight. Such however is not the proper or primary tendency of Sophistry:\nthe standpoint of which is no other than that of 'Raisonnement.' The\nSophists came on the scene at a time when the Greeks had begun to grow\ndissatisfied with mere authority and tradition and felt the need of\nintellectual justification for what they were to accept as obligatory.\nThat desideratum the Sophists supplied by teaching their countrymen\nto seek for the various points of view under which things may be\nconsidered: which points of view are the same as grounds. But the\nground, as we have seen, has no essential and objective principles of\nits own, and it is as easy to discover grounds for what is wrong and\nimmoral as for what is moral and right. Upon the observer therefore it\ndepends to decide what points are to have most weight. The decision in\nsuch circumstances is prompted by his individual views and sentiments.\nThus the objective foundation of what ought to have been of absolute\nand essential obligation, accepted by all, was undermined: and\nSophistry by this destructive action deservedly brought upon itself\nthe bad name previously mentioned. Socrates, as we all know, met the\nSophists at every point, not by a bare re-assertion of authority and\ntradition against their argumentations, but by showing dialectically\nhow untenable the mere grounds were, and by vindicating the obligation\nof justice and goodness,--by reinstating the universal or notion of the\nwill. In the present day such a method of argumentation is not quite\nout of fashion. Nor is that the case only in the discussion of secular\nmatters. It occurs even in sermons, such as those where every possible\nground of gratitude to God is propounded. To such pleading Socrates\nand Plato would not have scrupled to apply the name of Sophistry.\nFor Sophistry has nothing to do with what is taught:--that may very\npossibly be true. Sophistry lies in the formal circumstance of teaching\nit by grounds which are as available for attack as for defence. In a\ntime so rich in reflection and so devoted to _raisonnement_ as our\nown, he must be a poor creature who cannot advance a good ground for\neverything, even for what is worst and most depraved. Everything in the\nworld that has become corrupt has had good ground for its corruption.\nAn appeal to grounds at first makes the hearer think of beating a\nretreat: but when experience has taught him the real state of these\nmatters, he closes his ears against them, and refuses to be imposed\nupon any more.\n122.] As it first comes, the chief feature of Essence is show in itself\nand intermediation in itself. But when it has completed the circle\nof intermediation, its unity with itself is explicitly put as the\nself-annulling of difference, and therefore of intermediation. Once\nmore then we come back to immediacy or Being,--but Being in so far as\nit is intermediated by annulling the intermediation. And that Being is\nExistence.\nThe ground is not yet determined by objective principles of its\nown, nor is it an end or final cause: hence it is not active, nor\nproductive. An Existence only _proceeds from_ the ground. The\ndeterminate ground is therefore a formal matter: that is to say, any\npoint will do, so long as it is expressly put as self-relation, as\naffirmation, in correlation with the immediate existence depending on\nit. If it be a ground at all, it is a good ground: for the term 'good'\nis employed abstractly as equivalent to affirmative; and any point (or\nfeature) is good which can in any way be enunciated as confessedly\naffirmative. So it happens that a ground can be found and adduced for\neverything: and a good ground (for example, a good motive for action)\nmay effect something or may not, it may have a consequence or it may\nnot. It becomes a motive (strictly so called) and effects something,\n_e.g._ through its reception into a will; there and there only it\nbecomes active and is made a cause.\n(b) _Existence._\n123.] Existence is the immediate unity of reflection-into-self and\nreflection-into-another. It follows from this that existence is the\nindefinite multitude of existents as reflected-into-themselves, which\nat the same time equally throw light upon one another,--which, in\nshort, are co-relative, and form a world of reciprocal dependence and\nof infinite interconnexion between grounds and consequents. The grounds\nare themselves existences: and the existents in like manner are in many\ndirections grounds as well as consequents.\nThe phrase 'Existence' (derived from _existere_) suggests the fact of\nhaving proceeded from something. Existence is Being which has proceeded\nfrom the ground, and been reinstated by annulling its intermediation.\nThe Essence, as Being set aside and absorbed, originally came\nbefore us as shining or showing in self, and the categories of this\nreflection are identity, difference and ground. The last is the unity\nof identity and difference; and because it unifies them it has at the\nsame time to distinguish itself from itself. But that which is in\nthis way distinguished from the ground is as little mere difference,\nas the ground itself is abstract sameness. The ground works its\nown suspension: and when suspended, the result of its negation is\nexistence. Having issued from the ground, existence contains the ground\nin it 'the ground does not remain, as it were, behind existence, but by\nits very nature supersedes itself and translates itself into existence.\nThis is exemplified even in our ordinary mode of thinking, when we\nlook upon the ground of a thing, not as something abstractly inward,\nbut as itself also an existent. For example, the lightning-flash\nwhich has set a house on fire would be considered the ground of the\nconflagration: or the manners of a nation and the condition of its\nlife would be regarded as the ground of its constitution. Such indeed\nis the ordinary aspect in which the existent world originally appears\nto reflection,--an indefinite crowd of things existent, which being\nsimultaneously reflected on themselves and on one another are related\nreciprocally as ground and consequence. In this motley play of the\nworld, if we may so call the sum of existents, there is nowhere a\nfirm footing to be found: everything bears an aspect of relativity,\nconditioned by and conditioning something else. The reflective\nunderstanding makes it its business to elicit and trace these\nconnexions running out in every direction; but the question touching an\nultimate design is so far left unanswered, and therefore the craving of\nthe reason after knowledge passes with the further development of the\nlogical Idea beyond this position of mere relativity.\n124.] The reflection-on-another of the existent is however inseparable\nfrom the reflection-on-self: the ground is their unity, from which\nexistence has issued. The existent therefore includes relativity, and\nhas on its own part its multiple interconnexions with other existents:\nit is reflected on itself as its ground. The existent is, when so\ndescribed, a Thing.\nThe 'thing-by-itself' (or thing in the abstract), so famous in the\nphilosophy of Kant, shows itself here in its genesis. It is seen to be\nthe abstract reflection-on-self, which is clung to, to the exclusion of\nreflection-on-other-things and of all predication of difference. The\nthing-by-itself therefore is the empty substratum for these predicates\nof relation.\nIf to know means to comprehend an object in its concrete character,\nthen the thing-by-itself, which is nothing but the quite abstract\nand indeterminate thing in general, must certainly be as unknowable\nas it is alleged to be. With as much reason however as we speak\nof the thing-by-itself, we might speak of quality-by-itself or\nquantity-by-itself, and of any other category. The expression would\nthen serve to signify that these categories are taken in their abstract\nimmediacy, apart from their development and inward character. It is\nno better than a whim of the understanding, therefore, if we attach\nthe qualificatory 'in or by-itself' to the _thing_ only. But this\n'in or by-itself' is also applied to the facts of the mental as well\nas the natural world: as we speak of electricity or of a plant in\nitself, so we speak of man or the state in itself. By this 'in-itself'\nin these objects we are meant to understand what they strictly and\nproperly are. This usage is liable to the same criticism as the\nphrase 'thing-in-itself.' For if we stick to the mere 'in-itself' of\nan object, we apprehend it not in its truth, but in the inadequate\nform of mere abstraction. Thus the man, by or in himself, is the\nchild. And what the child has to do is to rise out of this abstract\nand undeveloped 'in-himself,' and become 'for himself what he is at\nfirst only 'in-himself,' a free and reasonable being. Similarly, the\nstate-in-itself is the yet immature and patriarchal state, where the\nvarious political functions, latent in the notion of the state, have\nnot received the full logical constitution which the logic of political\nprinciples demands. In the same sense, the germ may be called the\nplant-in-itself. These examples may show the mistake of supposing\nthat the 'thing-in-itself' or the 'in-itself' of things is something\ninaccessible to our cognition. All things are originally in-themselves,\nbut that is not the end of the matter. As the germ, being the\nplant-in-itself, means self-development, so the thing in general passes\nbeyond its in-itself, (the abstract reflection on self,) to manifest\nitself further as a reflection on other things. It is in this sense\nthat it has properties.\n(c) _The Thing._\n125.] (\u03b1) The Thing is the totality--the development in explicit\nunity--of the categories of the ground and of existence. On the side\nof one of its factors, viz. reflection-on-other-things, it has in it\nthe differences, in virtue of which it is a characterised and concrete\nthing. These characteristics are different from one another; they have\ntheir reflection-into-self not on their own part, but on the part of\nthe thing. They are Properties of the thing: and their relation to the\nthing is expressed by the word 'have.'\nAs a term of relation, 'to have' takes the place of 'to be.' True,\nsomewhat has qualities on its part too: but this transference of\n'Having' into the sphere of Being is inexact, because the character as\nquality is directly one with the somewhat, and the somewhat ceases to\nbe when it loses its quality. But the thing is reflection-into-self:\nfor it is an identity which is also distinct from the difference,\n_i.e._ from its attributes.--In many languages 'have' is employed\nto denote past time. And with reason: for the past is absorbed or\nsuspended being, and the mind is its reflection-into-self; in the mind\nonly it continues to subsist,--the mind however distinguishing from\nitself this being in it which has been absorbed or suspended.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn the Thing all the characteristics of reflection recur as existent.\nThus the thing, in its initial aspect, as the thing-by-itself, is the\nself-same or identical. But identity, it was proved, is not found\nwithout difference: so the properties, which the thing has, are the\nexistent difference in the form of diversity. In the case of diversity\nor variety each diverse member exhibited an indifference to every\nother, and they had no other relation to each other, save what was\ngiven by a comparison external to them. But now in the thing we have a\nbond which keeps the various properties in union. Property, besides,\nshould not be confused with quality. No doubt, we also say, a thing\nhas qualities. But the phraseology is a misplaced one: 'having' hints\nat an independence, foreign to the 'Somewhat,' which is still directly\nidentical with its quality. Somewhat is what it is only by its\nquality: whereas, though the thing indeed exists only as it has its\nproperties, it is not confined to this or that definite property, and\ncan therefore lose it, without ceasing to be what it is.\n126.] (\u00df) Even in the ground, however, the reflection-on-something-else\nis directly convertible with reflection-on-self. And hence the\nproperties are not merely different from each other; they are also\nself-identical, independent, and relieved from their attachment to the\nthing. Still, as they are the characters of the thing distinguished\nfrom one another (as reflected-into-self), they are not themselves\nthings, if things be concrete; but only existences reflected\ninto themselves as abstract characters. They are what are called\nMatters.\nNor is the name 'things' given to Matters, such as magnetic and\nelectric matters. They are qualities proper, a reflected Being,--one\nwith their Being,--they are the character that has reached immediacy,\nexistence: they are 'entities.'\nTo elevate the properties, which the Thing has, to the independent\nposition of matters, or materials of which it consists, is a proceeding\nbased upon the notion of a Thing: and for that reason is also found\nin experience. Thought and experience however alike protest against\nconcluding from the fact that certain properties of a thing, such\nas colour, or smell, may be represented as particular colouring or\nodorific matters, that we are then at the end of the inquiry, and\nthat nothing more is needed to penetrate to the true secret of things\nthan a disintegration of them into their component materials. This\ndisintegration into independent matters is properly restricted to\ninorganic nature only. The chemist is in the right therefore when,\nfor example, he analyses common salt or gypsum into its elements, and\nfinds that the former consists of muriatic acid and soda, the latter of\nsulphuric acid and calcium. So too the geologist does well to regard\ngranite as a compound of quartz, felspar, and mica. These matters,\nagain, of which the thing consists, are themselves partly things,\nwhich in that way may be once more reduced to more abstract matters.\nSulphuric acid, for example, is a compound of sulphur and oxygen. Such\nmatters or bodies can as a matter of fact be exhibited as subsisting by\nthemselves: but frequently we find other properties of things, entirely\nwanting this self-subsistence, also regarded as particular matters.\nThus we hear caloric, and electrical or magnetic matters spoken of.\nSuch matters are at the best figments of understanding. And we see\nhere the usual procedure of the abstract reflection of understanding.\nCapriciously adopting single categories, whose value entirely depends\non their place in the gradual evolution of the logical idea, it employs\nthem in the pretended interests of explanation, but in the face of\nplain, unprejudiced perception and experience, so as to trace back to\nthem every object investigated. Nor is this all. The theory, which\nmakes things consist of independent matters, is frequently applied in a\nregion where it has neither meaning nor force. For within the limits of\nnature even, wherever there is organic life, this category is obviously\ninadequate. An animal may be said to consist of bones, muscles, nerves,\n&c.: but evidently we are here using the term 'consist' in a very\ndifferent sense from its use when we spoke of the piece of granite as\nconsisting of the above-mentioned elements. The elements of granite are\nutterly indifferent to their combination: they could subsist as well\nwithout it. The different parts and members of an organic body on the\ncontrary subsist only in their union: they cease to exist as such, when\nthey are separated from each other.\n127.] Thus Matter is the mere abstract or indeterminate\nreflection-into-something-else, or reflection-into-self at the same\ntime as determinate; it is consequently Thinghood which then and there\nis,--the subsistence of the thing. By this means the thing has on the\npart of the matters its reflection-into-self (the reverse of \u00a7 125);\nit subsists not on its own part, but consists of the matters, and is\nonly a superficial association between them, an external combination of\nthem.\n128.] (\u03b3) Matter, being the immediate unity of existence with itself,\nis also indifferent towards specific character. Hence the numerous\ndiverse matters coalesce into the one Matter, or into existence\nunder the reflective characteristic of identity. In contrast to this\none Matter these distinct properties and their external relation which\nthey have to one another in the thing, constitute the _Form_,--the\nreflective category of difference, but a difference which exists and is\na totality.\nThis one featureless Matter is also the same as the Thing-by-itself\nwas: only the latter is intrinsically quite abstract, while the former\nessentially implies relation to something else, and in the first place\nto the Form.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe various matters of which the thing consists are potentially the\nsame as one another. Thus we get one Matter in general to which the\ndifference is expressly attached externally and as a bare form. This\ntheory which holds things all round to have one and the same matter at\nbottom, and merely to differ externally in respect of form, is much in\nvogue with the reflective understanding. Matter in that case counts for\nnaturally indeterminate, but susceptible of any determination; while at\nthe same time it is perfectly permanent, and continues the same amid\nall change and alteration. And in finite things at least this disregard\nof matter for any determinate form is certainly exhibited. For example,\nit matters not to a block of marble, whether it receive the form of\nthis or that statue or even the form of a pillar. Be it noted however\nthat a block of marble can disregard form only relatively, that is, in\nreference to the sculptor: it is by no means purely formless. And so\nthe mineralogist considers the relatively formless marble as a special\nformation of rock, differing from other equally special formations,\nsuch as sandstone or porphyry. Therefore we say it is an abstraction\nof the understanding which isolates matter into a certain natural\nformlessness. For properly speaking the thought of matter includes the\nprinciple of form throughout, and no formless matter therefore appears\nanywhere even in experience as existing. Still the conception of\nmatter as original and pre-existent, and as naturally formless, is a\nvery ancient one; it meets us even among the Greeks, at first in the\nmythical shape of Chaos, which is supposed to represent the unformed\nsubstratum of the existing world. Such a conception must of necessity\ntend to make God not the Creator of the world, but a mere world-moulder\nor demiurge. A deeper insight into nature reveals God as creating the\nworld out of nothing. And that teaches two things. On the one hand it\nenunciates that matter, as such, has no independent subsistence, and on\nthe other that the form does not supervene upon matter from without,\nbut as a totality involves the principle of matter in itself. This free\nand infinite form will hereafter come before us as the notion.\n129.] Thus the Thing suffers a disruption into Matter and Form. Each\nof these is the totality of thinghood and subsists for itself. But\nMatter, which is meant to be the positive and indeterminate existence,\ncontains, as an existence, reflection-on-another, every whit as\nmuch as it contains self-enclosed being. Accordingly as uniting\nthese characteristics, it is itself the totality of Form. But Form,\nbeing a complete whole of characteristics, _ipso facto_ involves\nreflection-into-self; in other words, as self-relating Form it has the\nvery function attributed to Matter. Both are at bottom the same. Invest\nthem with this unity, and you have the relation of Matter and Form,\nwhich are also no less distinct.\n130.] The Thing, being this totality, is a contradiction. On the side\nof its negative unity it is Form in which Matter is determined and\ndeposed to the rank of properties (\u00a7 125). At the same time it consists\nof Matters, which in the reflection-of-the-thing-into-itself are as\nmuch independent as they are at the same time negatived. Thus the thing\nis the essential existence, in such a way as to be an existence that\nsuspends or absorbs itself in itself. In other words, the thing is an\nAppearance or Phenomenon.\nThe negation of the several matters, which is insisted on in the\nthing no less than their independent existence, occurs in Physics as\n_porosity._ Each of the several matters (colouring matter, odorific\nmatter, and if we believe some people, even sound-matter,--not\nexcluding caloric, electric matter, &c:) is also negated: and in this\nnegation of theirs, or as interpenetrating their pores, we find the\nnumerous other independent matters, which, being similarly porous,\nmake room in turn for the existence of the rest. Pores are not\nempirical facts; they are figments of the understanding, which uses\nthem to represent the element of negation in independent matters.\nThe further working-out of the contradictions is concealed by the\nnebulous imbroglio in which all matters are independent and all no less\nnegated in each other.--If the faculties or activities are similarly\nhypostatised in the mind, their living unity similarly turns to the\nimbroglio of an action of the one on the others.\nThese pores (meaning thereby not the pores in an organic body, such as\nthe pores of wood or of the skin, but those in the so-called 'matters,'\nsuch as colouring matter, caloric, or metals, crystals, &c.) cannot be\nverified by observation. In the same way matter itself,--furthermore\nform which is separated from matter,--whether that be the thing as\nconsisting of matters, or the view that the thing itself subsists and\nonly has proper ties,--is all a product of the reflective understanding\nwhich, while it observes and professes to record only what it observes,\nis rather creating a metaphysic, bristling with contradictions of which\nit is unconscious.\nB.--APPEARANCE.\n131.] The Essence must appear or shine forth. Its shining or reflection\nin it is the suspension and translation of it to immediacy, which,\nwhilst as reflection-on-self it is matter or subsistence, is also form,\nreflection-on-something-else, a subsistence which sets itself aside. To\nshow or shine is the characteristic by which essence is distinguished\nfrom being,--by which it is essence; and it is this show which, when\nit is developed, shows itself, and is Appearance. Essence accordingly\nis not something beyond or behind appearance, but just because it\nis the essence which exists--the existence is Appearance\n(Forth-shining).\n*       *       *       *       *\nExistence stated explicitly in its contradiction is Appearance. But\nappearance (forth-shining) is not to be confused with a mere show\n(shining). Show is the proximate truth of Being or immediacy. The\nimmediate, instead of being, as we suppose, something independent,\nresting on its own self, is a mere show, and as such it is packed or\nsummed up under the simplicity of the immanent essence. The essence\nis, in the first place, the sum total of the showing itself, shining\nin itself (inwardly); but, far from abiding in this inwardness, it\ncomes as a ground forward into existence; and this existence being\ngrounded not in itself, but on something else, is just appearance.\nIn our imagination we ordinarily combine with the term appearance\nor phenomenon the conception of an indefinite congeries of things\nexisting, the being of which is purely relative, and which consequently\ndo not rest on a foundation of their own, but are esteemed only as\npassing stages. But in this conception it is no less implied that\nessence does not linger behind or beyond appearance. Rather it is, we\nmay say, the Infinite kindness which lets its own show freely issue\ninto immediacy, and graciously allows it the joy of existence. The\nappearance which is thus created does not stand on its own feet, and\nhas its being not in itself but in something else. God who is the\nessence, when He lends existence to the passing stages of His own show\nin Himself, may be described as the goodness that creates a world: but\nHe is also the power above it, and the righteousness, which manifests\nthe merely phenomenal character of the content of this existing world,\nwhenever it tries to exist in independence.\nAppearance is in every way a very important grade of the logical idea.\nIt may be said to be the distinction of philosophy from ordinary\nconsciousness that it sees the merely phenomenal character of what the\nlatter supposes to have a self-subsistent being. The significance of\nappearance however must be properly grasped, or mistakes will arise.\nTo say that anything is a _mere_ appearance may be misinterpreted to\nmean that, as compared with what is merely phenomenal, there is greater\ntruth in the immediate, in that which _is._ Now in strict fact, the\ncase is precisely the reverse. Appearance is higher than mere Being,--a\nricher category because it holds in combination the two elements of\nreflection-into-self and reflection-into-another: whereas Being (or\nimmediacy) still mere relationlessness and apparently rests upon itself\nalone. Still, to say that anything is _only_ an appearance suggests a\nreal flaw, which consists in this, that Appearance is still divided\nagainst itself and without intrinsic stability. Beyond and above mere\nappearance comes in the first place Actuality, the third grade of\nEssence, of which we shall afterwards speak.\nIn the history of Modern Philosophy, Kant has the merit of first\nrehabilitating this distinction between the common and the philosophic\nmodes of thought. He stopped half-way however, when he attached to\nAppearance a subjective meaning only, and put the abstract essence\nimmovable outside it as the thing-in-itself beyond the reach of our\ncognition. For it is the very nature of the world of immediate objects\nto be appearance only. Knowing it to be so, we know at the same time\nthe essence, which, far from staying behind or beyond the appearance,\nrather manifests its own essentiality by deposing the world to a mere\nappearance. One can hardly quarrel with the plain man who, in his\ndesire for totality, cannot acquiesce in the doctrine of subjective\nidealism, that we are solely concerned with phenomena. The plain man,\nhowever, in his desire to save the objectivity of knowledge, may very\nnaturally return to abstract immediacy, and maintain that immediacy\nto be true and actual. In a little work published under the title,\n_A Report, clear as day, to the larger Public touching the proper\nnature of the Latest Philosophy: an Attempt to force the reader to\nunderstand,'_ Fichte examined the opposition between subjective\nidealism and immediate consciousness in a popular form, under the shape\nof a dialogue between the author and the reader, and tried hard to\nprove that the subjective idealist's point of view was right. In this\ndialogue the reader complains to the author that he has completely\nfailed to place himself in the idealist's position, and is inconsolable\nat the thought that things around him are no real things but mere\nappearances. The affliction of the reader can scarcely be blamed when\nhe is expected to consider himself hemmed in by an impervious circle\nof purely subjective conceptions. Apart from this subjective view of\nAppearance, however, we have all reason to rejoice that the things\nwhich environ us are appearances and not steadfast and independent\nexistences; since in that case we should soon perish of hunger, both\nbodily and mental.\n(a) _The World of Appearance._\n132.] The Apparent or Phenomenal exists in such a way, that its\nsubsistence is _ipso facto_ thrown into abeyance or suspended and\nis only one stage in the form itself. The form embraces in it the\nmatter or subsistence as one of its characteristics. In this way\nthe phenomenal has its ground in this (form) as its essence, its\nreflection-into-self in contrast with its immediacy, but, in so doing,\nhas it only in another aspect of the form. This ground of its is no\nless phenomenal than itself, and the phenomenon accordingly goes on to\nan endless mediation of subsistence by means of form, and thus equally\nby non-subsistence. This endless inter-mediation is at the same time\na unity of self-relation; and existence is developed into a totality,\ninto a world of phenomena,--of reflected finitude.\n(b) _Content and Form._\n133.] Outside one another as the phenomena in this phenomenal\nworld are, they form a totality, and are wholly contained in their\nself-relatedness. In this way the self-relation of the phenomenon is\ncompletely specified, it has the Form in itself: and because it\nis in this identity, has it as essential subsistence. So it comes about\nthat the form is Content: and in its mature phase is the Law\nof the Phenomenon. When the form, on the contrary, is not reflected\ninto self, it is equivalent to the negative of the phenomenon, to\nthe non-independent and changeable: and that sort of form is the\nindifferent or External Form.\nThe essential point to keep in mind about the opposition of Form and\nContent is that the content is not formless, but has the form in its\nown self, quite as much as the form is external to it. There is thus\na doubling of form. At one time it is reflected into itself; and then\nis identical with the content. At another time it is not reflected\ninto itself, and then is the external existence, which does not at\nall affect the content. We are here in presence, implicitly, of the\nabsolute correlation of content and form: viz. their reciprocal\nrevulsion, so that content is nothing but the revulsion of form into\ncontent, and form nothing but the revulsion of content into form. This\nmutual revulsion is one of the most important laws of thought. But it\nis not explicitly brought out before the Relations of Substance and\nCausality.\nForm and content are a pair of terms frequently employed by the\nreflective understanding, especially with a habit of looking on the\ncontent as the essential and independent, the form on the contrary as\nthe unessential and dependent. Against this it is to be noted that both\nare in fact equally essential; and that, while a formless _content_ can\nbe as little found as a formless _matter,_ the two (content and matter)\nare distinguished by this circumstance, that matter, though implicitly\nnot without form, still in its existence manifests a disregard of form,\nwhereas the content, as such, is what it is only because the matured\nform is included in it. Still the form comes before us sometimes as\nan existence indifferent and external to content, and does so for\nthe reason that the whole range of Appearance still suffers from\nexternality. In a book, for instance, it certainly has no bearing upon\nthe content, whether it be written or printed, bound in paper or in\nleather. That however does not in the least imply that apart from such\nan indifferent and external form, the content of the book is itself\nformless. There are undoubtedly books enough which even in reference\nto their content may well be styled formless: but want of form in this\ncase is the same as bad form, and means the defect of the right form,\nnot the absence of all form whatever. So far is this right form from\nbeing unaffected by the content that it is rather the content itself. A\nwork of art that wants the right form is for that very reason no right\nor true work of art: and it is a bad way of excusing an artist, to say\nthat the content of his works is good and even excellent, though they\nwant the right form. Real works of art are those where content and form\nexhibit a thorough identity. The content of the Iliad, it may be said,\nis the Trojan war, and especially the wrath of Achilles. In that we\nhave everything, and yet very little after all; for the Iliad is made\nan Iliad by the poetic form, in which that content is moulded. The\ncontent of Romeo and Juliet may similarly be said to be the ruin of two\nlovers through the discord between their families: but something more\nis needed to make Shakespeare's immortal tragedy.\nIn reference to the relation of form and content in the field of\nscience, we should recollect the difference between philosophy and\nthe rest of the sciences. The latter are finite, because their mode\nof thought, as a merely formal act, derives its content from without.\nTheir content therefore is not known as moulded from within through\nthe thoughts which lie at the ground of it, and form and content do\nnot thoroughly interpenetrate each other. This partition disappears in\nphilosophy, and thus justifies its title of infinite knowledge. Yet\neven philosophic thought is often held to be a merely formal act; and\nthat logic, which confessedly deals only with thoughts _qu\u00e2_ thoughts,\nis merely formal, is especially a foregone conclusion. And if content\nmeans no more than what is palpable and obvious to the senses, all\nphilosophy and logic in particular must be at once acknowledged to\nbe void of content, that is to say, of content perceptible to the\nsenses. Even ordinary forms of thought however, and the common usage of\nlanguage, do not in the least restrict the appellation of content to\nwhat is perceived by the senses, or to what has a being in place and\ntime. A book without content is, as every one knows, not a book with\nempty leaves, but one of which the content is as good as none. We shall\nfind as the last result on closer analysis, that by what is called\ncontent an educated mind means nothing but the presence and power of\nthought. But this is to admit that thoughts are not empty forms without\naffinity to their content, and that in other spheres as well as in art\nthe truth and the sterling value of the content essentially depend on\nthe content showing itself identical with the form.\n134.] But immediate existence is a character of the subsistence itself\nas well as of the form: it is consequently external to the character of\nthe content; but in an equal degree this externality, which the content\nhas through the factor of its subsistence, is essential to it. When\nthus explicitly stated, the phenomenon is relativity or correlation:\nwhere one and the same thing, viz. the content or the developed\nform, is seen as the externality and antithesis of independent\nexistences, and as their reduction to a relation of identity, in which\nidentification alone the two things distinguished are what they are.\n(c) _Relation or Correlation._\n135.] (\u03b1) The immediate relation is that of the Whole and the\nParts. The content is the whole, and consists of the parts (the\nform), its counterpart. The parts are diverse one from another. It is\nthey that possess independent being. But they are parts, only when they\nare identified by being related to one another; or, in so far as they\nmake up the whole, when taken together. But this 'Together' is the\ncounterpart and negation of the part.\nEssential correlation is the specific and completely universal\nphase in which things appear. Everything that exists stands in\ncorrelation, and this correlation is the veritable nature of every\nexistence. The existent thing in this way has no being of its own, but\nonly in something else: in this other however it is self-relation; and\ncorrelation is the unity of the self-relation and relation-to-others.\nThe relation of the whole and the parts is untrue to this extent, that\nthe notion and the reality of the relation are not in harmony. The\nnotion of the whole is to contain parts: but if the whole is taken\nand made what its notion implies, _i.e._ if it is divided, it at once\nceases to be a whole. Things there are, no doubt, which correspond\nto this relation: but for that very reason they are low and untrue\nexistences. We must remember however what 'untrue' signifies. When\nit occurs in a philosophical discussion, the term 'untrue' does not\nsignify that the thing to which it is applied is non-existent. A bad\nstate or a sickly body may exist all the same; but these things are\nuntrue, because their notion and their reality are out of harmony.\nThe relation of whole and parts, being the immediate relation, comes\neasy to reflective understanding; and for that reason it often\nsatisfies when the question really turns on profounder ties. The limbs\nand organs, for instance, of an organic body are not merely parts of\nit: it is only in their unity that they are what they are, and they\nare unquestionably affected by that unity, as they also in turn affect\nit. These limbs and organs become mere parts, only when they pass under\nthe hands of the anatomist, whose occupation, be it remembered, is not\nwith the living body but with the corpse. Not that such analysis is\nillegitimate: we only mean that the external and mechanical relation of\nwhole and parts is not sufficient for us, if we want to study organic\nlife in its truth. And if this be so in organic life, it is the case\nto a much greater extent when we apply this relation to the mind and\nthe formations of the spiritual world. Psychologists may not expressly\nspeak of parts of the soul or mind, but the mode in which this\nsubject is treated by the analytic understanding is largely founded\non the analogy of this finite relation. At least that is so, when the\ndifferent forms of mental activity are enumerated and described merely\nin their isolation one after another, as so-called special powers and\nfaculties.\n136.] (\u03b2) The one-and-same of this correlation (the self-relation\nfound in it) is thus immediately a negative self-relation. The\ncorrelation is in short the mediating process whereby one and the\nsame is first unaffected towards difference, and secondly is the\nnegative self-relation, which repels itself as reflection-into-self to\ndifference, and invests itself (as reflection-into-something-else) with\nexistence, whilst it conversely leads back this reflection-into-other\nto self-relation and indifference. This gives the correlation of\nForce and its Expression.\nThe relationship of whole and part is the immediate and therefore\nunintelligent (mechanical) relation,--a revulsion of self-identity\ninto mere variety. Thus we pass from the whole to the parts, and from\nthe parts to the whole: in the one we forget its opposition to the\nother, while each on its own account, at one time the whole, at another\nthe parts, is taken to be an independent existence. In other words,\nwhen the parts are declared to subsist in the whole, and the whole\nto consist of the parts, we have either member of the relation at\ndifferent times taken to be permanently subsistent, while the other is\nnon-essential. In its superficial form the mechanical nexus consists in\nthe parts being independent of each other and of the whole.\nThis relation may be adopted for the progression _ad infinitum,_\nin the case of the divisibility of matter: and then it becomes an\nunintelligent alternation with the two sides. A thing at one time is\ntaken as a whole: then we go on to specify the parts: this specifying\nis forgotten, and what was a part is regarded as a whole: then the\nspecifying of the part comes up again, and so on for ever. But if this\ninfinity be taken as the negative which it is, it is the _negative_\nself-relating element in the correlation,--Force, the self-identical\nwhole, or immanency; which yet supersedes this immanency and gives\nitself expression;--and conversely the expression which vanishes and\nreturns into Force.\nForce, notwithstanding this infinity, is also finite: for the content,\nor the one and the same of the Force and its out-putting, is this\nidentity at first only for the observer: the two sides of the relation\nare not yet, each on its own account, the concrete identity of that\none and same, not yet the totality. For one another they are therefore\ndifferent, and the relationship is a finite one. Force consequently\nrequires solicitation from without: it works blindly: and on account of\nthis defectiveness of form, the content is also limited and accidental.\nIt is not yet genuinely identical with the form: not yet is it _as_ a\nnotion and an end; that is to say, it is not intrinsically and actually\ndeterminate. This difference is most vital, but not easy to apprehend:\nit will assume a clearer formulation when we reach Design. If it be\noverlooked, it leads to the confusion of conceiving God as Force, a\nconfusion from which Herder's God especially suffers.\nIt is often said that the nature of Force itself is unknown and only\nits manifestation apprehended. But, in the first place, it may be\nreplied, every article in the import of Force is the same as what\nis specified in the Exertion: and the explanation of a phenomenon\nby a Force is to that extent a mere tautology. What is supposed to\nremain unknown, therefore, is really nothing but the empty form of\nreflection-into-self, by which alone the Force is distinguished from\nthe Exertion,--and that form too is something familiar. It is a form\nthat does not make the slightest addition to the content and to the\nlaw, which have to be discovered from the phenomenon alone. Another\nassurance always given is that to speak of forces implies no theory as\nto their nature: and that being so, it is impossible to see why the\nform of Force has been introduced into the sciences at all. In the\nsecond place the nature of Force is undoubtedly unknown: we are still\nwithout any necessity binding and connecting its content together in\nitself, as we are without necessity in the content, in so far as it is\nexpressly limited and hence has its character by means of another thing\noutside it.\n(1) Compared with the immediate relation of whole and parts, the\nrelation between force and its putting-forth may be considered\ninfinite. In it that identity of the two sides is realised, which in\nthe former relation only existed for the observer. The whole, though\nwe can see that it consists of parts, ceases to be a whole when it\nis divided: whereas force is only shown to be force when it exerts\nitself, and in its exercise only comes back to itself. The exercise is\nonly force once more. Yet, on further examination even this relation\nwill appear finite, and finite in virtue of this mediation: just\nas, conversely, the relation of whole and parts is obviously finite\nin virtue of its immediacy. The first and simplest evidence for the\nfinitude of the mediated relation of force and its exercise is, that\neach and every force is conditioned and requires something else than\nitself for its subsistence. For instance, a special vehicle of magnetic\nforce, as is well known, is iron, the other properties of which, such\nas its colour, specific weight, or relation to acids, are independent\nof this connexion with magnetism. The same thing is seen in all other\nforces, which from one end to the other are found to be conditioned\nand mediated by something else than themselves. Another proof of\nthe finite nature of force is that it requires solicitation before\nit can put itself forth. That through which the force is solicited,\nis itself another exertion of force, which cannot put itself forth\nwithout similar solicitation. This brings us either to a repetition of\nthe infinite progression, or to a reciprocity of soliciting and being\nsolicited. In either case we have no absolute beginning of motion.\nForce is not as yet, like the final cause, inherently self-determining:\nthe content is given to it as determined, and force, when it exerts\nitself, is, according to the phrase, blind in its working. That phrase\nimplies the distinction between abstract force-manifestation and\nteleological action.\n(2) The oft-repeated statement, that the exercise of the force and\nnot the force itself admits of being known, must be rejected as\ngroundless. It is the very essence of force to manifest itself, and\nthus in the totality of manifestation, conceived as a law, we at the\nsame time discover the force itself. And yet this assertion that force\nin its own self is unknowable betrays a well-grounded presentiment\nthat this relation is finite. The several manifestations of a force at\nfirst meet us in indefinite multiplicity, and in their isolation seem\naccidental: but, reducing this multiplicity to its inner unity, which\nwe term force, we see that the apparently contingent is necessary, by\nrecognising the law that rules it. But the different forces themselves\nare a multiplicity again, and in their mere juxtaposition seem to be\ncontingent. Hence in empirical physics, we speak of the forces of\ngravity, magnetism, electricity, &c, and in empirical psychology of\nthe forces of memory, imagination, will, and all the other faculties.\nAll this multiplicity again excites a craving to know these different\nforces as a single whole, nor would this craving be appeased even if\nthe several forces were traced back to one common primary force. Such\na primary force would be really no more than an empty abstraction,\nwith as little content as the abstract thing-in-itself. And besides\nthis, the correlation of force and manifestation is essentially a\nmediated correlation (of reciprocal dependence), and it must therefore\ncontradict the notion of force to view it as primary or resting on\nitself.\nSuch being the case with the nature of force, though we may consent to\nlet the world be called a manifestation of divine forces, we should\nobject to have God Himself viewed as a mere force. For force is after\nall a subordinate and finite category. At the so-called renascence of\nthe sciences, when steps were taken to trace the single phenomena of\nnature back to underlying forces, the Church branded the enterprise\nas impious. The argument of the Church was as follows. If it be the\nforces of gravitation, of vegetation, &c. which occasion the movements\nof the heavenly bodies, the growth of plants, &c., there is nothing\nleft for divine providence, and God sinks to the level of a leisurely\non-looker, surveying this play of forces. The students of nature, it is\ntrue, and Newton more than others, when they employed the reflective\ncategory of force to explain natural phenomena, have expressly pleaded\nthat the honour of God, as the Creator and Governor of the world, would\nnot thereby be impaired. Still the logical issue of this explanation\nby means of forces is that the inferential understanding proceeds to\nfix each of these forces, and to maintain them in their finitude as\nultimate. And contrasted with this deinfinitised world of independent\nforces and matters, the only terms in which it is possible still to\ndescribe God will present Him in the abstract infinity of an unknowable\nsupreme Being in some other world far away. This is precisely the\nposition of materialism, and of modern 'free-thinking,' whose theology\nignores what God is and restricts itself to the mere fact _that_ He\nis. In this dispute therefore the Church and the religious mind have\nto a certain extent the right on their side. The finite forms of\nunderstanding certainly fail to fulfil the conditions for a knowledge\neither of Nature or of the formations in the world of Mind as they\ntruly are. Yet on the other side it is impossible to overlook the\nformal right which, in the first place, entitles the empirical sciences\nto vindicate the right of thought to know the existent world in all\nthe speciality of its content, and to seek something further than the\nbare statement of mere abstract faith that God creates and governs the\nworld. When our religious consciousness, resting upon the authority of\nthe Church, teaches us that God created the world by His almighty will,\nthat He guides the stars in their courses, and vouchsafes to all His\ncreatures their existence and their well-being, the question Why? is\nstill left to answer. Now it is the answer to this question which forms\nthe common task of empirical science and of philosophy. When religion\nrefuses to recognise this problem, or the right to put it, and appeals\nto the unsearchableness of the decrees of God, it is taking up the same\nagnostic ground as is taken by the mere Enlightenment of understanding.\nSuch an appeal is no better than an arbitrary dogmatism, which\ncontravenes the express command of Christianity, to know God in spirit\nand in truth, and is prompted by a humility which is not Christian, but\nborn of ostentatious bigotry.\n137.] Force is a whole, which is in its own self negative\nself-relation; and as such a whole it continually pushes\nitself off from itself and puts itself forth. But since this\nreflection-into-another (corresponding to the distinction between the\nParts of the Whole) is equally a reflection-into-self, this out-putting\nis the way and means by which Force that returns back into itself is\nas a Force. The very act of out-putting accordingly sets in abeyance\nthe diversity of the two sides which is found in this correlation,\nand expressly states the identity which virtually constitutes their\ncontent. The truth of Force and utterance therefore is that relation,\nin which the two sides are distinguished only as Outward and Inward.\n138.] (\u03b3) The Inward (Interior) is the ground, when it\nstands as the mere form of the one side of the Appearance and\nthe Correlation,--the empty form of reflection-into-self. As a\ncounterpart to it stands the Outward (Exterior),--Existence,\nalso as the form of the other side of the correlation, with the\nempty characteristic of reflection-into-something-else. But Inward\nand Outward are identified: and their identity is identity brought\nto fulness in the content, that unity of reflection-into-self and\nreflection-into-other which was forced to appear in the movement of\nforce. Both are the same one totality, and this unity makes them the\ncontent.\n139.] In the first place then, Exterior is the same content as\nInterior. What is inwardly is also found outwardly, and _vice vers\u00e2._\nThe appearance shows nothing that is not in the essence, and in the\nessence there is nothing but what is manifested.\n140.] In the second place, Inward and Outward, as formal terms,\nare also reciprocally opposed, and that thoroughly. The one is the\nabstraction of identity with self; the other, of mere multiplicity\nor reality. But as stages of the one form, they are essentially\nidentical: so that whatever is at first explicitly put only in the one\nabstraction, is also as plainly and at one step only in the other.\nTherefore what is only internal is also only external: and what is only\nexternal, is so far only at first internal.\nIt is the customary mistake of reflection to take the essence to be\nmerely the interior. If it be so taken, even this way of looking at\nit is purely external, and that sort of essence is the empty external\nabstraction.\nIns Innere der Natur\nDringt sein erschaffner Geist,\nZu gl\u00fccklich wenn er nur\nDie \u00e4u\u00dfere Schaale weist.[1]\nIt ought rather to have been said that, if the essence of nature is\never described as the inner part, the person who so describes it\nonly knows its outer shell. In Being as a whole, or even in mere\nsense-perception, the notion is at first only an inward, and for that\nvery reason is something external to Being, a subjective thinking\nand being, devoid of truth.--In Nature as well as in Mind, so long\nas the notion, design, or law are at first the inner capacity, mere\npossibilities, they are first only an external, inorganic nature,\nthe knowledge of a third person, alien force, and the like. As a man\nis outwardly, that is to say in his actions (not of course in his\nmerely bodily outwardness), so is he inwardly: and if his virtue,\nmorality, &c. are only inwardly his,--that is if they exist only in his\nintentions and sentiments, and his outward acts are not identical with\nthem, the one half of him is as hollow and empty as the other.\nThe relation of Outward and Inward unites the two relations that\nprecede, and at the same time sets in abeyance mere relativity and\nphenomenality in general. Yet so long as understanding keeps the Inward\nand Outward fixed in their separation, they are empty forms, the one\nas null as the other. Not only in the study of nature, but also of the\nspiritual world, much depends on a just appreciation of the relation\nof inward and outward, and especially on avoiding the misconception\nthat the former only is the essential point on which everything turns,\nwhile the latter is unessential and trivial. We find this mistake made\nwhen, as is often done, the difference between nature and mind is\ntraced back to the abstract difference between inner and outer. As for\nnature, it certainly is in the gross external, not merely to the mind,\nbut even on its own part. But to call it external 'in the gross' is\nnot to imply an abstract externality--for there is no such thing. It\nmeans rather that the Idea which forms the common content of nature and\nmind, is found in nature as outward only, and for that very reason only\ninward. The abstract understanding, with its 'Either--or,' may struggle\nagainst this conception of nature. It is none the less obviously found\nin our other modes of consciousness, particularly in religion. It is\nthe lesson of religion that nature, no less than the spiritual world,\nis a revelation of God: but with this distinction, that while nature\nnever gets so far as to be conscious of its divine essence, that\nconsciousness is the express problem of the mind, which in the matter\nof that problem is as yet finite. Those who look upon the essence of\nnature as mere inwardness, and therefore inaccessible to us, take up\nthe same line as that ancient creed which regarded God as envious and\njealous; a creed which both Plato and Aristotle pronounced against long\nago. All that God is, He imparts and reveals; and He does so, at first,\nin and through nature.\nAny object indeed is faulty and imperfect when it is only inward, and\nthus at the same time only outward, or, (which is the same thing,) when\nit is only an outward and thus only an inward. For instance, a child,\ntaken in the gross as human being, is no doubt a rational creature;\nbut the reason of the child as child is at first a mere inward, in the\nshape of his natural ability or vocation, &c. This mere inward, at the\nsame time, has for the child the form of a more outward, in the shape\nof the will of his parents, the attainments of his teachers, and the\nwhole world of reason that environs him. The education and instruction\nof a child aim at making him actually and for himself what he is at\nfirst potentially and therefore for others, viz. for his grown-up\nfriends. The reason, which at first exists in the child only as an\ninner possibility, is actualised through education: and conversely, the\nchild by these means becomes conscious that the goodness, religion, and\nscience which he had at first looked upon as an outward authority, are\nhis own and inward nature. As with the child so it is in this matter\nwith the adult, when, in opposition to his true destiny, his intellect\nand will remain in the bondage of the natural man. Thus, the criminal\nsees the punishment to which he has to submit as an act of violence\nfrom without: whereas in fact the penalty is only the manifestation of\nhis own criminal will.\nFrom what has now been said, we may learn what to think of a man who,\nwhen blamed for his shortcomings, it may be, his discreditable acts,\nappeals to the (professedly) excellent intentions and sentiments of\nthe inner self he distinguishes therefrom. There certainly may be\nindividual cases, where the malice of outward circumstances frustrates\nwell-meant designs, and disturbs the execution of the best-laid plans.\nBut in general even here the essential unity between inward and outward\nis maintained. We are thus justified in saying that a man is what he\ndoes; and the lying vanity which consoles itself with the feeling of\ninward excellence, may be confronted with the words of the gospel: 'By\ntheir fruits ye shall know them.' That grand saying applies primarily\nin a moral and religious aspect, but it also holds good in reference\nto performances in art and science. The keen eye of a teacher who\nperceives in his pupil decided evidences of talent, may lead him to\nstate his opinion that a Raphael or a Mozart lies hidden in the boy:\nand the result will show how far such an opinion was well-founded.\nBut if a daub of a painter, or a poetaster, soothe themselves by the\nconceit that their head is full of high ideals, their consolation is\na poor one; and if they insist on being judged not by their actual\nworks but by their projects, we may safely reject their pretensions\nas unfounded and unmeaning. The converse case however also occurs. In\npassing judgment on men who have accomplished something great and good,\nwe often make use of the false distinction between inward and outward.\nAll that they have accomplished, we say, is outward merely; inwardly\nthey were acting from some very different motive, such as a desire to\ngratify their vanity or other unworthy passion. This is the spirit of\nenvy. Incapable of any great action of its own, envy tries hard to\ndepreciate greatness and to bring it down to its own level. Let us,\nrather, recall the fine expression of Goethe, that there is no remedy\nbut Love against great superiorities of others. We may seek to rob\nmen's great actions of their grandeur, by the insinuation of hypocrisy;\nbut, though it is possible that men in an instance now and then may\ndissemble and disguise a good deal, they cannot conceal the whole of\ntheir inner self, which infallibly betrays itself in the _decursus\nvitae._ Even here it is true that a man is nothing but the series of\nhis actions.\nWhat is called the 'pragmatic' writing of history has in modern times\nfrequently sinned in its treatment of great historical characters, and\ndefaced and tarnished the true conception of them by this fallacious\nseparation of the outward from the inward. Not content with telling\nthe unvarnished tale of the great acts which have been wrought by\nthe heroes of the world's history, and with acknowledging that their\ninward being corresponds with the import of their acts, the pragmatic\nhistorian fancies himself justified and even obliged to trace the\nsupposed secret motives that lie behind the open facts of the record.\nThe historian, in that case, is supposed to write with more depth in\nproportion as he succeeds in tearing away the aureole from all that\nhas been heretofore held grand and glorious, and in depressing it, so\nfar as its origin and proper significance are concerned, to the level\nof vulgar mediocrity. To make these pragmatical researches in history\neasier, it is usual to recommend the study of psychology, which is\nsupposed to make us acquainted with the real motives of human actions.\nThe psychology in question however is only that petty knowledge of\nmen, which looks away from the essential and permanent in human\nnature to fasten its glance on the casual and private features shown\nin isolated instincts and passions. A pragmatical psychology ought\nat least to leave the historian, who investigates the motives at the\nground of great actions, a choice between the 'substantial' interests\nof patriotism, justice, religious truth and the like, on the one hand,\nand the subjective and 'formal' interests of vanity, ambition, avarice\nand the like, on the other. The latter however are the motives which\nmust be viewed by the pragmatist as really efficient, otherwise the\nassumption of a contrast between the inward (the disposition of the\nagent) and the outward (the import of the action) would fall to the\nground. But inward and outward have in truth the same content; and the\nright doctrine is the very reverse of this pedantic judicially. If the\nheroes of history had been actuated by subjective and formal interests\nalone, they would never have accomplished what they have. And if we\nhave due regard to the unity between the inner and the outer, we must\nown that great men willed what they did, and did what they willed.\n141.] The empty abstractions, by means of which the one identical\ncontent perforce continues in the two correlatives, suspend themselves\nin the immediate transition, the one in the other. The content is\nitself nothing but their identity (\u00a7 138): and these abstractions are\nthe seeming of essence, put as seeming. By the manifestation of force\nthe inward is put into existence: but this putting is the mediation by\nempty abstractions. In its own self the intermediating process vanishes\nto the immediacy, in which the inward and the outward are absolutely\nidentical and their difference is distinctly no more than assumed and\nimposed. This identity is Actuality.\nC.--ACTUALITY.\n142.] Actuality is the unity, become immediate, of essence with\nexistence, or of inward with outward. The utterance of the actual\nis the actual itself: so that in this utterance it remains just as\nessential, and only is essential, in so far as it is in immediate\nexternal existence.\nWe have ere this met Being and Existence as forms of the immediate.\nBeing is, in general, unreflected immediacy and transition into\nanother. Existence is immediate unity of being and reflection; hence\nappearance: it comes from the ground, and falls to the ground. In\nactuality this unity is explicitly put, and the two sides of the\nrelation identified. Hence the actual is exempted from transition, and\nits externality is its energising. In that energising it is reflected\ninto itself: its existence is only the manifestation of itself, not of\nan other.\nActuality and thought (or Idea) are often absurdly opposed. How\ncommonly we hear people saying that, though no objection can be urged\nagainst the truth and correctness of a certain thought, there is\nnothing of the kind to be seen in actuality, or it cannot be actually\ncarried out! People who use such language only prove that they have\nnot properly apprehended the nature either of thought or of actuality.\nThought in such a case is, on one hand, the synonym for a subjective\nconception, plan, intention or the like, just as actuality, on the\nother, is made synonymous with external and sensible existence. This\nis all very well in common life, where great laxity is allowed in the\ncategories and the names given to them: and it may of course happen\nthat _e.g._ the plan, or so-called idea, say of a certain method of\ntaxation, is good and advisable in the abstract, but that nothing of\nthe sort is found in so-called actuality, or could possibly be carried\nout under the given conditions. But when the abstract understanding\ngets hold of these categories and exaggerates the distinction they\nimply into a hard and fast line of contrast, when it tells us that in\nthis actual world we must knock ideas out of our heads, it is necessary\nenergetically to protest against these doctrines, alike in the name of\nscience and of sound reason. For on the one hand Ideas are not confined\nto our heads merely, nor is the Idea, upon the whole, so feeble as to\nleave the question of its actualisation or non-actualisation dependent\nin our will. The Idea is rather the absolutely active as well I as\nactual. And on the other hand actuality is not so bad and irrational,\nas purblind or wrong-headed and muddle-brained would-be reformers\nimagine. So far is actuality, as distinguished from mere appearance,\nand primarily presenting a unity of inward and outward, from being in\ncontrariety with reason, that it is rather thoroughly reasonable, and\neverything which is not reasonable must on that very ground cease to\nbe held actual. The same view may be traced in the usages of educated\nspeech, which declines to give the name of real poet or real statesman\nto a poet or a statesman who can do nothing really meritorious or\nreasonable.\nIn that vulgar conception of actuality which mistakes for it what is\npalpable and directly obvious to the senses, we must seek the ground\nof a wide-spread prejudice about the relation of the philosophy of\nAristotle to that of Plato. Popular opinion makes the difference to be\nas follows. While Plato recognises the idea and only the idea as the\ntruth, Aristotle, rejecting the idea, keeps to what is actual, and is\non that account to be considered the founder and chief of empiricism.\nOn this it may be remarked: that although actuality certainly is\nthe principle of the Aristotelian philosophy, it is not the vulgar\nactuality of what is immediately at hand, but the idea as actuality.\nWhere then lies the controversy of Aristotle against Plato? It lies in\nthis. Aristotle calls the Platonic idea a mere \u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2, and establishes\nin opposition to Plato that the idea, which both equally recognise to\nbe the only truth, is essentially to be viewed as an \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, in other\nwords, as the inward which is quite to the fore, or as the unity of\ninner and outer, or as actuality, in the emphatic sense here given to\nthe word.\n143.] Such a concrete category as Actuality includes the\ncharacteristics aforesaid and their difference, and is therefore also\nthe development of them, in such a way that, as it has them, they are\nat the same time plainly understood to be a show, to be assumed or\nimposed (\u00a7 141).\n(\u03b1) Viewed as an identity in general, Actuality is first of all\nPossibility--the reflection-into-self which, as in contrast with\nthe concrete unity of the actual, is taken and made an abstract and\nunessential essentiality. Possibility is what is essential to reality,\nbut in such a way that it is at the same time only a possibility.\nIt was probably the import of Possibility which induced Kant to regard\nit along with necessity and actuality as Modalities, 'since these\ncategories do not in the least increase the notion as object, but only\nexpress its relation to the faculty of knowledge.' For Possibility is\nreally the bare abstraction of reflection-into-self,--what was formerly\ncalled the Inward, only that it is now taken to mean the external\ninward, lifted out of reality and with the being of a mere supposition,\nand is thus, sure enough, supposed only as a bare modality, an\nabstraction which comes short, and, in more concrete terms, belongs\nonly to subjective thought. It is otherwise with Actuality and\nNecessity. They are anything but a mere sort and mode for something\nelse: in fact the very reverse of that. If they are supposed, it is as\nthe concrete, not merely supposititious, but intrinsically complete.\nAs Possibility is, in the first instance, the mere form of\nidentity-with-self (as compared with the concrete which is actual),\nthe rule for it merely is that a thing must not be self-contradictory.\nThus everything is possible; for an act of abstraction can give any\ncontent this form of identity. Everything however is as impossible as\nit is possible. In every content,--which is and must be concrete,--the\nspeciality of its nature may be viewed as a specialised contrariety\nand in that way as a contradiction. Nothing therefore can be more\nmeaningless than to speak of such possibility and impossibility. In\nphilosophy, in particular, there should never be a word said of showing\nthat 'It is possible,' or 'There is still another possibility,' or, to\nadopt another phraseology, 'It is conceivable.' The same consideration\nshould warn the writer of history against employing a category which\nhas now been explained to be on its own merits untrue: but the subtlety\nof the empty understanding finds its chief pleasure in the fantastic\ningenuity of suggesting possibilities and lots of possibilities.\nOur picture-thought is at first disposed to see in possibility the\nricher and more comprehensive, in actuality the poorer and narrower\ncategory. Everything, it is said, is possible, but everything which\nis possible is not on that account actual. In real truth, however, if\nwe deal with them as thoughts, actuality is the more comprehensive,\nbecause it is the concrete thought which includes possibility as an\nabstract element. And that superiority is to some extent expressed\nin our ordinary mode of thought when we speak of the possible, in\ndistinction from the actual, as _only_ possible. Possibility is often\nsaid to consist in a thing's being thinkable. 'Think,' however, in this\nuse of the word, only means to conceive any content under the form of\nan abstract identity. Now every content can be brought under this form,\nsince nothing is required except to separate it from the relations in\nwhich it stands. Hence any content, however absurd and nonsensical, can\nbe viewed as possible. It is possible that the moon might fall upon\nthe earth to-night; for the moon is a body separate from the earth,\nand may as well fall down upon it as a stone thrown into the air does.\nIt is possible that the Sultan may become Pope; for, being a man, he\nmay be converted to the Christian faith, may become a Catholic priest,\nand so on. In language like this about possibilities, it is chiefly\nthe law of the sufficient ground or reason which is manipulated in the\nstyle already explained. Everything, it is said, is possible, for which\nyou can state some ground. The less education a man has, or, in other\nwords, the less he knows of the specific connexions of the objects\nto which he directs his observations, the greater is his tendency to\nlaunch out into all sorts of empty possibilities. An instance of this\nhabit in the political sphere is seen in the pot-house politician.\nIn practical life too it is no uncommon thing to see ill-will and\nindolence slink behind the category of possibility, in order to escape\ndefinite obligations. To such conduct the same remarks apply as were\nmade in connexion with the law of sufficient ground. Reasonable and\npractical men refuse to be imposed upon by the possible, for the simple\nground that it is possible only. They stick to the actual (not meaning\nby that word merely whatever immediately is now and here). Many of\nthe proverbs of common life express the same contempt for what is\nabstractly possible. 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'\nAfter all there is as good reason for taking everything to be\nimpossible, as to be possible: for every content (a content is always\nconcrete) includes not only diverse but even opposite characteristics.\nNothing is so impossible, for instance, as this, that I am: for 'I' is\nat the same time simple self-relation and, as undoubtedly, relation\nto something else. The same may be seen in every other fact in the\nnatural or spiritual world. Matter, it may be said, is impossible:\nfor it is the unity of attraction and repulsion. The same is true of\nlife, law, freedom, and above all, of God Himself, as the true, _e.g._\nthe triune God,--a notion of God, which the abstract 'Enlightenment'\nof Understanding, in conformity with its canons, rejected on the\nallegation that it was contradictory in thought. Generally speaking,\nit is the empty understanding which haunts these empty forms: and\nthe business of philosophy in the matter is to show how null and\nmeaningless they are. Whether a thing is possible or impossible,\ndepends altogether on the subject-matter: that is, on the sum total of\nthe elements in actuality, which, as it opens itself out, discloses\nitself to be necessity.\n144.] (\u00df) But the Actual in its distinction from possibility (which\nis reflection-into-self) is itself only the outward concrete, the\nunessential immediate. In other words, to such extent as the actual\nis primarily (\u00a7 142) the simple merely immediate unity of Inward\nand Outward, it is obviously made an unessential outward, and thus\nat the same time (\u00a7 140) it is merely inward, the abstraction of\nreflection-into-self. Hence it is itself characterised as a merely\npossible. When thus valued at the rate of a mere possibility, the\nactual is a Contingent or Accidental, and, conversely,\npossibility is mere Accident itself or Chance.\n146.] Possibility and Contingency are the two factors of\nActuality,--Inward and Outward, put as mere forms which constitute the\nexternality of the actual. They have their reflection-into-self on the\nbody of actual fact, or content, with its intrinsic definiteness which\ngives the essential ground of their characterisation. The finitude of\nthe contingent and the possible lies, therefore, as we now see, in the\ndistinction of the form-determination from the content: and, therefore,\nit depends on the content alone whether anything is contingent and\npossible.\nAs possibility is the mere _inside_ of actuality, it is for that\nreason a mere _outside_ actuality, in other words, Contingency. The\ncontingent, roughly speaking, is what has the ground of its being\nnot in itself but in somewhat else. Such is the aspect under which\nactuality first comes before consciousness, and which is often mistaken\nfor actuality itself. But the contingent is only one side of the\nactual,--the side, namely, of reflection on somewhat else. It is the\nactual, in the signification of something merely possible. Accordingly\nwe consider the contingent to be what may or may not be, what may be\nin one way or in another, whose being or not-being, and whose being\non this wise or otherwise, depends not upon itself but on something\nelse. To overcome this contingency is, roughly speaking, the problem\nof science on the one hand; as in the range of practice, on the other,\nthe end of action is to rise above the contingency of the will, or\nabove caprice. It has however often happened, most of all in modern\ntimes, that contingency has been unwarrantably elevated, and had a\nvalue attached to it, both in nature and the world of mind, to which\nit has no just claim. Frequently Nature--to take it first,--has been\nchiefly admired for the richness and variety of its structures. Apart,\nhowever, from what disclosure it contains of the Idea, this richness\ngratifies none of the higher interests of reason, and in its vast\nvariety of structures, organic and inorganic, affords us only the\nspectacle of a contingency losing itself in vagueness. At any rate,\nthe chequered scene presented by the several varieties of animals and\nplants, conditioned as it is by outward circumstances,--the complex\nchanges in the figuration and grouping of clouds, and the like, ought\nnot to be ranked higher than the equally casual fancies of the mind\nwhich surrenders itself to its own caprices. The wonderment with which\nsuch phenomena are welcomed is a most abstract frame of mind, from\nwhich one should advance to a closer insight into the inner harmony and\nuniformity of nature.\nOf contingency in respect of the Will it is especially important to\nform a proper estimate. The Freedom of the Will is an expression that\noften means mere free-choice, or the will in the form of contingency.\nFreedom of choice, or the capacity of determining ourselves towards one\nthing or another, is undoubtedly a vital element in the will (which in\nits very notion is free); but instead of being freedom itself, it is\nonly in the first instance a freedom in form. The genuinely free will,\nwhich includes free choice as suspended, is conscious to itself that\nits content is intrinsically firm and fast, and knows it at the same\ntime to be thoroughly its own. A will, on the contrary, which remains\nstanding on the grade of option, even supposing it does decide in\nfavour of what is in import right and true, is always haunted by the\nconceit that it might, if it had so pleased, have decided in favour of\nthe reverse course. When more narrowly examined, free choice is seen\nto be a contradiction, to this extent that its form and content stand\nin antithesis. The matter of choice is given, and known as a content\ndependent not on the will itself,'but on outward circumstances. In\nreference to such a given content, freedom lies only in the form of\nchoosing, which, as it is only a freedom in form, may consequently be\nregarded as freedom only in supposition. On an ultimate analysis it\nwill be seen that the same outwardness of circumstances, on which is\nfounded the content that the will finds to its hand, can alone account\nfor the will giving its decision for the one and not the other of the\ntwo alternatives.\nAlthough contingency, as it has thus been shown, is only one aspect in\nthe whole of actuality, and therefore not to be mistaken for actuality\nitself, it has no less than the rest of the forms of the idea its due\noffice in the world of objects. This is, in the first place, seen in\nNature. On the surface of Nature, so to speak, Chance ranges unchecked,\nand that contingency must simply be recognised, without the pretension\nsometimes erroneously ascribed to philosophy, of seeking to find in it\na could-only-be-so-and-not-otherwise. Nor is contingency less visible\nin the world of Mind. The will, as we have already remarked, includes\ncontingency under the shape of option or free-choice, but only as a\nvanishing and abrogated element. In respect of Mind and its works,\njust as in the case of Nature, we must guard against being so far\nmisled by a well-meant endeavour after rational knowledge, as to try\nto exhibit the necessity of phenomena which are marked by a decided\ncontingency, or, as the phrase is, to construe them _a priori._ Thus\nin language (although it be, as it were, the body of thought) Chance\nstill unquestionably plays a decided part; and the same is true of the\ncreations of law, of art, &c. The problem of science, and especially of\nphilosophy, undoubtedly consists in eliciting the necessity concealed\nunder the semblance of contingency. That however is far from meaning\nthat the contingent belongs to our subjective conception alone, and\nmust therefore be simply set aside, if we wish to get at the truth.\nAll scientific researches which pursue this tendency exclusively,\nlay themselves fairly open to the charge of mere jugglery and an\nover-strained precisianism.\n146.] When more closely examined, what the aforesaid outward side\nof actuality implies is this. Contingency, which is actuality\nin its immediacy, is the self-identical, essentially only as a\nsupposition which is no sooner made than it is revoked and leaves\nan existent externality. In this way, the external contingency is\nsomething pre-supposed, the immediate existence of which is at the\nsame time a possibility, and has the vocation to be suspended, to\nbe the possibility of something else. Now this possibility is the\nCondition.\nThe Contingent, as the immediate actuality, is at the same time\nthe possibility of somewhat else,--no longer however that abstract\npossibility which we had at first, but the possibility which _is._ And\na possibility existent is a Condition. By the Condition of a thing\nwe mean first, an existence, in short an immediate, and secondly\nthe vocation of this immediate to be suspended and subserve the\nactualising of something else.--Immediate actuality is in general\nas such never what it ought to be; it is a finite actuality with an\ninherent flaw, and its vocation is to be consumed. But the other\naspect of actuality is its essentiality. This is primarily the inside,\nwhich as a mere possibility is no less destined to be suspended.\nPossibility thus suspended is the issuing of a new actuality, of which\nthe first immediate actuality was the pre-supposition. Here we see\nthe alternation which is involved in the notion of a Condition. The\nConditions of a thing seem at first sight to involve no bias anyway.\nReally however an immediate actuality of this kind includes in it\nthe germ of something else altogether. At first this something else\nis only a possibility: but the form of possibility is soon suspended\nand translated into actuality. This new actuality thus issuing is the\nvery inside of the immediate actuality which it uses up. Thus there\ncomes into being quite an other shape of things, and yet itis not an\nother: for the first actuality is only put as what it in essence was.\nThe conditions which are sacrificed, which fall to the ground and are\nspent, only unite with themselves in the other actuality. Such in\ngeneral is the nature of the process of actuality. The actual is no\nmere case of immediate Being, but, as essential Being, a suspension of\nits own immediacy, and thereby mediating itself with itself.\n147.] (\u03b3) When this externality (of actuality) is thus developed into\na circle of the two categories of possibility and immediate actuality,\nshowing the intermediation of the one by the other, it is what is\ncalled Real Possibility. Being such a circle, further, it\nis the totality, and thus the content, the actual fact or affair in\nits all-round definiteness. Whilst in like manner, if we look at the\ndistinction between the two characteristics in this unity, it realises\nthe concrete totality of the form, the immediate self-translation\nof inner into outer, and of outer into inner. This self-movement of\nthe form is Activity, carrying into effect the fact or affair as a\n_real_ ground which is self-suspended to actuality, and carrying into\neffect the contingent actuality, the conditions; _i.e._ it is their\nreflection-in-self, and their self-suspension to an other actuality,\nthe actuality of the actual fact. If all the conditions are at hand,\nthe fact (event) _must_ be actual; and the fact itself is one of the\nconditions: for being in the first place only inner, it is at first\nitself only pre-supposed. Developed actuality, as the coincident\nalternation of inner and outer, the alternation of their opposite\nmotions combined into a single motion, is Necessity.\nNecessity has been defined, and rightly so, as the union of possibility\nand actuality. This mode of expression, however, gives a superficial\nand therefore unintelligible description of the very difficult notion\nof necessity. It is difficult because it is the notion itself, only\nthat its stages or factors are still as actualities, which are yet at\nthe same time to be viewed as forms only, collapsing and transient. In\nthe two following paragraphs therefore an exposition of the factors\nwhich constitute necessity must be given at greater length.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen anything is said to be necessary, the first question we ask is,\nWhy? Anything necessary accordingly comes before us as something due to\na supposition, the result of certain antecedents. If we go no further\nthan mere derivation from antecedents however, we have not gained a\ncomplete notion of what necessity means. What is merely derivative,\nis what it is, not through itself, but through something else; and in\nthis way it too is merely contingent. What is necessary, on the other\nhand, we would have be what it is through itself; and thus, although\nderivative, it must still contain the antecedent whence it is derived\nas a vanishing element in itself. Hence we say of what is necessary,\n'It is.' We thus hold it to be simple self-relation, in which all\ndependence on something else is removed.\nNecessity is often said to be blind. If that means that in the process\nof necessity the End or final cause is not explicitly and overtly\npresent, the statement is correct. The process of necessity begins\nwith the existence of scattered circumstances which appear to have no\ninter-connexion and no concern one with another. These circumstances\nare an immediate actuality which collapses, and out of this negation\na new actuality proceeds. Here we have a content which in point of\nform is doubled, once as content of the final realised fact, and once\nas content of the scattered circumstances which appear as if they\nwere positive, and make themselves at first felt in that character.\nThe latter content is in itself nought and is accordingly inverted\ninto its negative, thus becoming content of the realised fact. The\nimmediate circumstances fall to the ground as conditions, but are at\nthe same time retained as content of the ultimate reality. From such\ncircumstances and conditions there has, as we say, proceeded quite\nanother thing, and it is for that reason that we call this process of\nnecessity blind. If on the contrary we consider teleological action, we\nhave in the end of action a content which is already fore-known. This\nactivity therefore is not blind but seeing. To say that the world is\nruled by Providence implies that design, as what has been absolutely\npre-determined, is the active principle, so that the issue corresponds\nto what has been fore-known and fore-willed.\nThe theory however which regards the world as determined through\nnecessity and the belief in a divine providence are by no means\nmutually excluding points of view. The intellectual principle\nunderlying the idea of divine providence will hereafter be shown to be\nthe notion. But the notion is the truth of necessity, which it contains\nin suspension in itself; just as, conversely, necessity is the notion\nimplicit. Necessity is blind only so long as it is not understood.\nThere is nothing therefore more mistaken than the charge of blind\nfatalism made against the Philosophy of History, when it takes for its\nproblem to understand the necessity of every event. The philosophy of\nhistory rightly understood takes the rank of a Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e; and those,\nwho fancy they honour Divine Providence by excluding necessity from\nit, are really degrading it by this exclusiveness to a blind and\nirrational caprice. In the simple language of the religious mind which\nspeaks of God's eternal and immutable decrees, there is implied an\nexpress recognition that necessity forms part of the essence of God. In\nhis difference from God, man, with his own private opinion and will,\nfollows the call of caprice and arbitrary humour, and thus often finds\nhis acts turn out something quite different from what he had meant and\nwilled. But God knows what He wills, is determined in His eternal will\nneither by accident from within nor from without, and what He wills He\nalso accomplishes, irresistibly.\nNecessity gives a point of view which has important bearings upon our\nsentiments and behaviour. When we look upon events as necessary, our\nsituation seems at first sight to lack freedom completely. In the\ncreed of the ancients, as we know, necessity figured as Destiny. The\nmodern point of view, on the contrary, is that of Consolation. And\nConsolation means that, if we renounce our aims and interests, we do so\nonly in prospect of receiving compensation. Destiny, on the contrary,\nleaves no room for Consolation. But a close examination of the ancient\nfeeling about destiny, will not by any means reveal a sense of bondage\nto its power. Rather the reverse. This will clearly appear, if we\nremember, that the sense of bondage springs from inability to surmount\nthe antithesis, and from looking at what _is,_ and what happens, as\ncontradictory to what _ought_ to be and happen. In the ancient mind the\nfeeling was more of the following kind: Because such a thing is, it\nis, and as it is, so ought it to be. Here there is no contrast to be\nseen, and therefore no sense of bondage, no pain, and no sorrow. True,\nindeed, as already remarked, this attitude towards destiny is void of\nconsolation. But then, on the other hand, it is a frame of mind which\ndoes not need consolation, so long as personal subjectivity has not\nacquired its infinite significance. It is this point on which special\nstress should be laid in comparing the ancient sentiment with that of\nthe modern and Christian world.\nBy Subjectivity, however, we may understand, in the first place, only\nthe natural and finite subjectivity, with its contingent and arbitrary\ncontent of private interests and inclinations,--all, in short, that\nwe call person as distinguished from thing: taking 'thing' in the\nemphatic sense of the word (in which we use the (correct) expression\nthat it is a question of _things_ and not of _persons)._ In this sense\nof sub-activity we cannot help admiring the tranquil resignation of\nthe ancients to destiny, and feeling that it is a much higher and\nworthier mood than that of the moderns, who obstinately pursue their\nsubjective aims, and when they find themselves constrained to resign\nthe hope of reaching them, console themselves with the prospect of a\nreward in some other shape. But the term subjectivity is not to be\nconfined merely to the bad and finite kind of it which is contrasted\nwith the thing (fact). In its truth subjectivity is immanent in the\nfact, and as a subjectivity thus infinite is the very truth of the\nfact. Thus regarded, the doctrine of consolation receives a newer and\na higher significance. It is in this sense that the Christian religion\nis to be regarded as the religion of consolation, and even of absolute\nconsolation. Christianity, we know, teaches that God wishes all men\nto be saved. That teaching declares that subjectivity has an infinite\nvalue. And that consoling power of Christianity just lies in the fact\nthat God Himself is in it known as the absolute subjectivity, so that,\ninasmuch as subjectivity involves the element of particularity, _our_\nparticular personality too is recognised not merely as something to be\nsolely and simply nullified, but as at the same time something to be\npreserved. The gods of the ancient world were also, it is true, looked\nupon as personal; but the personality of a Zeus and an Apollo is not\na real personality: it is only a figure in the mind. In other words,\nthese gods are mere personifications, which, being such, do not know\nthemselves, and are only known. An evidence of this defect and this\npowerlessness of the old gods is found even in the religious beliefs\nof antiquity. In the ancient creeds not only men, but even gods,\nwere represented as subject to destiny (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd or \u03b5\u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7), a\ndestiny which we must conceive as necessity not unveiled, and thus as\nsomething wholly impersonal, selfless, and blind. On the other hand,\nthe Christian God is God not known merely, but also self-knowing; He is\na personality not merely figured in our minds, but rather absolutely\nactual.\nWe must refer to the Philosophy of Religion for a further discussion of\nthe points here touched. But we may note in passing how important it\nis for any man to meet everything that befalls him with the spirit of\nthe old proverb which describes each man as the architect of his own\nfortune. That means that it is only himself after all of which a man\nhas the usufruct. The other way would be to lay the blame of whatever\nwe experience upon other men, upon unfavourable circumstances, and the\nlike. And this is a fresh example of the language of unfreedom, and at\nthe same time the spring of discontent. If man saw, on the contrary,\nthat whatever happens to him is only the outcome of himself, and that\nhe only bears his own guilt, he would stand free, and in everything\nthat came upon him would have the consciousness that he suffered no\nwrong. A man who lives in dispeace with himself and his lot, commits\nmuch that is perverse and amiss, for no other reason than because of\nthe false opinion that he is wronged by others. No doubt too there is a\ngreat deal of chance in what befalls us. But the chance has its root in\nthe 'natural' man. So long however as a man is otherwise conscious that\nhe is free, his harmony of soul and peace of mind will not be destroyed\nby the disagreeables that befall him. It is their view of necessity,\ntherefore, which is at the root of the content and discontent of men,\nand which in that way determines their destiny itself.\n148.] Among the three elements in the process of necessity--the\nCondition, the Fact, and the Activity--\na. The Condition is (\u03b1) what is pre-supposed or ante-stated, _e.g._\nit is not only supposed or stated, and so only a correlative to the\nfact, but also prior, and so independent, a contingent and external\ncircumstance which exists without respect to the fact. While thus\ncontingent, however, this pre-supposed or ante-stated term, in respect\nwithal of the fact, which is the totality, is a complete circle of\nconditions, (\u00df) The conditions are passive, are used as materials for\nthe fact, into the content of which they thus enter. They are likewise\nintrinsically conformable to this content, and already contain its\nwhole characteristic.\nb. The Fact is also (\u03b1) something pre-supposed or ante-stated, _i.e._\nit is at first, and as supposed, only inner and possible, and also,\nbeing prior, an independent content by itself, (\u00df) By using up the\nconditions, it receives its external existence, the realisation of\nthe articles of its content, which reciprocally correspond to the\nconditions, so that whilst it presents itself out of these as the fact,\nit also proceeds from them.\nc. The Activity similarly has (\u03b1) an independent existence of its own\n(as a man, a character), and at the same time it is possible only\nwhere the conditions are and the fact, (\u00df) It is the movement which\ntranslates the conditions into fact, and the latter into the former as\nthe side of existence, or rather the movement which educes the fact\nfrom the conditions in which it is potentially present, and which gives\nexistence to the fact by abolishing the existence possessed by the\nconditions.\nIn so far as these three elements stand to each other in the shape\nof independent existences, this process has the aspect of an outward\nnecessity. Outward necessity has a limited content for its fact. For\nthe fact is this whole, in phase of singleness. But since in its form\nthis whole is external to itself, it is self-externalised even in its\nown self and in its content, and this externality, attaching to the\nfact, is a limit of its content.\n149.] Necessity, then, is potentially the one essence, self-same but\nnow full of content, in the reflected light of which its distinctions\ntake the form of independent realities. This self-sameness is at the\nsame time, as absolute form, the activity which reduces into dependency\nand mediates into immediacy.--Whatever is necessary is through an\nother, which is broken up into the mediating ground (the Fact and\nthe Activity) and an immediate actuality or accidental circumstance,\nwhich is at the same time a Condition. The necessary, being through\nan other, is not in and for itself: hypothetical, it is a mere result\nof assumption. But this intermediation is just as immediately however\nthe abrogation of itself. The ground and contingent condition is\ntranslated into immediacy, by which that dependency is now lifted up\ninto actuality, and the fact has closed with itself. In this return\nto itself the necessary simply and positively _is,_ as unconditioned\nactuality. The necessary is so, mediated through a circle of\ncircumstances: it is so, because the circumstances are so, and at the\nsame time it is so, unmediated: it is so, because it is.\n(a) _Relationship of Substantiality._\n150.] The necessary is in itself an absolute correlation of elements,\n_i.e._ the process developed (in the preceding paragraphs), in which\nthe correlation also suspends itself to absolute identity.\nIn its immediate form it is the relationship of Substance and Accident.\nThe absolute self-identity of this relationship is Substance as such,\nwhich as necessity gives the negative to this form of inwardness, and\nthus invests itself with actuality, but which also gives the negative\nto this outward thing. In this negativity, the actual, as immediate,\nis only an accidental which through this bare possibility passes over\ninto another actuality. This transition is the identity of substance,\nregarded as form-activity (\u00a7\u00a7 148, 149).\n151.] Substance is accordingly the totality of the Accidents,\nrevealing itself in them as their absolute negativity, (that is to\nsay, as absolute power,) and at the same time as the wealth of all\ncontent. This content however is nothing but that very revelation,\nsince the character (being reflected in itself to make content) is\nonly a passing stage of the form which passes away in the power of\nsubstance. Substantiality is the absolute form-activity and the power\nof necessity: all content is but a vanishing element which merely\nbelongs to this process, where there is an absolute revulsion of form\nand content into one another.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn the history of philosophy we meet with Substance as the principle\nof Spinoza's system. On the import and value of that much-praised and\nno less decried philosophy there has been great misunderstanding and\na deal of talking since the days of Spinoza. The atheism and, as a\nfurther charge, the pantheism of the system has formed the commonest\nground of accusation. These cries arise because of Spinoza's conception\nof God as substance, and substance only. What we are to think of this\ncharge follows, in the first instance, from the place which substance\ntakes in the system of the logical idea. Though an essential stage in\nthe evolution of the idea, substance is not the same with absolute\nIdea, but the idea under the still limited form of necessity. It is\ntrue that God is necessity, or, as we may also put it, that He is the\nabsolute Thing: He is however no less the absolute Person. That He is\nthe absolute Person however is a point which the philosophy of Spinoza\nnever reached: and on that side it falls short of the true notion of\nGod which forms the content of religious consciousness in Christianity.\nSpinoza was by descent a Jew; and it is upon the whole the Oriental way\nof seeing things, according to which the nature of the finite world\nseems frail and transient, that has found its intellectual expression\nin his system. This Oriental view of the unity of substance certainly\ngives the basis for all real further development. Still it is not the\nfinal idea. It is marked by the absence of the principle of the Western\nWorld, the principle of individuality, which first appeared under a\nphilosophic shape, contemporaneously with Spinoza, in the Monadology of\nLeibnitz.\nFrom this point we glance back to the alleged atheism of Spinoza. The\ncharge will be seen to be unfounded if we remember that his system,\ninstead of denying God, rather recognises that He alone really is.\nNor can it be maintained that the God of Spinoza, although he is\ndescribed as alone true, is not the true God, and therefore as good as\nno God. If that were a just charge, it would only prove that all other\nsystems, where speculation has not gone beyond a subordinate stage\nof the idea,--that the Jews and Mohammedans who know God only as the\nLord,--and that even the many Christians for whom God is merely the\nmost high, unknowable, and transcendent being, are as much atheists as\nSpinoza. The so-called atheism of Spinoza is merely an exaggeration of\nthe fact that he defrauds the principle of difference or finitude of\nits due. Hence his system, as it holds that there is properly speaking\nno world, at any rate that the world has no positive being, should\nrather be styled Acosmism, These considerations will also show what is\nto be said of the charge of Pantheism. If Pantheism means, as it often\ndoes, the doctrine which takes finite things in their finitude and in\nthe complex of them to be God, we must acquit the system of Spinoza of\nthe crime of Pantheism. For in that system, finite things and the world\nas a whole are denied all truth. On the other hand, the philosophy\nwhich is Acosmism is for that reason certainly pantheistic.\nThe shortcoming thus acknowledged to attach to the content turns out\nat the same time to be a shortcoming in respect of form. Spinoza puts\nsubstance at the head of his system, and defines it to be the unity\nof thought and extension, without demonstrating how he gets to this\ndistinction, or how he traces it back to the unity of substance. The\nfurther treatment of the subject proceeds in what is called the\nmathematical method. Definitions and axioms are first laid down: after\nthem comes a series of theorems, which are proved by an analytical\nreduction of them to these unproved postulates. Although the system\nof Spinoza, and that even by those who altogether reject its contents\nand results, is praised for the strict sequence of its method, such\nunqualified praise of the form is as little justified as an unqualified\nrejection of the content. The defect of the content is that the form\nis not known as immanent in it, and therefore only approaches it as an\nouter and subjective form. As intuitively accepted by Spinoza without a\nprevious mediation by dialectic, Substance, as the universal negative\npower, is as it were a dark shapeless abyss which engulfs all definite\ncontent as radically null, and produces from itself nothing that has a\npositive subsistence of its own.\n152.] At the stage, where substance, as absolute power, is the\nself-relating power (itself a merely inner possibility) which thus\ndetermines itself to accidentality,--from which power the externality\nit thereby creates is distinguished--necessity is a correlation\nstrictly so called, just as in the first form of necessity, it is\nsubstance. This is the correlation of Causality.\n(b) _Relationship of Causality._\n153.] Substance is Cause, in so far as substance reflects into\nself as against its passage into accidentality and so stands as the\n_primary_ fact, but again no less suspends this reflection-into-self\n(its bare possibility), lays itself down as the negative of itself, and\nthus produces an Effect, an actuality, which, though so far only\nassumed as a sequence, is through the process that effectuates it at\nthe same time necessary.\nAs primary fact, the cause is qualified as having absolute independence\nand a subsistence maintained in face of the effect: but in the\nnecessity, whose identity constitutes that primariness itself, it\nis wholly passed into the effect. So far again as we can speak of a\ndefinite content, there is no content in the effect that is not in\nthe cause. That identity in fact is the absolute content itself: but\nit is no less also the form-characteristic. The primariness of the\ncause is suspended in the effect in which the cause makes itself a\ndependent being. The cause however does not for that reason vanish and\nleave the effect to be alone actual. For this dependency is in like\nmanner directly suspended, and is rather the reflection of the cause\nin itself, its primariness: in short, it is in the effect that the\ncause first becomes actual and a cause. The cause consequently is in\nits full truth _causa sui._--Jacobi, sticking to the partial conception\nof mediation (in his Letters on Spinoza, second edit. p. 416), has\ntreated the _causa sui_ (and the _effectus sui_ is the same), which is\nthe absolute truth of the cause, as a mere formalism. He has also made\nthe remark that God ought to be defined not as the ground of things,\nbut essentially as cause. A more thorough consideration of the nature\nof cause would have shown that Jacobi did not by this means gain what\nhe intended. Even in the finite cause and its conception we can see\nthis identity between cause and effect in point of content. The rain\n(the cause) and the wet (the effect) are the self-same existing water.\nIn point of form the cause (rain) is dissipated or lost in the effect\n(wet): but in that case the result can no longer be described as\neffect; for without the cause it is nothing, and we should have only\nthe unrelated wet left.\nIn the common acceptation of the causal relation the cause is finite,\nto such extent as its content is so (as is also the case with finite\nsubstance), and so far as cause and effect are conceived as two several\nindependent existences; which they are, however, only when we leave\nthe causal relation out of sight. In the finite sphere we never get\nover the difference of the form-characteristics in their relation: and\nhence we turn the matter round and define the cause also as something\ndependent or as an effect. This again has another cause, and thus there\ngrows up a progress from effects to causes _ad infinitum._ There is a\ndescending progress too: the effect, looked at in its identity with the\ncause, is itself defined as a cause, and at the same time as another\ncause, which again has other effects, and so on for ever.\nThe way understanding bristles up against the idea of substance is\nequalled by its readiness to use the relation of cause and effect.\nWhenever it is proposed to view any sum of fact as necessary, it\nis especially the relation of causality to which the reflective\nunderstanding makes a point of tracing it back. Now, although this\nrelation does undoubtedly belong to necessity, it forms only one aspect\nin the process of that category. That process equally requires the\nsuspension of the mediation involved in causality and the exhibition\nof it as simple self-relation. If we stick to causality as such, we\nhave it not in its truth. Such a causality is merely finite, and its\nfinitude lies in retaining the distinction between cause and effect\nunassimilated. But these two terms, if they are distinct, are also\nidentical. Even in ordinary consciousness that identity may be found.\nWe say that a cause is a cause, only when it has an effect, and _vice\nvers\u00e2._ Both cause and effect are thus one and the same content: and\nthe distinction between them is primarily only that the one lays down,\nand the other is laid down. This formal difference however again\nsuspends itself, because the cause is not only a cause of something\nelse, but also a cause of itself; while the effect is not only an\neffect of something else, but also an effect of itself. The finitude\nof things consists accordingly in this. While cause and effect are in\ntheir notion identical, the two forms present themselves severed so\nthat, though the cause is also an effect, and the effect also a cause,\nthe cause is not an effect in the same connexion as it is a cause, nor\nthe effect a cause in the same connexion as it is an effect. This\nagain gives the infinite progress, in the shape of an endless series\nof causes, which shows itself at the same time as an endless series of\neffects.\n154.] The effect is different from the cause. The former as such has\na being dependent on the latter. But such a dependence is likewise\nreflection-into-self and immediacy: and the action of the cause, as it\nconstitutes the effect, is at the same time the pre-constitution of\nthe effect, so long as effect is kept separate from cause. There is\nthus already in existence another substance on which the effect takes\nplace. As immediate, this substance is not a self-related negativity\nand _active,_ but _passive._ Yet it is a substance, and it is therefore\nactive also: it therefore suspends the immediacy it was originally put\nforward with, and the effect which was put into it: it reacts, _e.g._\nsuspends the activity of the first substance. But this first substance\nalso in the same way sets aside its own immediacy, or the effect which\nis put into it; it thus suspends the activity of the other substance\nand reacts. In this manner causality passes into the relation of\nAction and Reaction, or Reciprocity.\nIn Reciprocity, although causality is not yet invested with its true\ncharacteristic, the rectilinear movement out from causes to effects,\nand from effects to causes, is bent round and back into itself, and\nthus the progress _ad infinitum_ of causes and effects is, as a\nprogress, really and truly suspended. This bend, which transforms, the\ninfinite progression into a self-contained relationship, is here as\nalways the plain reflection that in the above meaningless repetition\nthere is only one and the same thing, viz. one cause and another, and\ntheir connexion with one another. Reciprocity--which is the development\nof this relation-itself however only distinguishes turn and turn\nabout (--not causes, but) factors of causation, in each of which--just\nbecause they are inseparable (on the principle of the identity that the\ncause is cause in the effect, and _vice vers\u00e2_)--the other factor is\nalso equally supposed.\n(c) _Reciprocity or Action and Reaction._\n155.] The characteristics which in Reciprocal Action are retained as\ndistinct are (\u03b1) potentially the same. The one side is a cause, is\nprimary, active, passive, &c, just as the other is. Similarly the\npre-supposition of another side and the action upon it, the immediate\nprimariness and the dependence produced by the alternation, are one and\nthe same on both sides. The cause assumed to be first is on account\nof its immediacy passive, a dependent being, and an effect. The\ndistinction of the causes spoken of as two is accordingly void: and\nproperly speaking there is only one cause, which, while it suspends\nitself (as substance) in its effect, also rises in this operation only\nto independent existence as a cause.\n156.] But this unity of the double cause is also (\u03b2) actual. All this\nalternation is properly the cause in act of constituting itself and in\nsuch constitution lies its being. The nullity of the distinctions is\nnot only potential, or a reflection of ours (\u00a7 155). Reciprocal action\njust means that each characteristic we impose is also to be suspended\nand inverted into its opposite, and that in this way the essential\nnullity of the 'moments' is explicitly stated. An effect is introduced\ninto the primariness; in other words, the primariness is abolished: the\naction of a cause becomes reaction, and so on.\nReciprocal action realises the causal relation in its complete\ndevelopment. It is this relation, therefore, in which reflection\nusually takes shelter when the conviction grows that things can no\nlonger be studied satisfactorily from a causal point of view, on\naccount of the infinite progress already spoken of. Thus in historical\nresearch the question may be raised in a first form, whether the\ncharacter and manners of a nation are the cause of its constitution and\nits laws, or if they are not rather the effect. Then, as the second\nstep, the character and manners on one side and the constitution and\nlaws on the other are conceived on the principle of reciprocity: and\nin that case the cause in the same connexion as it is a cause will at\nthe same time be an effect, and _vice vers\u00e2._ The same thing is done\nin the study of Nature, and especially of living organisms. There\nthe several organs and functions are similarly seen to stand to each\nother in the relation of reciprocity. Reciprocity is undoubtedly the\nproximate truth of the relation of cause and effect, and stands, so\nto say, on the threshold of the notion; but on that very ground,\nsupposing that our aim is a thoroughly comprehensive idea, we should\nnot rest content with applying this relation. If we get no further than\nstudying a given content under the point of view of reciprocity, we are\ntaking up an attitude which leaves matters utterly incomprehensible.\nWe are left with a mere dry fact; and the call for mediation, which\nis the chief motive in applying the relation of causality, is still\nunanswered. And it we look more narrowly into the dissatisfaction\nfelt in applying the relation of reciprocity, we shall see that it\nconsists in the circumstance, that this relation, instead of being\ntreated as an equivalent for the notion, ought, first of all, to be\nknown and understood in its own nature. And to understand the relation\nof action and reaction we must not let the two sides rest in their\nstate of mere given facts, but recognise them, as has been shown in\nthe two paragraphs preceding, for factors of a third and higher, which\nis the notion and nothing else. To make, for example, the manners of\nthe Spartans the cause of their constitution and their constitution\nconversely the cause of their manners, may no doubt be in a way\ncorrect. But, as we have comprehended neither the manners nor the\nconstitution of the nation, the result of such reflections can never\nbe final or satisfactory. The satisfactory point will be reached only\nwhen these two, as well as all other, special aspects of Spartan life\nand Spartan history are seen to be founded in this notion.\n157.] This pure self-reciprocation is therefore Necessity unveiled\nor realised. The link of necessity _qu\u00e2_ necessity is identity, as\nstill inward and concealed, because it is the identity of what are\nesteemed actual things, although their very self-subsistence is bound\nto be necessity. The circulation of substance through causality\nand reciprocity therefore only expressly makes out or states that\nself-subsistence is the infinite negative self-relation--a relation\n_negative,_ in general, for in it the act of distinguishing and\nintermediating becomes a primariness of actual things independent\none against the other,--and _infinite self-relation,_ because their\nindependence only lies in their identity.\n158.] This truth of necessity, therefore, is _Freedom:_ and the\ntruth of substance is the Notion,--an independence which, though\nself-repulsive into distinct independent elements, yet in that\nrepulsion is self-identical, and in the movement of reciprocity still\nat home and conversant only with itself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nNecessity is often called hard, and rightly so, if we keep only to\nnecessity as such, _i.e._ to its immediate shape. Here we have,\nfirst of all, some state or, generally speaking, fact, possessing an\nindependent subsistence: and necessity primarily implies that there\nfalls upon such a fact something else by which it is brought low.\nThis is what is hard and sad in necessity immediate or abstract. The\nidentity of the two things, which necessity presents as bound to each\nother and thus bereft of their independence, is at first only inward,\nand therefore has no existence for those under the yoke of necessity.\nFreedom too from this point of view is only abstract, and is preserved\nonly by renouncing all that we immediately are and have. But, as we\nhave seen already, the process of necessity is so directed that it\novercomes the rigid externality which it first had and reveals its\ninward nature. It then appears that the members, linked to one another,\nare not really foreign to each other, but only elements of one whole,\neach of them, in its connexion with the other, being, as it were, at\nhome, and combining with itself. In this way necessity is transfigured\ninto freedom,--not the freedom that consists in abstract negation,\nbut freedom concrete and positive. From which we may learn what a\nmistake it is to regard freedom and necessity as mutually exclusive.\nNecessity indeed _qu\u00e2_ necessity is far from being freedom: yet\nfreedom pre-supposes necessity, and contains it as an unsubstantial\nelement in itself. A good man is aware that the tenor of his conduct\nis essentially obligatory and necessary. But this consciousness is\nso far from making any abatement from his freedom, that without it\nreal and reasonable freedom could not be distinguished from arbitrary\nchoice,--a freedom which has no reality and is merely potential. A\ncriminal, when punished, may look upon his punishment as a restriction\nof his freedom. Really the punishment is not foreign constraint to\nwhich he is subjected, but the manifestation of his own act: and if he\nrecognises this, he comports himself as a free man. In short, man is\nmost independent when he knows himself to be determined by the absolute\nidea throughout. It was this phase of mind and conduct which Spinoza\ncalled _Amor intellectualis Dei._\n159.] Thus the Notion is the truth of Being and Essence, inasmuch as\nthe shining or show of self-reflection is itself at the same time\nindependent immediacy, and this being of a different actuality is\nimmediately only a shining or show on itself.\nThe Notion has exhibited itself as the truth of Being and Essence, as\nthe ground to which the regress of both leads. Conversely it has been\ndeveloped out of being as its ground. The former aspect of the advance\nmay be regarded as a concentration of being into its depth, thereby\ndisclosing its inner nature: the latter aspect as an issuing of the\nmore perfect from the less perfect. When such development is viewed on\nthe latter side only, it does prejudice to the method of philosophy.\nThe special meaning which these superficial thoughts of more imperfect\nand more perfect have in this place is to indicate the distinction of\nbeing, as an immediate unity with itself, from the notion, as free\nmediation with itself. Since being has shown that it is an element in\nthe notion, the latter has thus exhibited itself as the truth of being.\nAs this its reflection in itself and as an absorption of the mediation,\nthe notion is the pre-supposition of the immediate--a pre-supposition\nwhich is identical with the return to self; and in this identity lie\nfreedom and the notion. If the partial element therefore be called the\nimperfect, then the notion, or the perfect, is certainly a development\nfrom the imperfect; since its very nature is thus to suspend its\npre-supposition. At the same time it is the notion alone which, in the\nact of supposing itself, makes its pre-supposition; as has been made\napparent in causality in general and especially in reciprocal action.\nThus in reference to Being and Essence the Notion is defined as Essence\nreverted to the simple immediacy of Being,--the shining or show of\nEssence thereby having actuality, and its actuality being at the same\ntime a free shining or show in itself. In this manner the notion has\nbeing as its simple self-relation, or as the immediacy of its immanent\nunity. Being is so poor a category that it is the least thing which can\nbe shown to be found in the notion.\nThe passage from necessity to freedom, or from actuality into the\nnotion, is the very hardest, because it proposes that independent\nactuality shall be thought as having all its substantiality in the\npassing over and identity with the other independent actuality. The\nnotion, too, is extremely hard, because it is itself just this very\nidentity. But the actual substance as such, the cause, which in its\nexclusiveness resists all invasion, is _ipso facto_ subjected to\nnecessity or the destiny of passing into dependency: and it is this\nsubjection rather where the chief hardness lies. To think necessity, on\nthe contrary, rather tends to melt that hardness. For thinking means\nthat, in the other, one meets with one's self.--It means a liberation,\nwhich is not the flight of abstraction, but consists in that which is\nactual having itself not as something else, but as its own being and\ncreation, in the other actuality with which it is bound up by the force\nof necessity. As existing in an individual form, this liberation is\ncalled I: as developed to its totality, it is free Spirit; as feeling,\nit is Love; and as enjoyment, it is Blessedness.--The great vision\nof substance in Spinoza is only a potential liberation from finite\nexclusiveness and egoism: but the notion itself realises for its own\nboth the power of necessity and actual freedom.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen, as now, the notion is called the truth of Being and Essence,\nwe must expect to be asked, why we do not begin with the notion? The\nanswer is that, where knowledge by thought is our aim, we cannot begin\nwith the truth, because the truth, when it forms the beginning, must\nrest on mere assertion. The truth when it is thought must as such\nverify itself to thought. If the notion were put at the head of Logic,\nand defined, quite correctly in point of content, as the unity of\nBeing and Essence, the following question would come up: What are we\nto think under the terms 'Being' and 'Essence,' and how do they come\nto be embraced in the unity of the Notion? But if we answered these\nquestions, then our beginning with the notion would be merely nominal.\nThe real start would be made with Being, as we have here done: with\nthis difference, that the characteristics of Being as well as those\nof Essence would have to be accepted uncritically from figurate\nconception, whereas we have observed Being and Essence in their own\ndialectical development and learnt how they lose themselves in the\nunity of the notion.\n[1] Compare Goethe's indignant outcry--'To Natural Science,' vol. i.\npt. 3:\nDas h\u00f6r' ich sechzig Jahre wiederholen,\nUnd fluche drauf, aber verstohlen,--\nNatur hat weder Kern noch Schaale,\nAlles ist sie mit einem Male.\nCHAPTER IX.\nTHIRD SUB-DIVISION OF LOGIC.\nTHE DOCTRINE OF THE NOTION.\n160.] The Notion is the principle of freedom, the power of\nsubstance self-realised. It is a systematic whole, in which each of its\nconstituent functions is the very total which the notion is, and is put\nas indissolubly one with it. Thus in its self-identity it has original\nand complete determinateness.\nThe position taken up by the notion is that of absolute idealism.\nPhilosophy is a knowledge through notions because it sees that what\non other grades of consciousness is taken to have Being, and to be\nnaturally or immediately independent, is but a constituent stage in the\nIdea. In the logic of understanding, the notion is generally reckoned\na mere form of thought, and treated as a general conception. It is to\nthis inferior view of the notion that the assertion refers, so often\nurged on behalf of the heart and sentiment, that notions as such are\nsomething dead, empty, and abstract. The case is really quite the\nreverse. The notion is, on the contrary, the principle of all life, and\nthus possesses at the same time a character of thorough concreteness.\nThat it is so follows from the whole logical movement up to this point,\nand need not be here proved. The contrast between form and content,\nwhich is thus used to criticise the notion when it is alleged to be\nmerely formal, has, like all the other contrasts upheld by reflection,\nbeen already left behind and overcome dialectically or through itself.\nThe notion, in short, is what contains all the earlier categories of\nthought merged in it. It certainly is a form, but an infinite and\ncreative form, which includes, but at the same time releases from\nitself, the fulness of all content. And so too the notion may, if it\nbe wished, be styled abstract, if the name concrete is restricted to\nthe concrete facts of sense or of immediate perception. For the notion\nis not palpable to the touch, and when we are engaged with it, hearing\nand seeing must quite fail us. And yet, as it was before remarked, the\nnotion is a true concrete; for the reason that it involves Being and\nEssence, and the total wealth of these two spheres with them, merged in\nthe unity of thought.\nIf, as was said at an earlier point, the different stages of the\nlogical idea are to be treated as a series of definitions of the\nAbsolute, the definition which now results for us is that the Absolute\nis the Notion. That necessitates a higher estimate of the notion,\nhowever, than is found in formal conceptualist Logic, where the notion\nis a mere form of our subjective thought, with no original content of\nits own. But if Speculative Logic thus attaches a meaning to the term\nnotion so very different from that usually given, it may be asked why\nthe same word should be employed in two contrary acceptations, and an\noccasion thus given for confusion and misconception. The answer is\nthat, great as the interval is between the speculative notion and the\nnotion of Formal Logic, a closer examination shows that the deeper\nmeaning is not so foreign to the general usages of language as it\nseems at first sight. We speak of the deduction of a content from the\nnotion, _e.g._ of the specific provisions of the law of property from\nthe notion of property; and so again we speak of tracing back these\nmaterial details to the notion. We thus recognise that the notion is no\nmere form without a content of its own: for if it were, there would be\nin the one case nothing to deduce from such a form, and in the other\ncase to trace a given body of fact back to the empty form of the notion\nwould only rob the fact of its specific character, without making it\nunderstood.\n161.] The onward movement of the notion is no longer either\na transition into, or a reflection on something else, but\nDevelopment. For in the notion, the elements distinguished are\nwithout more ado at the same time declared to be identical with one\nanother and with the whole, and the specific character of each is a\nfree being of the whole notion.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTransition into something else is the dialectical process within the\nrange of Being: reflection (bringing something else into light), in\nthe range of Essence. The movement of the Notion is _development_: by\nwhich that only is explicit which is already implicitly present. In\nthe world of nature it is organic life that corresponds to the grade\nof the notion. Thus _e.g._ the plant is developed from its germ. The\ngerm virtually involves the whole plant, but does so only ideally or in\nthought: and it would therefore be a mistake to regard the development\nof the root, stem, leaves, and other different parts of the plant, as\nmeaning that they were _realiter_ present, but in a very minute form,\nin the germ. That is the so-called 'box-within-box' hypothesis; a\ntheory which commits the mistake of supposing an actual existence of\nwhat is at first found only as a postulate of the completed thought.\nThe truth of the hypothesis on the other hand lies in its perceiving\nthat in the process of development the notion keeps to itself and\nonly gives rise to alteration of form, without making any addition in\npoint of content. It is this nature of the notion--this manifestation\nof itself in its process as a development of its own self,--which is\nchiefly in view with those who speak of innate ideas, or who, like\nPlato, describe all learning merely as reminiscence. Of course that\nagain does not mean that everything which is embodied in a mind, after\nthat mind has been formed by instruction, had been present in that mind\nbeforehand, in its definitely expanded shape.\nThe movement of the notion is as it were to be looked upon merely as\nplay: the other which it sets up is in reality not an other. Or, as\nit is expressed in the teaching of Christianity: not merely has God\ncreated a world which confronts Him as an other; He has also from all\neternity begotten a Son in whom He, a Spirit, is at home with Himself.\n162.] The doctrine of the notion is divided into three parts. (1) The\nfirst is the doctrine of the Subjective or Formal Notion.\n(2) The second is the doctrine of the notion invested with the\ncharacter of immediacy, or of Objectivity. (3) The third is the\ndoctrine of the Idea, the subject-object, the unity of notion\nand objectivity, the absolute truth.\nThe Common Logic covers only the matters which come before us here\nas a portion of the third part of the whole system, together with\nthe so-called Laws of Thought, which we have already met; and in the\nApplied Logic it adds a little about cognition. This is combined with\npsychological, metaphysical, and all sorts of empirical materials,\nwhich were introduced because, when all was done, those forms of\nthought could not be made to do all that was required of them. But\nwith these additions the science lost its unity of aim. Then there was\na further circumstance against the Common Logic. Those forms, which\nat least do belong to the proper domain of Logic, are supposed to be\ncategories of conscious thought only, of thought too in the character\nof understanding, not of reason.\nThe preceding logical categories, those viz. of Being and Essence, are,\nit is true, no mere logical modes or entities: they are proved to be\nnotions in their transition or their dialectical element, and in their\nreturn into themselves and totality. But they are only in a modified\nform notions (cp. \u00a7\u00a7 84 and 112), notions rudimentary, or, what is\nthe same thing, notions for us. The antithetical term into which each\ncategory passes, or in which it shines, so producing correlation, is\nnot characterised as a particular. The third, in which they return\nto unity, is not characterised as a subject or an individual: nor is\nthere any explicit statement that the category: is identical in its\nantithesis,--in other words, its freedom is not expressly stated: and\nall this because the category is not universality.--What generally\npasses current under the name of a notion is a mode of understanding,\nor, even, a mere general representation, and therefore, in short, a\nfinite mode of thought (cp. \u00a7 62).\nThe Logic of the Notion is usually treated as a science of form only,\nand understood to deal with the form of notion, judgment, and syllogism\nas form, without in the least touching the question whether anything\nis true. The answer to that question is supposed to depend on the\ncontent only. If the logical forms of the notion were really dead and\ninert receptacles of conceptions and thoughts, careless of what they\ncontained, knowledge about them would be an idle curiosity which the\ntruth might dispense with. On the contrary they really are, as forms\nof the notion, the vital spirit of the actual world. That only is\ntrue of the actual which is true in virtue of these forms, through\nthem and in them. As yet, however, the truth of these forms has never\nbeen considered or examined on their own account any more than their\nnecessary interconnexion.\nA.--THE SUBJECTIVE NOTION.\n(a) _The Notion as Notion._\n163.] The Notion as Notion contains the three following 'moments' or\nfunctional parts. (1) The first is _Universality_--meaning that it\nis in free equality with itself in its specific character. (2) The\nsecond is Particularity--that is, the specific character, in\nwhich the universal continues serenely equal to itself. (3) The third\nis Individuality--meaning the reflection-into-self of the\nspecific characters of universality and particularity;--which negative\nself-unity has complete and original determinateness, without any loss\nto its self-identity or universality.\nIndividual and actual are the same thing: only the former has issued\nfrom the notion, and is thus, as a universal, stated expressly as a\nnegative identity with itself. The actual, because it is at first no\nmore than a potential or immediate unity of essence and existence,\n_may_ possibly have effect: but the individuality of the notion is\nthe very source of effectiveness, effective moreover no longer as the\ncause is, with a show of effecting something else, but effective of\nitself.--Individuality, however, is not to be understood to mean the\nimmediate or natural individual, as when we speak of individual things\nor individual men: for that special phase of individuality does not\nappear till we come to the judgment. Every function and 'moment' of\nthe notion is itself the whole notion (\u00a7 160); but the individual or\nsubject is the notion expressly put as a totality.\n(1) The notion is generally associated in our minds with abstract\ngenerality, and on that account it is often described as a general\nconception. We speak, accordingly, of the notions of colour, plant,\nanimal, &c. They are supposed to be arrived at by neglecting the\nparticular features which distinguish the different colours, plants,\nand animals from each other, and by retaining those common to them all.\nThis is the aspect of the notion which is familiar to understanding;\nand feeling is in the right when it stigmatises such hollow and empty\nnotions as mere phantoms and shadows. But the universal of the notion\nis not a mere sum of features common to several things, confronted\nby a particular which enjoys an existence of its own. It is, on the\ncontrary, self-particularising or self-specifying, and with undimmed\nclearness finds itself at home in its antithesis. For the sake both of\ncognition and of our practical conduct, it is of the utmost importance\nthat the real universal should not be confused with what is merely held\nin common. All those charges which the devotees of feeling make against\nthought, and especially against philosophic thought, and the reiterated\nstatement that it is dangerous to carry thought to what they call too\ngreat lengths, originate in the confusion of these two things.\nThe universal in its true and comprehensive meaning is a thought\nwhich, as we know, cost thousands of years to make it enter into the\nconsciousness of men. The thought did not gain its full recognition\ntill the days of Christianity. The Greeks, in other respects so\nadvanced, knew neither God nor even man in their true universality.\nThe gods of the Greeks were only particular powers of the mind; and\nthe universal God, the God of all nations, was to the Athenians still\na God concealed. They believed in the same way that an absolute gulf\nseparated themselves from the barbarians. Man as man was not then\nrecognised to be of infinite worth and to have infinite rights.\nThe question has been asked, why slavery has vanished from modern\nEurope. One special circumstance after another has been adduced in\nexplanation of this phenomenon. But the real ground why there are\nno more slaves in Christian Europe is only to be found in the very\nprinciple of Christianity itself, the religion of absolute freedom.\nOnly in Christendom is man respected as man, in his infinitude and\nuniversality. What the slave is without, is the recognition that he is\na person: and the principle of personality is universality. The master\nlooks upon his slave not as a person, but as a selfless thing. The\nslave is not himself reckoned an 'I';--his 'I' is his master.\nThe distinction referred to above between what is merely in common, and\nwhat is truly universal, is strikingly expressed by Rousseau in his\nfamous 'Contrat Social,' when he says that the laws of a state must\nspring from the universal will (_volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale,_) but need not on\nthat account be the will of all (_volont\u00e9 de tous._) Rousseau would\nhave made a sounder contribution towards a theory of the state, if he\nhad always keep this distinction in sight. The general will is the\nnotion of the will: and the laws are the special clauses of this will\nand based upon the notion of it.\n(2) We add a remark upon the account of the origin and formation of\nnotions which is usually given in the Logic of Understanding. It is\nnot _we_ who frame the notions. The notion is not something which\nis originated at all. No doubt the notion is not mere Being, or the\nimmediate: it involves mediation, but the mediation lies in itself. In\nother words, the notion is what is mediated through itself and with\nitself. It is a mistake to imagine that the objects which form the\ncontent of our mental ideas come first and that our subjective agency\nthen supervenes, and by the aforesaid operation of abstraction, and\nby colligating the points possessed in common by the objects, frames\nnotions of them. Rather the notion is the genuine first; and things\nare what they are through the action of the notion, immanent in them,\nand revealing itself in them. In religious language we express this\nby saying that God created the world out of nothing. In other words,\nthe world and finite things have issued from the fulness of the divine\nthoughts and the divine decrees. Thus religion recognises thought and\n(more exactly) the notion to be the infinite form, or the free creative\nactivity, which can realise itself without the help of a matter that\nexists outside it.\n164.] The notion is concrete out and out: because the negative\nunity with itself, as characterisation pure and entire, which is\nindividuality, is just what constitutes its self-relation, its\nuniversality. The functions or 'moments' of the notion are to this\nextent indissoluble. The categories of 'reflection' are expected to be\nseverally apprehended and separately accepted as current, apart from\ntheir opposites. But in the notion, where their identity is expressly\nassumed, each of its functions can be immediately apprehended only from\nand with the rest.\nUniversality, particularity, and individuality are, taken in the\nabstract, the same as identity, difference, and ground. But the\nuniversal is the self-identical, with the express qualification,\nthat it simultaneously contains the particular and the individual.\nAgain, the particular is the different or the specific character, but\nwith the qualification that it is in itself universal and is as an\nindividual. Similarly the individual must be understood to be a subject\nor substratum, which involves the genus and species in itself and\npossesses a substantial existence. Such is the explicit or realised\ninseparability of the functions of the notion in their difference (\u00a7\n160)--what may be called the clearness of the notion, in which each\ndistinction causes no dimness or interruption, but is quite as much\ntransparent.\nNo complaint is oftener made against the notion than that it is\n_abstract._ Of course it is abstract, if abstract means that the medium\nin which the notion exists is thought in general and not the sensible\nthing in its empirical concreteness. It is abstract also, because the\nnotion falls short of the idea. To this extent the subjective notion\nis still formal. This however does not mean that it ought to have\nor receive another content than its own. It is itself the absolute\nform, and so is all specific character, but as that character is in\nits truth. Although it be abstract therefore, it is the concrete,\nconcrete altogether, the subject as such. The absolutely concrete is\nthe mind (see end of \u00a7 159)--the notion when it _exists_ as notion\ndistinguishing itself from its objectivity, which notwithstanding the\ndistinction still continues to be its own. Everything else which is\nconcrete, however rich it be, is not so intensely identical with itself\nand therefore not so concrete on its own part,--least of all what is\ncommonly supposed to be concrete, but is only a congeries held together\nby external influence.--What are called notions, and in fact specific\nnotions, such as man, house, animal, &c, are simply denotations\nand abstract representations. These abstractions retain out of all\nthe functions of the notion only that of universality; they leave\nparticularity and individuality out of account and have no development\nin these directions. By so doing they just miss the notion.\n165.] It is the element of Individuality which first explicitly\ndifferentiates the elements of the notion. Individuality is the\nnegative reflection of the notion into itself, and it is in that way at\nfirst the free differentiating of it as the first negation, by which\nthe specific character of the notion is realised, but under the form\nof particularity. That is to say, the different elements are in the\nfirst place only qualified as the several elements of the notion, and,\nsecondly, their identity is no less explicitly stated, the one being\nsaid to be the other. This realised particularity of the notion is the\nJudgment.\nThe ordinary classification of notions, as _clear, distinct_ and\n_adequate,_ is no part of the notion; it belongs to psychology.\nNotions, in fact, are here synonymous with mental representations;\na _clear_ notion is an abstract simple representation: a _distinct_\nnotion is one where, in addition to the simplicity, there is one 'mark'\nor character emphasised as a sign for subjective cognition. There is\nno more striking mark of the formalism and decay of Logic than the\nfavourite category of the 'mark.' The _adequate_ notion comes nearer\nthe notion proper, or even the Idea: but after all it expresses only\nthe formal circumstance that a notion or representation agrees with its\nobject, that is, with an external thing.--The division into what are\ncalled _subordinate_ and _co-ordinate_ notions implies a mechanical\ndistinction of universal from particular which allows only a mere\ncorrelation of them in external comparison. Again, an enumeration\nof such kinds as _contrary_ and _contradictory, affirmative_ and\n_negative_ notions, &c, is only a chance-directed gleaning of logical\nforms which properly belong to the sphere of Being or Essence, (where\nthey have been already examined,) and which have nothing to do with\nthe specific notional character as such. The true distinctions in the\nnotion, universal, particular, and individual, may be said also to\nconstitute species of it, but only when they are kept severed from\neach other by external reflection. The immanent differentiating and\nspecifying of the notion come to sight in the judgment: for to judge is\nto specify the notion.\n(b) _The Judgment._\n166.] The Judgment is the notion in its particularity, as a\nconnexion which is also a distinguishing of its functions, which are\nput as independent and yet as identical with themselves, not with one\nanother.\nOne's first impression about the Judgment is the independence of the\ntwo extremes, the subject and the predicate. The former we take to be\na thing or term _per se,_ and the predicate a general term outside\nthe said subject and somewhere in our heads. The next point is for us\nto bring the latter into combination with the former, and in this way\nframe a Judgment. The copula 'is' however enunciates the predicate _of_\nthe subject, and so that external subjective subsumption is again put\nin abeyance, and the Judgment taken as a determination of the object\nitself.--The etymological meaning of the Judgment (_Urtheil_) in\nGerman goes deeper, as it were declaring the unity of the notion to be\nprimary, and its distinction to be the original partition. And that is\nwhat the Judgment really is.\nIn its abstract terms a Judgment is expressible in the proposition:\n'The individual is the universal.' These are the terms under which\nthe subject and the predicate first confront each other, when the\nfunctions of the notion are taken in their immediate character or\nfirst abstraction. [Propositions such as, 'The particular is the\nuniversal,' and 'The individual is the particular,' belong to the\nfurther specialisation of the judgment.] It shows a strange want\nof observation in the logic-books, that in none of them is the fact\nstated, that in _every_ judgment there is such a statement made, as,\nThe individual is the universal, or still more definitely, The subject\nis the predicate: (_e.g._ God is absolute spirit). No doubt there is\nalso a distinction between terms like individual and universal, subject\nand predicate: but it is none the less the universal fact, that every\njudgment states them to be identical.\nThe copula 'is' springs from the nature of the notion, to be\nself-identical even in parting with its own. The individual and\nuniversal are _its_ constituents, and therefore characters which\ncannot be isolated. The earlier categories (of reflection) in their\ncorrelations also refer to one another: but their interconnexion is\nonly 'having' and not 'being,' _i.e._ it is not the identity which is\nrealised as identity or universality. In the judgment, therefore, for\nthe first time there is seen the genuine particularity of the notion:\nfor it is the speciality or distinguishing of the latter, without\nthereby losing universality.\n*       *       *       *       *\nJudgments are generally looked upon as combinations of notions, and,\nbe it added, of heterogeneous notions. This theory of judgment is\ncorrect, so far as it implies that it is the notion which forms the\npresupposition of the judgment, and which in the judgment comes up\nunder the form of difference. But on the other hand, it is false to\nspeak of notions differing in kind. The notion, although concrete,\nis still as a notion essentially one, and the functions which it\ncontains are not different kinds of it. It is equally false to speak\nof a combination of the two sides in the judgment, if we understand\nthe term 'combination' to imply the independent existence of the\ncombining members apart from the combination. The same external view\nof their nature is more forcibly apparent when judgments are described\nas produced by the ascription of a predicate to the subject. Language\nlike this looks upon the subject as self-subsistent outside, and the\npredicate as found somewhere in our head. Such a conception of the\nrelation between subject and predicate however is at once contradicted\nby the copula 'is.' By saying 'This rose is red,' or 'This picture\nis beautiful,' we declare, that it is not we who from outside attach\nbeauty to the picture or redness to the rose, but that these are the\ncharacteristics proper to these objects. An additional fault in the\nway in which Formal Logic conceives the judgment is, that it makes\nthe judgment look as if it were something merely contingent, and\ndoes not offer any proof for the advance from notion on to judgment.\nFor the notion does not, as understanding supposes, stand still in\nits own immobility. It is rather an infinite form, of boundless\nactivity, as it were the _punctum saliens_ of all vitality, and\nthereby self-differentiating. This disruption of the notion into the\ndifference of its constituent functions',--a disruption imposed by the\nnative act of the notion, is the judgment. A judgment therefore means\nthe particularising of the notion. No doubt the notion is implicitly\nthe particular. But in the notion as notion the particular is not yet\nexplicit, and still remains in transparent unity with the universal.\nThus, for example, as we remarked before (\u00a7 160, note), the germ of a\nplant contains its particular, such as root, branches, leaves, &c.:\nbut these details are at first present only potentially, and are not\nrealised till the germ uncloses. This unclosing is, as it were, the\njudgment of the plant. The illustration may also serve to show how\nneither the notion nor the judgment are merely found in our head, or\nmerely framed by us. The notion is the very heart of things, and makes\nthem what they are. To form a notion of an object means therefore to\nbecome aware of its notion: and when we proceed to a criticism or\njudgment of the object, we are not performing a subjective act, and\nmerely ascribing this or that predicate to the object. We are, on the\ncontrary, observing the object in the specific character imposed by its\nnotion.\n167.] The Judgment is usually taken in a subjective sense as an\noperation and a form, occurring merely in self-conscious thought. This\ndistinction, however, has no existence on purely logical principles,\nby which the judgment is taken in the quite universal signification\nthat all things are a judgment. That is to say, they are individuals,\nwhich are a universality or inner nature in themselves,--a universal\nwhich is individualised. Their universality and individuality are\ndistinguished, but the one is at the same time identical with the other.\nThe interpretation of the judgment, according to which it is assumed\nto be merely subjective, as if _we_ ascribed a predicate to a subject,\nis contradicted by the decidedly objective expression of the judgment.\nThe rose _is_ red; Gold _is_ a metal. It is not by us that something\nis first ascribed to them.--A judgment is however distinguished from a\nproposition. The latter contains a statement about the subject, which\ndoes not stand to it in any universal relationship, but expresses some\nsingle action, or some state, or the like. Thus, 'Caesar was born at\nRome in such and such a year, waged war in Gaul for ten years, crossed\nthe Rubicon, &c.,' are propositions, but not judgments. Again it is\nabsurd to say that such statements as, 'I slept well last night,' or\n'Present arms!' may be turned into the form of a judgment. 'A carriage\nis passing by'--would be a judgment, and a subjective one at best, only\nif it were doubtful, whether the passing object was a carriage, or\nwhether it and not rather the point of observation was in motion:--in\nshort, only if it were desired to specify a conception which was still\nshort of appropriate specification.\n168.] The judgment is an expression of finitude. Things from its point\nof view are said to be finite, because they are a judgment, because\ntheir definite being and their universal nature, (their body and their\nsoul,) though united indeed (otherwise the things would be nothing),\nare still elements in the constitution which are already different and\nalso in any case separable.\n169.] The abstract terms of the judgment, 'The individual is the\nuniversal,' present the subject (as negatively self-relating) as what\nis immediately _concrete,_ while the predicate is what is _abstract,_\nindeterminate, in short, the universal. But the two elements are\nconnected together by an 'is': and thus the predicate (in its\nuniversality) must also contain the speciality of the subject, must,\nin short, have particularity: and so is realised the identity between\nsubject and predicate; which, being thus unaffected by this difference\nin form, is the content.\nIt is the predicate which first gives the subject, which till then was\non its own account a bare mental representation or an empty name, its\nspecific character and content. In judgments like 'God is the most\nreal of all things,' or 'The Absolute is the self-identical,' God and\nthe Absolute are mere names; what they _are_ we only learn in the\npredicate. What the subject may be in other respects, as a concrete\nthing, is no concern of _this_ judgment. (Cp. \u00a7 31.)\nTo define the subject as that of which something is said, and the\npredicate as what is said about it, is mere trifling. It gives no\ninformation about the distinction between the two. In point of\nthought, the subject is primarily the individual, and the predicate\nthe universal. As the judgment receives further development, the\nsubject ceases to be merely the immediate individual, and the predicate\nmerely the abstract universal: the former acquires the additional\nsignifications of particular and universal,--the latter the additional\nsignifications of particular and individual. Thus while the same names\nare given to the two terms of the judgment, their meaning passes\nthrough a series of changes.\n170.] We now go closer into the speciality of subject and predicate.\nThe subject as negative self-relation (\u00a7\u00a7 163, 166) is the stable\nsubstratum in which the predicate has its subsistence and where it\nis ideally present. The predicate, as the phrase is, _inheres_ in\nthe subject. Further, as the subject is in general and immediately\nconcrete, the specific connotation of the predicate is only one of the\nnumerous characters of the subject. Thus the subject is ampler and\nwider than the predicate.\nConversely, the predicate as universal is self-subsistent, and\nindifferent whether this subject is or not. The predicate outflanks\nthe subject, subsuming it under itself: and hence on its side is wider\nthan the subject. The specific content of the predicate (\u00a7 169) alone\nconstitutes the identity of the two.\n171.] At first, subject, predicate, and the specific content or the\nidentity are, even in their relation, still put in the judgment\nas different and divergent. By implication, however, that is, in\ntheir notion, they are identical. For the subject is a concrete\ntotality,--which means not any indefinite multiplicity, but\nindividuality alone, the particular and the universal in an identity:\nand the predicate too is the very same unity (\u00a7 170).--The copula\nagain, even while stating the identity of subject and predicate,\ndoes so at first only by an abstract 'is.' Conformably to such an\nidentity the subject has to be _put_ also in the characteristic of the\npredicate. By this means the latter also receives the characteristic of\nthe former: so that the copula receives its full complement and full\nforce. Such is the continuous specification by which the judgment,\nthrough a copula charged with content, comes to be a syllogism. As it\nis primarily exhibited in the judgment, this gradual specification\nconsists in giving to an originally abstract, sensuous universality the\nspecific character of allness, of species, of genus, and finally of the\ndeveloped universality of the notion.\nAfter we are made aware of this continuous specification of the\njudgment, we can see a meaning and an interconnexion in what are\nusually stated as the kinds of judgment. Not only does the ordinary\nenumeration seem purely casual, but it is also superficial, and even\nbewildering in its statement of their distinctions. The distinction\nbetween positive, categorical and assertory judgments, is either a pure\ninvention of fancy, or is left undetermined. On the right theory, the\ndifferent judgments follow necessarily from one another, and present\nthe continuous specification of the notion; for the judgment itself is\nnothing but the notion specified.\nWhen we look at the two preceding spheres of Being and Essence, we see\nthat the specified notions as judgments are reproductions of these\nspheres, but put in the simplicity of relation peculiar to the notion.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe various kinds of judgment are no empirical aggregate. They are\na systematic whole based on a principle; and it was one of Kant's\ngreat merits to have first emphasised the necessity of showing\nthis. His proposed division, according to the headings in his table\nof categories, into judgments of quality, quantity, relation and\nmodality, can not be called satisfactory, partly from the merely formal\napplication of this categorical rubric, partly on account of their\ncontent. Still it rests upon a true perception of the fact that the\ndifferent species of judgment derive their features from the universal\nforms of the logical idea itself. If we follow this clue, it will\nsupply us with three chief kinds of judgment parallel to the stages\nof Being, Essence, and Notion. The second of these kinds, as required\nby the character of Essence, which is the stage of differentiation,\nmust be doubled. We find the inner ground for this systematisation of\njudgments in the circumstance that when the Notion, which is the unity\nof Being and Essence in a comprehensive thought, unfolds, as it does in\nthe judgment, it must reproduce these two stages in a transformation\nproper to the notion. The notion itself meanwhile is seen to mould and\nform the genuine grade of judgment.\nFar from occupying the same level, and being of equal value, the\ndifferent species of judgment form a series of steps, the difference\nof which rests upon the logical significance of the predicate. That\njudgments differ in value is evident even in our ordinary ways of\nthinking. We should not hesitate to ascribe a very slight faculty of\njudgment to a person who habitually framed only such judgments as,\n'This wall is green,' 'This stove is hot.' On the other hand we should\ncredit with a genuine capacity of judgment the person whose criticisms\ndealt with such questions as whether a certain work of art was\nbeautiful, whether a certain action was good, and so on. In judgments\nof the first-mentioned kind the content forms only an abstract quality,\nthe presence of which can be sufficiently detected by immediate\nperception. To pronounce a work of art to be beautiful, or an action to\nbe good, requires on the contrary a comparison of the objects with what\nthey ought to be, _i.e._ with their notion.\n(\u03b1) Qualitative Judgment.\n172.] The immediate judgment is the judgment of definite Being. The\nsubject is invested with a universality as its predicate, which is\nan immediate, and therefore a sensible quality. It may be (1) a\nPositive judgment: The individual is a particular. But the\nindividual is not a particular: or in more precise language, such\na single quality is not congruous with the concrete nature of the\nsubject. This is (2) a Negative judgment.\nIt is one of the fundamental assumptions of dogmatic Logic that\nQualitative judgments such as, 'The rose is red,' or 'is not red,' can\ncontain _truth. Correct_ they may be, _i.e._ in the limited circle\nof perception, of finite conception and thought: that depends on the\ncontent, which likewise is finite, and, on its own merits, untrue.\nTruth, however, as opposed to correctness, depends solely on the form,\nviz. on the notion as it is put and the reality corresponding to it.\nBut truth of that stamp is not found in the Qualitative judgment.\nIn common life the terms _truth_ and _correctness_ are often treated\nas synonymous: we speak of the truth of a content, when we are only\nthinking of its correctness. Correctness, generally speaking, concerns\nonly the formal coincidence between our conception and its content,\nwhatever the constitution of this content may be. Truth, on the\ncontrary, lies in the coincidence of the object with itself, that is,\nwith its notion. That a person is sick, or that some one has committed\na theft, may certainly be correct. But the content is untrue. A sick\nbody is not in harmony with the notion of body, and there is a want\nof congruity between theft and the notion of human conduct. These\ninstances may show that an immediate judgment, in which an abstract\nquality is predicated of an immediately individual thing, however\ncorrect it may be, cannot contain truth. The subject and predicate of\nit do not stand to each other in the relation of reality and notion.\nWe may add that the untruth of the immediate judgment lies in the\nincongruity between its form and content. To say 'This rose is red,'\ninvolves (in virtue of the copula 'is') the coincidence of subject and\npredicate. The rose however is a concrete thing, and so is not red\nonly: it has also an odour, a specific form, and many other features\nnot implied in the predicate red. The predicate on its part is an\nabstract universal, and does not apply to the rose alone. There are\nother flowers and other objects which are red too. The subject and\npredicate in the immediate judgment touch, as it were, only in a single\npoint, but do not cover each other. The case is different with the\nnotional judgment. In pronouncing an action to be good, we frame a\nnotional judgment. Here, as we at once perceive, there is a closer and\na more intimate relation than in the immediate judgment. The predicate\nin the latter is some abstract quality which may or may not be applied\nto the subject. In the judgment of the notion the predicate is, as it\nwere, the soul of the subject, by which the subject, as the body of\nthis soul, is characterised through and through.\n173.] This negation of a particular quality, which is the first\nnegation, still leaves the connexion of the subject with the predicate\nsubsisting. The predicate is in that manner a sort of relative\nuniversal, of which a special phase only has been negatived. [To say,\nthat the rose is not red, implies that it is still coloured--in the\nfirst place with another colour; which however would be only one more\npositive judgment.] The individual however is not a universal. Hence\n(3) the judgment suffers disruption into one of two forms. It is either\n(a) the Identical judgment, an empty identical relation stating\nthat the individual is the individual; or it is (b) what is called the\nInfinite judgment, in which we are presented with the total\nincompatibility of subject and predicate.\nExamples of the latter are: 'The mind is no elephant:' 'A lion is\nno table;' propositions which are correct but absurd, exactly like\nthe identical propositions: 'A lion is a lion;' 'Mind is mind.'\nPropositions like these are undoubtedly the truth of the immediate, or,\nas it is called, Qualitative judgment. But they are not judgments at\nall, and can only occur in a subjective thought where even an untrue\nabstraction may hold its ground.--In their objective aspect, these\nlatter judgments express the nature of what is, or of sensible things,\nwhich, as they declare, suffer disruption into an empty identity on the\none hand, and on the other a fully-charged relation--only that this\nrelation is the qualitative antagonism of the things related, their\ntotal incongruity.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe negatively-infinite judgment, in which the subject has no relation\nwhatever to the predicate, gets its place in the Formal Logic solely as\na nonsensical curiosity. But the infinite judgment is not really a mere\ncasual form adopted by subjective thought. It exhibits the proximate\nresult of the dialectical process in the immediate judgments preceding\n(the positive and simply-negative), and distinctly displays their\nfinitude and untruth. Crime may be quoted as an objective instance of\nthe negatively-infinite judgment. The person committing a crime, such\nas a theft, does not, as in a suit about civil rights, merely deny\nthe particular right of another person to some one definite thing.\nHe denies the right of that person in general, and therefore he is\nnot merely forced to restore what he has stolen, but is punished in\naddition, because he has violated law as law, _i.e._ law in general.\nThe civil-law suit on the contrary is an instance of the negative\njudgment pure and simple where merely the particular law is violated,\nwhilst law in general is so far acknowledged. Such a dispute is\nprecisely paralleled by a negative judgment, like, 'This flower is not\nred:' by which we merely deny the particular colour of the flower, but\nnot its colour in general, which may be blue, yellow, or any other.\nSimilarly death, as a negatively-infinite judgment, is distinguished\nfrom disease as simply-negative. In disease, merely this or that\nfunction of life is checked or negatived: in death, as we ordinarily\nsay, body and soul part, _i.e._ subject and predicate utterly diverge.\n(\u00df) _Judgment of Reflection._\n174.] The individual put as individual (_i.e._ as reflected-into-self)\ninto the judgment, has a predicate, in comparison with which the\nsubject, as self-relating, continues to be still _an other_ thing.--In\nexistence the subject ceases to be immediately qualitative, it is in\ncorrelation, and inter-connexion with an other thing,--with an external\nworld. In this way the universality of the predicate comes to signify\nthis relativity--(_e.g._) useful, or dangerous; weight or acidity; or\nagain, instinct; are examples of such relative predicates.\nThe Judgment of Reflection is distinguished from the Qualitative\njudgment by the circumstance that its predicate is not an immediate\nor abstract quality, but of such a kind as to exhibit the subject\nas in relation to something else. When we say, _e.g._ 'This rose is\nred.' we regard the subject in its immediate individuality, and\nwithout reference to anything else. If, on the other hand, we frame\nthe judgment, 'This plant is medicinal,' we regard the subject, plant,\nas standing in connexion with something else (the sickness which it\ncures), by means of its predicate (its medicinality). The case is the\nsame with judgments like: This body is elastic: This instrument is\nuseful: This punishment has a deterrent influence. In every one of\nthese instances the predicate is some category of reflection. They all\nexhibit an advance beyond the immediate individuality of the subject,\nbut none of them goes so far as to indicate the adequate notion of it.\nIt is in this mode of judgment that ordinary _raisonnement_ luxuriates.\nThe greater the concreteness of the object in question, the more points\nof view does it offer to reflection; by which however its proper nature\nor notion is not exhausted.\n175.] (1) Firstly then the subject, the individual as individual (in\nthe Singular judgment), is a universal. But (2) secondly, in\nthis relation it is elevated above its singularity. This enlargement is\nexternal, due to subjective reflection, and at first is an indefinite\nnumber of particulars. (This is seen in the Particular judgment,\nwhich is obviously negative as well as positive: the individual is\ndivided in itself: partly it is self-related, partly related to\nsomething else.) (3) Thirdly, Some are the universal: particularity is\nthus enlarged to universality: or universality is modified through the\nindividuality of the subject, and appears as allness Community,\nthe ordinary universality of reflection.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe subject, receiving, as in the Singular judgment, a universal\npredicate, is carried out beyond its mere individual self. To say,\n'This plant is wholesome,' implies not only that this single plant is\nwholesome, but that some or several are so. We have thus the particular\njudgment (some plants are wholesome, some men are inventive, &c). By\nmeans of particularity the immediate individual comes to lose its\nindependence, and enters into an inter-connexion with something else.\nMan, as _this_ man, is not this single man alone: he stands beside\nother men and becomes one in the crowd, just by this means however he\nbelongs to his universal, and is consequently raised.--The particular\njudgment is as much negative as positive. If only some bodies are\nelastic, it is evident that the rest are not elastic.\nOn this fact again depends the advance to the third form of the\nReflective judgment, viz. the judgment of allness (all men are mortal,\nall metals conduct electricity). It is as 'all' that the universal\nis in the first instance generally encountered by reflection. The\nindividuals form for reflection the foundation, and it is only our\nsubjective action which collects and describes them as 'all.' So far\nthe universal has the aspect of an external fastening, that holds\ntogether a number of independent individuals, which have not the least\naffinity towards it. This semblance of indifference is however unreal:\nfor the universal is the ground and foundation, the root, and substance\nof the individual. If _e.g._ we take Caius, Titus, Sempronius, and\nthe other inhabitants of a town or country, the fact that all of them\nare men is not merely something which they have in common, but their\nuniversal or kind, without which these individuals would not be at all.\nThe case is very different with that superficial generality falsely\nso called, which really means only what attaches, or is common, to\nall the individuals. It has been remarked, for example, that men,\nin contradistinction from the lower animals, possess in common the\nappendage of ear-lobes. It is evident, however, that the absence of\nthese ear-lobes in one man or another would not affect the rest of\nhis being, character, or capacities: whereas it would be nonsense\nto suppose that Caius, without being a man, would still be brave,\nlearned, &c. The individual man is what he is in particular, only in so\nfar as he is before all things a man as man and in general. And that\ngenerality is not something external to, or something in addition to\nother abstract qualities, or to mere features discovered by reflection.\nIt is what permeates and includes in it everything particular.\n176.] The subject being thus likewise characterised as a universal,\nthere is an express identification of subject and predicate, by which\nat the same time the speciality of the judgment form is deprived of\nall importance. This unity of the content (the content being the\nuniversality which is identical with the negative reflection-in-self of\nthe subject) makes the connexion in judgment a necessary one.\nThe advance from the reflective judgment of allness to the judgment\nof necessity is found in our usual modes of thought, when we say that\nwhatever appertains to all, appertains to the species, and is therefore\nnecessary. To say all plants, or all men, is the same thing as to say\n_the_ plant, or _the_ man.\n(\u03b3) _Judgment of Necessity._\n177.] The Judgment of Necessity, _i.e._ of the identity of the content\nin its difference (1), contains, in the predicate, partly the substance\nor nature of the subject, the concrete universal, the _genus_; partly,\nseeing that this universal also contains the specific character as\nnegative, the predicate represents the exclusive essential character,\nthe _species._ This is the Categorical judgment.\n(2) Conformably to their substantiality, the two terms receive the\naspect of independent actuality. Their identity is then inward only;\nand thus the actuality of the one is at the same time not its own, but\nthe being of the other. This is the Hypothetical judgment.\n(3) If, in this self-surrender and self-alienation of the notion,\nits inner identity is at the same time explicitly put, the universal\nis the genus which is self-identical in its mutually-exclusive\nindividualities. This judgment, which has this universal for both its\nterms, the one time as a universal, the other time as the circle of\nits self-excluding particularisation in which the 'either--or' as much\nas the 'as well as' stands for the genus, is the Disjunctive\njudgment. Universality, at first as a genus, and now also as the\ncircuit of its species, is thus described and expressly put as a\ntotality.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe Categorical judgment (such as 'Gold is a metal,' 'The rose is a\nplant') is the un-mediated judgment of necessity, and finds within the\nsphere of Essence its parallel in the relation of substance. All things\nare a Categorical judgment. In other words, they have their substantial\nnature, forming their fixed and unchangeable substratum. It is only\nwhen things are studied from the point of view of their kind, and as\nwith necessity determined by the kind, that the judgment first begins\nto be real. It betrays a defective logical training to place upon the\nsame level judgments like 'gold is dear,' and judgments like 'gold\nis a metal.' That 'gold is dear' is a matter of external connexion\nbetween it and our wants or inclinations, the costs of obtaining it,\nand other circumstances. Gold remains the same as it was, though that\nexternal reference is altered or removed. Metalleity, on the contrary,\nconstitutes the substantial nature of gold, apart from which it, and\nall else that is in it, or can be predicated of it, would be unable to\nsubsist. The same is the case if we say, 'Caius is a man.' We express\nby that, that whatever else he may be, has worth and meaning, only when\nit corresponds to his substantial nature or manhood.\nBut even the Categorical judgment is to a certain extent defective. It\nfails to give due place to the function or element of particularity.\nThus 'gold is a metal,' it is true; but so are silver, copper, iron:\nand metalleity as such has no leanings to any of its particular\nspecies. In these circumstances we must advance from the Categorical to\nthe Hypothetical judgment, which may be expressed in the formula: If\n_A_ is, _B_ is. The present case exhibits the same advance as formerly\ntook place from the relation of substance to the relation of cause. In\nthe Hypothetical judgment the specific character of the content shows\nitself mediated and dependent on something else: and this is exactly\nthe relation of cause and effect. And if we were to give a general\ninterpretation to the Hypothetical judgment, we should say that it\nexpressly realises the universal in its particularising. This brings\nus to the third form of the Judgment of Necessity, the Disjunctive\njudgment. _A_ is either _B_ or _C_ or _D._ A work of poetic art is\neither epic or lyric or dramatic. Colour is either yellow or blue or\nred. The two terms in the Disjunctive judgment are identical. The genus\nis the sum total of the species, and the sum total of the species\nis the genus. This unity of the universal and the particular is the\nnotion: and it is the notion which, as we now see, forms the content of\nthe judgment.\n(\u03b4) _Judgment of the Notion._\n178.] The Judgment of the Notion has for its content the notion, the\ntotality in simple form, the universal with its complete speciality.\nThe subject is, (1) in the first place, an individual, which has\nfor its predicate the reflection of the particular existence on its\nuniversal; or the judgment states the agreement or disagreement of\nthese two aspects. That is, the predicate is such a term as good, true,\ncorrect. This is the Assertory judgment.\nJudgments, such as whether an object, action, &c. is good, bad, true,\nbeautiful, &c, are those to which even ordinary language first applies\nthe name of judgment. We should never ascribe judgment to a person who\nframed positive or negative judgments like, This rose is red, This\npicture is red, green, dusty, &c.\nThe Assertory judgment, although rejected by society as out of place\nwhen it claims authority on its own showing, has however been made the\nsingle and all-essential form of doctrine, even in philosophy, through\nthe influence of the principle of immediate knowledge and faith. In the\nso-called philosophic works which maintain this principle, we may read\nhundreds and hundreds of assertions about reason, knowledge, thought,\n&c. which, now that external authority counts for little, seek to\naccredit themselves by an endless restatement of the same thesis.\n179.] On the part of its at first un-mediated subject, the Assertory\njudgment does not contain the relation of particular with universal\nwhich is expressed in the predicate. This judgment is consequently\na mere subjective particularity, and is confronted by a contrary\nassertion with equal right, or rather want of right. It is therefore\nat once turned into (2) a Problematical judgment. But when we\nexplicitly attach the objective particularity to the subject and make\nits speciality the constitutive feature of its existence, the subject\n(3) then expresses the connexion of that objective particularity with\nits constitution, _i.e._ with its genus; and thus expresses what\nforms the content of the predicate (see \u00a7 178). [This (_the immediate\nindividuality_) house (_the genus,_) being so and so constituted\n(_particularity,_) is good or bad.] This is the Apodictic\njudgment. All things are a genus (_i.e._ have a meaning and purpose) in\nan _individual_ actuality of a _particular_ constitution. And they are\nfinite, because the particular in them may and also may not conform to\nthe universal.\n180.] In this manner subject and predicate are each the whole judgment.\nThe immediate constitution of the subject is at first exhibited as\nthe intermediating ground, where the individuality of the actual\nthing meets with its universality, and in this way as the ground of\nthe judgment. What has been really made explicit is the oneness of\nsubject and predicate, as the notion itself, filling up the empty 'is'\nof the copula. While its constituent elements are at the same time\ndistinguished as subject and predicate, the notion is put as their\nunity, as the connexion which serves to intermediate them: in short, as\nthe Syllogism.\n(c) _The Syllogism._\n181.] The Syllogism brings the notion and the judgment into one.\nIt is notion,--being the simple identity into which the distinctions of\nform in the judgment have retired. It is judgment,--because it is at\nthe same time set in reality, that is, put in the distinction of its\nterms. The Syllogism is the reasonable, and everything reasonable.\nEven the ordinary theories represent the Syllogism to be the form of\nreasonableness, but only a subjective form; and no inter-connexion\nwhatever is shown to exist between it and any other reasonable content,\nsuch as a reasonable principle, a reasonable action, idea, &c. The name\nof reason is much and often heard, and appealed to: but no one thinks\nof explaining its specific character, or saying what it is,--least of\nall that it has any connexion with Syllogism. But formal Syllogism\nreally presents what is reasonable in such a reasonless way that it\nhas nothing to do with any reasonable matter. But as the matter in\nquestion can only be rational in virtue of the same quality by which\nthought is reason, it can be made so by the form only: and that\nform is Syllogism. And what is a Syllogism but an explicit putting,\n_i.e._ realising of the notion, at first in form only, as stated\nabove? Accordingly the Syllogism is the essential ground of whatever\nis true: and at the present stage the definition of the Absolute is\nthat it is the Syllogism, or stating the principle in a proposition:\nEverything is a Syllogism. Everything is a notion, the existence of\nwhich is the differentiation of its members or functions, so that the\nuniversal nature of the Notion gives itself external reality by means\nof particularity, and thereby, and as a negative reflection-into-self,\nmakes itself an individual. Or, conversely: the actual thing is an\nindividual, which by means of particularity rises to universality and\nmakes itself identical with itself.--The actual is one: but it is also\nthe divergence from each other of the constituent elements of the\nnotion; and the Syllogism represents the orbit of intermediation of its\nelements, by which it realises its unity.\nThe Syllogism, like the notion and the judgment, is usually described\nas a form merely of our subjective thinking. The Syllogism, it is said,\nis the process of proving the judgment. And certainly the judgment does\nin every case refer us to the Syllogism. The step from the one to the\nother however is not brought about by our subjective action, but by the\njudgment itself which puts itself as Syllogism, and in the conclusion\nreturns to the unity of the notion. The precise point by which we\npass to the Syllogism is found in the Apodictic judgment. In it we\nhave an individual which by means of its qualities connects itself\nwith its universal or notion. Here we see the particular becoming the\nmediating mean between the individual and the universal. This gives\nthe fundamental form of the Syllogism, the gradual specification of\nwhich, formally considered, consists in the fact that universal and\nindividual also occupy this place of mean. This again paves the way for\nthe passage from subjectivity to objectivity.\n182.] In the 'immediate' Syllogism the several aspects of the notion\nconfront one another abstractly, and stand in an external relation\nonly. We have first the two extremes, which are Individuality and\nUniversality; and then the notion, as the mean for locking the two\ntogether, is in like manner only abstract Particularity. In this way\nthe extremes are put as independent and without affinity either towards\none another or towards their mean. Such a Syllogism contains reason,\nbut in utter notionlessness,--the formal Syllogism of Understanding. In\nit the subject is coupled with an _other_ character; or the universal\nby this mediation subsumes a subject external to it. In the rational\nSyllogism, on the contrary, the subject is by means of the mediation\ncoupled with itself. In this manner it first comes to be a subject: or,\nin the subject we have the first germ of the rational Syllogism.\nIn the following examination, the Syllogism of Understanding, according\nto the interpretation usually put upon it, is expressed in its\nsubjective shape; the shape which it has when _we_ are said to make\nsuch Syllogisms. And it really is only a subjective syllogising. Such\nSyllogism however has also an objective meaning; it expresses only the\nfinitude of things, but does so in the specific mode which the form\nhas here reached. In the case of finite things their subjectivity,\nbeing only thinghood, is separable from their properties or their\nparticularity, but also separable from their universality: not only\nwhen the universality is the bare quality of the thing and its external\ninter-connexion with other things, but also when it is its genus and\nnotion.\n*       *       *       *       *\nOn the above-mentioned theory of syllogism, as the rational form _par\nexcellence,_ reason has been defined as the faculty of syllogising,\nwhilst understanding is defined as the faculty of forming notions. We\nmight object to the conception on which this depends, and according to\nwhich the mind is merely a sum of forces or faculties existing side\nby side. But apart from that objection, we may observe in regard to\nthe parallelism of understanding with the notion, as well as of reason\nwith syllogism, that the notion is as little a mere category of the\nunderstanding as the syllogism is without qualification definable\nas rational. For, in the first place, what the Formal Logic usually\nexamines in its theory of syllogism, is really nothing but the mere\nsyllogism of understanding, which has no claim to the honour of being\nmade a form of rationality, still less to be held as the embodiment of\nall reason. The notion, in the second place, so far from being a form\nof understanding, owes its degradation to such a place entirely to\nthe influence of that abstract mode of thought. And it is not unusual\nto draw such a distinction between a notion of understanding and a\nnotion of reason. The distinction however does not mean that notions\nare of two kinds. It means that our own action often stops short at\nthe mere negative and abstract form of the notion, when we might also\nhave proceeded to apprehend the notion in its true nature, as at once\npositive and concrete. It is _e.g._ the mere understanding, which\nthinks liberty to be the abstract contrary of necessity, whereas the\nadequate rational notion of liberty requires the element of necessity\nto be merged in it. Similarly the definition of God, given by what is\ncalled Deism, is merely the mode in which the understanding thinks God:\nwhereas Christianity, to which He is known as the Trinity, contains the\nrational notion of God.\n(\u03b1) _Qualitative Syllogism._\n183.] The first syllogism is a syllogism of definite being,--a\nQualitative Syllogism, as stated in the last paragraph. Its form (1) is\nI--P--U: _i.e._ a subject as Individual is coupled (concluded) with a\nUniversal character by means of a (Particular) quality.\nOf course the subject (_terminus minor_) has other characteristics\nbesides individuality, just as the other extreme (the predicate of the\nconclusion, or _terminus major_) has other characteristics than mere\nuniversality. But here the interest turns only on the characteristics\nthrough which these terms make a syllogism.\nThe syllogism of existence is a syllogism of understanding merely, at\nleast in so far as it leaves the individual, the particular, and the\nuniversal to confront each other quite abstractly. In this syllogism\nthe notion is at the very height of self-estrangement. We have in it\nan immediately individual thing as subject: next some one particular\naspect or property attaching to this subject is selected, and by means\nof this property the individual turns out to be a universal. Thus we\nmay say, This rose is red: Red is a colour: Therefore, this rose\nis a coloured object. It is this aspect of the syllogism which the\ncommon logics mainly treat of. There was a time when the syllogism was\nregarded as an absolute rule for all cognition, and when a scientific\nstatement was not held to be valid until it had been shown to follow\nfrom a process of syllogism. At present, on the contrary, the different\nforms of the syllogism are met nowhere save in the manuals of Logic;\nand an acquaintance with them is considered a piece of mere pedantry,\nof no further use either in practical life or in science. It would\nindeed be both useless and pedantic to parade the whole machinery of\nthe formal syllogism on every occasion. And yet the several forms of\nsyllogism make themselves constantly felt in our cognition. If any one,\nwhen awaking on a winter morning, hears the creaking of the carriages\non the street, and is thus led to conclude that it has frozen hard in\nthe night, he has gone through a syllogistic operation:--an operation\nwhich is every day repeated under the greatest variety of conditions.\nThe interest, therefore, ought at least not to be less in becoming\nexpressly conscious of this daily action of our thinking selves, than\nconfessedly belongs to the study of the functions of organic life, such\nas the processes of digestion, assimilation, respiration, or even the\nprocesses and structures of the nature around us. We do not, however,\nfor a moment deny that a study of Logic is no more necessary to teach\nus how to draw correct conclusions, than a previous study of anatomy\nand physiology is required in order to digest or breathe.\nAristotle was the first to observe and describe the different forms,\nor, as they are called, figures of syllogism, in their subjective\nmeaning: and he performed his work so exactly and surely, that no\nessential addition has ever been required. But while sensible of the\nvalue of what he has thus done, we must not forget that the forms of\nthe syllogism of understanding, and of finite thought altogether,\nare not what Aristotle has made use of in his properly philosophical\ninvestigations. (See \u00a7 189.)\n184.] This syllogism is completely contingent (\u03b1) in the matter of its\nterms. The Middle Term, being an abstract particularity, is nothing\nbut any quality whatever of the subject: but the subject, being\nimmediate and thus empirically concrete, has several others, and could\ntherefore be coupled with exactly as many other universalities as it\npossesses single qualities. Similarly a single particularity may have\nvarious characters in itself, so that the same _medius terminus_ would\nserve to connect the subject with several different universals.\nIt is more a caprice of fashion, than a sense of its incorrectness,\nwhich has led to the disuse of ceremonious syllogising. This and the\nfollowing section indicate the uselessness of such syllogising for the\nends of truth.\nThe point of view indicated in the paragraph shows how this style of\nsyllogism can 'demonstrate' (as the phrase goes) the most diverse\nconclusions. All that is requisite is to find a _medius terminus_ from\nwhich the transition can be made to the proposition sought. Another\n_medius terminus_ would enable us to demonstrate something else, and\neven the contrary of the last. And the more concrete an object is, the\nmore aspects it has, which may become such middle terms. To determine\nwhich of these aspects is more essential than another, again, requires\na further syllogism of this kind, which fixing on the single quality\ncan with equal ease discover in it some aspect or consideration by\nwhich it can make good its claims to be considered necessary and\nimportant.\nLittle as we usually think on the Syllogism of Understanding in the\ndaily business of life, it never ceases to play its part there. In\na civil suit, for instance, it is the duty of the advocate to give\ndue force to the legal titles which make in favour of his client. In\nlogical language, such a legal title is nothing but a middle term.\nDiplomatic transactions afford another illustration of the same, when,\nfor instance, different powers lay claim to one and the same territory.\nIn such a case the laws of inheritance, the geographical position of\nthe country, the descent and the language of its inhabitants, or any\nother ground, may be emphasised as a _medius terminus._\n185.] (\u00df) This syllogism, if it is contingent in point of its terms,\nis no less contingent in virtue of the form of relation which is\nfound in it. In the syllogism, according to its notion, truth lies in\nconnecting two distinct things by a Middle Term in which they are one.\nBut connexions of the extremes with the Middle Term (the so-called\n_premisses,_ the major and the minor premiss) are in the case of this\nsyllogism much more decidedly _immediate_ connexions. In other words,\nthey have not a proper Middle Term.\nThis contradiction in the syllogism exhibits a new case of the infinite\nprogression. Each of the premisses evidently calls for a fresh\nsyllogism to demonstrate it: and as the new syllogism has two immediate\npremisses, like its predecessor, the demand for proof is doubled at\nevery step, and repeated without end.\n186.] On account of its importance for experience, there has been\nhere noted a defect in the syllogism, to which in this form absolute\ncorrectness had been ascribed. This defect however must lose itself in\nthe further specification of the syllogism. For we are now within the\nsphere of the notion; and here therefore, as well as in the judgment,\nthe opposite character is not merely present potentially, but is\nexplicit. To work out the gradual specification of the syllogism,\ntherefore, there need only be admitted and accepted what is at each\nstep realised by the syllogism itself.\nThrough the immediate syllogism I--P--U, the Individual is mediated\n(through a Particular) with the Universal, and in this conclusion put\nas a universal. It follows that the individual subject, becoming itself\na universal, serves to unite the two extremes, and to form their ground\nof intermediation. This gives the second figure of the syllogism, (2)\nU--I--P. It expresses the truth of the first; it shows in other words\nthat the intermediation has taken place in the individual, and is thus\nsomething contingent.\n187.] The universal, which in the first conclusion was specified\nthrough individuality, passes over into the second figure and there\nnow occupies the place that belonged to the immediate subject. In the\nsecond figure it is concluded with the particular. By this conclusion\ntherefore the universal is explicitly put as particular--and is now\nmade to mediate between the two extremes, the places of which are\noccupied by the two others (the particular and the individual). This is\nthe third figure of the syllogism: (3) P--U--I.\nWhat are called the Figures of the syllogism (being three in\nnumber, for the fourth is a superfluous and even absurd addition of\nthe Moderns to the three known to Aristotle) are in the usual mode of\ntreatment put side by side, without the slightest thought of showing\ntheir necessity, and still less of pointing out their import and value.\nNo wonder then that the figures have been in later times treated as an\nempty piece of formalism. They have however a very real significance,\nderived from the necessity for every function or characteristic\nelement of the notion to become the whole itself, and to stand as\nmediating ground.--But to find out what 'moods' of the propositions\n(such as whether they may be universals, or negatives) are needed\nto enable us to draw a correct conclusion in the different figures,\nis a mechanical inquiry, which its purely mechanical nature and its\nintrinsic meaninglessness have very properly consigned to oblivion.\nAnd Aristotle would have been the last person to give any countenance\nto those who wish to attach importance to such inquiries or to the\nsyllogism of understanding in general. It is true that he described\nthese, as well as numerous other forms of mind and nature, and that\nhe examined and expounded their specialities. But in his metaphysical\ntheories, as well as his theories of nature and mind, he was very\nfar from taking as basis, or criterion, the syllogistic forms of the\n'understanding.' Indeed it might be maintained that not one of these\ntheories would ever have come into existence, or been allowed to exist,\nif it had been compelled to submit to the laws of understanding. With\nall the descriptiveness and analytic faculty which Aristotle after his\nfashion is substantially strong in, his ruling principle is always the\nspeculative notion; and that syllogistic of 'understanding' to which he\nfirst gave such a definite expression is never allowed to intrude in\nthe higher domain of philosophy.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn their objective sense, the three figures of the syllogism declare\nthat everything rational is manifested as a triple syllogism; that\nis to say, each one of the members takes in turn the place of the\nextremes, as well as of the mean which reconciles them. Such, for\nexample, is the case with the three branches of philosophy; the Logical\nIdea, Nature, and Mind. As we first see them, Nature is the middle\nterm which links the others together. Nature, the totality immediately\nbefore us, unfolds itself into the two extremes of the Logical Idea\nand Mind. But Mind is Mind only when it is mediated through nature.\nThen, in the second place, Mind, which we know as the principle of\nindividuality, or as the actualising principle, is the mean; and Nature\nand the Logical Idea are the extremes. It is Mind which cognises the\nLogical Idea in Nature and which thus raises Nature to its essence.\nIn the third place again the Logical Idea itself becomes the mean: it\nis the absolute substance both of mind and of nature, the universal\nand all-pervading principle. These are the members of the Absolute\nSyllogism.\n188.] In the round by which each constituent function assumes\nsuccessively the place of mean and of the two extremes, their specific\ndifference from each other has been superseded. In this form, where\nthere is no distinction between its constituent elements, the syllogism\nat first has for its connective link equality, or the external identity\nof understanding. This is the Quantitative or Mathematical Syllogism:\nif two things are equal to a third, they are equal to one another.\n*       *       *       *       *\nEverybody knows that this Quantitative syllogism appears as a\nmathematical axiom, which like other axioms is said to be a principle\nthat does not admit of proof, and which indeed being self-evident does\nnot require such proof. These mathematical axioms however are really\nnothing but logical propositions, which, so far as they enunciate\ndefinite and particular thoughts, are deducible from the universal and\nself-characterising thought. To deduce them, is to give their proof.\nThat is true of the Quantitative syllogism, to which mathematics\ngives the rank of an axiom. It is really the proximate result of\nthe qualitative or immediate syllogism. Finally, the Quantitative\nsyllogism is the syllogism in utter formlessness. The difference\nbetween the terms which is required by the notion is suspended.\nExtraneous circumstances alone can decide what propositions are to be\npremisses here: and therefore in applying this syllogism we make a\npre-supposition of what has been elsewhere proved and established.\n189.] Two results follow as to the form. In the first place, each\nconstituent element has taken the place and performed the function of\nthe mean and therefore of the whole, thus implicitly losing its partial\nand abstract character (\u00a7 182 and \u00a7 184); secondly, the mediation has\nbeen completed (\u00a7 185), though the completion too is only implicit,\nthat is, only as a circle of mediations which in turn pre-suppose each\nother. In the first figure I--P--U the two premisses I is P and P is\nU are yet without a mediation. The former premiss is mediated in the\nthird, the latter in the second figure. But each of these two figures,\nagain, for the mediation of its premisses pre-supposes the two others.\nIn consequence of this, the mediating unity of the notion must be put\nno longer as an abstract particularity, but as a developed unity of the\nindividual and universal--and in the first place a reflected unity of\nthese elements. That is to say, the individuality gets at the same time\nthe character of universality. A mean of this kind gives the Syllogism\nof Reflection.\n(\u03b2) _Syllogism of Reflection._\n190.] If the mean, in the first place, be not only an abstract\nparticular character of the subject, but at the same time all the\nindividual concrete subjects which possess that character, but possess\nit only along with others, (1) we have the Syllogism of Allness.\nThe major premiss, however, which has for its subject the particular\ncharacter, the _terminus medius,_ as allness, pre-supposes the very\nconclusion which ought rather to have pre-supposed it. It rests\ntherefore (2) on an Induction, in which the mean is given by the\ncomplete list of individuals as such,--a, b, c, d, &c. On account of\nthe disparity, however, between universality and an immediate and\nempirical individuality, the list can never be complete. Induction\ntherefore rests upon (3) Analogy. The middle term of Analogy\nis an individual, which however is understood as equivalent to its\nessential universality, its genus, or essential character.--The first\nsyllogism for its intermediation turns us over to the second, and the\nsecond turns us over to the third. But the third no less demands an\nintrinsically determinate Universality, or an individuality as type of\nthe genus, after the round of the forms of external connexion between\nindividuality and universality has been run through in the figures of\nthe Reflective Syllogism.\nBy the Syllogism of Allness the defect in the first form of the\nSyllogism of Understanding, noted in \u00a7 184, is remedied, but only to\ngive rise to a new defect. This defect is that the major premiss itself\npre-supposes what really ought to be the conclusion, and pre-supposes\nit as what is thus an 'immediate' proposition. All men are mortal,\ntherefore Caius is mortal: All metals conduct electricity, therefore\n_e.g._ copper does so. In order to enunciate these major premisses,\nwhich when they say 'all' mean the 'immediate' individuals and are\nproperly intended to be empirical propositions, it is requisite that\nthe propositions about the individual man Caius, or the individual\nmetal copper, should previously have been ascertained to be correct.\nEverybody feels not merely the pedantry, but the unmeaning formalism of\nsuch syllogisms as: All men are mortal, Caius is a man, therefore Caius\nis mortal.\nThe syllogism of Allness hands us over to the syllogism of Induction,\nin which the individuals form the coupling mean. 'All metals conduct\nelectricity,' is an empirical proposition derived from experiments\nmade with each of the individual metals. We thus get the syllogism of\nInduction I in the following shape P--I--U. I . . .\nGold is a metal: silver is a metal: so is copper, lead, &c. This is\nthe major premiss. Then comes the minor premiss: All these bodies\nconduct electricity; and hence results the conclusion, that all metals\nconduct electricity. The point which brings about a combination here\nis individuality in the shape of allness. But this syllogism once\nmore hands us over to another syllogism. Its mean is constituted by\nthe complete list of the individuals. That pre-supposes that over\na certain region observation and experience are completed. But the\nthings in question here are individuals; and so again we are landed\nin the progression _ad infinitum_ (i, i, i, &c.). In other words, in\nno Induction can we ever exhaust the individuals. The 'all metals,'\n'all plants,' of our statements, mean only all the metals, all the\nplants, which we have hitherto become acquainted with. Every Induction\nis consequently imperfect. One and the other observation, many it may\nbe, have been made: but all the cases, all the individuals, have not\nbeen observed. By this defect of Induction we are led on to Analogy.\nIn the syllogism of Analogy we conclude from the fact that some things\nof a certain kind possess a certain quality, that the same quality is\npossessed by other things of the same kind. It would be a syllogism of\nAnalogy, for example, if we said: In all planets hitherto discovered\nthis has been found to be the law of motion, consequently a newly\ndiscovered planet will probably move according to the same law. In the\nexperiential sciences Analogy deservedly occupies a high place, and\nhas led to results of the highest importance. Analogy is the instinct\nof reason, creating an anticipation that this or that characteristic,\nwhich experience has discovered, has its root in the inner nature or\nkind of an object, and arguing on the faith of that anticipation.\nAnalogy it should be added may be superficial or it may be thorough.\nIt would certainly be a very bad analogy to argue that since the man\nCaius is a scholar, and Titus also is a man, Titus will probably be a\nscholar too: and it would be bad because a man's learning is not an\nunconditional consequence of his manhood. Superficial analogies of\nthis kind however are very frequently met with. It is often argued,\nfor example: The earth is a celestial body, so is the moon, and it\nis therefore in all probability inhabited as well as the earth. The\nanalogy is not one whit better than that previously mentioned. That\nthe earth is inhabited does not depend on its being a celestial body,\nbut in other conditions, such as the presence of an atmosphere, and of\nwater in connexion with the atmosphere, &c.: and these are precisely\nthe conditions which the moon, so far as we know, does not possess.\nWhat has in modern times been called the Philosophy of Nature consists\nprincipally in a frivolous play with empty and external analogies,\nwhich, however, claim to be considered profound results. The natural\nconsequence has been to discredit the philosophical study of nature.\n(\u03b3) _Syllogism of Necessity._\n191.] The Syllogism of Necessity, if we look to its purely abstract\ncharacteristics or terms, has for its mean the Universal in the same\nway as the Syllogism of Reflection has the Individual, the latter\nbeing in the second, and the former in the third figure (\u00a7 187).\nThe Universal is expressly put as in its very nature intrinsically\ndeterminate. In the first place (1) the Particular, meaning by the\nparticular the specific genus or species, is the term for mediating\nthe extremes--as is done in the Categorical syllogism. (2) The\nsame office is performed by the Individual, taking the individual as\nimmediate being, so that it is as much mediating as mediated:--as\nhappens in the Hypothetical syllogism. (3) We have also the\nmediating Universal explicitly put as a totality of its particular\nmembers, and as a single particular, or exclusive individuality:--which\nhappens in the Disjunctive syllogism. It is one and the same\nuniversal which is in these terms of the Disjunctive syllogism; they\nare only different forms for expressing it.\n192.] The syllogism has been taken conformably to the distinctions\nwhich it contains; and the general result of the course of their\nevolution has been to show that these differences work out their own\nabolition and destroy the notion's outwardness to its own self. And,\nas we see, in the first place, (1) each of the dynamic elements has\nproved itself the systematic whole of these elements, in short a whole\nsyllogism,--they are consequently implicitly identical. In the second\nplace, (2) the negation of their distinctions and of the mediation of\none through another constitutes independency; so that it is one and\nthe same universal which is in these forms, and which is in this way\nalso explicitly put as their identity. In this ideality of its dynamic\nelements, the syllogistic process may be described as essentially\ninvolving the negation of the characters through which its course runs,\nas being a mediative process through the suspension of mediation,--as\ncoupling the subject not with another, but with a suspended other, in\none word, with itself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn the common logic, the doctrine of syllogism is supposed to conclude\nthe first part, or what is called the 'elementary' theory. It is\nfollowed by the second part, the doctrine of Method, which proposes\nto show how a body of scientific knowledge is created by applying to\nexisting objects the forms of thought discussed in the elementary part.\nWhence these objects originate, and what the thought of objectivity\ngenerally speaking implies, are questions to which the Logic of\nUnderstanding vouchsafes no further answer. It believes thought to\nbe a mere subjective and formal activity, and the objective fact,\nwhich confronts thought, to have a separate and permanent being. But\nthis dualism is a half-truth: and there is a want of intelligence in\nthe procedure which at once accepts, without inquiring into their\norigin, the categories of subjectivity and objectivity. Both of them,\nsubjectivity as well as objectivity, are certainly thoughts--even\nspecific thoughts: which must show themselves founded on the universal\nand self-determining thought. This has here been done--at least for\nsubjectivity. We have recognised it, or the notion subjective (which\nincludes the notion proper, the judgment, and the syllogism) as the\ndialectical result of the first two main stages of the Logical Idea,\nBeing and Essence. To say that the notion is subjective and subjective\nonly, is so far quite correct: for the notion certainly is subjectivity\nitself. Not less subjective than the notion are also the judgment and\nsyllogism: and these forms, together with the so-called Laws of Thought\n(the Laws of Identity, Difference, and Sufficient Ground), make up the\ncontents of what is called the 'Elements' in the common logic. But we\nmay go a step further. This subjectivity, with its functions of notion,\njudgment, and syllogism, is not like a set of empty compartments which\nhas to get filled from without by separately-existing objects. It would\nbe truer to say that it is subjectivity itself which, as dialectical,\nbreaks through its own barriers and opens out into objectivity by means\nof the syllogism.\n193.] This 'realisation' of the notion,--a realisation in which the\nuniversal is this one totality withdrawn back into itself (of which\nthe different members are no less the whole, and) which has given\nitself a character of 'immediate' unity by merging the mediation:--this\nrealisation of the notion is the Object.\nI his transition from the Subject, the notion in general, and\nespecially the syllogism, to the Object, may, at the first glance,\nappear strange, particularly if we look only at the Syllogism\nof Understanding, and suppose syllogising to be only an act of\nconsciousness. But that strangeness imposes on us no obligation to seek\nto make the transition plausible to the image-loving conception. The\nonly question which can be considered is, whether our usual conception\nof what is called an 'object' approximately corresponds to the object\nas here described. By 'object' is commonly understood not an abstract\nbeing, or an existing thing merely, or any sort of actuality, but\nsomething independent, concrete, and self-complete, this completeness\nbeing the totality of the notion. That the object (_Objekt_) is also\nan object to us (_Gegenstand_) and is external to something else,\nwill be more precisely seen, when it puts itself in contrast with\nthe subjective. At present, as that into which the notion has passed\nfrom its mediation, it is only immediate object and nothing more,\njust as the notion is not describable as subjective, previous to the\nsubsequent contrast with objectivity.\nFurther, the Object in general is the one total, in itself still\nunspecified, the Objective World as a whole, God, the Absolute Object.\nThe object, however, has also difference attaching to it: it falls\ninto pieces, indefinite in their multiplicity (making an objective\nworld); and each of these individualised parts is also an object, an\nintrinsically concrete, complete, and independent existence.\nObjectivity has been compared with being, existence, and actuality;\nand so too the transition to existence and actuality (not to being,\nfor _it_ is the primary and quite abstract immediate) maybe compared\nwith the transition to objectivity. The ground from which existence\nproceeds, and the reflective correlation which is merged in actuality,\nare nothing but the as yet imperfectly realised notion. They are only\nabstract aspects of it,--the ground being its merely essence-bred\nunity, and the correlation only the connexion of real sides which are\nsupposed to have only self-reflected being. The notion is the unity of\nthe two; and the object is not a merely essence-like, but inherently\nuniversal unity, not only containing real distinctions, but containing\nthem as totalities in itself.\nIt is evident that in all these transitions there is a further purpose\nthan merely to show the indissoluble connexion between the notion or\nthought and being. It has been more than once remarked that being is\nnothing more than simple self-relation, and this meagre category is\ncertainly implied in the notion, or even in thought. But the meaning\nof these transitions is not to accept characteristics or categories,\nas only implied;--a fault which mars even the Ontological argument for\nGod's existence, when it is stated that being is one among realities.\nWhat such a transition does, is to take the notion, as it ought to be\nprimarily characterised _per se_ as a notion, with which this remote\nabstraction of being, or eve of objectivity, has as yet nothing to do,\nand looking at its specific character as a notional character alone, to\nsee when and whether it passes over into a form which is different from\nthe character as it belongs to the notion and appears in it.\nIf the Object, the product of this transition, be brought into relation\nwith the notion, which, so far as its special form is concerned, has\nvanished in it, we may give a correct expression to the result, by\nsaying that notion or, if it be preferred, subjectivity and object are\n_implicitly_ the same. But it is equally correct to say that they are\ndifferent. In short, the two modes of expression are equally correct\nand incorrect. The true state of the case can be presented in no\nexpressions of this kind. The 'implicit' is an abstraction, still more\npartial and inadequate than the notion itself, of which the inadequacy\nis upon the whole suspended, by suspending itself to the object with\nits opposite inadequacy. Hence that implicitness also must, by its\nnegation, give itself the character of explicitness. As in every case,\nspeculative identity is not the above-mentioned triviality of an\n_implicit_ identity of subject and object. This has been said often\nenough. Yet it could not be too often repeated, if the intention were\nreally to put an end to the stale and purely malicious misconception in\nregard to this identity:--of which however there can be no reasonable\nexpectation.\nLooking at that unity in a quite general way, and raising no objection\nto the one-sided form of its implicitness, we find it as the well-known\npre-supposition of the ontological proof for the existence of God.\nThere, it appears as supreme perfection. Anselm, in whom the notable\nsuggestion of this proof first occurs, no doubt originally restricted\nhimself to the question whether a certain content was in our thinking\nonly. His words are briefly these: '_Certe id quo majus cogitari\nnequit, non potest esse in intellectu solo. Si enim vel in solo\nintellectu est, potest cogitari esse_ et in re: _quod majus est.\nSi ergo id quo majus cogitari non potest, est in solo intellectu; id\nipsum quo majus cogitari non potest, est quo majus cogitari potest.\nSed certe hoc esse non potest._' (Certainly that, than which nothing\ngreater can be thought, cannot be in the intellect alone. For even\nif it is in the intellect alone, it can also be thought to exist in\nfact: and that is greater. If then that, than which nothing greater\ncan be thought, is in the intellect alone; then the very thing, which\nis greater than anything which can be thought, can be exceeded in\nthought. But certainly this is impossible.) The same unity received\na more objective expression in Descartes, Spinoza and others: while\nthe theory of immediate certitude or faith presents it, on the\ncontrary, in somewhat the same subjective aspect as Anselm. These\nIntuitionalists hold that _in our consciousness_ the attribute of being\nis indissolubly associated with the conception of God. The theory of\nfaith brings even the conception of external finite things under the\nsame inseparable nexus between the consciousness and the being of\nthem, on the ground that _perception_ presents them conjoined with the\nattribute of existence: and in so saying, it is no doubt correct. It\nwould be utterly absurd, however, to suppose that the association in\nconsciousness between existence and our conception of finite things\nis of the same description as the association between existence and\nthe conception of God. To do so would be to forget that finite things\nare changeable and transient, _i.e._ that existence is associated\nwith them for a season, but that the association is neither eternal\nnor inseparable. Speaking in the phraseology of the categories before\nus, we may say that, to call a thing finite, means that its objective\nexistence is not in harmony with the thought of it, with its universal\ncalling, its kind and its end. Anselm, consequently, neglecting any\nsuch conjunction as occurs in finite things, has with good reason\npronounced that only to be the Perfect which exists not merely in a\nsubjective, but also in an objective mode. It does no good to put\non airs against the Ontological proof, as it is called, and against\nAnselm thus denning the Perfect. The argument is one latent in every\nunsophisticated mind, and it recurs in every philosophy, even against\nits wish and without its knowledge--as may be seen in the theory of\nimmediate belief.\nThe real fault in the argumentation of Anselm is one which is\nchargeable on Descartes and Spinoza, as well as on the theory of\nimmediate knowledge. It is this. This unity which is enunciated as the\nsupreme perfection or, it may be, subjectively, as the true knowledge,\nis pre-supposed, _i.e._ it is assumed only as potential. This identity,\nabstract as it thus appears, between the two categories may be at\nonce met and opposed by their diversity; and this was the very answer\ngiven to Anselm long ago. In short, the conception and existence of\nthe finite is set in antagonism to the infinite; for, as previously\nremarked, the finite possesses objectivity of such a kind as is at\nonce incongruous with and different from the end or aim, its essence\nand notion. Or, the finite is such a conception and in such a way\nsubjective, that it does not involve existence. This objection and this\nantithesis are got over, only by showing the finite to be untrue and\nthese categories in their separation to be inadequate and null. Their\nidentity is thus seen to be one into which they spontaneously pass\nover, and in which they are reconciled.\nB.--THE OBJECT.\n194.] The Object is immediate being, because insensible to difference,\nwhich in it has suspended itself. It is, further, a totality in itself,\nwhilst at the same time (as this identity is only the _implicit_\nidentity of its dynamic elements) it is equally indifferent to its\nimmediate unity. It thus breaks up into distinct parts, each of which\nis itself the totality. Hence the object is the absolute contradiction\nbetween a complete independence of the multiplicity, and the equally\ncomplete non-independence of the different pieces.\nThe definition, which states that the Absolute is the Object, is most\ndefinitely implied in the Leibnizian Monad. The Monads are each an\nobject, but an object implicitly 'representative,' indeed the total\nrepresentation of the world. In the simple unity of the Monad, all\ndifference is merely ideal, not independent or real. Nothing from\nwithout comes into the monad: It is the whole notion in itself, only\ndistinguished by its own greater or less development. None the less,\nthis simple totality parts into the absolute multeity of differences,\neach becoming an independent monad. In the monad of monads, and the\nPre-established Harmony of their inward developments, these substances\nare in like manner again reduced to 'ideality' and unsubstantiality.\nThe philosophy of Leibnitz, therefore, represents contradiction in its\ncomplete development.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAs Fichte in modern times has especially and with justice insisted,\nthe theory which regards the Absolute or God as the Object and there\nstops, expresses the point of view taken by superstition and slavish\nfear. No doubt God is the Object, and, indeed, the Object out and\nout, confronted with which our particular or subjective opinions and\ndesires have no truth and no validity. As absolute object however, God\ndoes not therefore take up the position of a dark and hostile power\nover against subjectivity. He rather involves it as a vital element in\nHimself. Such also is the meaning of the Christian doctrine, according\nto which God has willed that all men should be saved and all attain\nblessedness. The salvation and the blessedness of men are attained when\nthey come to feel themselves at one with God, so that God, on the other\nhand, ceases to be for them mere object, and, in that way, an object\nof fear and terror, as was especially the case with the religious\nconsciousness of the Romans. But God in the Christian religion is\nalso known as Love, because in His Son, who is one with Him, He has\nrevealed Himself to men as a man amongst men, and thereby redeemed\nthem. All which is only another way of saying that the antithesis of\nsubjective and objective is implicitly overcome, and that it is our\naffair to participate in this redemption by laying aside our immediate\nsubjectivity (putting off the old Adam), and learning to know God as\nour true and essential self.\nJust as religion and religious worship consist in overcoming the\nantithesis of subjectivity and objectivity, so science too and\nphilosophy have no other task than to overcome this antithesis by the\nmedium of thought. The aim of knowledge is to divest the objective\nworld that stands opposed to us of its strangeness, and, as the phrase\nis, to find ourselves at home in it: which means no more than to trace\nthe objective world back to the notion,--to our innermost self. We\nmay learn from the present discussion the mistake of regarding the\nantithesis of subjectivity and objectivity as an abstract and permanent\none. The two are wholly dialectical. The notion is at first only\nsubjective: but without the assistance of any foreign material or stuff\nit proceeds, in obedience to its own action, to objectify itself. So,\ntoo, the object is not rigid and processless. Its process is to show\nitself as what is at the same time subjective, and thus form the step\nonwards to the idea. Any one who, from want of familiarity with the\ncategories of subjectivity and objectivity, seeks to retain them in\ntheir abstraction, will find that the isolated categories slip through\nhis fingers before he is aware, and that he says the exact contrary of\nwhat he wanted to say.\n(2) Objectivity contains the three forms of Mechanism, Chemism,\nand Teleology. The object of mechanical type is the immediate and\nundifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the\ndifferent pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other,\nand their connexion is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary,\nthe object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such\na way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to\neach other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality.\nThe third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the\nunity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object,\nis a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of\ndifferentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring\nitself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the\nrealisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea.\n(a) _Mechanism._\n196.] The object (1) in its immediacy is the notion only potentially;\nthe notion as subjective is primarily outside it; and all its\nspecific character is imposed from without. As a unity of differents,\ntherefore, it is a composite, an aggregate; and its capacity of\nacting on anything else continues to be an external relation. This is\nFormal Mechanism.--Notwithstanding, and in this connexion and\nnon-independence, the objects remain independent and offer resistance,\nexternal to each other.\nPressure and impact are examples of mechanical relations. Our knowledge\nis said to be mechanical or by rote, when the words have no meaning\nfor us, but continue external to sense, conception, thought; and\nwhen, being similarly external to each other, they form a meaningless\nsequence. Conduct, piety, &c. are in the same way mechanical, when a\nman's behaviour is settled for him by ceremonial laws, by a spiritual\nadviser, &c.; in short, when his own mind and will are not in his\nactions, which in this way are extraneous to himself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMechanism, the first form of objectivity, is also the category which\nprimarily offers itself to reflection, as it examines the objective\nworld. It is also the category beyond which reflection seldom goes.\nIt is, however, a shallow and superficial mode of observation, one\nthat cannot carry us through in connexion with Nature and still less\nin connexion with the world of Mind. In Nature it is only the veriest\nabstract relations of matter in its inert masses which obey the law of\nmechanism. On the contrary the phenomena and operations of the province\nto which the term 'physical' in its narrower sense is applied, such as\nthe phenomena of light, heat, magnetism, and electricity, cannot be\nexplained by any mere mechanical processes, such as pressure, impact,\ndisplacement of parts, and the like. Still less satisfactory is it\nto transfer these categories and apply them in the field of organic\nnature; at least if it be our aim to understand the specific features\nof that field, such as the growth and nourishment of plants, or, it\nmay be, even animal sensation. It is at any rate a very deep-seated,\nand perhaps the main, defect of modern researches into nature, that,\neven where other and higher categories than those of mere mechanism\nare in operation, they still stick obstinately to the mechanical laws;\nalthough they thus conflict with the testimony of unbiassed perception,\nand foreclose the gate to an-adequate knowledge of nature. But even\nin considering the formations in the world of Mind, the mechanical\ntheory has been repeatedly invested with an authority which it has no\nright to. Take as an instance the remark that man consists of soul and\nbody. In this language, the two things stand each self-subsistent, and\nassociated only from without. Similarly we find the soul regarded as a\nmere group of forces and faculties, subsisting independently side by\nside.\nThus decidedly must we reject the mechanical mode of inquiry when it\ncomes forward and arrogates to itself the place of rational cognition\nin general, and seeks to get mechanism accepted as an absolute\ncategory. But we must not on that account forget expressly to vindicate\nfor mechanism the right and import of a general logical category. It\nwould be, therefore, a mistake to restrict it to the special physical\ndepartment from which it derives its name. There is no harm done, for\nexample, in directing attention to mechanical actions, such as that\nof gravity, the lever, &c, even in departments, notably in physics\nand in physiology, beyond the range of mechanics proper. It must\nhowever be remembered, that within these spheres the laws of mechanism\ncease to be final or decisive, and sink, as it were, to a subservient\nposition. To which may be added, that, in Nature, when the higher\nor organic functions are in any way checked or disturbed in their\nnormal efficiency, the otherwise subordinate category of mechanism\nis immediately seen to take the upper hand. Thus a sufferer from\nindigestion feels pressure on the stomach, after partaking of certain\nfood in slight quantity; whereas those whose digestive organs are sound\nremain free from the sensation, although they have eaten as much. The\nsame phenomenon occurs in the general feeling of heaviness in the\nlimbs, experienced in bodily indisposition. Even in the world of Mind,\nmechanism has its place; though there, too, it is a subordinate one. We\nare right in speaking of mechanical memory, and all sorts of mechanical\noperations, such as reading, writing, playing on musical instruments,\n&c. In memory, indeed, the mechanical quality of the action is\nessential: a circumstance, the neglect of which has not unfrequently\ncaused great harm in the training of the young, from the misapplied\nzeal of modern educationalists for the freedom of intelligence. It\nwould betray bad psychology, however, to have recourse to mechanism for\nan explanation of the nature of memory, and to apply mechanical laws\nstraight off to the soul. The mechanical feature in memory lies merely\nin the fact that certain signs, tones, &c. are apprehended in their\npurely external association, and then reproduced in this association,\nwithout attention being expressly directed to their meaning and inward\nassociation. To become acquainted with these conditions of mechanical\nmemory requires no further study of mechanics, nor would that study\ntend at all to advance the special inquiry of psychology.\n196.] The want of stability in itself which allows the object to suffer\nviolence, is possessed by it (see preceding \u00a7) only in so far as it\nhas a certain stability. Now as the object is implicitly invested\nwith the character of notion, the one of these characteristics is not\nmerged into its other; but the object, through the negation of itself\n(its lack of independence), closes with itself, and not till it so\ncloses, is it independent. Thus at the same time in distinction from\nthe outwardness, and negativing that outwardness in its independence,\ndoes this independence form a negative unity with self,--Centrality\n(subjectivity). So conceived, the object itself has direction and\nreference towards the external. But this external object is similarly\ncentral in itself, and being so, is no less only referred towards the\nother centre; so that it no less has its centrality in the other. This\nis (2) Mechanism with Affinity (with bias, or 'difference'), and\nmay be illustrated by gravitation, appetite, social instinct, &c.\n197.] This relationship, when fully carried out, forms a syllogism. In\nthat syllogism the immanent negativity, as the central individuality\nof an object, (abstract centre,) relates itself to non-independent\nobjects, as the other extreme, by a mean which unites the centrality\nwith the non-independence of the objects, (relative centre.) This is\n(3) Absolute Mechanism.\n198.] The syllogism thus indicated (I--P--U) is a triad of syllogisms.\nThe wrong individuality of non-independent objects, in which formal\nMechanism is at home, is, by reason of that non-independence, no\nless universality, though it be only external. Hence these objects\nalso form the mean between the absolute and the relative centre\n(the form of syllogism being U--I--P): for it is by this want of\nindependence that those two are kept asunder and made extremes, as\nwell as related to one another. Similarly absolute centrality, as the\npermanently-underlying universal substance (illustrated by the gravity\nwhich continues identical), which as pure negativity equally includes\nindividuality in it, is what mediates between the relative centre and\nthe non-independent objects (the form of syllogism being P--U--I). It\ndoes so no less essentially as a disintegrating force, in its character\nof immanent individuality, than in virtue of universality, acting as an\nidentical bond of union and tranquil self-containedness.\nLike the solar system, so for example in the practical sphere the state\nis a system of three syllogisms. (1) The Individual or person, through\nhis particularity or physical or mental needs (which when carried\nout to their full development give _civil_ society), is coupled with\nthe universal, _i.e._ with society, law, right, government. (2) The\nwill or action of the individuals is the intermediating force which\nprocures for these needs satisfaction in society, in law, &c, and\nwhich gives to society, law, &c. their fulfilment and actualisation.\n(3) But the universal, that is to say the state, government, and law,\nis the permanent underlying mean in which the individuals and their\nsatisfaction have and receive their fulfilled reality, inter-mediation,\nand persistence. Each of the functions of the notion, as it is brought\nby intermediation to coalesce with the other extreme, is brought\ninto union with itself and produces itself: which production is\nself-preservation.--It is only by the nature of this triple coupling,\nby this triad of syllogisms with the name _termini,_ that a whole is\nthoroughly understood in its organisation.\n199.] The immediacy of existence, which the objects have in Absolute\nMechanism, is implicitly negatived by the fact that their independence\nis derived from, and due to, their connexions with each other, and\ntherefore to their own want of stability. Thus the object must be\nexplicitly stated as in its existence having an Affinity (or a\nbias) towards its other,--as not-indifferent.\n(b) _Chemism_.\n200.] The not-indifferent (biassed) object has an immanent mode which\nconstitutes its nature, and in which it has existence. But as it is\ninvested with the character of total notion, it is the contradiction\nbetween this totality and the special mode of its existence.\nConsequently it is the constant endeavour to cancel this contradiction\nand to make its definite being equal to the notion.\n*       *       *       *       *\nChemism is a category of objectivity which, as a rule, is not\nparticularly emphasised, and is generally put under the head of\nmechanism. The common name of mechanical relationship is applied to\nboth, in contra-distinction to the teleological. There is a reason for\nthis in the common feature which belongs to mechanism and chemism. In\nthem the notion exists, but only implicit and latent, and they are thus\nboth marked off from teleology where the notion has real independent\nexistence. This is true: and yet chemism and mechanism are very\ndecidedly distinct. The object, in the form of mechanism, is primarily\nonly an indifferent reference to self, while the chemical object is\nseen to be completely in reference to something else. No doubt even\nin mechanism, as it develops itself, there spring up references to\nsomething else: but the nexus of mechanical objects with one another is\nat first only an external nexus, so that the objects in connexion with\none another still retain the semblance of independence. In nature, for\nexample; the several celestial bodies, which form our solar system,\ncompose a kinetic system, and thereby show that they are related to\none another. Motion, however, as the unity of time and space, is a\nconnexion which is purely abstract and external. And it seems therefore\nas if these celestial bodies, which are thus externally connected with\neach other, would continue to be what they are, even apart from this\nreciprocal relation. The case is quite different with chemism. Objects\nchemically biassed are what they are expressly by that bias alone.\nHence they are the absolute impulse towards integration by and in one\nanother.\n201.] The product of the chemical process consequently is the Neutral\nobject, latent in the two extremes, each on the alert. The notion\nor concrete universal, by means of the bias of the objects (the\nparticularity), coalesces with the individuality (in the shape of the\nproduct), and in that only with itself. In this process too the other\nsyllogisms are equally involved. The place of mean is taken both by\nindividuality as activity, and by the concrete universal, the essence\nof the strained extremes; which essence reaches definite being in the\nproduct.\n202.] Chemism, as it is a reflectional nexus of objectivity, has\npre-supposed, not merely the bias or non-indifferent nature of the\nobjects, but also their immediate independence. The process of chemism\nconsists in passing to and fro from one form to another; which forms\ncontinue to be as external as before.--In the neutral product the\nspecific properties, which the extremes bore towards each other, are\nmerged. But although the product is conformable to the notion, the\ninspiring principle of active differentiation does not exist in it; for\nit has sunk back to immediacy. The neutral body is therefore capable\nof disintegration. But the discerning principle, which breaks up the\nneutral body into biassed and strained extremes, and which gives to\nthe indifferent object in general its affinity and animation towards\nanother;--that principle, and the process as a separation with tension,\nfalls outside of that first process.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe chemical process does not rise above a conditioned and finite\nprocess. The notion as notion is only the heart and core of the\nprocess, and does not in this stage come to an existence of its own.\nIn the neutral product the process is extinct, and the existing cause\nfalls outside it.\n203.] Each of these two processes, the reduction of the biassed\n(not-indifferent) to the neutral, and the differentiation of the\nindifferent or neutral, goes its own way without hindrance from the\nother. But that want of inner connexion shows that they are finite,\nby their passage into products in which they are merged and lost.\nConversely the process exhibits the nonentity of the pre-supposed\nimmediacy of the not-indifferent objects.--By this negation of\nimmediacy and of externalism in which the notion as object was sunk,\nit is liberated and invested with independent being in face of that\nexternalism and immediacy. In these circumstances it is the End (Final\nCause).\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe passage from chemism to the teleological relation is implied in the\nmutual cancelling of both of the forms of the chemical process. The\nresult thus attained is the liberation of the notion, which in chemism\nand mechanism was present only in the germ, and not yet evolved. The\nnotion in the shape of the aim or end thus comes into independent\nexistence.\n(c) _Teleology._\n204.] In the End the notion has entered on free existence\nand has a being of its own, by means of the negation of immediate\nobjectivity. It is characterised as subjective, seeing that this\nnegation is, in the first place, abstract, and hence at first the\nrelation between it and objectivity still one of contrast. This\ncharacter of subjectivity, however, compared with the totality of the\nnotion, is one-sided, and that, be it added, for the End itself, in\nwhich all specific characters have been put as subordinated and merged.\nFor it therefore even the object, which it pre-supposes, has only\nhypothetical (ideal) reality,--essentially no-reality. The End in short\nis a contradiction of its self-identity against the negation stated in\nit, _i.e._ its antithesis to objectivity, and being so, contains the\neliminative or destructive activity which negates the antithesis and\nrenders it identical with itself. This is the realisation of the End:\nin which, while it turns itself into the other of its subjectivity and\nobjectifies itself, thus cancelling the distinction between the two, it\nhas only closed with itself, and retained itself.\nThe notion of Design or End, while on one hand called redundant, is on\nanother justly described as the rational notion, and contrasted with\nthe abstract universal of understanding. The latter only _subsumes_\nthe particular, and so connects it with itself: but has it not in its\nown nature.--The distinction between the End or _final cause,_ and the\nmere _efficient cause_ (which is the cause ordinarily so called), is of\nsupreme importance. Causes, properly so called, belong to the sphere of\nnecessity, blind, and not yet laid bare. The cause therefore appears\nas passing into its correlative, and losing its primordiality there by\nsinking into dependency. It is only by implication, or for us, that\nthe cause is in the effect made for the first time a cause, and that\nit there returns into itself. The End, on the other hand, is expressly\nstated as containing the specific character in its own self,--the\neffect, namely, which in the purely causal relation is never free from\notherness. The End therefore in its efficiency does not pass over, but\nretains itself, _i.e._ it carries into effect itself only, and is at\nthe end what it was in the beginning or primordial state. Until it thus\nretains itself, it is not genuinely primordial.--The End then requires\nto be speculatively apprehended as the notion, which itself in the\nproper unity and ideality of its characteristics contains the judgment\nor negation,--the antithesis of subjective and objective,--and which to\nan equal extent suspends that antithesis.\nBy End however we must not at once, nor must we ever merely, think\nof the form which it has in consciousness as a mode of mere mental\nrepresentation. By means of the notion of Inner Design Kant has\nresuscitated the Idea in general and particularly the idea of life.\nAristotle's definition of life virtually implies inner design, and is\nthus far in advance of the notion of design in modern Teleology, which\nhad in view finite and outward design only.\nAnimal wants and appetites are some of the readiest instances of\nthe End. They are the _felt_ contradiction, which exists _within_\nthe living subject, and pass into the activity of negating this\nnegation which mere subjectivity still is. The satisfaction of the\nwant or appetite restores the peace between subject and object. The\nobjective thing which, so long as the contradiction exists, _i.e._\nso long as the want is felt, stands on the other side, loses this\nquasi-independence, by its union with the subject. Those who talk of\nthe permanence and immutability of the finite, as well subjective as\nobjective, may see the reverse illustrated in the operations of every\nappetite. Appetite is, so to speak, the conviction that the subjective\nis only a half-truth, no more adequate than the objective. But appetite\nin the second place carries out its conviction. It brings about the\nsupersession of these finites: it cancels the antithesis between the\nobjective which would be and stay an objective only, and the subjective\nwhich in like manner would be and stay a subjective only.\nAs regards the action of the End, attention may be called to the fact,\nthat in the syllogism, which represents that action, and shows the end\nclosing with itself by the means of realisation, the radical feature is\nthe negation of the _termini._ That negation is the one just mentioned\nboth of the immediate subjectivity appearing in the End as such, and\nof the immediate objectivity as seen in the means and the objects\npre-supposed. This is the same negation, as is in operation when the\nmind leaves the contingent things of the world as well as its own\nsubjectivity and rises to God. It is the 'moment' or factor which (as\nnoticed in the Introduction and \u00a7 192) was overlooked and neglected in\nthe analytic form of syllogisms, under which the so-called proofs of\nthe Being of a God presented this elevation.\n205.] In its primary and immediate aspect the Teleological relation\nis _external_ design, and the notion confronts a pre-supposed object.\nThe End is consequently finite, and that partly in its content,\npartly in the circumstance that it has an external condition in the\nobject, which has to be found existing, and which is taken as material\nfor its realisation. Its self-determining is to that extent in form\nonly. The un-mediatedness of the End has the further result that\nits particularity or content--which as form-characteristic is the\nsubjectivity of the End--is reflected into self, and so different from\nthe totality of the form, subjectivity in general, the notion. This\nvariety constitutes the finitude of Design within its own nature. The\ncontent of the End. in this way, is quite as limited, contingent, and\ngiven, as the object is particular and found ready to hand.\n*       *       *       *       *\nGenerally speaking, the final cause is taken to mean nothing more\nthan external design. In accordance with this view of it, things are\nsupposed not to carry their vocation in themselves, but merely to be\nmeans employed and spent in realising a purpose which lies outside\nof them. That may be said to be the point of view taken by Utility,\nwhich once played a great part even in the sciences, but of late has\nfallen into merited disrepute, now that people have begun to see that\nit failed to give a genuine insight into the nature of things. It is\ntrue that finite things as finite ought in justice to be viewed as\nnon-ultimate, and as pointing beyond themselves. This negativity of\nfinite things however is their own dialectic, and in order to ascertain\nit we must pay attention to their positive content.\nTeleological observations on things often proceed from a well-meant\nwish to display the wisdom of God as it is especially revealed in\nnature. Now in thus trying to discover final causes for which the\nthings serve as means, we must remember that we are stopping short\nat the finite, and are liable to fall into trifling reflections: as,\nfor instance, if we not merely studied the vine in respect of its\nwell-known use for man, but proceeded to consider the cork-tree in\nconnexion with the corks which are cut from its bark to put into the\nwine-bottles. Whole books used to be written in this spirit. It is easy\nto see that they promoted the genuine interest neither of religion nor\nof science. External design stands immediately in front of the idea:\nbut what thus stands on the threshold often for that reason is least\nadequate.\n206.] The teleological relation is a syllogism in which the subjective\nend coalesces with the objectivity external to it, through a middle\nterm which is the unity of both. This unity is on one hand the\n_purposive_ action, on the other the _Means, i.e._ objectivity made\ndirectly subservient to purpose.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe development from End to Idea ensues by three stages, first,\nSubjective End; second, End in process of accomplishment; and third,\nEnd accomplished. First of all we have the Subjective End; and that,\nas the notion in independent being, is itself the totality of the\nelementary functions of the notion. The first of these functions\nis that of self-identical universality, as it were the neutral\nfirst water, in which everything is involved, but nothing as yet\ndiscriminated. The second of these elements is the particularising\nof this universal, by which it acquires a specific content. As this\nspecific content again is realised by the agency of the universal, the\nlatter returns by its means back to itself, and coalesces with itself.\nHence too when we set some end before us, we say that we 'conclude' to\ndo something: a phrase which implies that we were, so to speak, open\nand accessible to this or that determination. Similarly we also at a\nfurther step speak of a man 'resolving' to do something, meaning that\nthe agent steps forward out of his self-regarding inwardness and enters\ninto dealings with the environing objectivity. This supplies the step\nfrom the merely Subjective End to the purposive action which tends\noutwards.\n207.] (1) The first syllogism of the final cause represents the\nSubjective End. The universal notion is brought to unite with\nindividuality by means of particularity, so that the individual\nas self-determination acts as judge. That is to say, it not only\nparticularises or makes into a determinate content the still\nindeterminate universal, but also explicitly puts an antithesis of\nsubjectivity and objectivity, and at the same time is in its own self\na return to itself; for it stamps the subjectivity of the notion,\npre-supposed as against objectivity, with the mark of defect, in\ncomparison with the complete and rounded totality, and thereby at the\nsame time turns outwards.\n208.] (2) This action which is directed outwards is the individuality,\nwhich in the Subjective End is identical with the particularity\nunder which, along with the content, is also comprised the external\nobjectivity. It throws itself in the first place immediately upon the\nobject, which it appropriates to itself as a Means. The notion is this\nimmediate power; for the notion is the self-identical negativity, in\nwhich the being of the object is characterised as wholly and merely\nideal.--The whole Means then is this inward power of the notion, in the\nshape of an agency, with which the object as Means is 'immediately'\nunited and in obedience to which it stands.\nIn finite teleology the Means is thus broken up into two elements\nexternal to each other, (a) the action and (b) the object which serves\nas Means. The relation of the final cause as power to this object, and\nthe subjugation of the object to it, is immediate (it forms the first\npremiss in the syllogism) to this extent, that in the teleological\nnotion as the self-existent ideality the object is put as potentially\nnull. This relation, as represented in the first premiss, itself\nbecomes the Means, which at the same time involves the syllogism, that\nthrough this relation--in which the action of the End is contained and\ndominant--the End is coupled with objectivity.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe execution of the End is the mediated mode of realising the End; but\nthe immediate realisation is not less needful. The End lays hold of the\nobject immediately, because it is the power over the object, because\nin the End particularity, and in particularity objectivity also, is\ninvolved.--A living being has a body; the soul takes possession of it\nand without intermediary has objectified itself in it. The human soul\nhas much to do, before it makes its corporeal nature into a means. Man\nmust, as it were, take possession of his body, so that it may be the\ninstrument of his soul.\n209.] (3) Purposive action, with its Means, is still directed outwards,\nbecause the End is also _not_ identical with the object, and must\nconsequently first be mediated with it. The Means in its capacity of\nobject stands, in this second premiss, in direct relation to the other\nextreme of the syllogism, namely, the material or objectivity which is\npre-supposed. This relation is the sphere of chemism and mechanism,\nwhich have now become the servants of the Final Cause, where lies their\ntruth and free notion. Thus the Subjective End, which is the power\nruling these processes, in which the objective things wear themselves\nout on one another, contrives to keep itself free from them, and to\npreserve itself in them. Doing so, it appears as the Cunning of reason.\n*       *       *       *       *\nReason is as cunning as it is powerful. Cunning may be said to lie\nin the inter-mediative action which, while it permits the objects to\nfollow their own bent and act upon one another till they waste away,\nand does not itself directly interfere in the process, is nevertheless\nonly working out its own aims. With this explanation, Divine Providence\nmay be said to stand to the world and its process in the capacity of\nabsolute cunning. God lets men do as they please with their particular\npassions and interests; but the result is the accomplishment of--not\ntheir plans, but His, and these differ decidedly from the ends\nprimarily sought by those whom He employs.\n210.] The realised End is thus the overt unity of subjective and\nobjective. It is however essentially characteristic of this unity, that\nthe subjective and objective are neutralised and cancelled only in the\npoint of their one-sidedness, while the objective is subdued and made\nconformable to the End, as the free notion, and thereby to the power\nabove it. The End maintains itself against and in the objective\nfor it is no mere one-sided subjective or particular, it is also the\nconcrete universal, the implicit identity of both. This universal, as\nsimply reflected in itself, is the content which remains unchanged\nthrough all the three _termini_ of the syllogism and their movement.\n211.] In finite design, however, even the executed End has the same\nradical rift or flaw as had the Means and the initial End. We have\ngot therefore only a form extraneously impressed on a pre-existing\nmaterial: and this form, by reason of the limited content of the End,\nis also a contingent characteristic. The End achieved consequently is\nonly an object, which again becomes a Means or material for other Ends,\nand so on for ever.\n212.] But what virtually happens in the realising of the End is that\nthe one-sided subjectivity and the show of objective independence\nconfronting it are both cancelled. In laying hold of the means, the\nnotion constitutes itself the very implicit essence of the object. In\nthe mechanical and chemical processes the independence of the object\nhas been already dissipated implicitly, and in the course of their\nmovement under the dominion of the End, the show of that independence,\nthe negative which confronts the notion, is got rid of. But in the fact\nthat the End achieved is characterised only as a Means and a material,\nthis object, viz. the teleological, is there and then put as implicitly\nnull, and only 'ideal.' This being so, the antithesis between form\nand content has also vanished. While the End by the removal and\nabsorption of all form-characteristics coalesces with itself, the form\nas self-identical is thereby put as the content, so that the notion,\nwhich is the action of form, has only itself for content. Through this\nprocess, therefore, there is made explicitly manifest what was the\nnotion of design: viz. the implicit unity of subjective and objective\nis now realised. And this is the Idea.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThis finitude of the End consists in the circumstance, that, in the\nprocess of realising it, the material, which is employed as a means,\nis only externally subsumed under it and made conformable to it. But,\nas a matter of fact, the object is the notion implicitly: and thus\nwhen the notion, in the shape of End, is realised in the object, we\nhave but the manifestation of the inner nature of the object itself.\nObjectivity is thus, as it were, only a covering under which the notion\nlies concealed. Within the range of the finite we can never see or\nexperience that the End has been really secured. The consummation of\nthe infinite End, therefore, consists merely in removing the illusion\nwhich makes it seem yet unaccomplished. The Good, the absolutely Good,\nis eternally accomplishing itself in the world: and the result is that\nit needs not wait upon us, but is already by implication, as well as in\nfull actuality, accomplished. This is the illusion under which we live.\nIt alone supplies at the same time the actualising force on which the\ninterest in the world reposes. In the course of its process the Idea\ncreates that illusion, by setting an antithesis to confront it; and its\naction consists in getting rid of the illusion which it has created.\nOnly out of this error does the truth arise. In this fact lies the\nreconciliation with error and with finitude. Error or other-being, when\nsuperseded, is still a necessary dynamic element of truth: for truth\ncan only be where it makes itself its own result.\nC.--THE IDEA.\n213.] The Idea is truth in itself and for itself,--the absolute\nunity of the notion and objectivity. Its 'ideal' content is nothing\nbut the notion in its detailed terms: its 'real' content is only the\nexhibition which the notion gives itself in the form of external\nexistence, whilst yet, by enclosing this shape in its ideality, it\nkeeps it in its power, and so keeps itself in it.\nThe definition, which declares the Absolute to be the Idea, is itself\nabsolute. All former definitions come back to this. The Idea is\nthe Truth: for Truth is the correspondence of objectivity with the\nnotion:--not of course the correspondence of external things with my\nconceptions,--for these are only _correct_ conceptions held by _me,_\nthe individual person. In the idea we have nothing to do with the\nindividual, nor with figurate conceptions, nor with external things.\nAnd yet, again, everything actual, in so far as it is true, is the\nIdea, and has its truth by and in virtue of the Idea alone. Every\nindividual being is some one aspect of the Idea: for which, therefore,\nyet other actualities are needed, which in their turn appear to have\na self-subsistence of their own. It is only in them altogether and\nin their relation that the notion is realised. The individual by\nitself does not correspond to its notion. It is this limitation of its\nexistence which constitutes the finitude and the ruin of the individual.\nThe Idea itself is not to be taken as an idea of something or other,\nany more than the notion is to be taken as merely a specific notion.\nThe Absolute is the universal and one idea, which, by an act of\n'judgment,' particularises itself to the system of specific ideas;\nwhich after all are constrained by their nature to come back to the one\nidea where their truth lies. As issued out of this 'judgment' the Idea\nis _in the first place_ only the one universal _substance:_ but its\ndeveloped and genuine actuality is to be as a _subject_ and in that way\nas mind.\nBecause it has no _existence_ for starting-point and _point d'appui,_\nthe Idea is frequently treated as a mere logical form. Such a view must\nbe abandoned to those theories, which ascribe so-called reality and\ngenuine actuality to the existent thing and all the other categories\nwhich have not yet penetrated as far as the Idea. It is no less false\nto imagine the Idea to be mere abstraction. It is abstract certainly,\nin so far as everything untrue is consumed in it: but in its own self\nit is essentially concrete, because it is the free notion giving\ncharacter to itself, and that character, reality. It would be an\nabstract form, only if the notion, which is its principle, were taken\nas an abstract unity, and not as the negative return of it into self\nand as the subjectivity which it really is.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTruth is at first taken to mean that I _know_ how something _is._ This\nis truth, however, only in reference to consciousness; it is formal\ntruth, bare correctness. Truth in the deeper sense consists in the\nidentity between objectivity and the notion. It is in this deeper sense\nof truth that we speak of a true state, or of a true work of art. These\nobjects are true, if they are as they ought to be, _i.e._ if their\nreality corresponds to their notion. When thus viewed, to be untrue\nmeans much the same as to be bad. A bad man is an untrue man, a man\nwho does not behave as his notion or his vocation requires. Nothing\nhowever can subsist, if it be _wholly_ devoid of identity between the\nnotion and reality. Even bad and untrue things have being, in so far\nas their reality still, somehow, conforms to their notion. Whatever\nis thoroughly bad or contrary to the notion, is for that very reason\non the way to ruin. It is by the notion alone that the things in the\nworld have their subsistence; or, as it is expressed in the language of\nreligious conception, things are what they are, only in virtue of the\ndivine and thereby creative thought which dwells within them.\nWhen we hear the Idea spoken of, we need not imagine something far\naway beyond this mortal sphere. The idea is rather what is completely\npresent: and it is found, however confused and degenerated, in\nevery consciousness. We conceive the world to ourselves as a great\ntotality which is created by God, and so created that in it God has\nmanifested Himself to us. We regard the world also as ruled by Divine\nProvidence: implying that the scattered and divided parts of the world\nare continually brought back, and made conformable, to the unity from\nwhich they have issued. The purpose of philosophy has always been the\nintellectual ascertainment of the Idea; and everything deserving the\nname of philosophy has constantly been based on the consciousness\nof an absolute unity where the understanding sees and accepts only\nseparation.--It is too late now to ask for proof that the Idea is\nthe truth. The proof of that is contained in the whole deduction and\ndevelopment of thought up to this point. The idea is the result of\nthis course of dialectic. Not that it is to be supposed that the idea\nis mediate only, _i.e._ mediated through something else than itself.\nIt is rather its own result, and being so, is no less immediate than\nmediate. The stages hitherto considered, viz. those of Being and\nEssence, as well as those of Notion and of Objectivity, are not, when\nso distinguished, something permanent, resting upon themselves. They\nhave proved to be dialectical; and their only truth is that they are\ndynamic elements of the idea.\n214.] The Idea may be described in many ways. It may be called reason\n(and this is the proper philosophical signification of reason);\nsubject-object; the unity of the ideal and the real, of the finite and\nthe infinite, of soul and body; the possibility which has its actuality\nin its own self; that of which the nature can be thought only as\nexistent, &c. All these descriptions apply, because the Idea contains\nall the relations of understanding, but contains them in their infinite\nself-return and self-identity.\nIt is easy work for the understanding to show that everything said\nof the Idea is self-contradictory. But that can quite as well be\nretaliated, or rather in the Idea the retaliation is actually made. And\nthis work, which is the work of reason, is certainly not so easy as\nthat of the understanding. Understanding may demonstrate that the Idea\nis self-contradictory: because the subjective is subjective only and is\nalways confronted by the objective,--because being is different from\nnotion and therefore cannot be picked out of it,--because the finite\nis finite only, the exact antithesis of the infinite, and therefore\nnot identical with it; and so on with every term of the description.\nThe reverse of all this however is the doctrine of Logic. Logic shows\nthat the subjective which is to be subjective only, the finite which\nwould be finite only, the infinite which would be infinite only, and so\non, have no truth, but contradict themselves, and pass over into their\nopposites. Hence this transition, and the unity in which the extremes\nare merged and become factors, each with a merely reflected existence,\nreveals itself as their truth.\nThe understanding, which addresses itself to deal with the Idea,\ncommits a double misunderstanding. It takes _first_ the extremes of\nthe Idea (be they expressed as they will, so long as they are in their\nunity), not as they are understood when stamped with this concrete\nunity, but as if they remained abstractions outside of it. It no less\nmistakes the relation between them, ever when it has been expressly\nstated. Thus, for example it overlooks even the nature of the copula\nin the judgment, which affirms that the individual, or subject, is\nafter all not individual, but universal. But, in the _second_ place,\nthe understanding believes _its_ 'reflection,'--that the self-identical\nIdea contains its own negative, or contains contradiction,--to be an\nexternal reflection which does not lie within the Idea itself. But the\nreflection is really no peculiar cleverness of the understanding. The\nIdea itself is the dialectic which for ever divides and distinguishes\nthe self-identical from the differentiated, the subjective from the\nobjective, the finite from the infinite, soul from body. Only on\nthese terms is it an eternal creation, eternal vitality, and eternal\nspirit. But while it thus passes or rather translates itself into the\nabstract understanding, it for ever remains reason. The Idea is the\ndialectic which again makes this mass of understanding and diversity\nunderstand its finite nature and the pseudo-independence in its\nproductions, and which brings the diversity back to unity. Since this\ndouble movement is not separate or distinct in time, nor indeed in any\nother way--otherwise it would be only a repetition of the abstract\nunderstanding--the Idea is the eternal vision of itself in the other,\n--notion which in its objectivity _has_ carried out _itself,_--object\nwhich is inward design, essential subjectivity.\nThe different modes of apprehending the Idea as unity of ideal and\nreal, of finite and infinite, of identity and difference, &c. are more\nor less formal. They designate some one stage of the _specific_ notion.\nOnly the notion itself, however, is free and the genuine universal:\nin the Idea, therefore, the specific character of the notion is\nonly the notion itself,--an objectivity, viz. into which it, being\nthe universal, continues itself, and in which it has only its own\ncharacter, the total character. The Idea is the infinite judgment, of\nwhich the terms are severally the independent totality; and in which,\nas each grows to the fulness of its own nature, it has thereby at the\nsame time passed into the other. None of the other specific notions\nexhibits this totality complete on both its sides as the notion itself\nand objectivity.\n215.] The Idea is essentially a process, because its identity is the\nabsolute and free identity of the notion, only in so far as it is\nabsolute negativity and for that reason dialectical. It is the round of\nmovement, in which the notion, in the capacity of universality which\nis individuality, gives itself the character of objectivity and of the\nantithesis thereto; and this externality which has the notion for its\nsubstance, finds its way back to subjectivity through its immanent\ndialectic.\nAs the idea is (a) a process, it follows that such an expression for\nthe Absolute as _unity_ of thought and being, of finite and infinite,\n&c. is false; for unity expresses an abstract and merely quiescent\nidentity. As the Idea is (b) subjectivity, it follows that the\nexpression is equally false on another account. That unity of which\nit speaks expresses a merely virtual or underlying presence of the\ngenuine unity. The infinite would thus seem to be merely _neutralised_\nby the finite, the subjective by the objective, thought by being. But\nin the negative unity of the Idea, the infinite overlaps and includes\nthe finite, thought overlaps being, subjectivity overlaps objectivity.\nThe unity of the Idea is thought, infinity, and subjectivity, and\nis in consequence to be essentially distinguished from the Idea as\n_substance,_ just as this overlapping subjectivity, thought, or\ninfinity is to be distinguished from the one-sided subjectivity,\none-sided thought, one-sided infinity to which it descends in judging\nand defining.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe idea as a process runs through three stages in its development.\nThe first form of the idea is Life: that is, the idea in the form of\nimmediacy. The second form is that of mediation or differentiation;\nand this is the idea in the form of Knowledge, which appears under\nthe double aspect of the Theoretical and Practical idea. The process\nof knowledge eventuates in the restoration of the unity enriched by\ndifference. This gives the third form of the idea, the Absolute Idea:\nwhich last stage of the logical idea evinces itself to be at the same\ntime the true first, and to have a being due to itself alone.\n(a) _Life._\n216.] The _immediate_ idea is Life. As _soul,_ the notion is\nrealised in a body of whose externality the soul is the immediate\nself-relating universality. But the soul is also its particularisation,\nso that the body expresses no other distinctions than follow from the\ncharacterisations of its notion. And finally it is the Individuality\nof the body as infinite negativity,--the dialectic of that bodily\nobjectivity, with its parts lying out of one another, conveying\nthem away from the semblance of independent subsistence back into\nsubjectivity, so that all the members are reciprocally momentary\nmeans as well as momentary ends. Thus as life is the initial\nparticularisation, so it results in the negative self-asserting unity:\nin the dialectic of its corporeity it only coalesces with itself.\nIn this way life is essentially something alive, and in point of\nits immediacy this individual living thing. It is characteristic of\nfinitude in this sphere that, by reason of the immediacy of the idea,\nbody and soul are separable. This constitutes the mortality of the\nliving being. It is only, however, when the living being is dead, that\nthese two sides of the idea are different _ingredients._\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe single members of the body are what they are only by and in\nrelation to their unity. A hand _e.g._ when hewn off from the body is,\nas Aristotle has observed, a hand in name only, not in fact. From the\npoint of view of understanding, life is usually spoken of as a mystery,\nand in general as incomprehensible. By giving it such a name, however,\nthe Understanding only confesses its own finitude and nullity. So far\nis life from being incomprehensible, that in it the very notion is\npresented to us, or rather the immediate idea existing as a notion. And\nhaving said this, we have indicated the defect of life. Its notion and\nreality do not thoroughly correspond to each other. The notion of life\nis the soul, and this notion has the body for its reality. The soul is,\nas it were, infused into its corporeity; and in that way it is at first\nsentient only, and not yet freely self-conscious. The process of life\nconsists in getting the better of the immediacy with which it is still\nbeset: and this process, which is itself threefold, results in the idea\nunder the form of judgment, _i.e._ the idea as Cognition.\n217.] A living being is a syllogism, of which the very elements are in\nthemselves systems and syllogisms (\u00a7\u00a7 198, 201, 207). They are however\nactive syllogisms or processes; and in the subjective unity of the\nvital agent make only one process. Thus the living being is the process\nof its coalescence with itself, which runs on through three processes.\n218.] (1) The first is the process of the living being inside itself.\nIn that process it makes a split on its own self, and reduces its\ncorporeity to its object or its inorganic nature. This corporeity, as\nan aggregate of correlations, enters in its very nature into difference\nand opposition of its elements, which mutually become each other's\nprey, and assimilate one another, and are retained by producing\nthemselves. Yet this action of the several members (organs), is only\nthe living subject's one act to which their productions revert; so that\nin these productions nothing is produced except the subject: in other\nwords, the subject only reproduces itself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe process of the vital subject within its own limits has in Nature\nthe threefold form of Sensibility, Irritability, and Reproduction. As\nSensibility, the living being is immediately simple self-relation--it\nis the soul omnipresent in its body, the outsideness of each member of\nwhich to others has for it no truth. As Irritability, the living being\nappears split up in itself; and as Reproduction, it is perpetually\nrestoring itself from the inner distinction of its members and organs.\nA vital agent only exists as this continually self-renewing process\nwithin its own limits.\n219.] (2) But the judgment of the notion proceeds, as free, to\ndischarge the objective or bodily nature as an independent totality\nfrom itself; and the negative relation of the living thing to itself\nmakes, as immediate individuality, the pre-supposition of an inorganic\nnature confronting it. As this negative of the animate is no less a\nfunction in the notion of the animate itself, it exists consequently\nin the latter (which is at the same time a concrete universal) in the\nshape of a defect or want. The dialectic by which the object, being\nimplicitly null, is merged, is the action of the self-assured living\nthing, which in this process against an inorganic nature thus retains,\ndevelops, and objectifies itself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe living being stands face to face with an inorganic nature, to which\nit comports itself as a master and which it assimilates to itself.\nThe result of the assimilation is not, as in the chemical process, a\nneutral product in which the independence of the two confronting sides\nis merged; but the living being shows itself as large enough to embrace\nits other which cannot withstand its power. The inorganic nature\nwhich is subdued by the vital agent suffers this fate, because it is\n_virtually_ the same as what life is _actually._ Thus in the other the\nliving being only coalesces with itself. But when the soul has fled\nfrom the body, the elementary powers of objectivity begin their play.\nThese powers are, as it were, continually on the spring, ready to begin\ntheir process in the organic body; and life is the constant battle\nagainst them.\n220.] (3) The living individual, which in its first process comports\nitself as intrinsically subject and notion, through its second\nassimilates its external objectivity and thus puts the character of\nreality into itself. It is now therefore implicitly a Kind, with\nessential universality of nature. The particularising of this Kind is\nthe relation of the living subject to another subject of its Kind: and\nthe judgment is the tie of Kind over these individuals thus appointed\nfor each other. This is the Affinity of the Sexes.\n221.] The process of Kind brings it to a being of its own. Life being\nno more than the idea immediate, the product of this process breaks\nup into two sides. On the one hand, the living individual, which was\nat first pre-supposed as immediate, is now seen to be mediated and\ngenerated. On the other, however, the living individuality, which, on\naccount of its first immediacy, stands in a negative attitude towards\nuniversality, sinks in the superior power of the latter.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe living being dies, because it is a contradiction. Implicitly it is\nthe universal or Kind, and yet immediately it exists as an individual\nonly. Death shows the Kind to be the power that rules the immediate\nindividual. For the animal the process of Kind is the highest point of\nits vitality. But the animal never gets so far in its Kind as to have\na being of its own; it succumbs to the power of Kind. In the process\nof Kind the immediate living being mediates itself with itself, and\nthus rises above its immediacy, only however to sink back into it\nagain. Life thus runs away, in the first instance, only into the false\ninfinity of the progress _ad infinitum._ The real result, however,\nof the process of life, in the point of its notion, is to merge and\novercome that immediacy with which the idea, in the shape of life, is\nstill beset.\n222.] In this manner however the idea of life has thrown off not some\none particular and immediate 'This,' but this first immediacy as a\nwhole. It thus comes to itself, to its truth: it enters upon existence\nas a free Kind self-subsistent. The death of merely immediate and\nindividual vitality is the 'procession' of spirit.\n(b) _Cognition in general._\n223.] The idea exists free for itself, in so far as it has universality\nfor the medium of its existence,--as objectivity itself has\nnotional being,--as the idea is its own object. Its subjectivity,\nthus universalised, is _pure_ self-contained distinguishing of the\nidea,--intuition which keeps itself in this identical universality.\nBut, as _specific_ distinguishing, it is the further judgment of\nrepelling itself as a totality from itself, and thus, in the first\nplace, pre-supposing itself as an external universe. There are two\njudgments, which though implicitly identical are not yet explicitly put\nas identical.\n224.] The relation of these two ideas, which implicitly and as life are\nidentical, is thus one of correlation: and it is that correlativity\nwhich constitutes the characteristic of finitude in this sphere. It\nis the relationship of reflection, seeing that the distinguishing of\nthe idea in its own self is only the first judgment--presupposing the\nother and not yet supposing itself to constitute it. And thus for the\nsubjective idea the objective is the immediate world found ready to\nhand, or the idea as life is in the phenomenon of individual existence.\nAt the same time, in so far as this judgment is pure distinguishing\nwithin its own limits (\u00a7 223), the idea realises in one both itself and\nits other. Consequently it is the certitude of the virtual identity\nbetween itself and the objective world.--Reason comes to the world\nwith an absolute faith in its ability to make the identity actual, and\nto raise its certitude to truth; and with the instinct of realising\nexplicitly the nullity of that contrast which it sees to be implicitly\nnull.\n225.] This process is in general terms Cognition. In Cognition\nin a single act the contrast is virtually superseded, as regards both\nthe one-sidedness of subjectivity and the one-sidedness of objectivity.\nAt first, however, the supersession of the contrast is but implicit.\nThe process as such is in consequence immediately infected with the\nfinitude of this sphere, and splits into the twofold movement of the\ninstinct of reason, presented as two different movements. On the one\nhand it supersedes the one-sidedness of the Idea's subjectivity by\nreceiving the existing world into itself, into subjective conception\nand thought; and with this objectivity, which is thus taken to be\nreal and true, for its content it fills up the abstract certitude of\nitself. On the other hand, it supersedes the one-sidedness of the\nobjective world, which is now, on the contrary, estimated as only a\nmere semblance, a collection of contingencies and shapes at bottom\nvisionary. It modifies and informs that world by the inward nature of\nthe subjective, which is here taken to be the genuine objective. The\nformer is the instinct of science after Truth, Cognition properly so\ncalled:--the Theoretical action of the idea. The latter is the instinct\nof the Good to fulfil the same--the Practical activity of the idea or\nVolition.\n(\u03b1) _Cognition proper._\n226.] The universal finitude of Cognition, which lies in the\none judgment, the pre-supposition of the contrast (\u00a7 224),--a\npre-supposition in contradiction of which its own act lodges protest,\nspecialises itself more precisely on the face of its own idea. The\nresult of that specialisation is, that its two elements receive the\naspect of being diverse from each other, and, as they are at least\ncomplete, they take up the relation of 'reflection,' not of 'notion,'\nto one another. The assimilation of the matter, therefore, as a datum,\npresents itself in the light of a reception of it into categories which\nat the same time remain external to it, and which meet each other in\nthe same style of diversity. Reason is active here, but it is reason in\nthe shape of understanding. The truth which such Cognition can reach\nwill therefore be only finite: the infinite truth (of the notion) is\nisolated and made transcendent, an inaccessible goal in a world of its\nown. Still in its external action cognition stands under the guidance\nof the notion, and notional principles form the secret clue to its\nmovement.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe finitude of Cognition lies in the pre-supposition of a world\nalready in existence, and in the consequent view of the knowing subject\nas a _tabula rasa._ The conception is one attributed to Aristotle;\nbut no man is further than Aristotle from such an outside theory of\nCognition. Such a style of Cognition does not recognise in itself the\nactivity of the notion--an activity which it is implicitly, but not\nconsciously. In its own estimation its procedure is passive. Really\nthat procedure is active.\n227.] Finite Cognition, when it pre-supposes what is distinguished\nfrom it to be something already existing and confronting it,--to be\nthe various facts of external nature or of consciousness--has, in the\nfirst place, (1) Formal identity or the abstraction of universality for\nthe form of its action. Its activity therefore consists in analysing\nthe given concrete object, isolating its differences, and giving them\nthe form of abstract universality. Or it leaves the concrete thing as\na ground, and by setting aside the unessential-looking particulars,\nbrings into relief a concrete universal, the Genus, or Force and Law.\nThis is the Analytical Method.\n*       *       *       *       *\nPeople generally speak of the analytical and synthetical methods,\nas if it depended solely on our choice which we pursued. This is\nfar from the case. It depends on the form of the objects of our\ninvestigation, which of the two methods, that are derivable from the\nnotion of finite cognition, ought to be applied. In the first place,\ncognition is analytical. Analytical cognition deals with an object\nwhich is presented in detachment, and the aim of its action is to\ntrace back to a universal the individual object before it. Thought\nin such circumstances means no more than an act of abstraction or of\nformal identity. That is the sense in which thought is understood by\nLocke and all empiricists. Cognition, it is often said, can never do\nmore than separate the given concrete objects into their abstract\nelements, and then consider these elements in their isolation. It is,\nhowever, at once apparent that this turns things upside down, and that\ncognition, if its purpose be to take things as they are, thereby falls\ninto contradiction with itself. Thus the chemist _e.g._ places a piece\nof flesh in his retort, tortures it in many ways, and then informs us\nthat it consists of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, &c. True: but these\nabstract matters have ceased to be flesh. The same defect occurs in\nthe reasoning of an empirical psychologist when he analyses an action\ninto the various aspects which it presents, and then sticks to these\naspects in their separation. The object which is subjected to analysis\nis treated as a sort of onion from which one coat is peeled off after\nanother.\n228.] This universality is (2) also a specific universality. In this\ncase the line of activity follows the three 'moments' of the notion,\nwhich (as it has not its infinity in finite cognition) is the specific\nor definite notion of understanding. The reception of the object into\nthe forms of this notion is the Synthetic Method.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe movement of the Synthetic method is the reverse of the Analytical\nmethod. The latter starts from the individual, and proceeds to the\nuniversal; in the former the starting-point is given by the universal\n(as a definition), from which we proceed by particularising (in\ndivision) to the individual (the theorem). The Synthetic method thus\npresents itself as the development of the 'moments' of the notion on\nthe object.\n229.] (\u03b1) When the object has been in the first instance brought by\ncognition into the form of the specific notion in general, so that\nin this way its genus and its universal character or speciality are\nexplicitly stated, we have the Definition. The materials and the\nproof of Definition are procured by means of the Analytical method (\u00a7\n227). The specific character however is expected to be a 'mark' only:\nthat is to say it is to be in behoof only of the purely subjective\ncognition which is external to the object.\n*       *       *       *       *\nDefinition involves the three organic elements of the\nnotion: the universal or proximate genus _genus proximum,_\nthe particular or specific character of the genus (_qualitas\nspecified,_) and the individual, or object defined.--The first\nquestion that definition suggests, is where it comes from.\nThe general answer to this question is to say, that definitions\noriginate by way of analysis. This will explain how it\nhappens that people quarrel about the correctness of proposed\ndefinitions; for here everything depends on what\nperceptions we started from, and what points of view we\nhad before our eyes in so doing. The richer the object to\nbe defined is, that is, the more numerous are the aspects\nwhich it offers to our notice, the more various are the definitions\nwe may frame of it. Thus there are quite a host of\ndefinitions of life, of the state, &c. Geometry, on the contrary,\ndealing with a theme so abstract as space, has an easy\ntask in giving definitions. Again, in respect of the matter or\ncontents of the objects defined, there is no constraining\nnecessity present. We are expected to admit that space\nexists, that there are plants, animals, &c, nor is it the business\nof geometry, botany, &c. to demonstrate that the objects\nin question necessarily are. This very circumstance makes\nthe synthetical method of cognition as little suitable for\nphilosophy as the analytical: for philosophy has above all\nthings to leave no doubt of the necessity of its objects. And\nyet several attempts have been made to introduce the synthetical\nmethod into philosophy. Thus Spinoza, in particular,\nbegins with definitions. He says, for instance, that\nsubstance is the _causa sui._ His definitions are unquestionably\na storehouse of the most speculative truth, but it takes the\nshape of dogmatic assertions. The same thing is also true\nof Schelling.\n230.] (\u00df) The statement of the second element of the notion, _i.e._ of\nthe specific character of the universal as particularising, is given by\nDivision in accordance with some external consideration.\n*       *       *       *       *\nDivision we are told ought to be complete. That requires a principle\nor ground of division so constituted, that the division based upon it\nembraces the whole extent of the region designated by the definition\nin general. But, in division, there is the further requirement that\nthe principle of it must be borrowed from the nature of the object in\nquestion. If this condition be satisfied, the division is natural and\nnot merely artificial, that is to say, arbitrary. Thus, in zoology,\nthe ground of division adopted in the classification of the mammalia\nis mainly afforded by their teeth and claws. That is so far sensible,\nas the mammals themselves distinguish themselves from one another by\nthese parts of their bodies; back to which therefore the general type\nof their various classes is to be traced. In every case the genuine\ndivision must be controlled by the notion. To that extent a division,\nin the first instance, has three members: but as particularity\nexhibits itself as double, the division may go to the extent even\nof four members. In the sphere of mind trichotomy is predominant, a\ncircumstance which Kant has the credit of bringing into notice.\n231.] (\u03b3) In the concrete individuality, where the mere unanalysed\nquality of the definition is regarded as a correlation of elements,\nthe object is a synthetical nexus of distinct characteristics. It is\na Theorem. Being different, these characteristics possess but\na mediated identity. To supply the materials, which form the middle\nterms, is the office of Construction: and the process of mediation\nitself, from which cognition derives the necessity of that nexus, is\nthe Demonstration.\nAs the difference between the analytical and synthetical methods is\ncommonly stated, it seems entirely optional which of the two we employ.\nIf we assume, to start with, the concrete thing which the synthetic\nmethod presents as a result, we can analyse from it as consequences\nthe abstract propositions which formed the pre-suppositions and the\nmaterial for the proof. Thus, algebraical definitions of curved lines\nare theorems in the method of geometry. Similarly even the Pythagorean\ntheorem, if made the definition of a right-angled triangle, might yield\nto analysis those propositions which geometry had already demonstrated\non its behoof. The optionalness of either method is due to both alike\nstarting from an external pre-supposition. So far as the nature of\nthe notion is concerned, analysis is prior; since it has to raise the\ngiven material with its empirical concreteness into the form of general\nabstractions, which may then be set in the front of the synthetical\nmethod as definitions.\nThat these methods, however indispensable and brilliantly successful\nin their own province, are unserviceable for philosophical cognition,\nis self-evident. They have pre-suppositions; and their style of\ncognition is that of understanding, proceeding under the canon of\nformal identity. In Spinoza, who was especially addicted to the use of\nthe geometrical method, we are at once struck by its characteristic\nformalism. Yet his ideas were speculative in spirit; whereas the system\nof Wolf, who carried the method out to the height of pedantry, was\neven in subject-matter a metaphysic of the understanding. The abuses\nwhich these methods with their formalism once led to in philosophy\nand science have in modern times been followed by the abuses of what\nis called 'Construction.' Kant brought into vogue the phrase that\nmathematics 'construes' its notions. All that was meant by the phrase\nwas that mathematics has not to do with notions, but with abstract\nqualities of sense-perceptions. The name 'Construction (_construing_)\nof notions' has since been given to a sketch or statement of sensible\nattributes which were picked up from perception, quite guiltless\nof any influence of the notion, and to the additional formalism of\nclassifying scientific and philosophical objects in a tabular form\non some pre-supposed rubric, but in other respects at the fancy and\ndiscretion of the observer. In the background of all this, certainly,\nthere is a dim consciousness of the Idea, of the unity of the notion\nand objectivity,--a consciousness, too, that the idea is concrete. But\nthat play of what is styled 'construing' is far from presenting this\nunity adequately--a unity which is none other than the notion properly\nso called: and the sensuous concreteness of perception is as little the\nconcreteness of reason and the idea.\nAnother point calls for notice. Geometry works with the sensuous but\nabstract perception of space; and in space it experiences no difficulty\nin isolating and defining certain simple analytic modes. To geometry\nalone therefore belongs in its perfection the synthetical method of\nfinite cognition. In its course, however (and this is the remarkable\npoint), it finally stumbles upon what are termed irrational and\nincommensurable quantities; and in their case any attempt at further\nspecification drives it beyond the principle of the understanding.\nThis is only one of many instances in terminology, where the title\nrational is perversely applied to the province of understanding,\nwhile we stigmatise as irrational that which shows a beginning and a\ntrace of rationality. Other sciences, removed as they are from the\nsimplicity of space or number, often and necessarily reach a point\nwhere understanding permits no further advance: but they get over the\ndifficulty without trouble. They make a break in the strict sequence\nof their procedure, and assume whatever they require, though it be\nthe reverse of what preceded, from some external quarter,--opinion,\nperception, conception or any other source. Its inobservancy as to\nthe nature of its methods and their relativity to the subject-matter\nprevents this finite cognition from seeing that, when it proceeds by\ndefinitions and divisions, &c., it is really led on by the necessity\nof the laws of the notion. For the same reason it cannot see when it\nhas reached its limit; nor, if it have transgressed that limit, does it\nperceive that it is in a sphere where the categories of understanding,\nwhich it still continues rudely to apply, have lost all authority.\n232.] The necessity, which finite cognition produces in the\nDemonstration, is, in the first place, an external necessity, intended\nfor the subjective intelligence alone. But in necessity as such,\ncognition itself has left behind its presupposition and starting-point,\nwhich consisted in accepting its content as given or found.\nNecessity _qu\u00e2_ necessity is implicitly the self-relating notion. The\nsubjective idea has thus implicitly reached an original and objective\ndeterminateness,--a something not-given, and for that reason immanent\nin the subject. It has passed over into the idea of Will.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe necessity which cognition reaches by means of the demonstration is\nthe reverse of what formed its starting-point. In its starting-point\ncognition had a given and a contingent content; but now, at the close\nof its movement, it knows its content to be necessary. This necessity\nis reached by means of subjective agency. Similarly, subjectivity\nat starting was quite abstract, a bare _tabula rasa._ It now shows\nitself as a modifying and determining principle. In this way we pass\nfrom the idea of cognition to that of will. The passage, as will be\napparent on a closer examination, means that the universal, to be\ntruly apprehended, must be apprehended as subjectivity, as a notion\nself-moving, active, and form-imposing.\n(\u00df) _Volition._\n233.] The subjective idea as original and objective determinateness,\nand as a simple uniform content, is the Good. Its impulse\ntowards self-realisation is in its behaviour the reverse of the idea of\ntruth, and rather directed towards moulding the world it finds before\nit into a shape conformable to its purposed End.--This Volition has,\non the one hand, the certitude of the nothingness of the pre-supposed\nobject; but, on the other, as finite, it at the same time pre-supposes\nthe purposed End of the Good to be a mere subjective idea, and the\nobject to be independent.\n234.] This action of the Will is finite: and its finitude lies in\nthe contradiction that in the inconsistent terms applied to the\nobjective world the End of the Good is just as much not executed\nas executed,--the end in question put as unessential as much as\nessential,--as actual and at the same, time as merely possible. This\ncontradiction presents itself to imagination as an endless progress in\nthe actualising of the Good; which is therefore set up and fixed as\na mere 'ought,' or goal of perfection. In point of form however this\ncontradiction vanishes when the action supersedes the subjectivity of\nthe purpose, and along with it the objectivity, with the contrast which\nmakes both finite; abolishing subjectivity as a whole and not merely\nthe one-sidedness of this form of it. (For another new subjectivity of\nthe kind, that is, a new generation of the contrast, is not distinct\nfrom that which is supposed to be past and gone.) This return into\nitself is at the same time the content's own 'recollection' that it\nis the Good and the implicit identity of the two sides,--it is a\n'recollection' of the pre-supposition of the theoretical attitude\nof mind (\u00a7 224) that the objective world is its own truth and\nsubstantiality.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhile Intelligence merely proposes to take the world as it is, Will\ntakes steps to make the world what it ought to be. Will looks upon\nthe immediate and given present not as solid being, but as mere\nsemblance without reality. It is here that we meet those contradictions\nwhich are so bewildering from the standpoint of abstract morality.\nThis position in its 'practical' bearings is the one taken by the\nphilosophy of Kant, and even by that of Fichte. The Good, say these\nwriters, has to be realised: we have to work in order to produce it:\nand Will is only the Good actualising itself. If the world then were\nas it ought to be, the action of Will would be at an end. The Will\nitself therefore requires that its End should not be realised. In\nthese words, a correct expression is given to the _finitude_ of Will.\nBut finitude was not meant to be the ultimate point: and it is the\nprocess of Will itself which abolishes finitude and the contradiction\nit involves. The reconciliation is achieved, when Will in its result\nreturns to the pre-supposition made by cognition. In other words, it\nconsists in the unity of the theoretical and practical idea. Will\nknows the end to be its own, and Intelligence apprehends the world as\nthe notion actual. This is the right attitude of rational cognition.\nNullity and transitoriness constitute only the superficial features\nand not the real essence of the world. That essence is the notion in\n_posse_ and in _esse:_ and thus the world is itself the idea. All\nunsatisfied endeavour ceases, when we recognise that the final purpose\nof the world is accomplished no less than ever accomplishing itself.\nGenerally speaking, this is the man's way of looking; while the young\nimagine that the world is utterly sunk in wickedness, and that the\nfirst thing needful is a thorough transformation. The religious mind,\non the contrary, views the world as ruled by Divine Providence, and\ntherefore correspondent with what it ought to be. But this harmony\nbetween the 'is' and the 'ought to be' is not torpid and rigidly\nstationary. Good, the final end of the world, has being, only while it\nconstantly produces itself. And the world of spirit and the world of\nnature continue to have this distinction, that the latter moves only in\na recurring cycle, while the former certainly also makes progress.\n235.] Thus the truth of the Good is laid down as the unity of the\ntheoretical and practical idea in the doctrine that the Good is\nradically and really achieved, that the objective world is in itself\nand for itself the Idea, just as it at the same time eternally lays\nitself down as End, and by action brings about its actuality. This life\nwhich has returned to itself from the bias and finitude of cognition,\nand which by the activity of the notion has become identical with it,\nis the Speculative or Absolute Idea.\n(c) _The Absolute Idea._\n236.] The Idea, as unity of the Subjective and Objective Idea, is\nthe notion of the Idea,--a notion whose object (_Gegenstand_) is the\nIdea as such, and for which the objective (_Objekt_) is Idea,--an\nObject which embraces all characteristics in its unity. This unity\nis consequently I the absolute and all truth, the Idea which thinks\nitself,--and here at least as a thinking or Logical Idea.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe Absolute Idea is, in the first place, the unity of the theoretical\nand practical idea, and thus at the same time the unity of the idea\nof life with the idea of cognition. In cognition we had the idea in a\nbiassed, one-sided shape. The process of cognition has issued in the\noverthrow of this bias and the restoration of that unity, which as\nunity, and in its immediacy, is in the first instance the Idea of Life.\nThe defect of life lies in its being only the idea implicit or natural:\nwhereas cognition is in an equally one-sided way the merely conscious\nidea, or the idea for itself. The unity and truth of these two is the\nAbsolute Idea, which is both in itself and for itself. Hitherto _we_\nhave had the idea in development through its various grades as _our_\nobject, but now the idea comes to be its _own object._ This is the\n\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 which Aristotle long ago termed the supreme form of the\nidea.\n237.] Seeing that there is in it no transition, or presupposition,\nand in general no specific character other than what is fluid and\ntransparent, the Absolute Idea is for itself the pure form of the\nnotion, which contemplates its content as its own self. It is its own\ncontent, in so far as it ideally distinguishes itself from itself,\nand the one of the two things distinguished is a self-identity in\nwhich however is contained the totality of the form as the system of\nterms describing its content. This content is the system of Logic. All\nthat is at this stage left as form for the idea is the Method of this\ncontent,--the specific consciousness of the value and currency of the\n'moments' in its development.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTo speak of the absolute idea may suggest the conception that we are\nat length reaching the right thing and the sum of the whole matter.\nIt is certainly possible to indulge in a vast amount of senseless\ndeclamation about the idea absolute. But its true content is only the\nwhole system of which we have been hitherto studying the development.\nIt may also be said in this strain that the absolute idea is the\nuniversal, but the universal not merely as an abstract form to which\nthe particular content is a stranger, but as the absolute form, into\nwhich all the categories, the whole fullness of the content it has\ngiven being to, have retired. The absolute idea may in this respect be\ncompared to the old man who utters the same creed as the child, but\nfor whom it is pregnant with the significance of a lifetime. Even if\nthe child understands the truths of religion, he cannot but imagine\nthem to be something outside of which lies the whole of life and the\nwhole of the world. The same may be said to be the case with human life\nas a whole and the occurrences with which it is fraught. All work is\ndirected only to the aim or end; and when it is attained, people are\nsurprised to find nothing else but just the very thing which they had\nwished for. The interest lies in the whole movement. When a man traces\nup the steps of his life, the end may appear to him very restricted:\nbut in it the whole _decursus vitae_ is comprehended. So, too, the\ncontent of the absolute idea is the whole breadth of ground which has\npassed under our view up to this point. Last of all comes the discovery\nthat the whole evolution is what constitutes the content and the\ninterest. It is indeed the prerogative of the philosopher to see that\neverything, which, taken apart, is narrow and restricted, receives\nits value by its connexion with the whole, and by forming an organic\nelement of the idea. Thus it is that we have had the content already,\nand what we have now is the knowledge that the content is the living\ndevelopment of the idea. This simple retrospect is contained in the\n_form_ of the idea. Each of the stages hitherto reviewed is an image\nof the absolute, but at first in a limited mode, and thus it is forced\nonwards to the whole, the evolution of which is what we termed Method.\n238.] The several steps or stages of the Speculative Method are,\nfirst of all, (a) the Beginning, which is Being or Immediacy:\nself-subsistent, for the simple reason that it is the beginning. But\nlooked at from the speculative idea, Being is its self-specialising\nact, which as the absolute negativity or movement of the notion makes\na judgment and puts itself as its own negative. Being, which to the\nbeginning as beginning seems mere abstract affirmation, is thus rather\nnegation, dependency, derivation, and pre-supposition. But it is the\nnotion, of which Being is the negation: and the notion is completely\nself-identical in its otherness, and is the certainty of itself. Being\ntherefore is the notion implicit, before it has been explicitly put as\na notion. This Being therefore, as the still unspecified notion,--a\nnotion that is only implicitly or 'immediately' specified--is equally\ndescribable as the Universal.\nWhen it means immediate being, the beginning is taken from sensation\nand perception--the initial stage in the analytical method of finite\ncognition. When it means universality, it is the beginning of the\nsynthetic method. But since the Logical Idea is as much a universal as\nit is in being--since it is pre-supposed by the notion as much as it\nitself immediately _is,_ its beginning is a synthetical as well as an\nanalytical beginning.\n*       *       *       *       *\nPhilosophical method is analytical as well as synthetical, not indeed\nin the sense of a bare juxtaposition or mere alternating employment\nof these two methods of finite cognition, but rather in such a way\nthat it holds them merged in itself. In every one of its movements\ntherefore it displays an attitude at once analytical and synthetical.\nPhilosophical thought proceeds analytically, in so far as it only\naccepts its object, the Idea, and while allowing it its own way, is\nonly, as it were, an on-looker at its movement and development. To this\nextent philosophising is wholly passive. Philosophic thought however is\nequally synthetic, and evinces itself to be the action of the notion\nitself. To that end, however, there is required an effort to keep back\nthe incessant impertinence of our own fancies and private opinions.\n239.] (b) The Advance renders explicit the _judgment_ implicit in\nthe Idea. The immediate universal, as the notion implicit, is the\ndialectical force which on its own part deposes its immediacy and\nuniversality to the level of a mere stage or 'moment.' Thus is put\nthe negative of the beginning, its specific character: it supposes a\ncorrelative, a relation of different terms,--the stage of Reflection.\nSeeing that the immanent dialectic only states explicitly what was\ninvolved in the immediate notion, this advance is Analytical; but\nseeing that in this notion this distinction was not yet stated,--it is\nequally Synthetical.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn the advance of the idea, the beginning exhibits itself as what\nit is implicitly. It is seen to be mediated and derivative, and\nneither to have proper being nor proper immediacy. It is only for\nthe consciousness which is itself immediate, that Nature forms the\ncommencement or immediacy, and that Spirit appears as what is mediated\nby Nature. The truth is that Nature is the creation of Spirit, and it\nis Spirit itself which gives itself a pre-supposition in Nature.\n240.] The abstract form of the advance is, in Being, an other and\ntransition into an other; in Essence showing or reflection in the\nopposite; in Notion, the distinction of individual from universality,\nwhich continues itself as such into, and is as an identity with, what\nis distinguished from it.\n241.] In the second sphere the primarily implicit notion has come as\nfar as shining, and thus is already the idea in germ. The development\nof this sphere becomes a regress into the first, just as the\ndevelopment of the first is a transition into the second.\nIt is only by means of this double movement, that the difference first\ngets its due, when each of the two members distinguished, observed\non its own part, completes itself to the totality, and in this way\nworks out its unity with the other. It is only by both merging their\none-sidedness on their own part, that their unity is kept from becoming\none-sided.\n242.] The second sphere developes the relation of the differents to\nwhat it primarily is,--to the contradiction in its own nature. That\ncontradiction which is seen in the infinite progress is resolved\n(c) into the end or terminus, where the differenced is explicitly\nstated as what it is in notion. The end is the negative of the first,\nand as the identity with that, is the negativity of itself. It is\nconsequently the unity in which both of these Firsts, the immediate\nand the real First, are made constituent stages in thought, merged,\nand at the same time preserved in the unity. The notion, which from\nits implicitness thus comes by means of its differentiation and the\nmerging of that differentiation to close with itself, is the realised\nnotion,--the notion which contains the relativity or dependence of its\nspecial features in its own independence. It is the idea which, as\nabsolutely first (in the method), regards this terminus as merely the\ndisappearance of the show or semblance, which made the beginning appear\nimmediate, and made itself seem a result. It is the knowledge that the\nidea is the one systematic whole.\n243.] It thus appears that the method is not an extraneous form,\nbut the soul and notion of the content, from which it is only\ndistinguished, so far as the dynamic elements of the notion even on\ntheir own part come in their own specific character to appear as the\ntotality of the notion. This specific character, or the content, leads\nitself with the form back to the idea; and thus the idea is presented\nas a systematic totality which is only one idea, of which the several\nelements are each implicitly the idea, whilst they equally by the\ndialectic of the notion produce the simple independence of the idea.\nThe science in this manner concludes by apprehending the notion of\nitself, as of the pure idea for which the idea is.\n244.] The Idea which is independent or for itself, when viewed on the\npoint of this its unity with itself, is Perception or Intuition, and\nthe percipient Idea is Nature. But as intuition the idea is, through\nan external 'reflection,' invested with the one-sided characteristic\nof immediacy, or of negation. Enjoying however an absolute liberty,\nthe Idea does not merely pass over into life, or as finite cognition\nallow life to show in it: in its own absolute truth it resolves to let\nthe 'moment' of its particularity, or of the first characterisation\nand other-being, the immediate idea, as its reflected image, go forth\nfreely as Nature.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWe have now returned to the notion of the Idea with which we began.\nThis return to the beginning is also an advance. We began with Being,\nabstract Being: where we now are we also have the Idea as Being: but\nthis Idea which has Being is Nature.\nNOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS\nCHAPTER I.\nPage 5, \u00a7 2. After-thought = Nachdenken, _e.g._ thought which retraces\nand reproduces an original, but submerged, thought (cf. Hegel's\n_Werke_, vi. p. xv): to be distinguished from Reflexion (cf.\n_Werke_, i. 174).\nP. 7, \u00a7 3.

Fichte, _Werke_, ii. 454: 'Hence for the common sort of\nhearers and readers the uncommon intelligibility of certain sermons and\nlectures and writings, not one word of which is intelligible to the\nman who thinks for himself,--because there is really no intelligence\nin them. The old woman who frequents the church--for whom by the way I\ncherish all possible respect--finds a sermon very intelligible and very\nedifying which contains lots of texts and verses of hymns she knows\nby rote and can repeat. In the same way readers, who fancy themselves\nfar superior to her, find a work very instructive and clear which\ntells them what they already know, and proofs very stringent which\ndemonstrate what they already believe. The pleasure the reader takes in\nthe writer is a concealed pleasure in himself. What a great man! (he\nsays to himself); it is as if I heard or read myself.\nP. 10, \u00a7 6. Cf. Hegel, _Werke>_ viii. 17: 'In this conviction (that\nwhat is reasonable is actual, and what is actual is reasonable) stands\nevery plain man, as well as the philosopher; and from it philosophy\nstarts in the study both of the spiritual and of the natural\nuniverse----The great thing however is, in the show of the temporal\nand the transient to recognise the substance which is immanent and the\neternal which is present. For the work of reason (which is synonymous\nwith the Idea), when in its actuality it simultaneously enters external\nexistence, emerges with an infinite wealth of forms, phenomena and\nphases, and envelopes its kernel with the motley rind with which\nconsciousness is earliest at home,--a rind which the notion must\npenetrate before it can find the inward pulse and feel it still beating\neven in the outward phases. But the infinite variety of circumstance\nwhich is formed in this externality by the light of the essence shining\nin it,--all this infinite material, with its regulations,--is not\nthe object of philosophy.... To comprehend _what is,_ is the task of\nphilosophy: for _what is_ is reason. As regards the individual, each,\nwhatever happens, is a son of his time. So too philosophy is its\ntime apprehended in thoughts. It is just as foolish to fancy that a\nphilosophy can overleap its present world as that an individual can\noverleap his time. If his theory really goes beyond actualities, if it\nconstructs an ideal, a world as it ought to be, then such existence\nas it has is only in his intentions--a yielding element in which\nanything you please may be fancy-formed.' Cf. Schelling, _Werke,_ iv.\n390: 'There are very many things, actions, &c. of which we may judge,\nafter vulgar semblance, that they are unreasonable. All the same we\npresuppose and assume that everything which is or which happens is\nreasonable, and that reason is, in one word, the prime matter and the\nreal of all being.'\nP. 11, \u00a7 6.

'Scholasticus' is the guileless 'freshman,' hero of\ncertain Facetiae (attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher Hierocles)\nwhich used occasionally to form part of the early Greek reading of\nschoolboys.\nK. L. Reinhold (1754-1823) presents in his intellectual history a\npicture of the development of ideas in his age. At the beginning\nhis _Attempt of a new theory of the human representative faculty_\n(1789) is typical of the tendency to give a subjective psychological\ninterpretation of Kant's theory of knowledge But the period of\nReinhold's teaching here referred to is that of _Contributions to an\neasier survey of the condition of philosophy at the beginning of the\nnineteenth century_ (Beitr\u00e4ge, 1801): the tendency which Hegel, who\nreviewed him in the _Critical Journal of Philosophy_ (_Werke,_ i. 267\n_seqq._), calls 'philosophising before philosophy.'--A similar spirit\nis operative in Krug's proposal (in his _Fundamental Philosophy,_ 1803)\nto start with what he called 'philosophical problematics.'\nP. 19, \u00a7 11. Plato, _Phaedo,_ p. 89, where Socrates protests against\nthe tendency to confound the defect of a particular piece of reasoning\nwith the incompetence of human reason altogether.\nP. 22, \u00a7 13. The dictum that the historical succession of philosophical\nsystems is identical with their logical sequence should not be\ntaken too literally and mechanically. Its essential point is simply\nthe theorem that history is not a casual series of unconnected\nevents--the deeds of particular persons, but is an evolution under\nlaws and uniformities:--it is this theorem applied to philosophies.\nBut difficulties may easily arise in the application of the general\nprinciple: _e.g._ it will be seen (by comparison of \u00a7 86 and \u00a7\n104) that though Pythagoras precedes Parmenides, and number is a\nstepping-stone to pure thought still pure Being comes at an earlier\nstage than Quantity.\nP. 23, \u00a7 13. There is a silent reference to what Reinhold professed\nto make the subject of his teaching at Jena--'philosophy without\nsurnames' (ohne Beinamen),--_i.e._ not a 'critical' philosophy;--or\nto the 'Philosophy which may not bear any man's name of Beck. As Hegel\nsays, _Werke,_ xvi. 138, 'The solicitude and apprehension against being\none-sided is only too often part of the weakness which is capable only\nof many-sided illogical superficiality.'\nP. 27, \u00a7 16. By 'anthropology' is meant not the anthropology of modern\nwriters, who use the name to denote mainly the history of human culture\nin its more rudimentary stages, and as exhibited chiefly in material\nproducts, but the study of those aspects of psychology which are most\nclosely allied with physiological conditions.\nWith the power of the intuition of genius to give almost all that\nlogical synthesis can produce, cf. _Werke,_ I. 331: 'In this way\na grand and pure intuition is able, in the purely architectonic\nfeatures of its picture, though the inter-connection of necessity and\nthe mastery of form does not come forward into visibility, to give\nexpression to the genuine ethical organism--like a building which\nsilently exhibits the spirit of its author in the several features of\nits mass, without the image of that spirit being set forth anywhere\nin one united shape. In such a delineation, made by help of notions,\nit is only a want of technical skill which prevents reason from\nraising the principle it embraces and pervades into the \"ideal\" form\nand becoming aware of it as the Idea. If the intuition only remains\ntrue to itself and does not let analytic intellect disconcert it, it\nwill probably--just because it cannot dispense with notions for its\nexpression--behave awkwardly in dealing with them, assume distorted\nshapes in its passage through consciousness, and be (to the speculative\neye) both incoherent and contradictory: but the arrangement of the\nparts and of the self-modifying characters betray the inward spirit of\nreason, however invisible. And so far as this appearance of that spirit\nis regarded as a product and a result, it will as product completely\nharmonise with the Idea.' Probably Goethe is before Hegel's mind.\nP. 28, \u00a7 17. The triplicity in unity of thought--its forthgoing\n'procession,' (cf. p. 362 _seqq._) and its return, which is yet an\nabiding in itself (Bei:sich:sein) was first explicitly schematised\nby Proclus, the consummator of Neo-Platonism. In his _Institutio\nTheologica_ he lays it down that the essential character of all\nspiritual reality (a\u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd) is to be \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, _e.g._\nto return upon itself, or to be a unity in and with difference,--to\nbe an original and spontaneous principle of movement (c. 15): or, as\nin C 31: \u03c0\u1f70\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03c1o\u1fd2\u1f78\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4' \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\n\u1f00\u03c6' \u03bf\u1f57 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.

Truth:--as early as _Werke,_ i. 82, _i.e._ 1801, Hegel had\ncome--perhaps influenced by the example of Jacobi--to the conclusion\nthat 'Truth is a word which, in philosophical discourse, deserves to be\nused only of the certainty of the Eternal and non-empirical Actual.'\n(And so Spinoza, ii. 310.)\nP. 32. 'The young have been flattered'--_e.g._ by Fichte, _Werke,_ i.\n435: 'Hence this science too promises itself few proselytes amongst men\nalready formed: if it can hope for any at all, it hopes for them rather\nfrom the young world, whose inborn force has not yet been ruined in the\nlaxity of the age.'\nP. 38, \u00a7 20. What Kant actually said (_Kritik der reinen Vernunft:\nElementarlehre,_ \u00a7 16), was 'The _I think_ must be able to accompany\nall my conceptions' (Vorstellungen). Here, as often elsewhere. Hegel\nseems to quote from memory,--with some shortcoming from absolute\naccuracy.\nFrom this point Fichte's idealism takes its spring, _e.g. Werke,_ ii.\n505: 'The ground of all certainty,--of all consciousness of fact in\nlife, and of all demonstrative knowledge in science, is this: _In_ and\n_with_ the single thing we affirm (setzen) (and whatever we affirm is\nnecessarily something single) we also affirm the absolute totality as\nsuch.... Only in so far as we have so affirmed anything, is it certain\nfor us,--from the single unit we have comprehended under it away to\nevery single thing in the infinity we shall comprehend under it,--from\nthe one individual who has comprehended it, to all individuals who\nwill comprehend it.... Without this absolute \"positing\" of the absolute\ntotality in the individual, we cannot (to employ a phrase of Jacobi's)\ncome to bed and board.'\n'Obviously therefore you enunciate not the judgment of a single\nobservation, but you embrace and \"posit\" the sheer infinitude and\ntotality of all possible observations:--an infinity which is not at\nall compounded out of finites, but out of which, conversely, the\nfinites themselves issue, and of which finite things are the mere\nalways-uncompleted analysis. This--how shall I call it, procedure,\npositing, or whatever you prefer--this \"manifestation\" of the absolute\ntotality, I call intellectual vision (Anschauung). I regard it--just\nbecause I cannot in any way get beyond intelligence--as immanent in\nintelligence, and name it so far egoity (Ichheit),--not objectivity\nand not subjectivity, but the absolute identity of the two:--an\negoity, however, which it was to be hoped would not be taken to mean\nindividuality. There lies in it, what you' (he is addressing Reinhold,\nwho here follows Bardili)' call a repetibility _ad infinitum._ For me,\ntherefore, the essence of the finite is composed of an immediate vision\nof the absolutely timeless infinite (with an absolute identity of\nsubjectivity and objectivity), and of a separation of the two latter,\nand an analysis (continued _ad infinitum_) of the infinite. In that\nanalysis consists the temporal life: and the starting-point of this\ntemporal life is the separation into subject and object, which through\nthe intellectual vision (intuition) are still both held together.'\nP. 44, \u00a7 22, _the mere fact of conviction._ Cf. _Rechtsphilosophie,_\n\u00a7 140 (_Werke,_ viii. 191): 'Finally the mere conviction which holds\nsomething to be right is given out as what decides the morality of\nan action. The good we will to do not yet having any content, the\nprinciple of conviction adds the information that the subsumption of an\naction under the category of good is purely a personal matter. If this\nbe so, the very pretence of an ethical objectivity is utterly lost. A\ndoctrine like this is closely allied with the self-styled philosophy\nwhich denies that the true is cognoscible: because for the Will,\ntruth--_i.e._ the rationality of the Will--lies in the moral laws.\nGiving out, as such a system does, that the cognition of the true is an\nempty vanity, far transcending the range of science (which recognises\nonly appearance), it must, in the matter of conduct, also find its\nprinciple in the apparent; whereby moral distinctions are reduced to\nthe peculiar theory of life held by the individual and to his private\nconviction. At first no doubt the degradation into which philosophy has\nthus sunk seems an affair of supreme indifference, a mere incident in\nthe futilities of the scholastic world: but the view necessarily makes\nitself a home in ethics, which is an essential part of philosophy; and\nit is then in the actual world that the world learns the true meaning\nof such theories.\n'As the view spreads that subjective conviction, and it alone, decides\nthe morality of an action, it follows that the charge of hypocrisy,\nonce so frequent, is now rarely heard. You can only qualify wickedness\nas hypocrisy on the assumption that certain actions are inherently\nand actually misdeeds, vices, and crimes, and that the defaulter\nnecessarily is aware of them as such, because he is aware of and\nrecognises the principles and outward acts of piety and honesty, even\nin the pretence to which he misapplies them. In other words, it was\ngenerally assumed as regards immorality that it is a duty to know the\ngood, and to be aware of its distinction from the bad. In any case it\nwas an absolute injunction which forbade the commission of vicious and\ncriminal acts, and which insisted on such actions being imputed to the\nagent, so far as he was a man, not a beast. But if the good heart,\nthe good intention, the subjective conviction, are set forth as the\ntrue sources of moral worth, then there is no longer any hypocrisy, or\nimmorality at all: for whatever one does, he can always justify it by\nthe reflection on it of good aims and motives; and by the influence of\nthat conviction it is good. There is no longer anything _inherently_\nvicious or criminal: instead of the frank and free, hardened and\nunperturbed sinner, comes the person whose mind is completely justified\nby intention and conviction. My good intention in my act, and my\nconviction of its goodness, make it good. We speak of judging and\nestimating an _act._ But on this principle it is only the aim and\nconviction of the agent--his faith--by which he ought to be judged.\nAnd that not in the sense in which Christ requires faith in objective\ntruth, so that for one who has a bad faith, _e.g._ a conviction bad\nin its content, the judgment to be pronounced must be bad, _e.g._\nconformable to this bad content. But faith here means only fidelity to\nconviction. Has the man (we ask) in acting kept true to his conviction?\nIt is formal subjective conviction on which alone the obligation of\nduty is made to depend.\n'A principle like this, where conviction is expressly made something\nsubjective, cannot but suggest the thought of possible error, with the\nfurther implied presupposition of an absolutely-existing law. But the\nlaw is no agent: it is only the actual human being who acts; and in the\naforesaid principle the only question in estimating human actions is\nhow far he has received the law into his conviction. If, therefore, it\nis not the actions which are to be estimated and generally measured by\nthat law, it is impossible to see what the law is for, and what end it\ncan serve. Such a law is degraded to a mere outside letter, in fact an\nempty word; which is only made a law, _i.e._ invested with obligatory\nforce, by my conviction.\n'Such a law may claim its authority from God or the State: it may even\nhave the authority of tens of centuries during which it served as\nthe bond that gave men, with all their deed and destiny, subsistence\nand coherence. And these are authorities in which are condensed the\nconvictions of countless individuals. And for me to set against that\nthe authority of my single conviction--for as my subjective conviction\nits sole validity is authority--that self-conceit, monstrous as it at\nfirst seems, is, in virtue of the principle that subjective conviction\nis to be the rule, pronounced to be no self-conceit at all.\n'Even if reason and conscience--which shallow science and bad sophistry\ncan never altogether expel--admit, with a noble illogicality, that\nerror is possible, still by describing crime and wickedness as\nonly an error we minimise the fault. For to err is human:--Who has\nnot been mistaken on one point or another, whether he had fresh or\npickled cabbage for dinner, and about innumerable things more or less\nimportant? But the difference of more or less importance disappears if\neverything turns on the subjectivity of conviction and on persistency\nin it. But the said noble illogicality which admits error to be\npossible, when it comes round to say that a wrong conviction is only an\nerror, really only falls into a further illogicality--the illogicality\nof dishonesty. One time conviction is made the basis of morality and\nof man's supreme value, and is thus pronounced the supreme and holy.\nAnother time all we have to do with is an error: my conviction is\nsomething trivial and casual, strictly speaking something outside,\nthat may turn out this way or that. And, really, my being convinced\n_is_ something supremely trivial? if I cannot _know_ truth, it is\nindifferent how I think; and all that is left to my thinking is that\nempty good,--a mere abstraction of generalisation.\n'It follows further that, on this principle of justification by\nconviction, logic requires me, in dealing with the way others act\nagainst my action, to admit that, so far as they in their belief and\nconviction hold my actions to be crimes, they are quite in the right.\nOn such logic not merely do I gain nothing, I am even deposed from the\npost of liberty and honour into a situation of slavery and dishonour.\nJustice--which in the abstract is mine as well as theirs--I feel only\nas a foreign subjective conviction, and in the execution of justice I\nfancy myself to be only treated by an external force.'\nP. 44, \u00a7 23. Selbstdenken--to think and not merely to read or listen is\nthe recurrent cry of Fichte (_e.g. Werke,_ ii. 329). According to the\neditors of _Werke,_ xv. 582, the reference here is to Schleiermacher\nand to his Monologues. Really it is to the Romantic principle in\ngeneral, especially F. Schlegel.\nP. 45, \u00a7 23. 'Fichte' _Werke,_ ii, 404: 'Philosophy\n(Wissenschaftslehre), besides (for the reason above noted that it has\nno auxiliary, no vehicle of the intuition at all, except the intuition\nitself), elevates the human mind higher than any geometry can It gives\nthe mind not only attentiveness, dexterity, stability, but at the same\ntime absolute independence, forcing it to be alone with itself, and\nto live and manage by itself. Compared with it, every other mental\noperation is infinitely easy; and to one who has been exercised in\nit nothing comes hard. Besides as it prosecutes all objects of human\nlore to the centre it accustoms the eye to hit the proper point at\nfirst glance' in everything presented to it, and to prosecute it\nundeviatingly For such a practical philosopher therefore there can be\nnothing dark, complicated, and confused, if only he is acquainted with\nthe object of discussion. It comes always easiest to him to construct\neverything afresh and _ab initio,_ because he carries within him plans\nfor every scientific edifice. He finds his way easily, therefore, in\nany complicated structure. Add to this the security and confidence of\nglance which he has acquired in philosophy--the guide which conducts in\nall _raisonnement_ and the imperturbability with which his eye meets\nevery divergence from the accustomed path and every paradox. It would\nbe quite different with all human concerns, if men could only resolve\nto believe their eyes. At present they inquire at their neighbours and\nat antiquity what they really see, and by this distrust in themselves\nerrors are eternalised. Against this distrust the possessor of\nphilosophy is for ever protected. In a word, by philosophy the mind\nof man comes to itself, and from henceforth rests on itself without\nforeign aid, and is completely master of itself, as the dancer of his\nfeet, or the boxer of his hands.'\nP. 45, \u00a7 23.

The\nreference is to some verses of Schelling in _Werke,_ iv. 546 (first\npublished in _Zeitschrift f\u00fcr speculative Physik,_ 1800). We have no\nreason to stand in awe of the world, he says, which is a tame and quiet\nbeast--\nSterft zwar ein Riesengeist darinnen,\nIst aber versteinert mit allen Sinnen;\nIn todten und lebendigen Dingen\nThut nach Bewustseyn m\u00e4chtig ringen.\nIn human shape he at length awakes from the iron sleep, from the long\ndream: but as man he feels himself a stranger and exile; he would\nfain return to great Nature; he fears what surrounds him and imagines\nspectres, not knowing he might say of Nature to himself--\nIch bin der Gott, den sie im Busen hegt,\nDer Geist, der sich in allem bewegt:\nVom fr\u00fchsten Ringen dunkler Kr\u00e4fte\nBis zum Erguss der ersten Lebenss\u00e4fte,\n.    .    .    .    .    .    .\nherauf zu des Gedankens Jugendkraft\nWodurch Natur verj\u00fcngt sich wieder schafft,\nIst eine kraft, ein Wechselspiel und Weben,\nEin Trieb und Drang nach immer h\u00f6herm Leben.\nCf. Oken, _Naturphilosophie,_\u00a7 2913: 'A natural body is a thought of\nthe primal act, turned rigid and crystallised,--a word of God.'\nPhrases of like import are not infrequent in Schelling's works (about\n1800-1), _e.g. Werke,_1. Abth. iii. 341: 'The dead and unconscious\nproducts of nature are only unsuccessful attempts to \"reflect\" itself;\nso-called dead nature is in all cases an immature intelligence'\n(unreife Intelligenz), or iv. 77, 'Nature itself is an intelligence,\nas it were, turned to rigidity (erstarrte) with all its sensations and\nperceptions'; and ii. 226 (_Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur,_\n1797), 'Hence nature is only intelligence turned into the rigidity of\nbeing; its qualities are sensations extinguished to being; bodies are\nits perceptions, so to speak, killed.'\nA close approach to the phrase quoted is found in the words of another\nof the 'Romantic' philosophers: 'Nature is a petrified magic-city'\n(versteinerte Zauberstadt). (Novalis, _Schriften,_ ii. 149.)\nP. 48, \u00a7 24. Cf. Fichte to Jacobi: (Jacobi's _Briefwechsel,_ ii. 208)\n'My absolute Ego is obviously not the individual: that explanation\ncomes from injured snobs and peevish philosophers, seeking to\nimpute to me the disgraceful doctrine of practical egoism. But the\n_individual must be deduced from the absolute ego._ To that task my\nphilosophy will proceed in the \"Natural Law.\" A finite being--it may\nbe deductively shown--can only think itself as a sense-being in a\nsphere of sense-beings,--on one part of which (that which has no power\nof origination) it has causality, while with the other part (to which\nit attributes a subjectivity like its own) it stands in reciprocal\nrelations. In such circumstances it is called an individual, and the\nconditions of individuality are called rights. As surely as it affirms\nits individuality, so surely does it affirm such a sphere the two\nconceptions indeed are convertible. So long as we look upon ourselves\nas individuals--and we always so regard ourselves in life, though not\nin philosophy and abstract imagination--we stand on what I call the\n\"practical\" point of view in our reflections (while to the standpoint\nof the absolute ego I give the name \"speculative\"). From the former\npoint of view there exists for us a world independent of us,--a world\nwe can only modify; whilst the pure ego (which even on this altitude\ndoes not altogether disappear from us,) is put outside us and called\nGod. How else could we get the properties we ascribe to God and deny to\nourselves, did we not after all find them within us, and only refuse\nthem to ourselves in a certain respect, i.e., as individuals? When this\n\"practical\" point of view predominates in our reflections, realism\nis supreme: when speculation itself deduces and recognises that\nstandpoint, there results a complete reconciliation between philosophy\nand common sense as premised in my system.\n'For what good, then, is the speculative standpoint and the whole of\nphilosophy therewith, if it be not for life? Had humanity not tasted\nof this forbidden fruit, it might dispense with all philosophy. But in\nhumanity there is a wish implanted to behold that region lying beyond\nthe individual; and to behold it not merely in a reflected light but\nface to face. The first who raised a question about God's existence\nbroke through the barriers, he shook humanity in its main foundation\npillars, and threw it out of joint into an intestine strife which is\nnot yet settled, and which can only be settled by advancing boldly\nto that supreme point from which the speculative and the practical\nappear to be at one. We began to philosophise from pride of heart, and\nthus lost our innocence: we beheld our nakedness, and ever since we\nphilosophise from the need of our redemption.'\nP. 50. Physics and Philosophy of Nature: cf. _Werke,_ vii. i, p. 18:\n'The Philosophy of Nature takes up the material, prepared for it by\nphysics out of experience, at the point to which physics has brought\nit, and again transforms it, without basing it ultimately on the\nauthority of experience. Physics therefore must work into the hands of\nphilosophy, so that the latter may translate into a true comprehension\n(Begriff) the abstract universal transmitted to it, showing how it\nissues from that comprehension as an intrinsically necessary whole. The\nphilosophic way of putting the facts is no mere whim once in a way,\nby way of change, to walk on the head, after walking a long while on\nthe legs, or once in a way to see our every-day face besmeared with\npaint. No; it is because the method of physics does not satisfy the\ncomprehension, that we have to go on further.'\nP. 51, \u00a7 24. The distinction of ordinary and speculative Logic\nis partly like that made by Fichte (i. 68) between Logic and\nWissenschaftslehre. 'The former,' says Fichte, 'is conditioned and\ndetermined by the latter.' Logic deals only with form; epistomology\nwith import as well.\nP. 54, \u00a7 24.

Abth.) 34.\nCHAPTER III.\nP. 61, \u00a7 28. Fichte--to emphasise the experiential truth of his\nsystem--says (_Werke,_ ii. 331): 'There was a philosophy which\nprofessed to be able to expand by mere _inference_ the range thus\nindicated for philosophy. According to it, thinking was--not, as we\nhave described it, the analysis of what was given and the recombining\nof it in other forms, but at the same time--a production and creation\nof something quite new. In this system the philosopher found himself\nin the exclusive possession of certain pieces of knowledge which the\nvulgar understanding had to do without. In it the philosopher could\nreason out for himself a God and an immortality and talk himself into\nthe conclusion that he was wise and good.'\nWolfs definition of philosophy is 'the Science of the possible in so\nfar as it can be'; and the possible = the non-contradictory.\nP. 64, \u00a7 29. The oriental sage corresponds (cf. Hegel, _Werke,_ xii.\n229) to the writer known as Dionysius the Areopagite (_De Mystica\nTheologia,_ and _De Divitus Nominibus._)--The same problem as to the\nrelation of the Infinite (God) to the Finite (world) is discussed in\nJewish speculation (by Saadia, Mamuni, _&c._) as the question of the\ndivine names,--a dogma founded on the thirteen names (or attributes)\napplied to God in Exodus xxxiv. 6. (Cf. D. Kaufmann, _Geschichte der\nAttributenlehre._) The same spirit has led to the list of ninety-nine\n'excellent names' of Allah in Islam, a list which tradition derives\nfrom Mohammed.\nP. 65, \u00a7 31. Cf. _Werke,_ ii. 47 _seqq.:_ 'The nature of the judgment\nor proposition--involving as it does a distinction of subject and\npredicate--is destroyed by the \"speculative\" proposition. This conflict\nof the propositional form with the unity of comprehension which\ndestroys it is like the antagonism in rhythm between metre and accent.\nThe rhythm results from the floating \"mean\" and unification of the two.\nHence even in the \"philosophical\" proposition the identity of subject\nand predicate is not meant to annihilate their difference (expressed by\nthe propositional form): their unity is meant to issue as a _harmony._\nThe propositional form lets appear the definite shade or accent\npointing to a distinction in its fulfilment: whereas in the predicate\ngiving expression to the substance, and the subject itself falling\ninto the universal, we have the unity in which that accent is heard no\nmore. Thus in the proposition \"God is Being\" the predicate is Being; it\nrepresents the substance in which the subject is dissolved away. Being\nis here meant not to be predicate but essence: and in that way God\nseems to cease to be what he is--by his place in the proposition--viz.\nthe permanent subject. The mind--far from getting further forward in\nthe passage from subject to predicate--feels itself rather checked,\nthrough the loss of the subject, and thrown back, from a sense of its\nloss, to the thought of the subject. Or,--since the predicate itself\nis enunciated as a subject (as Being or as Essence) which exhausts the\nnature of the subject, it again comes face to face with the subject\neven in the predicate.--Thought thus loses its solid objective ground\nwhich it had on the subject: yet at the same time in the predicate it\nis thrown back upon it, and instead of getting to rest in itself it\nreturns upon the subject of the content.--To this unusual check and\narrest are in the main due the complaints as to the unintelligibility\nof philosophical works,--supposing the individual to possess any other\nconditions of education needed for understanding them.'\nP. 66, \u00a7 32. On the relation of dogmatism and scepticism see the\nintroduction to Kant's _Criticism of Pure Reason,_ and compare Caird's\n_Critical Philosophy of I. Kant,_ vol. i. chap. i.\nP. 67, \u00a7 33. The subdivision of 'theoretical' philosophy or metaphysics\ninto the four branches, Ontology, Cosmology, Psychology (rational and\nempirical), and Natural Theology, is more or less common to the whole\nWolfian School. Wolf's special addition to the preceding scholastic\nsystems is found in the conception of a general Cosmology. Metaphysics\nprecedes physics, and the departments of practical philosophy. In\nfront of all stands logic or rational philosophy. Empirical psychology\nbelongs properly to physics, but reasons of practical convenience put\nit elsewhere.\nP. 69, \u00a7 34. The question of the 'Seat of the Soul' is well known in\nthe writings of Lotze (_e.g. Metaphysic,_ \u00a7 291).\nAbsolute actuosity. The _Notio Dei_ according to Thomas Aquinas, as\nwell as the dogmatics of post-Reformation times, is _actus purus_\n(or _actus purissimus_). For God _nihil potentialitatis habet._ Cf.\n_Werke, xii._228: 'Aristotle especially has conceived God under the\nabstract category of activity. Pure activity is knowledge (Wissen)--in\nthe scholastic age, _actus purus_--: but in order to be put as\nactivity, it must be put in its \"moments.\" For knowledge we require\nanother thing which is known: and which, when knowledge knows it, is\nthereby appropriated. It is implied in this that God--the eternal and\nself-subsistent--eternally begets himself as his Son,--distinguishes\nhimself from himself. But what he thus distinguishes from himself,\nhas not the shape of an otherness: but what is distinguished is\n_ipso facto_ identical with what it is parted from. God is spirit:\nno darkness, no colouring or mixture enters this pure light. The\nrelationship of father and son is taken from organic life and used\nmetaphorically--the natural relation is only pictorial and hence does\nnot quite correspond to what is to be expressed. We say, God eternally\nbegets his Son, God distinguishes himself from himself: and thus we\nbegin from God, saying he does this, and in the other he creates is\nutterly with himself (the form of Love): but we must be well aware\nthat God is this _whole action itself_ God is the beginning; he does\nthis: but equally is he only the end, the totality: and as such\ntotality he is spirit. God as merely the Father is not yet the true\n(it is the Jewish religion where he is thus without the Son): He is\nrather beginning and end: He is his presupposition, makes himself a\npresupposition (this is only another form of distinguishing): He is the\neternal process.'\nNicolaus Cusanus speaks of God (_De docta Ignorantia,_ ii. I) as\n_infinita actualitas quae est actu omnis essendi possibilitas._ The\nterm 'actuosity' seems doubtful.\nP. 73, \u00a7 36. _Sensus eminentior._ Theology distinguishes three modes in\nwhich the human intelligence can attain a knowledge of God. By the _via\ncausalitatis_ it argues that God is; by the _via negationis,_ what he\nis not; by the _via eminentiae,_ it gets a glimpse of the relation in\nwhich he stands to us. It regards God _i.e._ as the cause of the finite\nuniverse; but as God is infinite, all that is predicated of him must be\ntaken as merely approximative (_sensu eminentiori_) and there is left\na vast remainder which can only be filled up with negations [Durandus\nde S. Porciano on the Sentent, i. 3. I]. The _sensus eminentior_ is\nthe subject of Spinoza's strictures, Ep. 6 (56 in Opp. ii. 202): while\nLeibniz adopts it in the preface to _Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e,_ 'Les perfections de\nDieu sont celles de nos \u00e2mes, mais il les poss\u00e8de sans bornes: il est\nun oc\u00e9an, dont nous n'avons re\u00e7u que les gouttes; il y a en nous\nquelque puissance, quelque connaissance, quelque bont\u00e9; mais elles sont\ntoutes enti\u00e8res en Dieu.'\nThe _via causalitatis_ infers _e.g.,_ from the existence of morality\nand intelligence here, a Being whose will finds expression therein: the\n_via eminentiae_ infers that that will is good, and that intelligence\nwise in the highest measure, and the _via negationis_ sets aside in the\nconception of God all the limitations and conditions to which human\nintelligence and will are subject.\nCHAPTER IV.\nP. 80, \u00a7 38. The verses (forming part of the advice which\nMephistopheles, personating Faust, gives to the recently-arrived\npupil) stand in the original in a different order: beginning \"Dann hat\ner die Theile in seiner Hand,\" &c. The meaning of these and the two\npreceding lines is somewhat as follows, in versification even laxer\nthan Goethe's:--\nIf you want to describe life and gather its meaning,\nTo drive out its spirit most be your beginning,\nThen though fast in your hand lie the parts one by one\nThe spirit that linked them, alas! is gone.\nAnd 'Nature's Laboratory' is only a name\nThat the chemist bestows on't to hide his own shame.\nOne may compare _Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre,_ iii. 3, where it is\nremarked, in reference to some anatomical exercises: 'You will learn\nere long that building-up is more instructive than tearing-down,\ncombining more than separating, animating the dead more than killing\nagain what was killed already.... Combining means more than separating:\nreconstructing more than onlooking.' The first part of _Faust_ appeared\n1808: the _Wanderjahre,_ 1828-9.\nP. 82, \u00a7 39. The article on the 'Relation of scepticism to philosophy,\nan exposition of its various modifications, and comparison of the\nlatest with the ancient'--in form a review of G. E.

In an earlier review of Kant's work (_Werke,_ i. 83) on\nGlauben und Wissen (an article in Sendling and Hegel's _Journal_)\nHegel attaches more weight to a factor in the critical theory of\nknowledge, here neglected. Kant, he says, has--within the limits\nallowed by his psychological terms of thought--'put (in an excellent\nway) the _\u00e0 priori_ of sensibility into the original identity and\nmultiplicity, and that as transcendental imagination in the \"higher\npower\" of an immersion of unity in multiplicity: whilst Understanding\n(Verstand) he makes to consist in the elevation to universality of this\n_\u00e0 priori_ synthetic unity of sensibility,--whereby this identity is\ninvested with a comparative antithesis to the sensibility: and Reason\n(Vernunft) is presented as a still higher power over the preceding\ncomparative antithesis, without however this universality and infinity\nbeing allowed to go beyond the stereotyped formal pure infinity.\nThis genuinely rational construction by which, though the bad name\n\"faculties\" is left, there is in truth presented a single identity\nof them all, is transformed by Jacobi into a series of faculties,\n_resting_ one upon another.'\nP. 87, \u00a7 42. Fichte: cf. _Werke,_ i. 420: 'I have said before, and\nsay it here again, that my system is no other than the Kantian. That\nmeans: it contains the same view of facts, but in its method is quite\nindependent of the Kantian exposition.' 'Kant, up to now, is a closed\nbook.'--i. 442. There are two ways of critical idealism. 'Either' (as\nFichte) 'it actually deduces from the fundamental laws of intelligence,\nthat system of necessary modes of action, and with it, at the same\ntime, the objective conceptions thus arising, and thus lets the whole\ncompass of our conceptions gradually arise under the eyes of the reader\nor hearer; or' (like Kant and his unprogressive disciples) 'it gets\nhold of these laws from anywhere and anyhow, as they are immediately\napplied to objects, therefore on their lowest grade (--on this grade\nthey are called _categories),_ and then asseverates that it is by\nthese that objects are determined and arranged.' And i. 478: 'I know\nthat the categories which Kant laid down are in no way _proved_ by\nhim to be conditions of self-consciousness, but only said to be so:\nI know that space and time and what in the original consciousness is\ninseparable from them and fills them both, are still less deduced as\nsuch conditions, for of them it is not even said expressly--as of the\ncategories--that they are so, but only inferentially. But I believe\nquite as surely that I know that Kant had the thought of such a system:\nthat everything he actually propounds are fragments and results of this\nsystem; and that his statements have meaning and coherence only on this\npresupposition.' Cf. viii. 362.\nP. 89, \u00a7 42. Transcendental unity of self-consciousness. Kant's _Kritik\nder reinen Vernunft,_ \u00a7 16: 'The _I think_ must be able to accompany\nall my ideas.... This idea is an act of spontaneity. ... I name it\npure apperception ... or original apperception ... because it is that\nself-consciousness which can be accompanied by none further. The unity\nof it I also call the transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in\norder to denote the possibility of cognition _\u00e0 priori_ from it.'\nP. 92, \u00a7 44. _Caput mortuum:_ a term of the Alchemists to denote the\nnon-volatile precipitate left in the retort after the spirit had been\nextracted: the fixed or dead remains, 'quando spiritus animam sursum\nvexit.'\nP. 92, \u00a7 45. Reason and Understanding. In the Wolfian School (_e.g._\nin Baumgarten's _Metaphysik,_ \u00a7 468) the term intellect (Verstand)\nis used of the general faculty of higher cognition, while _ratio_\n(Vernunft) specially denotes the power of seeing distinctly the\nconnexions of things. So Wolff (_Vern\u00fcnftige Gedanken von Gott, &c._ \u00a7\n277) defines Verstand as 'the faculty of distinctly representing the\npossible,' and Vernunft (\u00a7 368) as 'the faculty of seeing into the\nconnexion of truths.' It is on this use of _Reason_ as the faculty of\ninference that Kant's use of the term is founded: though it soon widely\ndeparts from its origin. For upon the 'formal' use of reason as the\nfaculty of syllogising, Kant superinduces a transcendental use as a\n'faculty of _principles_,' while the understanding is only 'a faculty\nof _rules.'_ 'Reason,' in other words, 'itself begets conceptions,'\nand 'maxims, which it borrows neither from the senses nor from the\nunderstanding.' (_Kritik d. r. Vern., Dialektik,_ Einleit. ii. A.) And\nthe essential aim of Reason is to give unity to the various cognitions\nof understanding. While the unity given by understanding is 'unity of\na possible experience,' that sought by reason is the discovery of an\nunconditioned which will complete the unity of the former (_Dial._\nEinleit. iv), or of 'the totality of the conditions to a given\nconditioned.' (_Dial,_ vii.)\nIt is this distinction of the terms which is dominant in Fichte and\nHegel, where Verstand is the more practical intellect which seeks\ndefinite and restricted results and knowledges, while Vernunft is\na deeper and higher power which aims at completeness. In Goethe's\nmore reflective prose we see illustrations of this usage: _e.g.\nWilh. Meister's Wanderjahre,_ i. it is said to be the object of\nthe 'reasonable' man 'das entgegengesetzte zu \u00fcberschauen und in\nUebereinstimmung zu bringen': or Bk. ii. Reasonable men when they have\ndevised something verst\u00e4ndig to get this or that difficulty out of the\nway, &c. Goethe, in his _Spr\u00fcche in Prosa_ (896), _Werke,_ iii. 281,\nsays 'Reason has for its province the thing in process (das Werdende),\nunderstanding the thing completed (das Gewordene): the former does not\ntrouble itself about the purpose, the latter asks not whence. Reason\ntakes delight in developing; understanding wishes to keep everything as\nit is, so as to use it.' (Similarly in Eckermann's Convers. Feb. 13,\n1829.) Cf. Oken, Naturphilosophie, \u00a7 2914. Verstand ist Microcosmus,\nVernunft Macrocosmus.\nKant's use of the term Reason, coupled with his special view of\nPractical Reason and his use of the term Faith (Glaube), leads on to\nthe terminology of Jacobi. In earlier writings Jacobi had insisted on\nthe contrast between the superior authority of feeling and faith (which\nare in touch with truth) and the mechanical method of intelligence and\nreasoning (Verstand and Vernunft). At a later period however he changed\nand fixed the nomenclature of his distinction. What he had first called\nGlaube he latterly called Vernunft,--which is in brief a 'sense for\nthe supersensible'--an intuition giving higher and complete or total\nknowledge--an immediate apprehension of the real and the true. As\ncontrasted with this reasonable faith or feeling, he regards Verstand\nas a mere faculty of inference or derivative knowledge, referring one\nthing to another by the rule of identity.\nThis distinction which is substantially reproduced by Coleridge\n(though with certain clauses that show traces of Schellingian\ninfluence) has connexions--like so much else in Jacobi--with the\nusage of Schopenhauer, 'Nobody,' says Jacobi, 'has ever spoken of an\nanimal Vernunft: a mere animal Verstand however we all know and speak\nof.' (Jacobi's _Werke,_ iii. 8.) Schopenhauer repeats and enforces\nthe remark. All animals possess, says Schopenhauer, the power of\napprehending causality, of cognising objects: a power of immediate and\nintuitive knowledge of real things: this is Verstand. But Vernunft,\nwhich is peculiar to man, is the cognition of _truth_ (not of reality):\nit is an abstract judgment with a sufficient reason (_Welt als W._ i. \u00a7\n6).\nOne is tempted to connect the modern distinction with an older one\nwhich goes back in its origin to Plato and Aristotle, but takes form in\nthe Neo-Platonist School, and enters the Latin world through Bo\u00ebthius.\n_Consol. Phil._ iv. 6: _Igitur uti est ad intellectum ratiocinatio,\nad id quod est id quod gignitur, ad aeternitatem tempus,_ and in v.\n4 there is a full distinction of _sensus, imaginatio, ratio_ and\n_intelligentia_ in ascending order. _Ratio_ is the discursive knowledge\nof the idea (_universali consideratione perpendit): intelligentia_\napprehends it at once, and as a simple _forma (pura mentis acie\ncontuetur)_: [cf. Stob. _Ed._ i. 826-832: Porphyr. _Sentent._15].\nReasoning belongs to the human species, just as intelligence to the\ndivine alone. Yet it is assumed--in an attempt to explain divine\nforeknowledge and defend freedom--that man may in some measure place\nhimself on the divine standpoint (v. 5).\nThis contrast between a higher mental faculty (_mens_) and a lower\n(_ratio_) which even Aquinas adopts from the interpretation of\nAristotle (_Summa Theol._ i. 79, 9) is the favourite weapon in the\nhands of mysticism. After the example of Dionysius Areop., Nicolaus of\nCusa, Reuchlin, and other thinkers of the Renaissance depreciate mere\ndiscursive thought and logical reasoning. It is the inner _mens_--like\na simple ray of light--penetrating by an immediate and indivisible\nact to the divine--which gives us access to the supreme science. This\n_simplex intelligentia,--_ superior to imagination or reasoning--as\nGerson says, _Consid. de Th._ 10, is sometimes named _mens,_ sometimes\n_Spiritus,_ the light of intelligence, the shadow of the angelical\nintellect, the divine light. From Scotus Erigena to Nicolas of Cusa\none tradition is handed down: it is taken up by men like Everard Digby\n(in his _Theoria Analytica_) and the group of Cambridge Platonists and\nby Spinoza in the seventeenth century, and it reappears, profoundly\nmodified, in the German idealism between 1790 and 1820.\nP. 99, \u00a7 48.

Spinoza--defining God as 'the union of thought with\nextension.' This is not verbally accurate; for according to _Ethica,_\ni. pr. 11, God, or the substance, consists of infinite attributes,\neach of which expresses the eternal and infinite essence. But Spinoza\nmentions of 'attributes' only two: _Ethica,_ ii. pr. 1. I Thought is\nan attribute of God: pr. 2, Extension is an attribute of God. And he\nadds, _Ethica,_ i. pr. 10, Schol. 'All the attributes substance has\nwere always in it together, nor can one be produced by another.' And\nin _Ethica,_ ii. 7. Sch. it is said: 'Thinking substance and extended\nsubstance is one and the same substance which is comprehended now under\nthis, now under that attribute.'\nP. 110, \u00a7 54. 'Practical in the true sense of the word.' Cf. Kant,\n_Werke,_ Ros. and Sch. i. 581: 'A great misunderstanding, exerting an\ninjurious influence on scientific methods, prevails with regard to what\nshould be considered \"practical\" in such sense as to justify its place\nin practical philosophy. Diplomacy and finance, rules of economy no\nless than rules of social intercourse, precepts of health and dietetic\nof the soul no less than the body, have been classed as practical\nphilosophy on the mere ground that they all contain a collection of\npractical propositions. Hut although such practical propositions\ndiffer in mode of statement from the theoretical propositions which\nhave for import the possibility of things and the exposition of their\nnature, they have the same content. \"Practical,\" properly so called,\nare only those propositions which relate to _Liberty_ under laws. All\nothers whatever are nothing but the theory of what pertains to the\n_nature_ of things--only that theory is brought to bear on the way in\nwhich the things may be produced by us in conformity with a principle;\n_i.e._ the possibility of the things is presented as the result of\na voluntary action which itself too may be counted among physical\ncauses.' And Kant, _Werke,_ iv. 10. 'Hence a sum of practical precepts\ngiven by philosophy does not form a special part of it (co-ordinate\nwith the theoretical) merely because they are practical. Practical\nthey might be, even though their principle were wholly derived from\nthe theoretical knowledge of nature,--as _technico-practical_ rules.\nThey are practical in the true sense, when and because their principle\nis not borrowed from the nature-conception (which is always sensuously\nconditioned) and rests therefore on the supersensible, which the\nconception of liberty alone makes knowable by formal laws. They are\ntherefore ethico-practical, _i.e._ not merely _precepts and rules_ with\nthis or that intention, but laws without antecedent reference to ends\nand intentions.'\nP. 111, \u00a7 54. Eudaemonism. But there is Eudaemonism and Eudaemonism;\nas Cf. Hegel, _Werke,_ i. 8. 4 The time had come when the infinite\nlonging away beyond the body and the world had reconciled itself\nwith the reality of existence. Yet the reality which the soul was\nreconciled to--the objective which the subjectivity recognised--was\nactually only empirical existence, common world and actuality.... And\nthough the reconciliation was in its heart and ground sure and fast,\nit still needed an objective form for this ground: the very necessity\nof nature made the blind certitude of immersion in the reality of\nempirical existence seek to provide itself with a justification and a\ngood conscience. This reconciliation for consciousness was found in the\nHappiness-doctrine: the fixed point it started from being the empirical\nsubject, and what it was reconciled to, the vulgar actuality, whereon\nit might now confide, and to which it might surrender itself without\nsin. The profound coarseness and utter vulgarity, which is at the basis\nof this happiness-doctrine, has its only elevation in its striving\nafter justification and a good conscience, which however can get no\nfurther than the objectivity of mere intellectualism.\n'The dogmatism of eudaemonism and of popular philosophy (Aufkl\u00e4rung)\ntherefore did not consist in the fact that it made happiness and\nenjoyment the supreme good. For if Happiness be comprehended as an\n_Idea,_ it ceases to be something empirical and casual--as also to be\nanything sensuous. In the supreme existence, reasonable act (Thun) and\nsupreme enjoyment are one. So long as supreme blessedness is supreme\n_Idea_ it matters not whether we try to apprehend the supreme existence\non the side of its ideality,--which, as isolated may be first called\nreasonable act--or on the side of its reality--which as isolated may\nbe first called enjoyment and feeling. For reasonable act and supreme\nenjoyment, ideality and reality are both alike in it and identical.\nEvery philosophy has only one problem--to construe supreme blessedness\nas supreme Idea. So long as it is by reason that supreme enjoyment is\nascertained, the distinguishability of the two at once disappears:\nfor this comprehension and the infinity which is dominant in act, and\nthe reality and finitude which is dominant in enjoyment, are taken up\ninto one another. The controversy with happiness becomes a meaningless\nchatter, when happiness is known as the blessed enjoyment of the\neternal intuition. But what was called eudaemonism meant--it must\nbe said--an empirical happiness, an enjoyment of sensation, not the\neternal intuition and blessedness.'\nP. 112, \u00a7 55. Schiller. _Ueber die aesthetische Erziehung des\nMenschen_(1795), 18th letter. 'Through beauty the sensuous man is led\nto form and to thought; through beauty the intellectual man is led back\nto matter and restored to the sense-world. Beauty combines two states\nwhich are opposed to one another.' Letter 25. 'We need not then have\nany difficulty about finding a way from sensuous dependence to moral\nliberty, after beauty has given a case where liberty can completely\nco-exist with dependence, and where man in order to show himself an\nintelligence need not make his escape from matter. If--as the fact\nof beauty teaches--man is free even in association with the senses,\nand if--as the conception necessarily involves--liberty is something\nabsolute and supersensible, there can no longer be any question how\nhe comes to elevate himself from limitations to the absolute: for\nin beauty this has already come to pass.' Cf. _Ueber Anmuth und\nW\u00fcrde_(1793). 'It is in a beautiful soul, then, that sense and reason,\nduty and inclination harmonize; and grace is their expression in the\nappearance. Only in the service of a beautiful soul can nature at the\nsame time possess liberty.' (See Bosanquet's _History of Aesthetic._)\nP. 115, \u00a7 60. The quotation in the note comes from \u00a7 87 of the _Kritik\nder Urtheilskraft_ (_Werke,_ ed. Ros. and Sch. iv. 357).\nP. 120, \u00a7 60. Fichte, _Werke,_ i. 279. 'The principle of life and\nconsciousness, the ground of its possibility, is (as has been shown)\ncertainly contained in the Ego: yet by this means there arises no\nactual life, no empirical life in time--and another life is for us\nutterly unthinkable. If such an actual life is to be possible, there\nis still needed for that a special impulse (Aufstoss) striking the\nEgo from the Non-ego. According to my system, therefore, the ultimate\nground of all actuality for the Ego is an original action and re-action\nbetween the Ego and something outside it, of which all that can be said\nis that it must be completely opposed to the Ego. In this reciprocal\naction nothing is brought into the Ego, nothing foreign imported;\neverything that is developed from it _ad infinitum_ is developed from\nit solely according to its own laws. The Ego is merely put in motion by\nthat opposite, so as to act; and without such a first mover it would\nnever have acted; and, as its existence consists merely in action, it\nwould not even have existed. But the source of motion has no further\nattributes than to set in motion, to be an opposing force which as such\nis only felt.\n'My philosophy therefore is realistic. It shows that the consciousness\nof finite natures cannot at all be explained, unless we assume a force\nexisting independently of them, and completely opposed to them;--on\nwhich as regards their empirical existence they are dependent. But\nit asserts nothing further than such an opposed force, which is\nmerely _felt,_ but not _cognised,_ by finite beings. All possible\nspecifications of this force or non-ego, which may present themselves\n_ad infinitum_ in our consciousness, my system engages to deduce from\nthe specifying faculty of the Ego....\n'That the finite mind must necessarily assume outside it something\nabsolute (a Ding:an:sich), and yet must on the other hand acknowledge\nthat this something only exists for the mind (is a necessary no\u00fcmenon):\nthis is the circle which may be infinitely expanded, but from which the\nfinite mind can never issue.' Cf. Fichte's _Werke,_ i. 248, ii. 478.\nCHAPTER V.\nP. 121, \u00a7 62. F. H. Jacobi (_Werke,_ v. 82) in his _Woldemar_ (a\nromance contained in a series of letters, first published _as a whole_\nin 1781) writes: 'The philosophical understanding (Verstand) is jealous\nof everything unique, everything immediately certain which makes itself\ntrue, without proofs, solely by its existence. It persecutes this\nfaith of reason even into our inmost consciousness, where it tries to\nmake us distrust the feeling of our identity and personality.' 'What\nis absolutely and intrinsically true,' he adds (v. 122), 'is not got\nby way of reasoning and comparison: both our immediate consciousness\n(Wissen)--I am--and our conscience (Gewissen) are the work of a secret\nsomething in which heart, understanding, and sense combine.' 'Notions\n(Begriffe), far from embalming the living, really turn it into a\ncorpse' (v. 380).\nCf. Fichte's words (_Werke,_ ii. 255), Aus dem Gewissen allein stammt\ndie Wahrheit, &c.\nP. 122, \u00a7 62. The Letters on the doctrine of Spinoza, published in\n1785, were re-issued in 1789 with eight supplements.\n'A science,' says Jacobi in his latest utterance (_Werke,_ iv. pref.\nxxx.) 'is only a systematic register of cognitions mutually referring\nto one another--the first and last point in the series is wanting.'\nP. 123, \u00a7 62. Lalande's dictum is referred to by Fries (_Popul\u00e4re\nVorlesungen \u00fcber Sternkunde,_ 1813) quoted by Jacobi in his _Werke,_\nii. 55. What Lalande has actually written in the preface to his work on\nastronomy is that the science as he understands it has no relation to\nnatural theology--in other words, that he is not writing a Bridgewater\ntreatise.\nP. 123, \u00a7 63. Jacobi, _Werke,_ ii. 222. 'For my part, I regard the\nprinciple of reason as all one with the principle of life.' And ii.\n343: 'Evidently reason is the true and proper life of our nature.'\nIt is in virtue of our inner tendency and instinct towards the\neternal (Richtung und Trieb auf das Ewige),--of our sense for the\nsupersensible--that we, human beings, really subsist (iv. 6. 152). And\nthis Organ der Vernehmung des Uebersinnlichen is Reason (iii. 203, &c).\nThe language of Jacobi fluctuates, not merely in words, but in the\nintensity of his intuitionalism. Thus, _e.g._ iii. 32: 'The reason man\nhas is no faculty giving the science of the true, but only a presage'\n(Ahndung des Wahren). 'The belief in a God,' he says, at one time (iii.\n206) 'is as natural to man as his upright position': but that belief\nis, he says elsewhere, only 'an inborn devotion (Andacht) before an\nunknown God.' Thus, if we have an immediate awareness (Wissen) of\nGod, this is not knowledge or science (Wissenschaft). Such intuition\nof reason is described (ii. 9) as 'the faculty of _presupposing_ the\nintrinsically (an sich) true, good, and beautiful, with full confidence\nin the objective validity of the presupposition.' But that object we\nare let see only in feeling (ii. 61). 'Our philosophy,' he says (iii.\n6) 'starts from feeling--of course an objective and pure feeling.'\nP. 124, \u00a7 63. Jacobi (_Werke,_ iv. a, p. 211): 'Through faith (Glaube)\nwe know that we have a body.' Such immediate knowledge of our own\nactivity--'the feeling of I am, I act' (iii. 411)--the sense of\n'absolute self-activity' or freedom (of which the 'possibility cannot\nbe cognised,' because logically a contradiction) is what Jacobi calls\nAnschauung (Intuition). He distinguishes a sensuous, and a rational\nintuition (iii. 59).\nP. 125, \u00a7 63. Jacobi expressly disclaims identification of his Glaube\nwith the faith of Christian doctrine (_Werke,_ iv. a, p. 210). In\ndefence he quotes from Hume, Inquiry V, and from Reid, passages to\nillustrate his usage of the term 'belief--by the distinction between\nwhich and faith certain ambiguities are no doubt avoided.\nP. 129, \u00a7 66. Kant had said _'Concepts without intuitions are empty'_\nIt is an exaggeration of this half-truth (the other half is _Intuitions\nwithout concepts are blind_) that is the basis of these statements of\nJacobi (and of Schopenhauer)--a view of which the following passage\nfrom Schelling (_Werke,_ ii. 125) is representative. 'Concepts\n(Begriffe) are only silhouettes of reality. They are projected by\na serviceable faculty, the understanding, which only comes into\naction when reality is already on the scene,--which only comprehends,\nconceives, retains what it required a creative faculty to produce....\nThe mere concept is a word without meaning.... All reality that can\nattach to it is lent to it merely by the intuition (Anschauung) which\npreceded it. ... Nothing is real for us except what is _immediately\ngiven_ us, without any mediation by concepts, without our feeling at\nliberty. But nothing reaches us immediately except through intuition.'\nHe adds, however, 'Intuition is due to the activity of mind (Sein):\nit demands a disengaged sense (freier Sinn) and an intellectual organ\n(geistiges Organ).'\nP. 134.

Mill thus takes it as equivalent to an ontological\nmythology--probably a rare use of the term.\nCHAPTER VII.\nP. 156, \u00a7 85. The Absolute. The term, in something like its modern\nusage, is at least as old as Nicolaus Cusanus. God, according to him,\nis the _absoluta omnium quidditas (Apol._406), the _esse absolutum,_ or\n_ipsum esse in existentibus_ (_De ludo Globi,_ ii. 161 a), the _unum\nabsolutum,_ the _vis absoluta,_ or _possibilitas absoluta,_ or _valor\nabsolutus: absoluta vita, absoluta ratio: absoluta essendi forma._ On\nthis term and its companion _infinities_ he rings perpetual changes.\nBut its distinct employment to denote the 'metaphysical God' is much\nmore modern. In Kant, _e.g._ the 'Unconditioned' (Das Unbedingte)\nis the metaphysical, corresponding to the religious, conception of\ndeity; and the same is the case with Fichte, who however often makes\nuse of the adjective 'absolute.' It is with Schelling that the term\nis naturalised in philosophy: it already appears in his works of 1793\nand 1795: and from him apparently it finds its way into Fichte's\n_Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre_ of 1801 (_Werke,_ ii. 13) 'The\nabsolute is neither knowing nor being; nor is it identity, nor is it\nindifference of the two; but it is throughout merely and solely the\nabsolute.'\nThe term comes into English philosophical language through Coleridge\nand later borrowers from the German. See Ferrier's _Institutes of\nMetaphysic,_ Prop. xx, and Mill's _Examination of Hamilton,_ chap. iv.\nP. 158, \u00a7 86. Cf. Schelling, iii. 372: I = I expresses the identity\nbetween the 'I,' in so far as it is the producing, and the 'I' as the\nproduced; the original synthetical and yet identical proposition: the\n_cogito=sum_ of Schelling.\nP. 159. Definition of God as _Ens realissimum, e.g._ Meier's\n_Baumgarten's Metaphysic,_ \u00a7 605.\nJacobi, _Werke,_ iv. 6, thus describes Spinoza's God.\nAs to the beginning cf. Fichte, _Werke,_ ii. 14 (speaking of 'absolute\nknowing'): 'It is not a knowing of something, nor is it a knowing of\nnothing (so that it would be a knowing of somewhat, but this somewhat\nbe nothing): it is not even a knowing of itself, for it is no knowledge\nat all _of_;--nor is it _a_ knowing (quantitatively and in relation),\nbut it is (the) knowing (absolutely qualitatively). It is no act, no\nevent, or that somewhat is in knowing; but it is just the knowing, in\nwhich alone all acts and all events, which are there set down, can be\nset down.'\nHistory of Philosophy; cf. Hegel, _Werke,_ i. 165. 'If the Absolute,\nlike its phenomenon Reason, be (as it is) eternally one and the same,\nthen each reason, which has turned itself upon and cognised itself,\nhas produced a true philosophy and solved the problem which, like its\nsolution, is at all times the same. The reason, which cognises itself,\nhas in philosophy to do only with itself: hence in itself too lies\nits whole work and its activity; and as regards the inward essence of\nphilosophy there are neither predecessors nor successors.\n'Just as little, as of constant improvements, can there be talk of\n\"peculiar views\" of philosophy.... The true peculiarity of a philosophy\nis the interesting individuality, in which reason has organised itself\na form from the materials of a particular age; in it the particular\nspeculative reason finds spirit of its spirit, flesh of its flesh; it\nbeholds itself in it as one and the same, as another living being.\nEach philosophy is perfect in itself, and possesses totality, like a\nwork of genuine art. As little as the works of Apelles and Sophocles,\nif Raphael and Shakespeare had known them, could have seemed to them\nmere preliminary exercises for themselves--but as cognate spiritual\npowers;--so little can reason in its own earlier formations perceive\nonly useful preparatory exercises.'

The Buddhists. Cf. Hegel, _Werke,_ xi. 387. Modern\nhistories of Buddhism insist upon the purely ethico-religious character\nof the teaching. Writers like von Hartmann (_Religionsphilosophie,_ p.\n320) on the contrary hold that Buddhism carried out the esoteric theory\nof Brahmanism to the consequence that the abstract one is nothing.\nAccording to Vassilief, _Le Bouddhisme,_ p. 318 seqq., one of the\nBuddhist metaphysical schools, the Madhyamikas, founded by N\u00e2g\u00e2rdjuna\n400 years after Buddha, taught that All is Void.--Such metaphysics were\nprobably reactions of the underlying Brahmanist idea.\nBut generally Buddhism (as was not unnatural 60 years ago) is hardly\ntaken here in its characteristic historical features.\nP. 167, \u00a7 88. Aristotle, _Phys,_ i. 8 (191 a. 26): 'Those philosophers\nwho first sought the truth and the real substance of things got on a\nfalse track, like inexperienced travellers who fail to discover the\nway, and declared that nothing can either come into being or disappear,\nbecause it is necessary that what comes into being should come into\nbeing either from what is or from what is not, and that it is from both\nof these impossible: for what is does not become (it already is), and\nnothing would become from what is not.'\n(5) is an addition of ed. 3 (1830); cf. _Werke,_ xvii. 181.\nP. 168, \u00a7 88. The view of Heraclitus here taken is founded on the\ninterpretation given by Plato (in the _Theaetetus,_152; _Cratylus,_\n401) and by Aristotle, of a fundamental doctrine of the Ephesian--which\nhowever is expressed in the fragments by the name of the everliving\nfire. The other phrase (Ar. _Met._ i. 4) is used by Aristotle to\ndescribe the position, not of Heraclitus, but of Leucippus and\nDemocritus. Cf. Plutarch, _adv.

Schelling, i. 209.\n'Being (Seyn) expresses the absolute, Determinate being (Daseyn) a\nconditional, 'positing': Actuality, one conditioned in a definite sort\nby a definite condition. The single phenomenon in the whole system\nof the world has _actuality;_ the world of phenomena in general has\nDaseyn; but the absolutely-posited, the Ego, _is.

Plato, _Timaeus,_ c. 35 (formation of the world-soul):\n'From the individual and ever-identical essence (\u1f40\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) and the\ndivisible which is corporeal, he compounded a third intermediate\nspecies of essence.... And taking these, being three, he compounded\nthem all into one form (\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1), adjusting perforce the unmixable nature\nof the other and the same, and mingling them all with the essence, and\nmaking of three one again, he again distributed this total into as many\nportions as were fitting, but each of them mingled out of the same and\nthe other and the essence.'\nP. 175, \u00a7 94. Philosophy. Cf. Schelling, _Werke,_ ii. 377. 'A various\nexperience has taught me that for most men the greatest obstacle to the\nunderstanding and vital apprehension of philosophy is their invincible\nopinion that its object is to be sought at an infinite distance.\nThe consequence is, that while they should fix their eye on what is\npresent (das Gegenw\u00e4rtige), every effort of their mind is called out\nto get hold of an object which is not in question through the whole\ninquiry.' ... 'The aim of the sublimest science can only be to show the\nactuality,--in the strictest sense the actuality, the presence, the\nvital existence (Daseyn)--of a God in the whole of things and in each\none.... Here we deal no longer with an extra-natural or supernatural\nthing, but with the immediately near, the alone-actual to which we\nourselves also belong, and in which we are.'\nP. 177, \u00a7 95. Plato's _Philebus,_ ch. xii-xxiii (pp. 23-38): cf.\n_Werke,_ xiv. 214 seqq.: 'The absolute is therefore what in one unity\nis finite and infinite.'\nP. 178. Idealism of Philosophy: cf. Schelling, ii. 67. 'Every\nphilosophy therefore is and remains Idealism; and it is only under\nitself that it embraces realism and idealism; only that the former\nIdealism should not be confused with the latter, which is of a merely\nrelative kind.'\nHegel, _Werke,_ iii. 163. 'The proposition that the finite is \"ideal\"\nconstitutes Idealism. In nothing else consists the Idealism of\nphilosophy than in recognising that the finite has no genuine being....\nThe contrast of idealistic and realistic philosophy is therefore of\nno importance. A philosophy that attributed to finite existences as\nsuch a genuine ultimate absolute being would not deserve the name\nphilosophy.... By \"ideal\" is meant existing as a representation in\nconsciousness: whatever is in a mental concept, idea or imagination is\n\"ideal\": \"ideal\" is just another word for \"in imagination,\"--something\nnot merely distinct from the real, but essentially not real. The mind\nindeed is the great idealist: in the sensation, representation, thought\nof the mind the fact has not what is called _real_ existence; in the\nsimplicity of the Ego such external being is only suppressed, existing\n_for me,_ and \"ideally\" in me. This subjective idealism refers only to\nthe representational form, by which an import is mine.'\nP. 180, \u00a7 96. The distinction of nature and mind as real and ideal is\nespecially Schelling's: See _e.g._ his _Einleitung,_ &c. iii. 272. 'If\nit is the problem of Transcendental Philosophy to subordinate the real\nto the ideal, it is on the contrary the problem of the philosophy of\nnature to explain the ideal from the real.'\nP. 183, \u00a7 98. Newton: see _Scholium_ at the end of the _Principia,_ and\ncf. _Optics,_ iii. qu. 28.\nModern Atomism, besides the conception of particles or molecules, has\nthat of mathematical centres of force.\nKant, _Werke,_ v. 379 (ed. Rosenk.). 'The general principle of the\n_dynamic_ of material nature is that all reality in the objects of the\nexternal senses must be regarded as moving force: whereby accordingly\nso-called solid or absolute impenetrability is banished from natural\nscience as a meaningless concept, and repellent force put in its\nstead; whereas true and immediate attraction is defended against all\nthe subtleties of a self-misconceiving metaphysic and declared to be a\nfundamental force necessary for the very possibility of the concept of\nmatter.'\nP. 184, \u00a7 98. Abraham Gottheit K\u00e4stner (1719-1800), professor\nforty-four years at G\u00f6ttingen, enjoyed in the latter half of the\neighteenth century a considerable repute, both in literature and in\nmathematical science. Some of, his epigrams are still quoted.\nP. 190, \u00a7 102. The two 'moments' of number Unity, and Sum (Anzahl),\nmay be compared with the Greek distinction between one and \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\n(cf. Arist. _Phys._ iv. 12 \u1f10\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03b4\u03c5\u03ac\u03c2). According\nto Rosenkranz (_Leben Hegels_) the classification of arithmetical\noperations often engaged Hegel's research. Note the relation in Greek\nbetween \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd and \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd. Cf.

Not Aristotle, but rather Simplicius on the _Physics_\nof Aristotle, fol. 306: giving Zeno's argument against the alleged\ncomposition of the line from a series of points.

The distinction between imagination and intellect made\nby Spinoza in _Ep._ xii. (olim xxix.) in _Opp._ ed. Land vol. ii. 40\nseqq. is analogous to that already noted (p. 402) between _ratio_ and\n_intellegentia,_ and is connected, as by Bo\u00ebthius, with the distinction\nwhich Plato, _Timaeus,_ 37, draws between eternity (\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd) and time.\nThe infinite (_Eth._ i. prop. 8. Schol. I) is the 'absolute affirmation\nof a certain nature's existence,' as opposed to finitude which is\nreally _ex parte negatio._ 'The problem has always been held extremely\ndifficult, if not inextricable, because people did not distinguish\nbetween what is concluded to be infinite by its own nature and the\nforce of its definition, and what has no ends, not in virtue of its\nessence, but in virtue of its cause. It was difficult also because\nthey did not distinguish between what is called infinite because it\nhas no ends, and that whose parts (though we may have a maximum and\nminimum of it) we cannot equate or explicate by any number. Lastly\nbecause they lid not distinguish between what we can only understand\n(_intelligere,_) but not imagine, and what we can also imagine.'\nTo illustrate his meaning, Spinoza calls attention to the distinction\nof substance from mode, of eternity from duration. We can 'explicate'\nthe existence only of modes by duration: that of substance, 'by\neternity, _i.e._ by an infinite fruition of existence or being' (_per\naeternitatem, hoc est, infinitam existendi, sive, invita latinitate,\nessendi fruitionem._) The attempt therefore to show that extended\n_substance_ is composed of parts is an illusion,--which arises because\nwe look at quantity 'abstractly or superficially, as we have it in\nimagination by means of the senses.' So looking at it, as we are liable\nto do, a quantity will be found divisible, finite, composed of parts\nand manifold. But if we look at it as it really is,--as a Substance\n--as it is in the intellect alone--(which is a work of difficulty), it\nwill be found infinite, indivisible, and unique. 'It is only therefore\nwhen we abstract duration and quantity from substance, that we use\ntime to determine duration and measure to determine quantity, so as to\nbe able to imagine them. Eternity and substance, on the other hand,\nare no objects of imagination but only of intellect; and to try to\nexplicate them by such notions as measure, time, and number--which are\nonly modes of thinking or rather of imagining--is no better than to\nfall into imaginative raving.' 'Nor will even the modes of Substance\never be rightly understood, should they be confounded with this sort\nof _entia rationis_' (_i.e. modi cogitandi_ subserving the easier\nretention, explication and _imagination_ of things _understood_)'\nor aids to imagination. For when we do so, we separate them from\nsubstance, and from the mode in which they flow from eternity, without\nwhich they cannot be properly understood.' (Cf. Hegel's _Werke,_ i. 63.)\nThe verses from Albr. von Haller come from his poem on Eternity (1736).\nHegel seems to quote from an edition before 1776, when the fourth line\nwas added in the stanza as it thus finally stood:--\nIch h\u00e4ufe ungeheure Zahlen,\nGeb\u00fcrge Millionen auf,\nIch welze Zeit auf Zeit und Welt auf Welten hin,\nUnd wenn ich auf der March des endlichen nun bin,\nUnd von der f\u00fcrchterlichen H\u00f6he\nMit Schwindeln wieder nach dir sehe,\nIst alle Macht der Zahl, vermehrt mit tausend Malen,\nNoch nicht ein Theil von dir.\nIch tilge sie, und du liegst ganz vor mir.\nKant, _Kritik d. r. Vernunft,_ p. 641. 'Even Eternity, however _eerily_\nsublime may be its description by Haller,' &c.\nP. 197, \u00a7 104. Pythagoras in order of time probably comes between\nAnaximenes (of Ionia) and Xenophanes (of Elea). But the mathematical\nand metaphysical doctrines attributed to the Pythagorean are known\nto us only in the form in which they are represented in Plato and\nAristotle, _i.e._ in a later stage of development. The Platonists (cf.\nArist. _Met._ i. 6; xi. 1. 12; xii. 1. 7; cf. Plat. _Rep._ p. 510)\ntreated mathematical fact as mid-way between 'sensibles' and 'ideas';\nand Aristotle himself places mathematics as a science between physical\nand metaphysical (theological) philosophy.\nThe tradition (referred to p. 198) about Pythagoras is given by\nIamblichus, _Vita Pyth._ \u00a7115 seqq.: it forms part of the later\nNeo-Pythagorean legend, which entered literature in the first centuries\nof the Christian era.\nP. 201, \u00a7 107.

The 'laws of thought' is the magniloquent title given\nin the Formal Logic since Kant's day to the principles or maxims\n(_principia_, Grunds\u00e4tze) which Kant himself described as 'general and\nformal criteria of truth.' They include the so-called principle of\ncontradiction, with its developments, the principle of identity and\nexcluded middle: to which, with a desire for completeness, eclectic\nlogicians have added the Leibnizian principle of the reason. Hegel\nhas probably an eye to Krug and Fries in some of his remarks. The\nthree laws may be compared and contrasted with the three principles,\n--homogeneity, specification, and continuity of forms, in Kant's\n_Kritik d. r. Vern._ p. 686.\nP. 217, \u00a7 117. Leibniz, _Nouveaux Essais,_ Liv. ii. ch. 27, \u00a7 3 (ed.\nErdmann, p. 273: cf. fourth Letter to Clarke). _Il n'y a point deux\nindividus indiscernables.

But he adds (476), 'It is time to define\nmore accurately the concept of polarity.' So Oken, _Naturphilosophie_:\n\u00a776: 'A force consisting of two principles is called Polarity.' \u00a7 77:\n'Polarity is the first force which makes its appearance in the world.'\n\u00a7 81: 'The original movement is a result of the original polarity.'\nP. 223, \u00a7 119. Cf. Fichte, ii. 53. 'To everything but this the\nlogically trained thinker can rise. He is on his guard against\ncontradiction. But, in that case, how about the possibility of the\nmaxim of his own logic that we can think no contradiction. In some way\nhe must have got hold of contradiction and thought it, or he could\nmake no communications about it. Had such people only once regularly\nasked themselves how they came to think the _merely_ possible or\ncontingent (the not-necessary), and how they actually do so! Evidently\nthey here leap through a not-being, not-thinking, &c, into the utterly\nunmediated, self-initiating, free,--into be\u00ebnt non-being,--in short,\nthe above contradiction, as it was laid down. With consistent thinkers\nthe result of this incapacity is nothing but the utter abolition of\nfreedom,--the most absolute fatalism and Spinozism.\nP. 227, \u00a7121. Leibniz (ed. Erdmann, p. 515). 'The principle of _la\nraison d\u00e9terminante_ is that nothing ever occurs without there being a\ncause for it, or at least a determinant reason, _i.e._ something which\nmay serve to render a reason _\u00e0 priori_ why that is existent rather\nthan in any other way. This great principle holds good in all events.'\nCf. p. 707. 'The principle of \"sufficient reason\" is that in virtue\nof which we consider that no fact could be found true or consistent,\nno enunciation truthful, without there being a sufficient reason why\nit is so and not otherwise.... When a truth is necessary, we can find\nthe reason of it by analysis, resolving it into simpler ideas and\ntruths, until we come to primitive ideas.... But the sufficient reason\nought also to be found in contingent truths or truths of fact, _i.e._\nin the series of things spread through the universe of creatures,\nor the resolution into particular reasons might go into a limitless\ndetail: ... and as all this detail embraces only other antecedent, or\nmore detailed contingencies, ... the sufficient or final (_derni\u00e8re_)\nreason must be outside the succession or series of this detail of\ncontingencies, however infinite it might be. And it is thus that the\nfinal reason of things must be in a \"necessary substance,\" in which the\ndetail of the changes exists only _eminenter,_ as in the source,--and\nit is what we call God.' _(Monadology_ \u00a7\u00a7 32-38.)\nHence the supremacy of final causes. Thus _Opp._ ed. Erdmann, p. 678:\n_Ita fit ut efficientes causae pendeant a finalibus, et spiritualia\nsint natura priora materialibus._ Accordingly he urges, p. 155, that\nfinal cause has not merely a moral and religious value in ethics and\ntheology, but is useful even in physics for the detection of deep-laid\ntruths. Cf. p. 106: _C'est sanctifier la Philosophie que de faire\ncouler ses ruisseaux de la fontaine des attributs de Dieu. Bien loin\nd'exclure les causes finales et la consid\u00e9ration d'un \u00eatre agissant\navec sagesse, c'est de l\u00e0 qu'il faut tout d\u00e9duire en Physique._ Cf.\nalso _Principes de la Nature_ (Leibn. ed.

The great physical variety of these bodies must of itself create\na prepossession against such coordination; and their chemical origin,\nthe process from which they issue, is clearly no less various. But\nin an equally chaotic way, more abstract and more real processes are\nput on the same level. If all this is to get scientific form, every\nproduct ought to be determined according to the grade of the concrete\nand completely developed process from which it essentially issues, and\nwhich gives it its peculiar significance; and for that purpose it is\nnot less essential to distinguish grades in abstractness or reality\nof the process. Animal and vegetable substances in any case belong\nto a quite other order: so little can their nature be understood from\nthe chemical process, that they are rather destroyed in it, and only\nthe way of their death is apprehended.

One force predominates: otherwise\nthere were no _one,_ no whole' (p. 207). 'The supreme being (Daseyn)\ncould give its creatures nothing higher than being. (_Theophron._) But,\nmy friend, being and being, however simple in the concept, are in their\nestate very different; and what do you suppose, Philolaus, marks its\ngrades and differences? (_Phil._) Nothing but forces. In God himself\nwe found no higher conception; but all his forces were only one. The\nsupreme force could not be other than supreme goodness and wisdom,\never-living, ever-active. (_Theoph._) Now you yourself see, Philolaus,\nthat the supreme, or rather the All (for God is not a supreme unit in\na scale of beings like himself), could not reveal himself otherwise\nthan in the universe as active. In him nothing could slumber, and what\nhe expressed was himself. He is before everything, and everything\nsubsists in him: the whole world an expression, an appearance of his\never-living, ever-acting forces' (p. 200).\n'It was the mistake of Spinoza,' says Herder, 'to be unduly influenced\nby the Cartesian phraseology. Had he chosen the conception of force and\neffect, everything would have gone easier, and his system become much\nmore distinct and coherent. 'Had he developed the conception of power,\nand the conception of matter, he must in conformity with his system\nnecessarily have come to the conception of forces, which work as well\nin matter as in organs of thinking: he would in that case have regarded\npower and thought as forces, _e.g._ as one.' (Cf. H. Spencer, 'Force,\nthe Ultimate of Ultimates.' First Princ. p 169)\nAccording to Rosenkranz (_Leben Hegels,_ p. 223) there exists in\nmanuscript a criticism by Hegel on the second edition of Herder's\n_God._ Herder's Dialogue belongs to the controversy aroused by Jacobi's\nletters on Spinoza.\nP. 250, \u00a7 136.

Originally the first four lines appeared\nin Haller's poem _Die menschlichen Tugenden_ thus--\nIns Innre der Natur bringt sein erschaffner Geist:\nZu gl\u00fccklich, wenn sie noch die \u00e4u\u00dfre Schale weist!\n(To nature's heart there penetrates no mere created mind:\nToo happy if she but display the outside of her rind.)\nHegel--reading weizt for weist--takes the second line as\nToo happy, if he can but know the outside of her rind.\nGoethe's attack upon a vulgar misuse of the lines belongs to his\ndispute with the scientists. His verses appeared in 1820 as _Heiteres\nReimst\u00fcck_ at the end of Heft 3 _zur Morphologie,_--of which the\nclosing section is entitled _Freundlicher Zuruf_ (_Werke_ xxvii. 161),\nas follows:--\n\"Ins Innre der Natur,\"\nO du Philister!--\n\"Dringt kein erschaffner Geist.\"\n.    .    .    .    .    .\n\"Gl\u00fcckselig! wem sie nur\nDie \u00e4u\u00dfre Schale weis't.\"\nDas h\u00f6r' ich sechzig Jahre wiederholen,\nIch fluche drauf, aber verstohlen:\nSage mir taufend tausendmale:\nAlles giebt sie reichlich und gern;\nNatur hat weder Stern\nNoch Schale,\nAlles ist sie mit einem Male.\n[The last seven lines may be thus paraphrased in continuation:\nI swear--of course but to myself--as rings within my ears\nThat same old warning o'er and o'er again for sixty years,\nAnd thus a thousand thousand times I answer in my mind:\n--With gladsome and ungrudging hand metes nature from her store:\nShe keeps not back the core,\nNor separates the rind,\nBut all in each both rind and core has evermore combined.]\nP. 254, \u00a7 140.

This word, denoting a meddlesome busybody in older English\nand sometimes made a vague term of abuse, has been in the present\ncentury used in English as it is here employed in German.\nAccording to Polybius, ix. I. 2, the \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\nis that which has a directly utilitarian aim. So Kant, _Foundation of\nMetaph. of Ethic (Werke,_ viii. 41, note): 'A history is pragmatically\ncomposed when it renders prudent, _i.e._ instructs the world how it may\nsecure its advantage better or at least as well as the ages preceding.'\nSchelling (v. 308) quotes in illustration of pragmatic history-writing\nthe words of Faust to Wagner (Goethe, xi. 26):\nWas ihr den Geist der Zeiten heisst,\nDas ist im Grund der herren eigner Geist,,\nIn dem die Zeiten sich bespiegeln.\nCf. also Hegel, _Werke,_ ix. 8. 'A second kind of reflectional history\nis the pragmatic. When we have to do with the past and are engaged\nwith a distant world, the mind sees rising before it a present, which\nit has from its own action as a reward for its trouble. The events are\ndifferent; but their central and universal fact, their structural\nplan is identical. This abolishes the past and makes the event\npresent. Pragmatic reflections, however abstract they be, are thus in\nreality the present, and vivify the tales of the past with the life of\nto-day.--Here too a word should specially be given to the moralising\nand the moral instructions to be gained through history,--for which it\nwas often studied.... Rulers, statesmen, nations, are especially bidden\nlearn from the experience of history. But what experience and history\nteach is that nations and governments never have learned anything from\nhistory, or acted upon teaching which could have been drawn from it.'\nCf. Froude: _Divorce of Catherine,_ p. 2. 'The student (of history)\nlooks for an explanation (of political conduct) in elements which he\nthinks he understands--in pride, ambition, fear, avarice, jealousy, or\nsensuality.'\nP. 257, \u00a7 141. Cf. Goethe, xxiii, 298. 'What is the outside of an\norganic nature but the ever-varied phenomenon of the inside? This\noutside, this surface is so exactly adapted to a varied, complex,\ndelicate, inward structure that it thus itself becomes an inside:\nboth aspects, the outside and the inside, standing in most direct\ncorrelation alike in the quietest existence and in the most violent\nmovement.'\nP. 260, \u00a7 143. Kant, _Kritik der reinen Vernunft,_ 2nd ed. p. 266.\nP. 269, \u00a7 147. Cf. Schelling, _Werke,_ v. 290 (cf. iii. 603). 'There\nare three periods of history, that of nature, of destiny, and of\nprovidence. These three ideas express the same identity, but in a\ndifferent way. Destiny too is providence, but recognised in the real,\nas providence, is also destiny, but beheld (angeschaut) in the ideal.'\nP. 275, \u00a7 151. On the relation between Spinoza and Leibniz cf. Hegel,\n_Werke,_ iv. 187-193. It would be a mistake, however, to represent\nLeibniz as mainly engaged in a work of conscious antagonism to Spinoza.\nP. 277, \u00a7 153. Jacobi.--Jacobi (like Schopenhauer) insists specially on\nthe distinction between grounds (Gr\u00fcnde)--which are formal, logical,\nand verbal, and causes (Ursachen)--which carry us into reality and\nlife and nature. To transform the mere _Because_ into the _cause_\nwe must (he says) pass from logic and the analytical understanding\nto experience and the inner life. Instead of the timelessness of\nsimultaneity which characterises the logical relation cf ground and\nconsequent, the nexus of cause and effect introduces the element\nof time,--thereby acquiring reality (Jacobi, _Werke,_ iii. 452).\nThe conception of Cause--meaningless as a mere category of abstract\nthought--gets reality as a factor in experience, ein Erfahrungsbegriff,\nand is immediately given to us in the consciousness of our own\ncausality (Jacobi, _Werke,_ iv. 145-158). Cf. Kant, _Kritik der reinen\nVern._ p. 116.\nP. 283, \u00a7 158. The _Amor intellectualis Dei_ (Spinoza, _Eth._ v. 32)\nis described as a consequence of the third grade of cognition, viz.\nthe _scientia intuitiva_ which 'proceeds from an adequate idea of the\nformal essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate cognition\nof the essence of things (ii. 40, Schol. 2). From it arises (v.\n27), the highest possible _acquiescentia mentis,_ in which the mind\ncontemplates all things _sub specie aeternitatis_ (v. 29), knows itself\nto be in God and sees itself and all things in their divine essence.\nBut this intellectual love of mind towards God is part of the infinite\nlove wherewith God loves himself (v. 36) 'From these things we clearly\nunderstand in what our salvation or blessedness or liberty consists: to\nwit, in the constant and eternal love towards God, or in the love of\nGod towards men' (Schol. to v. 36).\nCHAPTER IX.\nPage 289, \u00a7 161. Evolution and development in the stricter sense\nin which these terms were originally used in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries imply a theory of preformation, according\nto which the growth of an organic being is simply a process of\nenlarging and filling out a miniature organism, actual but invisible,\nbecause too inconspicuous. Such was the doctrine adopted by Leibniz\n(_Consid\u00e9rations sur le principe de vie; Syst\u00e8me nouveau de la Nature_,\n&c). According to it development is no real generation of new parts,\nbut only an augmentation into bulk and visibility of parts already\noutlined. This doctrine of preformation (as opposed to epigenesis)\nis carried out by Charles Bonnet, who in his _Consid\u00e9rations sur les\ncorps organis\u00e9s_ (1762) propounds the further hypothesis that the\n'germs' from which living beings proceed contain, enclosed one within\nanother, the germs of all creatures yet to be. This is the hypothesis\nof '_Embo\u00eetement._' 'The system which regards generations as mere\neducts' says Kant (_Kritik der Urteilskraft,_ \u00a7 80; _Werke,_ iv. 318)\n'is called that of _individual_ preformation or the evolution theory:\nthe system which regards them as products is called Epigenesis.--which\nmight also be called the theory of _generic_ preformation, considering\nthat the productive powers of the g\u00e9n\u00e9rants follow the inherent\ntendencies belonging to the family characteristics, and that the\nspecific form is therefore a 'virtual' preformation, in this way the\nopposing theory of individual preformation might be better called\nthe involution theory, or theory of Einschachtelung (_Embo\u00eetement._)\nCf. Leibniz (_Werke,_ Erdmann, 715). 'As animals generally are not\nentirely born at conception or _generation,_ no more do they entirely\nperish at what we call _death_; for it is reasonable that what does\nnot commence naturally, does not finish either in the order of nature.\nThus quitting their mask or their rags, they only return to a subtler\ntheatre, where however they can be as sensible and well regulated as\nin the greater.... Thus not only the souls, but even the animals are\nneither generable nor perishable: they are only developed, enveloped,\nre-clothed, unclothed,--transformed. The souls never altogether quit\ntheir body, and do not pass from one body into another body which is\nentirely new to them. There is therefore no metempsychosis, but there\nis metamorphosis. The animals change, take and quit only parts: which\ntakes place little by little and by small imperceptible parcels, but\ncontinually, in nutrition: and takes place suddenly notably but rarely,\nat conception, or at death, which make them gain or lose much all at\nonce.'\nThe theory of _Embo\u00eetement_ or _Envelopment,_ according to Bonnet\n(_Consid\u00e9rations,_ &c. ch. I) is that 'the germs of all the organised\nbodies of one species were inclosed (_renferm\u00e9s_) one in another,\nand have been developed successively.' So according to Haller\n(_Physiology,_ Tome vii. \u00a7 2) 'it is evident that in plants the\nmother-plant contains the germs of several generations; and there is\ntherefore no inherent improbability in the view that _tous les enfans,\nexcept\u00e9 un, fussent renferm\u00e9s dans l'ovaire de la premi\u00e8re Fille\nd'Eve.'_ Cf. Weismann's _Continuity of the Germ-plasma._ Yet Bonnet\n(_Contemplation de la Nature,_ part vii. ch. 9, note 2), says, 'The\ngerms are not enclosed like boxes or cases one in another, but a germ\nforms part of another germ, as a grain forms part of the plant in which\nit is developed.'\nP. 293, \u00a7 163. Rousseau, _Contrat Social,_ liv. ii. ch. 3.\nP. 296, \u00a7 165. The 'adequate' idea is a sub-species of the 'distinct.'\nWhen an idea does not merely distinguish a thing from others (when\nit is _clear),_ or in addition represent the characteristic marks\nbelonging to the object so distinguished (when it is _distinct),_ but\nalso brings out the farther characteristics of these characteristics,\nthe idea is _adequate._ Thus adequate is a sort of second power of\ndistinct. (Cf. Baumeister's _Instit. Philos. Ration._ 1765, \u00a7\u00a7 64-94.)\nHegel's description rather agrees with the 'complete idea' 'by which\nI put before my mind singly marks sufficient to discern the thing\nrepresented from all other things in every case, state, and time'\n(Baumeister, _ib._ \u00a7 88).

But in the Proslogium he seeks an argument _quod nullo\nad se probandum quam se solo indigeret--i.e._ from the conception of\n(God as) the highest and greatest that can be (_aliquid quo nihil majus\ncogitari potest_) he infers its being (_sic ergo vere_ EST _aliquid\nquo majus cogitari non potest, ut nec cogitari possit non esse._) The\nabsolute would not be absolute if the idea of it did not _ipso facto_\nimply existence.\nGaunilo of Marmoutier in the _Liber pro insipiente_ made the objection\nthat the fact of such argument being needed showed that idea and\nreality were _prima facie_ different. And in fact the argument of\nAnselm deals with an Absolute which is object rather than subject,\nthought rather than thinker; in human consciousness realised, but\nnot essentially self-affirming--implicit (an:sich) only, as said in\npp. 331, 333.

It is as simple what the world is as a multiplicity: it\n'represents,' _i.e._ concentrates into unity, the variety of phenomena:\nis the expression of the material in the immaterial, of the compound in\nthe simple, of the extended outward in the inward. Its unity and its\nrepresentative capacity go together (cf. Lotze, _Mikrokosmus._) It is\nthe 'present which is full of the future and laden with the past' (ed.\nErdm. p. 197); the point which is all-embracing, the totality of the\nuniverse.

How stupid-headed\nmust be the man, who could not in a quarter of an hour master the\ntheory of asthenic, sthenic and indirectly asthenic diseases' (this is\npointed at Schelling's _Werke,_ iii. 236) 'and the three corresponding\ncurative methods, and who, when, no long time since, such instruction\nwas sufficient, could not in this short period be transformed from\na mere practitioner into a \"scientific\" physician? The formalism of\n_Naturphilosophie_ may teach _e.g._ that understanding is electricity,\nor that the animal is nitrogen, or even that it is _like_ the South or\nthe North, or that it represents it,--as baldly as is here expressed\nor with greater elaboration in terminology. At such teachings the\ninexperienced may fall into a rapture of admiration, may reverence the\nprofound genius it implies,--may take delight in the sprightliness\nof language which instead of the abstract _concept_ gives the more\npleasing _perceptual_ image, and may congratulate itself on feeling its\nsoul akin to such splendid achievement.

This\nobservation with regard to the nature of mathematics gives a hint as to\nthe first and supreme condition of its possibility: it must be based\non some pure percept in which it can exhibit all its concepts _in\nconcreto_ and yet _\u00e0 priori,_ or, as it is called, _construe_ them.'\nThe phrase, and the emphasis on the doctrine, that perception must be\ntaken as an auxiliary in mathematics,' belong specially to the second\nedition of the _Kritik, e.g._ Pref. xii.

OSMASTON, B.A.\nAUTHOR OF \"THE ART AND GENIUS OF TINTORET,\" \"AN ESSAY\nON THE FUTURE OF POETRY,\" AND OTHER WORKS\nVOL. I\nLONDON\nG. BELL AND SONS, LTD.\n1920\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE\nThe translation of Hegel's \"Aesthetik\" or \"Philosophy of Fine Art,\"\nwhich is contained in the four volumes of the present work, is the\nfirst complete translation in English of the three volumes devoted to\nthis subject in the collected edition (Berlin, 1835). I know of four\npartial translations in English of this work and one in French. These\nare Mr. W. M. Bryant's translation of Part II[1], Mr. Kedney's short\nanalysis of the entire work[2], Mr. Hastie's translation of Michelet's\nshort \"Philosophy of Art[3],\" prefaced by Hegel's Introduction, partly\ntranslated and partly summarized and lastly Professor B. Bosanquet's\ncomplete translation of Hegel's first Introduction with notes[4].\nThe French translation of M. B\u00e9nard purports to be more or less\na reproduction of the entire work and runs into two large-sized\nvolumes. It also is, however, so far as Hegel's Introduction and the\nfirst two Parts are concerned, merely a compressed summary, and only\nin particular passages is the translation anything but a very free\nrendering of the original, though there is a far closer approach to\nthis in Part III.\nI have not seen Mr. Bryant's translation. As any approach to an\nadequate reproduction of Hegel's writing Mr. Hastie's translation of\nMichelet's work and Mr. Kedney's analysis are of very little value[5].\nProfessor Bosanquet's translation is admirable within the limits\nimposed. To that extent I have merely followed, as I was able, in\nmy friend's footsteps; but this advance covers little more than one\nsixteenth part of the entire work of 1,600 pages.\nWith regard to all such analyses I entirely concur with Professor\nBosanquet's view stated in his preface, that such merely mislead if\nregarded as in any way a reflex of either Hegel himself or the German\ntext. It is true that this work is--as are in their degree other\nvolumes of the collected edition, the \"Outlines of the Philosophy\nof Right\" for example--a heterogeneous product, in our own instance\nnot merely lacking the final revision of the author, but rather put\ntogether as such a connected treatise by the editor responsible (i)\nfrom several autograph MSS. of Hegel[6], some of which were little\nmore than fragmentary notes for lectures, (ii) supplemented further\nfrom notes[7] taken by pupils who attended such lectures, the entire\nconglomerate being (iii) finally dovetailed together with connecting\nlinks by the editorial hand much as, to cite his own illustration, a\ncareful picture restorer might do in order to secure the impression of\na unified work, the unity aimed at by himself being rather that of a\nconnected literary treatise than a series of lectures.\nIt is obvious that a product of this nature will vary considerably\nthroughout in the degree that the personality and unique flavour of\nHegel himself, whether viewed as writer or thinker, asserts itself.\nThe introductions[8] have been, it would appear, taken almost\nexclusively from Hegel's own MSS.; but even these remained unrevised\nfor the press, owing to the premature and sudden death of their author.\nOf the greater portion of the work we can merely form our judgment of\nthe nature of its authenticity from the content itself. On the whole I\nshould myself say that the result was more favourable than might under\nsuch conditions have been expected. The editor assures us expressly\nthat so far as all illustrations and the substantive content of the\nwork is concerned no attempt has been made whatever to supplement the\nsame. Hegel is throughout here entirely responsible. I think, further,\nthat the endeavour claimed by the editor to preserve the general\ncharacter and tone (_Kolorit_) of Hegel's own diction has attained a\ndegree of success that could only have been within the reach of devoted\npupils and friends of the man himself, who for many years both attended\nhis lectures and studied his published works. Whatever opinion,\nhowever, we may arrive at on this head there can hardly be two opinions\nas to the sources in which the main interest consists for a modern\nreader.\nFirst, I should lay particular stress on the forceful and\ncharacteristic manner in which the fundamental philosophical\nconceptions which underlie the entire fabric are worked into and\nelaborated explicitly, throughout its detail. The very nature of this\nunwearied and insistent interfusion (_Durchdringung_) of positive\nfact, whether historical, scientific, or aesthetic, with the dialectic\nmovement of the Idea is here as essentially the method of Hegel as it\nis elsewhere. And this is so despite the fact that it is here presented\nfor the most part in a form less repellent to the ordinary reader and\nless provocative of hostile criticism. Translators therefore, who,\nfollowing the example of the French translator[9], deliberately seek\nto lighten the burden of their cargo by throwing overboard what they\nchoose to call the \"injurious dialectic,\" or the \"dark labyrinth\" of\nthis aspect of our work may reproduce much that is of instruction or\ninterest, but most certainly do not reproduce either the main strength\nof Hegel as a thinker, or the most characteristic impression--to say\nnothing of the repetitions--of such style or absence of literary style\nthat he possessed.\nSecondly, if there is one feature more striking than any other in this\nwork, which is bound at least to surprise anyone who still harbours\nthe obsolete notion that this philosopher moved in an exclusively\nabstract region of idea remote from the concrete experience of life and\nscientific or artistic knowledge, it is the wealth and extraordinary\nrange of the illustrations in these volumes no less than the vigour and\nfreshness of their application. In this respect two translations which\nmerely amount to a summary of theoretical content simply omit the vital\nor at least the most attractive heart of the interest.\nAs to the present claim of this laborious work to recognition and\nstudy, its historical significance is, I think, admitted by the most\nacknowledged authorities on the subject. As Schasler has called it,\nit is the first complete system of a philosophy of Art. The nature\nof its importance to our own most able and learned historian of the\nPhilosophy of Fine Art may not only be deduced from his own summary of\nits contents and significance in his invaluable historical survey[10],\nbut is further illustrated by the fact that he has reproduced the\nconcluding portion of Hegel's Introduction _in extenso_ in an Appendix\nto this work.\nOther writers have been less judicious both as hostile critics and in\nthe degree of their praise or enthusiasm. One German authority has\ncalled it Hegel's masterpiece. Such a title is, apart from any other\nground, sufficiently excluded by its history alone. Whether Hegel might\nhave made it his masterpiece had he lived is of course another question.\nOther admirers, such as the late Professor Caird[11], have more\nlegitimately accepted such a distinction for the \"Phenomenologie des\nGeistes.\" Mr. Hastie will even have it that throughout \"All is clear,\nradiant, harmonious and dim with the things that are a joy for ever.\"\nSuch an effusive display of abstract _Vorstellung_ reminds one little\nof either the dour temper of the Swabian philosopher, or the concrete\nintelligence which most distinguishes him from his rivals now and in\nhis lifetime. I can promise no such garden of Hesperides, or even\nPlatonic banquet, to any of my readers. It is true that we have here,\nthe work being primarily built upon lectures intended to instruct\nthe ordinary student, no such parade of the dialectic method in its\nformal structure such as constitutes the root of offence in some other\nworks of Hegel. But if we approach it with the belief that all is\ntherefore the plain sailing we meet with in the world of journalistic\nart criticism and the commonsense conceptions of everyday life, or\nwith the assurance that the work is, or can be, intelligible without\nsome real attempt to grapple with the fundamental ideas of Hegelian\nmetaphysic, we may find our disappointment very considerable. As a\nhumble translator I am bound to say that in a very large number of\npassages I have by no means discovered immediacy of intelligibility\nor radiance to be a conspicuous feature of the original. Radiance is\nindeed, I should say, not an attribute emphatically characteristic of\nany kind of Teutonic literature, and least of all of its scientific and\nphilosophical literature. The present work is certainly no exception.\nWith its untiring, not to say remorseless, effort to press home in\nrepeated expression, often but slightly varied, the same fundamental\npoints, its dogged and endless persistence in the careful explication\nthrough rational definition of every kind of positive material\nthat presents itself from the nature of the divine in man, or the\nsoul of living beast to the accurate determination in the terms of\nexpressed thought of a musical sound or an epigram or simile, with\nits well-nigh total disregard of the beauty of literary style, and\nits by no means unfrequent disregard of all principle of proportion\nin the co-ordination of its varied subject-matter--whatever else\nsuch a product may be it is most assuredly not, at least to English\napprehension, reminiscent of the radiance either of Homer or Apollo.\nBut though even sincere admiration may smile over such a description,\nit does unquestionably reflect to a remarkable extent the thoroughness,\ntenacity of purpose, the absence of superficial rhetoric, the wide\nrange, the extraordinary combination of constructive idea and detailed\nknowledge and research we rightly associate with the most valued works\nof German science and philosophy. It has never been more needful\nthan at this time of day to draw attention to such qualities, when\nthe national bias is to ignore or belittle their presence. It is,\nmoreover, not without passages which attain to a very real elevation of\neloquence, eloquence marked by the profoundest earnestness and entirely\nfree from the least flavour of bombast or sentimentalism. To the right\nkind of reader it can hardly fail to convey a certain fascination\nwhich is not merely due to the presence of a powerful and original\nintellect, but is equally inseparable from the product of a human soul\nintent upon getting at the heart of its subject, and keeping its vision\nthroughout fixed on that. Nor is the mere breadth of the canvas and the\ndepth of its content its only attraction. The work is indeed full of\ndigressions of exceptional interest to the general reader, and as such\nbears the indelible stamp of Hegel's manner as a lecturer, which his\neditor maintains stood out in such marked contrast to his more concise\nstyle as an author, drawing as he did when lecturing so largely on his\nencyclopaedic stores of knowledge.\nTo treat all the text as we now have it with the same respect may\nvery possibly betoken to some an excess of zeal on the part of the\ntranslator; but after all the most important thing for an English\nreader is to know what the volumes actually contain. In dealing with\nHegel the outlined sketch, whether secured through a process of\ndistillation or adulteration, is by no means any compensation for the\nloss of the complete picture. If we are impatient over many aspects of\nthis philosopher's particularity, we had much better dispense with him\naltogether.\nSympathetically studied it is hardly too much to say that this\nmonumental work is an education in itself. It is at any rate one which\ncannot fail to enlarge our conceptions of the significance and dignity\nof human art. Nor is this by any means impossible, even though we are\nunable to concur in, or indeed remain insufficiently qualified to\nexpress a judgment upon all or even a few of the most important of\nits conclusions. But it is perhaps not wholly unnecessary to observe\nthat before venturing upon a verdict in our wisdom we must, as Robert\nBrowning submitted in reference to the criticism passed upon his\npoetry, have awakened both our senses and intelligence \"that they may\nthe better judge.\" It is the modest aim of the present translation to\nmake that preparatory process more easy for the English reader, to\nassist that intelligent assimilation of the truth as it appears to a\ngreat and world-famous thinker, which is the necessary condition of\nany criticism meriting respectful attention at all. Such assimilation\nis perhaps impossible in the case of Hegel without effort, and indeed\nsomething of sympathy with his general outlook and temper, making as\nhe does little or no appeal whatever to the lover of literature as\nsuch, who had consequently far better leave him austerely alone to the\nconsideration of others who are more attracted.\nI do not propose in these prefatory remarks to enlarge further on the\nactual content of the work, or on the nature of the criticism which has\nbeen directed either to fundamental positions or matters of detail.\nSome of these I have referred to in my notes on the text where they are\nmost obviously pertinent. The general reader will find a very useful\nintroduction to some of the more primary difficulties in the study of\nHegel in Professor Bosanquet's prefatory essay to his translation.\nThe more serious student can hardly dispense with the perusal of a\nconsiderable portion of the same writer's history of Aesthetik, at\nleast that portion which directly deals with the writings of Kant,\nSchiller, Goethe, Schelling, and Hegel himself on the subject[12].\nI hold my translation to be as literal as is possible consistently with\nan endeavour to render or interpret German philosophical language in\nthe language or idiom of really expressive and intelligible English. It\nis now generally admitted that all translation is in the nature of an\ninterpretation. However much I may have fallen short of my aim, that\naim has been throughout to express the actual ideal content of the\nGerman, not merely with all the force and directness I could muster,\nbut with as near an approach to the formal structure of the German text\nas was consistent with the like condition of really readable English.\nAbove all I have striven to avoid the lassitude of mere paraphrase,\nthat vague generalization of content which conceives itself to possess\nthe right to eliminate from the text pretty much what it pleases.\nThe Index attached to the final volume is limited in its reference\nto proper names, and pre-eminently to illustrations in the text of\nworks either of general literature, or other products of art, which I\nconsidered of use or interest to the general reader.\nIn the table of contents to the several volumes I have notified with\nbrackets my own contributions to the German original. In all other\nrespects I have retained the divisions of subject-matter as I found\nthem recorded by Hegel or his editor.\nF. P.

It is\na subject co-extensive with the entire _realm of the beautiful_; more\nspecifically described, its province is that of _Art_, or rather, we\nshould say, of _Fine Art._\nFor a subject-matter such as this the term \"Aesthetic\" is no doubt\nnot entirely appropriate, for \"Aesthetic\" denotes more accurately the\nscience of the senses or emotion. It came by its origins as a science,\nor rather as something that to start with purported to be a branch of\nphilosophy, during the period of the school of Wolff, in other words\nwhen works of art were generally regarded in Germany with reference\nto the feelings they were calculated to evoke, as, for example, the\nfeelings of pleasure, admiration, fear, pity, and so forth. It is owing\nto the unsuitability or, more strictly speaking, the superficiality\nof this term that the attempt has been made by some to apply the name\n\"Callistic\" to this science. Yet this also is clearly insufficient\ninasmuch as the science here referred to does not investigate beauty in\nits general signification, but the beauty of art pure and simple. For\nthis reason we shall accommodate ourselves to the term Aesthetic, all\nthe more so as the mere question of nomenclature is for ourselves a\nmatter of indifference. It has as such been provisionally accepted in\nordinary speech, and we cannot do better than retain it. The _term_,\nhowever, which fully expresses our science is \"Philosophy of Art,\" and,\nwith still more precision, \"Philosophy of Fine Art.\"\n(_a_) In virtue of this expression we at once exclude the beauty of\nNature from the scientific exposition of Fine Art. Such a limitation\nof our subject may very well appear from a certain point of view as\nan arbitrary boundary line, similar to that which every science is\nentitled to fix in the demarcation of its subject-matter. We must not,\nhowever, understand the limitation of \"Aesthetic\" to the beauty of art\nin this sense. We are accustomed, no doubt, in ordinary life to speak\nof a beautiful colour, a beautiful heaven, a beautiful stream, to say\nnothing of beautiful flowers, animals, and, above all, of beautiful\nhuman beings. Without entering now into the disputed question how far\nthe quality of beauty can justly be predicated of such objects, and\nconsequently the beauty of Nature comes generally into competition with\nthat of art, we are justified in maintaining categorically that the\nbeauty of art stands _higher_ than Nature. For the beauty of art is a\nbeauty begotten, a new birth of mind[2]; and to the extent that Spirit\nand its creations stand higher than Nature and its phenomena, to that\nextent the beauty of art is more exalted than the beauty of Nature.\nIndeed, if we regard the matter in its formal aspect, that is to say,\naccording to the way it is there, any chance fancy that passes through\nany one's head[3], is of higher rank than any product of Nature. For\nin every case intellectual conception and freedom are inseparable\nfrom such a conceit. In respect to _content_ the sun appears to us an\nabsolutely necessary constituent of actual fact, while the perverse\nfancy passes away as something accidental and evanescent. None the\nless in its own independent being a natural existence such as the sun\npossesses no power of self-differentiation; it is neither essentially\nfree nor self-aware; and, if we regard it in its necessary cohesion\nwith other things, we do not regard it independently for its own sake,\nand consequently not as beautiful.\nMerely to maintain, in a general way, that mind and the beauty of art\nwhich originates therefrom stand _higher_ than the beauty of Nature\nis no doubt to establish next to nothing. The expression _higher_\nis obviously entirely indefinite; it still indicates the beauty of\nNature and art as standing juxtaposed in the field of conception, and\nemphasizes the difference as a quantitative and accordingly external\ndifference. But in predicating of mind and its artistic beauty a\nhigher place in contrast to Nature, we do not denote a distinction\nwhich is merely relative. Mind, and mind alone, is pervious to truth,\ncomprehending all in itself, so that all which is beautiful can only\nbe veritably beautiful as partaking in this higher sphere and as\nbegotten of the same. Regarded under this point of view it is only a\nreflection of the beauty appertinent to mind, that is, we have it under\nan imperfect and incomplete mode, and one whose substantive being is\nalready contained in the mind itself.\nAnd apart from this we shall find the restriction to the beauty of\nart only natural, for in so far as the beauties of Nature may have\ncome under discussion--a rarer occurrence among ancient writers than\namong ourselves--yet at least it has occurred to no one to insist\nemphatically on the beauty of natural objects to the extent of\nproposing a science, or systematic exposition of such beauties. It is\ntrue that the point of view of _utility_ has been selected for such\nexclusive treatment. We have, for example, the conception of a science\nof natural objects in so far as they are useful in the conflict with\ndiseases, in other words a description of minerals, chemical products,\nplants, animals, which subserve the art of healing. We do not find\nany analogous exploitation and consideration of the realm of Nature\nin its aspect of beauty. In the case of natural beauty we are too\nkeenly conscious that we are dealing with an indefinite subject-matter\ndestitute of any real criterion. It is for this reason that such an\neffort of comparison would carry with it too little interest to justify\nthe attempt.\nThese preliminary observations over beauty in Nature and art, over the\nrelation of both, and the exclusion of the first-mentioned from the\nprovince of our real subject-matter are intended to disabuse us of\nthe notion that the limitation of our science is simply a question of\ncapricious selection. We have, however, not reached the point where a\n_demonstration_ of this fact is feasible for the reason that such an\ninvestigation falls within the limits of our science itself, and it is\ntherefore only at a later stage that we can either discuss or prove the\nsame.\nAssuming, however, that we have, by way of prelude, limited our inquiry\nto the beauty of art, we are merely by this first step involved in\nfresh difficulties.\n(_b_) What must first of all occur to us is the question whether\nFine Art in itself is truly susceptible to a scientific treatment.\nIt is a simple fact that beauty and art pervade all the affairs of\nlife like some friendly genius, and embellish with their cheer all\nour surroundings, mental no less than material. They alleviate the\nstrenuousness of such relations, the varied changes of actual life;\nthey banish the tedium of our existence with their entertainment; and\nwhere nothing really worth having is actually achieved, it is at least\nan advantage that they occupy the place of actual vice. Yet while\nart prevails on all sides with its pleasing shapes, from the crude\ndecorations of savage tribes up to the splendours of the sacred shrine\nadorned with every conceivable beauty of design, none the less such\nshapes themselves appear to fall outside the real purposes of life,\nand even where the imaginative work of art is not impervious to such\nserious objects, nay, rather at times even appear to assist them, to\nthe extent at least of removing what is evil to a distance, yet for\nall that art essentially belongs to the _relaxation_ and _recreation_\nof spiritual life, whereas its substantive interests rather make a\ncall upon its strained energy. On such grounds an attempt to treat\nthat which on its own account is not of a serious character with all\nthe gravity of scientific exposition may very possibly appear to be\nunsuitable and pedantic. In any case from such a point of view art\nappears a _superfluity_ if contrasted with the essential needs and\ninterests of life, even assuming that the _softening_ of the soul which\na preoccupation with the beauty of objects is capable of producing,\ndoes not actually prove injurious in its effeminate influence upon\nthe serious quality of those _practical_ interests. Owing to this\nfundamental assumption that they are a luxury it has often appeared\nnecessary to undertake the defence of the fine arts relatively to\nthe necessities of practical life, and in particular relatively to\nmorality and piety; and inasmuch as this harmlessness is incapable of\ndemonstration, the idea has been at least to make it appear credible,\nthat this luxury of human experience contributes a larger proportion of\n_advantages_ than _disadvantages_. In this respect serious aims have\nbeen attributed to art, and in many quarters it has been commended as\na mediator between reason and sensuous associations, between private\ninclinations and duty, personified in short as a reconciler of these\nforces in the strenuous conflict and opposition which this antagonism\ngenerates. But it is just conceivable[4] that, even assuming the\npresence of such aims with all their indubitably greater seriousness,\nneither reason nor duty come by much profit from such mediation, for\nthe simple reason that they are incapable by their very nature of\nany such interfusion or compromise, demanding throughout the same\npurity which they intrinsically possess. And we might add that art\ndoes not become in any respect more worthy thereby of scientific\ndiscussion, inasmuch as it remains still on two sides a menial, that\nis, subservient to idleness and frivolity, if also to objects of more\nelevated character. In such service, moreover, it can at most merely\nappear as a means instead of being an object for its own sake. And, in\nconclusion, assuming that art is a means, it still invariably labours\nunder the formal defect, that so far as it in fact is subservient to\nmore serious objects, and produces results of like nature, the means\nwhich actually brings this about is _deception._ For beauty is made\nvital in the _appearance_[5]. Now it can hardly be denied that aims\nwhich are true and serious ought not to be achieved by deception; and\nthough such an effect is here and there secured by this means, such\nought only to be the case in a restricted degree; and even in the\nexceptional case we are not justified in regarding deception as the\nright means. For the means ought to correspond with the dignity of the\naim. Neither semblance nor deception, but only what is itself real and\ntrue, possesses a title to create what is real and true. Just in the\nsame way science has to investigate the true interests of the mind in\naccordance with the actual process of the real world and the manner of\nconceiving it as we actually find it.\nWe may possibly conclude from the above grounds that the art of beauty\nis unworthy of philosophical examination. It is after all, it may be\nsaid, only a pleasant pastime, and, though we may admit more serious\naims are also in its purview, nevertheless it is essentially opposed to\nsuch aims in their seriousness. It is at the most merely the servant of\nspecific amusements no less than the exceptional serious objects, and\nfor the medium of its existence as also for the means of its operations\ncan merely avail itself of deception and show.\nBut yet further in the _second_ place, it is a still more plausible\ncontention that even supposing fine art to be compatible generally\nwith philosophical disquisition, none the less it would form no really\nadequate subject-matter for scientific enquiry in the strict sense.\nFor the beauty of art is presented to sense, feeling, perception, and\nimagination: its field is not that of thought, and the comprehension of\nits activity and its creations demands another faculty than that of the\nscientific intelligence. Furthermore, what we enjoy in artistic beauty\nis just the _freedom_ of its creative and plastic activity. In the\nproduction and contemplation of these we appear to escape the principle\nof rule and system. In the creations of art we seek for an atmosphere\nof repose and animation as some counterpoise to the austerity of the\nrealm of law and the sombre self-concentration of thought; we seek for\nblithe and powerful reality in exchange for the shadow-world of the\nIdea. And, last of all, the free activity of the imagination is the\nsource of the fair works of art, which in this world of the mind are\neven more free than Nature is herself. Not only has art at its service\nthe entire wealth of natural form in all their superabundant variety,\nbut the creative imagination is able inexhaustibly to extend the realm\nof form by its _own_ productions and modifications. In the presence of\nsuch an immeasurable depth of inspired creation and its free products,\nit may not unreasonably be supposed that thought will lose the courage\nto apprehend such in their apparent _range_, to pronounce its verdict\nthereon, and to appropriate such beneath its universal formulae.\nScience, on the other hand, everyone must admit, is formally bound\nto occupy itself with thinking which abstracts from the mass of\nparticulars: and for this very reason, from one point of view, the\nimagination and its contingency and caprice, in other words the organ\nof artistic activity and enjoyment, is excluded from it. On the other\nhand, when art gives joyous animation to just this gloomy and arid\ndryness of the notion, bringing its abstractions and divisions into\nreconciliation with concrete fact, supplementing with its detail\nwhat is wanting to the notion in this respect, even in that case\na _purely_ contemplative reflection simply removes once more all\nthat has been added, does away with it, conducting the notion once\nagain to that simplicity denuded of positive reality which belongs\nto it and its shadowland of abstraction. It is also a possible\ncontention that science in respect to content is concerned with what\nis essentially _necessary._ If our science of Aesthetic places on one\nside natural beauty, not merely have we apparently made no advance,\nbut rather separated ourselves yet further from what is necessary. The\nexpression _Nature_ implies from the first the ideas of _necessity_\nand _uniformity_, that is to say a constitution which gives every\nexpectation of its proximity and adaptability to scientific inquiry.\nIn mental operations generally, and most of all in the imagination,\nif contrasted in this respect with Nature, caprice and superiority\nto every kind of formal restriction, caprice, it is here assumed, is\nuniquely in its right place, and these at once put out of court the\nbasis of a scientific inquiry.\nFrom each and all these points of view consequently, in its origin,\nthat is to say, in its effect and in its range, fine art, so far\nfrom proving itself fitted for scientific effort, rather appears\nfundamentally to resist the regulative principle of thought, and to be\nill-adapted for exact scientific discussion.\nDifficulties of this kind, and others like them, which have been raised\nin respect to a thoroughly scientific treatment of fine art have been\nborrowed from current ideas, points of view, and reflection, the more\nsystematic expansion of which we may read _ad nauseam_ in previous\nliterature, in particular French literature, upon the subject of beauty\nand the fine arts. Such contain to some extent facts which have their\njustification; in fact, elaborate arguments[6] are deduced therefrom,\nwhich also are not without their tincture of apparent plausibility.\nIn this way, for instance, there is the fact that the configuration\nof beauty is as multifold as the phenomenon of beauty is of universal\nextension; from which we may conclude, if we care to do so, that a\nuniversal impulse towards beauty is enclosed in our common nature,\nand may yet further conceivably infer, that because the conceptions\nof beauty are so countless in their variety and withal are obviously\nsomething _particular_, it is impossible to secure laws of _universal_\nvalidity either relatively to beauty or our taste for it.\nBefore turning away from such theories to the subject, as we ourselves\nconceive it, it will be a necessary and preliminary task to discuss the\nquestions and objections raised above.\nFirst, as to the _worthiness_ of art to form the object of scientific\ninquiry, it is no doubt the case that art can be utilized as a mere\npastime in the service of pleasure and entertainment, either in the\nembellishment of our surroundings, the imprinting of a delight-giving\nsurface to the external conditions of life, or the emphasis placed by\ndecoration on other objects. In these respects it is unquestionably no\nindependent or free art, but an art subservient to certain objects.\nThe kind of art, however, which _we_ ourselves propose to examine is\none which is _free_ in its aim and its means. That art in general can\nserve other objects, and even be merely a pastime, is a relation which\nit possesses in common with thought itself. From one point of view\nthought likewise, as science subservient to other ends, can be used in\njust the same way for finite purposes and means as they chance to crop\nup, and as such serviceable faculty of science is not self-determined,\nbut determined by something alien to it. But, further, as distinct\nfrom such subservience to particular objects, science is raised of its\nown essential resources in free independence to truth, and exclusively\nunited with its own aims in discovering the true fulfillment in that\ntruth.\nFine art is not art in the true sense of the term until it is also\nthus free, and its _highest_ function is only then satisfied when it\nhas established itself in a sphere which it shares with religion,\nand philosophy, becoming thereby merely one mode and form through\nwhich the _Divine_, the profoundest interests of mankind, and\nspiritual truths of widest range, art brought home to consciousness\nand expressed. It is in works of art that nations have deposited the\nrichest intuitions and ideas they possess; and not infrequently fine\nart supplies a key of interpretation to the wisdom and religion of\npeoples; in the case of many it is the only one. This is an attribute\nwhich art shares in common with religion and philosophy, the peculiar\ndistinction in the case of art being that its presentation of the\nmost exalted subject-matter is in sensuous form, thereby bringing\nthem nearer to Nature and her mode of envisagement, that is closer\nto our sensitive and emotional life. The world, into the profundity\nof which thought penetrates, is a supersensuous one, a world which\nto start with is posited as a Beyond in contrast to the immediacy of\nordinary conscious life and present sensation. It is the freedom of\nreflecting consciousness which disengages itself from this immersion in\nthe \"_this side_,\" or immediacy, in other words sensuous reality and\nfinitude. But the mind is able, too, to heal the _fracture_ which is\nthus created in its progression. From the wealth of its own resources\nit brings into being the works of fine art as the primary bond of\nmediation between that which is exclusively external, sensuous and\ntransitory, and the medium of pure thought, between Nature and its\nfinite reality, and the infinite freedom of a reason which comprehends.\nNow it was objected that the _element_[7] _of art_ was, if we view it\nas a whole, of an _unworthy_ character, inasmuch as it consisted of\nappearance and deceptions inseparable from such. Such a contention\nwould of course be justifiable, if we were entitled to assume that\nappearance had no _locus standi_[8] at all. An appearance or show\nis, however, essential to actuality. There could be no such thing as\ntruth if it did not appear, or, rather, let itself appear[9], were it\nnot further true for some _one_ thing or person, _for_ itself as also\n_for_ spirit. Consequently it cannot be appearance in general against\nwhich such an objection can be raised, but the particular mode of its\nmanifestation under which art makes actual what is essentially real\nand true. If, then, the appearance, in the medium of which art gives\ndeterminate existence to its creations, be defined as _deception_, such\nan objection is in the first instance intelligible if we compare it\nwith the _external world_ of a phenomena, and its _immediate_ relation\nto ourselves as material substance, or view it relatively to our own\nworld of emotions, that is our inward sensuous life. Both these are\nworlds to which in our everyday life, the life, that is, of visible\nexperience, we are accustomed to attach the worth and name of reality,\nactuality and truth as contrasted with that of art, which fails to\npossess such reality as we suppose. Now it is just this entire sphere\nof the empirical world, whether on its personal side or its objective\nside, which we ought rather to call in a stricter sense than when\nwe apply the term to the world of art, merely a show or appearance,\nand an even more unyielding form of deception. It is only beyond the\nimmediacy of emotional life and that world of external objects that\nwe shall discover reality in any true sense of the term. Nothing\nis actually real but that which is actual in its own independent\nright and substance[10], that which is at once of the substance of\nNature and of mind, which, while it is actually _here_ in present and\ndeterminate existence, yet retains under such limitation an essential\nand self-concentred being, and only in virtue of such is truly real.\nThe predominance of these universal powers is precisely that which art\naccentuates and manifests. In the external and soul-world of ordinary\nexperience we have also no doubt this essence of actuality, but in the\nchaotic congeries of particular detail, encumbered by the immediacy of\nsensuous envisagement, and every kind of caprice of condition, event,\ncharacter, and so forth. Now it is just the show and deception of this\nfalse and evanescent world which art disengages from the veritable\nsignificance of phenomena to which we have referred, implanting in\nthe same a reality of more exalted rank born of mind. The phenomena\nof art therefore are not merely not appearance and nothing more; we\nare justified in ascribing to them, as contrasted with the realities\nof our ordinary life, an actually higher reality and more veritable\nexistence. To as little extent are the representations of art a\ndeceptive appearance as compared with the assumed truer delineations\nof historical writing. For immediate existence also does not belong to\nhistorical writing. It only possesses the intellectual appearance of\nthe same as the medium of its delineations, and its content remains\ncharged with the entire contingent _materia_ of ordinary reality and\nits events, developments and personalities, whereas the work of art\nbrings us face to face with the eternal powers paramount in history\nwith this incidental association of the immediate sensuous present and\nits unstable appearance expunged.\nIf, however, it is in contrast with philosophic thought and religious\nand ethical principles, that the mode of appearance of the shapes of\nart, is described as a deception, there is certainly this in support\nof the view that the mode of revelation attained by a content in the\nrealm of thought is the truest reality. In comparison, nevertheless,\nwith the appearance of immediate sensuous existence and that of\nhistorical narration, the show of art possesses the advantage that, in\nits own virtue, it points beyond itself, directing us to a somewhat\nspiritual, which it seeks to envisage to the conceptive mind. Immediate\nappearance, on the contrary, does not give itself out to be thus\nillusive, but rather to be the true and real, though as a matter of\nfact such truth is contaminated and obstructed by the immediately\nsensuous medium. The hard rind of Nature and the everyday world offer\nmore difficulty to the mind in breaking through to the Idea than do the\nproducts of art.\nBut if from this particular point of view we place art thus highly, we\nmust not, on the other hand, fail to remember that neither in respect\nto content or form is art either the highest or most absolute mode of\nbringing the true interests of our spiritual life to consciousness.\nThe very form of art itself is sufficient to limit it to a definite\ncontent. It is only a particular sphere and grade of truth which is\ncapable of being reproduced in the form of a work of art. Such truth\nmust have the power in its own determinate character to go out freely\ninto sensuous shape and remain adequate to itself therein, if it is\nto be the genuine content of art, as is the case, for example, with\nthe gods of Greece. On the other hand there is a profounder grasp of\ntruth, in which the form is no longer on such easy and friendly terms\nwith the sensuous material as to be adequately accepted and expressed\nby that medium. Of such a type is the Christian conception of truth;\nand above all it is the prevailing spirit of our modern world, or,\nmore strictly, of our religion and our intellectual culture, which\nhave passed beyond the point at which art is the highest mode under\nwhich the absolute is brought home to human consciousness. The type\npeculiar to art-production and its products fails any longer to satisfy\nman's highest need. We are beyond the stage of reverence for works of\nart as divine and objects deserving our worship. The impression they\nproduce is one of a more reflective[11] kind, and the emotions which\nthey arouse require a higher test and a further verification. Thought\nand reflection have taken their flight above fine art. To those who\nare fond of complaint and grumbling such a condition of things may be\nheld as a form of decadence; it may be ascribed to the obsession of\npassion and selfish interests, which scare away the seriousness of art\nno less than its blithesomeness. Or we may find the fault to lie in\nthe exigencies of the present day, the complex conditions of social\nand political life, which prevent the soul, entangled as it is in\nmicroscopic interests, from securing its freedom in the nobler objects\nof art, a condition, too, in which the intelligence itself becomes\na menial to such trifling wants and the interests they excite in\nsciences, which subserve objects of a like nature, and are seduced into\nthe voluntary exile of such a wilderness.\nBut however we may explain the fact it certainly is the case that Art\nis no longer able to discover that satisfaction of spiritual wants,\nwhich previous epochs and nations have sought for in it and exclusively\nfound in it, a satisfaction which, at least on the religious side, was\nassociated with art in the most intimate way. The fair days of Greek\nart, as also the golden time of the later middle ages, are over. The\nreflective culture of our life of to-day makes it inevitable, both\nrelatively to our volitional power and our judgment, that we adhere\nstrictly to general points of view, and regulate particular matters in\nconsonance with them, so that universal forms, laws, duties, rights,\nand maxims hold valid as the determining basis of our life and the\nforce within of main importance. What is demanded for artistic interest\nas also for artistic creation is, speaking in general terms, a vital\nenergy, in which the universal is not present as law and maxim, but\nis operative in union with the soul and emotions, just as also, in\nthe imagination, what is universal and rational is enclosed only as\nbrought into unity with a concrete sensuous phenomenon. For this reason\nthe present time is not, if we review its conditions in their widest\nrange, favourable to art. And with regard to the executive artist\nhimself it is not merely that reflection on every side, which _will_\ninsist on utterance, owing to the universal habit of critical opinion\nand judgment, leads him astray from his art and infects his mind\nwith a like desire to accumulate abstract thought in his creations;\nrather the entire spiritual culture of the times is of such a nature\nthat he himself stands within a world thus disposed to reflection\nand the conditions it presupposes, and, do what he may, he cannot\nrelease himself either by his wish or his power of decision from their\ninfluence, neither can he by means of exceptional education, or a\nremoval from the ordinary conditions of life, conjure up for himself\nand secure a solitude capable of replacing all that is lost.\nIn all these respects art is and remains for us, on the side, of its\nhighest possibilities, a thing of the past. Herein it has further lost\nits genuine truth and life, and is rather transported to our world of\n_ideas_ than is able to maintain its former necessity and its superior\nplace in reality. What is now stimulated in us by works of art is, in\naddition to the fact of immediate enjoyment, our judgment. In other\nwords we subject the content, and the means of presentation of the\nwork of art, and the suitability and unsuitability of both, to the\ncontemplation of our thought. A _science_ of art is therefore a far\nmore urgent necessity in our own days than in times in which art as\nart sufficed by itself alone to give complete satisfaction. We are\ninvited by art to contemplate it reflectively, not, that is to say,\nwith the object of recreating such art[12], but in order to ascertain\nscientifically its nature.\nIn doing our best to accept such an invitation we are confronted with\nthe objection already adverted to, that even assuming that art is a\nsubject adapted for philosophical investigation in a general way, yet\nit unquestionably is not so adapted to the systematic procedure of\nscience. Such an objection, however, implies to start with the false\nnotion that we can have a philosophical inquiry which is at the same\ntime unscientific. In reply to such a point I can only here state\nsummarily my opinion, that whatever ideas other people may have of\nphilosophy and philosophizing, I myself conceive philosophical inquiry\nof any sort or kind to be inseparable from the methods of science. The\nfunction of philosophy is to examine subject-matter in the light of the\nprinciple of necessity, not, it is true, merely in accordance with its\nsubjective[13] necessity or external co-ordination, classification,\nand so forth; it has rather to unfold and demonstrate the object under\nreview out of the necessity of its own intimate nature. Until this\nessential process is made explicit the scientific quality of such an\ninquiry is absent. In so far, however, as the objective necessity of\nan object subsists essentially in its logical and metaphysical nature\nthe isolated examination of art may in such a case, at any rate, or\nrather inevitably, must be carried forward with a certain relaxation\nof scientific stringency. For art is based upon many assumptions, part\nof which relate to its content, part to its material or conceptive[14]\nmedium, in virtue of which art is never far from the borders of\ncontingency and caprice. Consequently it is only relatively to the\nessential and ideal progression of its content and its means of\nexpression that we are able to recall with advantage the formative\nprinciple of its necessity[15].\nThe objection that works of fine art defy the examination of scientific\nthought, because they originate in the unregulated world of imagination\nand temperament, and assert their effect exclusively on the emotions\nand the fancy with a complexity and variety which defies exact\nanalysis, raises a difficulty which still carries genuine weight behind\nit[16]. As a matter of fact the beauty of art does appear in a form\nwhich is expressly to be contrasted with abstract thought, a form which\nit is compelled to disturb in order to exercise its own activity in\nits own way. Such a result is simply a corollary of the thesis that\nreality anywhere and everywhere, whether the life of Nature or mind,\nis defaced and slain by its comprehension; that so far from being\nbrought more close to us by the comprehension of thinking, it is only\nby this means that it is in the complete sense removed apart from us,\nso that in his attempt to grasp through thought as a _means_ the nature\nof life, man rather renders nugatory this very aim. An exhaustive\ndiscussion of the subject is here impossible; we propose merely to\nindicate the point of view from which the removal of this difficulty or\nimpossibility and incompatibility might be effected. It will at least\nbe readily admitted that mind is capable of self-contemplation, and\nof possessing a consciousness, and indeed one that implies a power of\nthought co-extensive with itself and everything which originates from\nitself. It is, in fact, precisely _thought_, the process of thinking,\nwhich constitutes the most intimate and essential nature of mind.\nIt is in this thinking-consciousness over itself and its products,\ndespite all the freedom and caprice such may otherwise and indeed\nmust invariably possess--assuming only mind or spirit to be veritably\npregnant therein--that mind exhibits the activity congenial to its\nessential nature. Art and the creations of art, being works which\noriginate in and are begotten of the spirit, are themselves stamped\nwith the hall-mark of spirit, even though the mode of its presentation\naccept for its own the phenomenal guise of sensuous reality, permeating\nas it does the sensuous substance with intelligence. Viewed in this\nlight art is placed from the first nearer to spirit and its thought\nthan the purely external and unintelligent Nature. In the products\nof art mind is exclusively dealing with that which is its own. And\nalthough works of art are not thought and notion simply as such, but\nan evolution of the notion out of itself, an alienation of the same\nin the direction of sensuous being, yet for all that the might of the\nthinking spirit is discovered _not merely_ in its ability to grasp\n_itself_ in its most native form as pure thinking, but also, and as\ncompletely, to recognize itself in its self-divestment in the medium\nof emotion and the sensuous, to retain the grasp of itself in that\n\"other\" which it transforms but is not, transmuting the alien factor\ninto thought-expression, and by so doing recovering it to itself. And\nmoreover in this active and frequent relation to that \"other\" than\nitself the reflective mind is not in any way untrue to itself. We have\nhere no oblivion or surrender of itself; neither is it so impotent as\nto be unable to comprehend what is differentiated from that other[17];\nwhat it actually does is to grasp in the notion _both_ itself and its\nopposite. For the notion is the universal, which maintains itself in\nits particularizations, which covers in its grasp both itself and its\n\"other,\" and consequently contains the power and energy to cancel the\nvery alienation into which it passes. For this reason the work of\nart, in which thought divests itself of itself[18], belongs to the\nrealm of comprehending thought; and mind, by subjecting it[19] to\nscientific contemplation, thereby simply satisfies its most essential\nnature. For inasmuch as thought is its essence and notion, it can only\nultimately find such a satisfaction after passing all the products of\nits activity through the alembic of rational thought, and in this way\nmaking them for the first time in very truth part of its own substance.\nBut though art, as we shall eventually see with yet more distinctness,\nis far indeed from being the highest form of mind, it is only in the\nphilosophy of art that it comes into all that it may justly claim.\nIn the same way art is not debarred from a philosophical inquiry by\nreason of its unregulated caprice. As already intimated, it is its\ntrue function to bring to consciousness the highest interests of mind.\nAn immediate consequence of this is that, so far as the _content_ of\nfine art is concerned, it cannot range about in all the wildness of an\nunbridled fancy; these interests of spirit posit categorically for the\ncontent that embodies them definite points of attachment[20], however\nmultifold and inexhaustible may be the forms and shapes they assume.\nThe same may be said of the forms themselves. They too do not remain\nunaffected by constraining principles. It is not every chance form\nwhich is capable of expressing and presenting these interests, capable\nof assimilating them and reproducing them. It is only through one\ndeterminate content that the form adequate to its embodiment is defined.\nIt is upon grounds such as these that we are also able to discover a\ntrack adapted to critical reflection through the apparently endless\nvistas of artistic creations and shapes.\nWe have now, I trust, by way of prelude, succeeded in restricting the\ncontent of our science on the lines of definition proposed. We have\nmade it clear that neither is fine art unworthy of philosophical study,\nnor is such a philosophical study incapable of accepting as an object\nof its cognition the essence of fine art.\nII\nIf we now investigate the required _mode_ of such scientific\ninvestigation, we are here again face to face with two contradictory\nmodes of handling the subject, each of which appears to exclude the\nother and to permit us to arrive at no satisfactory result.\nOn the one hand we _observe_ the science of art, merely so to speak,\nfrom an external point of view busying itself with actual works of art,\ncataloguing them in a history of art, drawing up a sort of commentary\nupon extant works, or propounding theories which are intended to supply\nthe general points of view for artistic criticism no less than artistic\nproduction.\nOn the other hand we find science wholly giving itself up in\nits independence and self-assured to the contemplation of the\nbeautiful, offering generalizations which do not concern the specific\ncharacteristics of a work of art, producing in short an abstract\nphilosophy of the beautiful.\n1. With regard to the first mentioned method of study, the\nstarting-point of which is the _empirical_ study of definite _facts_,\nsuch is the path everyone must tread who means to study art at all. And\njust as everyone nowadays, even though he does not actually concern\nhimself with physical science, yet deems it indispensable to his\nintellectual equipment to have some kind of knowledge of the principles\nof that science[21], so too it is generally considered more or less\nessential to any man of real cultivation, that he should possess some\ngeneral knowledge of art; and indeed the pretension to be ranked as\ndilletante, or even as genuine _connoisseur_, meets with comparatively\nfew exceptions.\n(_a_) If however knowledge of this kind is really to claim the rank\nof _connoisseurship_ of the first class it must be both varied in its\ncharacter and of the widest range. It is an indispensable condition\nto such that it should possess an accurate knowledge of the well-nigh\nlimitless field of particular works of art both of ancient and modern\ntimes, some of which have already disappeared, while others are only to\nbe found in distant countries or portions of the globe, and which it is\nthe misfortune of our situation to be unable to inspect. Add to this\nthat every work of art belongs to _one_ age, _one_ nationality, and\ndepends upon particular historical or other ends and ideas. On account\nof this it is indispensable that the finest type of art-scholarship\nshould have at its command not merely historical knowledge of a wide\nrange, but knowledge that is highly specialized. In other words, a\nwork of art is associated with particular[22] detail in a peculiar\nsense, and a specific treatment, is imperative to the comprehension and\ninterpretation of it. And in conclusion this connoisseurship of the\nfinest class does not merely imply like every other a retentive memory,\nbut also a keen imaginative sense, in order to hold clearly before\nthe mind the images of such artistic representations in all their\ncharacteristic lines, and above all, to have them ready for comparison\nwith other works of art.\n(_b_) Within the limits of such a method of study which is primarily\nhistorical[23], distinct points of view will soon assert themselves\nwhich in the contemplation of such works we are not suffered to\nlose sight of, inasmuch as they are indispensable to a critical\nverdict. Such points of view, as is the case with other sciences the\ncommencement of which is empirical, are summarized, after their due\ncollection as separate units and comparison, in general criteria and\npropositions, emerging in a yet further stage of formal generalization\nin \"_Theories_ of the arts.\" This is not the place to dwell at length\nupon literature of this kind; we will merely recall a few specimens\nof such work in the most general way. There is, for instance, the\n\"Poetics\" of Aristotle, which contains a theory of tragedy still of\nreal interest. With still more pertinency among the ancients the\n\"Ars Poetica\" of Horace and the Essay on the \"Sublime\" by Longinus\nwill exemplify generally the manner in which this type of theorizing\nis carried out. The general theses which are therein formulated are\nintended to stand as premises and rules, in accordance with which works\nof art ought to be produced, their necessity being above all insisted\non in times of the decadence of poetry and art. They are, in short,\nprescriptions to the practitioner. The prescriptions, however, of these\nphysicians of art were even less successful in their curative effect on\nart than are the ordinary ones in the restoration of bodily health.\nAs to such theories I will merely remark that although in their\n_detail_ they contain much that is instructive, yet what they have to\nsay is based on a very limited range of artistic production, which\npassed no doubt for _the_ superlatively beautiful ones, but for all\nthat occupied but a very restricted portion of the entire field of\nsurvey. From a further point of view such generalizations are in part\nvery trivial reflections, which in their generality led up to no secure\ngrasp of actual detail, though that is above all the matter of most\nimportance. The epistle of Horace already cited is full of such general\ntheses, and consequently a book for everyone, but one which for this\nvery reason contains much of no importance at all. Take the lines:\nOmne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci\nLectorum delectando pariterque monendo--\n\"He carries all votes who has interfused the useful and the pleasant,\nby at the same time charming and instructing his reader.\" This is no\nbetter than copybook headings such as \"Stay where you are and earn\nan honest sixpence\"--which are good enough as generalization, but\nare defective in the concrete determinacy upon which action depends.\nAn interest of another kind deducible from this type of artistic\nstudy does not so much consist in the expressed object to promote\nthe production of genuine works of art: the intention appears to be\nrather that of influencing the judgment of others upon artistic works\nby such theories, creating, in short, a _standard of taste._ It is\nfor an object of this kind that Horne's \"Elements of Criticism,\" the\nwritings of Batteux, and Ramler's \"Introduction to the Fine Arts\" have\nfound many readers in their day. Taste, in this sense, has to do with\nco-ordination and artistic treatment, the thing in its right place,\nand all that concerns the finish of that which belongs to the external\nembodiment of a work of art. Add to this that to the principles of such\na taste views were attached which belonged to the psychology in fashion\nat the time, views which had been discovered by empirical observations\nof capacities and activities of the soul, or of passions and their\npotential aggrandizement, succession, and so forth. It is, however,\nan invariable fact that every one forms his opinion of works of art,\nor characters, actions and events according to the measure of his\ninsight and his perceptive temperament; and inasmuch as the formation\nof taste to which we have referred merely touched what was external\nand therefore jejune, and apart from this deduced its prescriptions\nentirely from a limited circle of artistic works and an intellectual\nculture and emotional discipline equally restricted, its sphere of\ninfluence was ineffective, and it had neither the power to comprehend\nthe profounder significance[24] and the true, nor to make the vision\nmore keen for their apprehension.\nSuch theories proceed through generalization as do the rest of the\nnon-philosophic sciences. The content which they submit to examination\nis accepted from ordinary ideas as something final and received\nas such. Questions are then asked about the constitution of such\na concept, the need for more distinct specification making itself\napparent, and this too is borrowed from current ideas, and forthwith\nfinally established from it in definitions. But in such a procedure we\nat once find ourselves on an insecure basis exposed to controversy.\nIt might in the first instance no doubt appear that the beautiful was\nquite a simple idea. But we soon discover it combines several aspects;\none writer will emphasize one of these, another some other one; or,\neven assuming the same points of view are considered, the question for\ndispute still remains which aspect is to be regarded as essential.\nWith regard to such questions it is generally reckoned as inseparable\nfrom scientific completeness, that the various definitions of the\nbeautiful should be enumerated and criticized. For ourselves we do\nnot propose to attempt this with such historical _exhaustiveness_ as\nwould unfold all the many refinements of such essays at definition,\nnor indeed on account of their _historical_ interest. We simply, by\nway of illustration, shall offer a few specimens of the more recent\nand more interesting ways of regarding the matter which do in fact\nhit off pretty nearly what is actually implied in the idea of the\nbeautiful. With this in view it is of first importance to recall\nGoethe's definition of the beautiful, which Meyer has incorporated\nin his \"History of the Creative Arts in Greece,\" in which work he\nalso brings forward the views of Hirt, though he does not actually\nmention his name. Hirt, one of the greatest among connoisseurs of\nthe first class in our time, in his \"Essay upon Fine Art\" (_Horen_,\n1797, seventh number), after considering the beautiful in the several\narts, summarizes his conclusions in the statement that the basis of a\njust criticism of fine art and cultivation of taste is the idea of the\n_Characteristic._ In other words he defines the beautiful ultimately\nas the \"Consummate[25] which is or can be an object of eye, ear, or\nimagination.\" He then proceeds to define this \"consummate\" as \"that\nwhich is adequate to its aim, which nature or art aimed at producing\nin the constitution of the object--after its generic kind and specific\ntype.\" For which reason it is necessary that, in order to instruct\nour critical sense of beauty, we should direct our attention, so far\nas possible, to the specific indications of the object's essential\nconstitution. It is, in fact, these _insignia_ of individuality which\nare its characteristic. Consequently under the term _character_\nas a principle of art he understands \"that definite individual\ncharacterization[26], whereby forms, movement and gesture, mien and\nexpression, local colouring, light and shadow, chiaroscuro and pose are\nseverally distinguished in due relation of course to the requirements\nof the object previously selected.\" This formula is more significant\nin its actual terms than other definitions in vogue. If we proceed\nto ask what the \"characteristic\" is we find that it implies, first,\na _content_, as, for instance, a definite emotion, situation, event,\naction, individual person or thing; secondly, the specific _manner_\nin accordance with which such a content is represented. It is to this\nmode or manner of presentation that the artistic principle of the\n\"characteristic\" is related. It requires that every aspect of detail in\nthe mode of expression shall subserve the clearer definition of that\nexpression's content, and become a vital member of such expression.\nThe abstract determination of the characteristic emphasizes therefore\nthe pertinency with which particular detail ought to bring into\nprominence the content which it is intended to reproduce. Attempting an\nelucidation of this conception apart from technical phrase we may state\nthe limitation implied in it as follows: In the drama, for instance, it\nis an action which constitutes the content. That is to say, the drama\nhas to represent how this or that action takes place. Now men do all\nkinds of different things. They speak to each other, take their meals,\nsleep, put on their clothes, say this and that, and all the rest of\nit. But in all this business of life what does not lie in immediate\nrelation with the particular action selected as the real dramatic\ncontent, must be excluded in order that relatively to it everything\nshall be significant. In the same way in a picture which only includes\none moment of that action, and it is possible to accumulate--such are\nthe countless vistas into which the objective world draws us--a mass\nof circumstances, persons, situations or other occurrences, which\nstand in no relation to the specific action as it actually occurs,\nnor subserve in any way the clearer characterization of the same. But\naccording to the definition given of the characteristic only that ought\nto enter into a work of art, which is appertinent to the manifestation\nand essential expression of precisely this one content and no other.\nNothing must declare itself as idle or superfluous.\nThis definition is no doubt of real importance, and from a certain\npoint of view admits of justification. Meyer, however, in the work\ncited, is of opinion that the view propounded has vanished, every\nvestige of it, and in his opinion only to the advantage of art. Such a\nconception he thinks would in all probability lead to caricature. This\njudgment is based on the previous idea that an attempt of this kind to\ndefine the beautiful once and for all is associated with the notion of\n_prescription._ The philosophy of art has absolutely nothing to do with\nprecepts for artists. The object is to unfold the essential nature of\nthe beautiful, and--apart from any intention to propound rules for the\nexecutant--how it is illustrated in actual work, that is works of art.\nTo such a criticism we may observe that the definition of Hirt no doubt\nincludes what is capable of being caricature, for caricature may also\nbe characteristic. The obvious point to make, however, against it is\nthis, that in caricature character in its definition is emphasized to\nthe point of exaggeration and is, if we may say so, a superfluity of\nthe characteristic. But a surfeit of this kind is no longer appropriate\nto the characteristic, but a burdensome reiteration whereby the\ncharacteristic may itself be ousted from what it ought to be. Moreover,\nwhat is of the nature of caricature is displayed as the characteristic\npresentment of what is ugly, which is of course a mode of distortion.\n_Ugliness_ is in its own right in this way more closely related to the\ncontent[27], so that it may be actually asserted that the principle of\nthe characteristic includes also ugliness and the presentment of the\nsame as a part of its essential determination. The definition of Hirt,\nof course, gives us no further account of the content of the beautiful.\nIt merely supplies us in this respect with a purely formal statement,\nwhich, however, contains real truth in it although formulated in\nabstract terms.\nThere is, however, the further question--what Meyer would substitute\nfor the artistic principle of Hirt, what he proposes himself? He deals\nin the first instance exclusively with the principle as we have it\nin ancient works of art, which, however, must contain in the widest\nconnotation of the term the essential determinant[28] of beauty[29].\nIn doing so he finds occasion to refer to Mengs and to Winckelmann's\ndefinition of the Ideal, and expresses himself to the effect that he\ndoes not wish either to reject or wholly to accept this principle\nof beauty, but on the other hand that he feels no hesitation in\nsubscribing to the opinion of an enlightened judge of art (that is\nGoethe), inasmuch as its meaning is distinct and it appears to solve\nthe problem with more accuracy. Now what Goethe says is this: \"The\nhighest principle of the ancients was the _significant_; the highest\nresult of successful artistic _handling_ is the _beautiful._\"\nIf we look more closely at what this dictum implies we have again once\nmore two aspects, that is to say a content or subject matter, and the\nmode of its presentation. In our consideration of a work of art we\nbegin with that which is directly presented to us, and after seeing\nit we proceed to inquire what its significance or content is. That\nexternal husk possesses no value to us simply as such. We assume that\nthere is an inward, an ideality or a significance behind it, in virtue\nof which the external appearance is made alive with mind or spirit. It\nis to this, its soul, that the external appearance points and attests.\nFor an appearance which is significant of something does not present\nitself to us, and merely that which it is _qu\u00e2_ externality, but\nsomething other than this; as also does the symbol for example and with\nyet more clarity the fable, the significance of which is simply the\nmoral and teaching of the same. In fact there is no word which does not\npoint to a meaning, possessing no value by itself. In the same way the\nhuman eye, the face, flesh, skin, the entire presence are a revelation\nof spirit, intelligence and soul; and in such a case the significance\nis without exception something beyond that which is offered in\nthe bare appearance. In this way too the work of art must possess\nsignificance; it must not appear to have told its tale simply in the\nfact of particular lines, curves, surfaces, indentations, reliefs of\nstone-work, in particular colours, tones, sounds of words, whatever\nmedium in fact art may employ. Its function is to unveil an inward or\nideal vitality, emotion, soul, a content and mind, which is precisely\nwhat we mean by the significance of a work of art.\nThis demand, therefore, for significance in a work of art is to all\nintents, and in its embrace much the same thing as Hirt's principle of\nthe characteristic.\nAccording to this conception we find as characteristic constituents\nof the beautiful an inward somewhat, a content, and an external rind\nwhich possesses that content as its significance. The inner or ideal\nconstituent appears in the external and thus enables itself to be\nrecognized, that which is external pointing away from itself to the\ninward.\nWe cannot, however, pursue the matter here into further detail.\n(_c_) But the earlier fashion of this \"theory-spinning,\" no less than\nthe laying down of rules for the executant already adverted to, has\nalready been thrust on one side despotically in Germany--mainly owing\nto the appearance of genuine living poetry--and the right of genius,\nits work and effects, have had their full independence insisted upon\nas against the pretensions of such rules of thumb and the broad\nwater-ducts of theory. From this foundation of an art which is itself\nof truly spiritual rank, as also of a sympathy and absorption of the\nsame, have arisen the receptivity and freedom which make it possible\nfor us to enjoy and appreciate great works of art which have long since\nbeen within our reach, whether it be those of the modern world, of the\nMiddle Ages, or of wholly foreign peoples of the Past, the works of\nIndia for example; works, which, in virtue of their antiquity or the\nremoteness of their nationality, possess unquestionably for ourselves\na side alien to ourselves; but which, if we consider the way in which\ntheir content passes over and beyond such national limits, and the\nmatter in it of common appeal to all mankind, can only be hallmarked\nby the prejudice of theory among the products of a barbarous or corrupt\ntaste. This recognition of works of art anywhere and everywhere, works\nwhich depart from the specific circle and forms of those upon which\nin the main the abstractions of theory were based, has, as a primary\nconsequence, led to the recognition of a peculiar type of art\u2014-_the\nromantic art._ It became necessary to apprehend the notion and the\nnature of the beautiful in a profounder way than these theories\nattempted. With this fact another, too, cooperated, viz., that the\nnotions in its form of apperception, the mind as pure thought on its\npart reached in philosophy a point of profounder self-cognition, and\nwas thereby compelled forthwith to grasp the essence of art too on\nprofounder lines. In this way, even in virtue of the point in the\nprocess reached of this general evolution of human thought, the type\nof theorizing upon art we have described, both relatively to its\nprinciples no less than their elaboration, has become obsolete. It is\nonly the _scholarship_ of the history of art which retains an abiding\nvalue, and must continue to retain it in proportion as the boundaries\nof its survey have enlarged in every direction by means of the advance\nmade in man's powers of receptivity already noticed. Its business\nand function consists in the aesthetic appreciation of particular\nworks of art and the knowledge of the historical, in other words the\nexternal conditions from which the work of art originates. It is an\nattitude of the mind, which, if assisted with sound sense and critical\ninsight, supported too with historical knowledge, is an indispensable\ncondition to the complete penetration into the individuality of a\ngiven work of art. The many writings of Goethe upon art and works of\nart are an excellent illustration. Theorizing, in the specific sense\nnoticed, is not the aim of this type of examination, although no doubt\nit not unfrequently also busies itself with abstract principles and\ncategories, and may drop into such a style unconsciously. If, however,\nwithout letting such deviations on our route detain us, we keep before\nour vision those concrete illustrations of artistic works, such at\nleast, whatever else they may do, supply a philosophy of art with the\nvisible warrant and confirmation of actual work, into the historical\ndetail of which, in each particular case, philosophy is not permitted\nto enter.\nThis then may be accepted as the first method of art study. It starts\nfrom the particular work which we have before us.\n2. The method or point of view to be contrasted with this, in other\nwords an entirely theoretical reflection, which is concerned to\ncognize the beautiful as such from its own intrinsic wealth, and\nto penetrate to the idea of it, is essentially distinct from the\nfirst method. As is well known, Plato was the first to demand of\nphilosophical inquiry in a profounder sense, that objects should not\nbe cognized in their _particularity_, but in their _universality_,\nin their generic type, their essential being and its explicit\nmanifestation. He maintained that this true essence[30] did not consist\nin _particular_ actions which were good, in particular true opinions,\nhandsome men or beautiful works of art, but in _goodness_, _beauty_,\nand _truth_ in their universality. Now if in fact the beautiful ought\nto be cognized according to its essence and notion, this can only\nbe effected by means of the thinking notion[31], by means of which\nthe logical and metaphysical nature of the _Idea as such_, as also\nof that of the particular _Idea of the beautiful_ enters into the\nthinking consciousness. But the consideration of the beautiful in\nits self-independence and its idea may readily once more become an\nabstract metaphysic; and even though Plato is accepted as founder and\npioneer, the Platonic abstraction no longer supplies all we require,\nnot even for the logical Idea of the beautiful. We are bound to grasp\nthis idea more profoundly and more in the concrete. The emptiness of\ncontent which clings to the Platonic Idea, no longer satisfies the\nricher philosophical requirements of the mind to-day. It is no doubt\nthe case that we also in the philosophy of art must make the Idea of\nthe beautiful our starting point; but it is by no means inevitable that\nwe should adhere to the Platonic ideas in their abstraction, ideas from\nwhich the philosophy of the beautiful merely dates its origins.\n3. The philosophical idea of the beautiful to indicate at any rate\nits true nature provisionally, must contain both extremes which\nwe have described mediated in itself. It must combine, that is to\nsay, metaphysical universality with the determinate content of real\nparticularity. It is only by this means that it is grasped in its\nessential no less than explicit truth. For on the one hand it is then,\nas contrasted with the sterility of one-sided reflection, fruit-bearing\nout of its own wealth. It is its function, in consonance with its own\nnotion, to develop into a totality of definite qualities, and this\nessential conception itself, no less than its detailed explication,\ncomprises the necessary coherence of its particular features as also\nof the progress and transition of one phase thereof into another.\nOn the other hand, these particulars into which the passage is made\nessentially carry the universality and essentiality of the fundamental\nnotion, as the particulars of which they appear. The modes of inquiry\nhitherto discussed lack both these aspects, and for this reason it\nis only the notion, as above formulated, in its completeness, which\nconducts us to definitive principles which are substantive, necessary,\nand self-contained in their completeness.\nIII\nAfter these preliminaries we come to closer quarters with our actual\nsubject-matter, namely, the philosophy of Fine Art[32]; and for\nthe reason that we are undertaking to treat it scientifically, our\ncommencement must be with the notional concept of the same. It is\nonly after we have definitely ascertained this that we can map out\nthe division of its parts, and with it the plan of the science as a\nwhole. A division of this kind, if it is not to be, as is the case with\nnon-philosophical inquiry, undertaken in a purely external way, must\ndiscover its principle in the notion of the subject treated itself.\nFace to face with such a demand we are at once met by the question:\n\"Whence do we arrive at such a conception?\" If we begin with the\nnotional concept of Fine Art itself the same at once becomes a\n_pre-supposition_ and mere assumption. Mere assumptions, however,\nare excluded from the philosophical method; whatever here is allowed\nas valid must have its truth demonstrated, in other words must be\nestablished in its necessity.\nWe will endeavour to arrive at an understanding in a few words in the\npresence of this difficulty which invariably recurs in the introduction\nto every course of philosophical study if treated independently. The\nsubject-matter of every science presents in the first instance two\naspects for consideration: first, the fact that a given object _is_;\nsecondly, the question _what_ it is.\nUpon the question of fact in ordinary scientific inquiry little\ndifficulty is experienced. Indeed it might on a cursory view even\nappear ridiculous if the demand were made that we had to prove in\ngeometry, for instance, that there were such objects as space, and\ngeometrical figures, or in astronomy and physics that there was a sun,\nstars, and magnetic phenomena. In these sciences, which are concerned\nwith what is actually presented to sense perception, objects are\naccepted from objective experience, and so far from it being regarded\nnecessary to demonstrate (_beweisen_) them, it is deemed sufficient\nto point to (_weisen_) the bare facts. Yet even within the limits of\nnon-philosophical instruction doubts may arise as to the existence of\ncertain objects. In psychology, for example, the science of mind, the\ndoubt is possible whether there _is_ a soul, an intelligence, _i.e._,\nsomething distinct from material conditions, something immaterial[33],\nindependent and self-substantive, or in the theology whether a God\nactually _exists._ Moreover, assuming the objects of the science to be\nthus immaterial, in other words, merely present in the mind, and not a\npart of the objective world we perceive, we have to face the possible\nconviction that there is nothing in the mind, but that which it has\nevoked in virtue of its own activity. This brings up incidentally the\nquestion whether men have produced this idea or intuition which is\ninward to their minds or not, and even if we do actually accept the\nfirst alternative, whether they have not made such an idea once more\nto vanish, or depreciated, the same at any rate to an idea of wholly\n_subjective_ validity, whose content possesses no independent or\nself-contained existence[34]. In this way, for example, the beautiful\nhas been frequently regarded as possessing no necessarily essential and\nindependent stability in the world of our ideas; rather it is accepted\nas a pleasure purely personal to ourselves, due to the caprice of our\nsenses[35]. Even our external intuitions, observations and perceptions\nfrequently deceive and lead us astray; but still more is this the case\nwith those ideas that do not arise from sense-perception, even though\nthey possess in themselves the greatest vitality, and are able to\ntransport us into passion, we are powerless to resist.\nThis doubt, then, whether an object of the inward world of our ideas\nand intuitions actually exists as an independent fact or not, as also\nthat further incidental problem, whether the particular consciousness\nin question has produced it in itself, and whether the particular\nmode or process, in which it objectified it to itself, is also\nadequate to the object thus envisaged in its essential and independent\nnature--these are precisely the kind of questions which have awakened\nin men the higher demand of philosophy, which is that, even if there\nis every appearance that an object is, or that we have before us\nsuch an object, yet none the less that object must be expounded or\ndemonstrated on the basis of its necessity. A demonstration of this\nkind, if developed on truly philosophical lines, ought at the same time\nto supply a sufficient answer to the question: _What_ a given object\nis. To work this out fully would, however, carry us further than is\nnow possible. We propose to limit ourselves to the following general\nremarks.\nIf we are to propound the necessity of our subject-matter, in other\nwords the beauty of art, we are bound to prove that art, or the\nbeautiful, is a result of antecedents such as, when regarded relatively\nto their true notional concept, conduct us with scientific necessity\nto the similar notion of fine art itself. Inasmuch as, however, we\npropose to make art the point of departure, and its idea and the\nobjective presence of the same, and do _not_ propose to deal with the\nantecedent conditions which are essential to the necessary exposition\nof its notional concept, for this reason art, in our treatment of it as\na particular object of scientific inquiry, involves a pre-assumption,\nwhich lies outside the boundary of our investigation; which, implying\nas it does a different content, belongs, as scientifically treated,\nto another course of philosophical inquiry. We have therefore now no\nother alternative than frankly to accept the notional idea of art,\nso to speak, provisionally[36], which is inevitable with every one\nof the _particular_ philosophical sciences, if regarded in their\nabstract isolation. For it is the entire body of philosophy, and that\nalone, which either is or can be the comprehension of the universe\nas one essentially _single_ organic totality; and which, as such a\ntotality, self-evolved from its own notional Idea, and returning into\nitself so as to form a whole in virtue of the necessary principle\nin which it is placed relatively to itself, encloses itself, and\nall that is itself, into one single world of truth. In the coronal\nof this scientific necessity is every particular member thereof a\nself-complete circle which returns into itself, while, at the same\ntime, and as imperatively, it possesses a necessary bond of connection\nwith other parts. This bond of coherence is a backward from which it\nis self-derived, no less than a forward to which it is self-impelled\nonward, in so far as it fruitfully begets fresh material from its\nown resources, and renders the same open and pervious to scientific\ncognition. It is not therefore our purpose to demonstrate the Idea of\nthe beautiful, which is our point of departure, or, in other words,\nto deduce it in all its necessity from the assumptions which are its\nantecedents in philosophy, and from the womb of which it is born. This\nis the object appropriate to an encyclopaedic development of philosophy\nas a whole and in its specific branches. For ourselves the notional\nconcept of the beautiful and art is a pre-supposition supplied us by\nthe system of philosophy. Inasmuch, however, as we are not prepared\nto discuss this system, and the association of art with it in the\npresent context[37], we have not as yet the idea of the beautiful\nbefore us in a _scientific form_: what we have and are able to deal\nwith are simply the phases and aspects of the same as we find them in\nthe various conceptions of beauty and art of our everyday conscious\nlife, or as they have been conceived by previous writers. Having made\nour start at this point we shall then at a later stage pass on to the\nmore fundamental investigation of those views, in order thereby to\nsecure the advantage of, in the first instance, working out a general\nidea of our subject-matter no less than obtaining a provisional\nacquaintance, as a result of our necessarily brief criticism, with its\nhigher principles, which will occupy our thoughts in the inquiry which\nfollows[38]. By this means our final introduction[39] will supply a\nsort of overture to the exposition of the subject itself, and will aim\nat being a general concatenation and direction of our reflection on the\nreal subject-matter before us. What in the first instance is known to\nus under current conceptions of a work of art may be subsumed under the\nthree following determinations:\n(1) A work of art is no product of Nature. It is brought into being\nthrough the agency of man.\n(2) It is created essentially _for_ man; and, what, is more, it is to a\ngreater-or less degree delivered from a sensuous medium, and addressed\nto his _senses_[40].\n(3) It contains an _end_ bound up with it.\n1. With regard to the first point, that a work of art is a product of\nhuman activity, an inference has been drawn from this (_a_) that such\nan activity, being the conscious production of an external object can\nalso be _known_ and _divulged_, and learned and reproduced by others.\nFor that which one is able to effect, another--such is the notion--is\nable to effect or to imitate[41], when he has once simply mastered the\nway of doing it. In short we have merely to assume an acquaintance with\nthe rules of art-production universally shared, and anybody may then,\nif he cares to do so, give effect to executive ability of the same\ntype, and produce works of art. It is out of reasoning of this kind\nthat the above-mentioned theories, with their provision of rules, and\ntheir prescriptions formulated for practical acceptance, have arisen.\nUnfortunately that which is capable of being brought into effect in\naccordance with suggestions of this description can only be something\nformally regular and mechanical. For only that which is mechanical is\nof so exterior a type that only an entirely empty effort of will and\ndexterity is required to accept it among our working conceptions, and\nforthwith to carry it out; an effort, in fact, which is not under the\nnecessity to contribute out of its own resources anything concrete such\nas is quite outside the prescriptive power of such general rules.\nThis is apparent with most vividness when precepts of this kind are not\nlimited to what is purely external and mechanical, but extend their\npretensions to the activity of the artist in the sense that implies\nwealth of significance and intelligence. In this field our rules pass\noff to purely indefinite generalities, such as \"the theme ought to be\ninteresting, and each individual person must speak as is appropriate\nto his status, age, sex and situation.\" But if rules are really to\nsuffice for such a purpose their directions ought to be formulated\nwith such directness of detail that, without any further co-operation\nof mind, they could be executed precisely in the manner they are\nprescribed. Such rules being, in respect to this content, abstract,\nclearly and entirely fall short of their pretension of being able to\ncomplete[42] the artistic consciousness. Artistic production is not a\nformal activity in accordance with a series of definitions; it is, as\nan activity of soul, constrained to work out of its own wealth, and\nto bring before the mind's eye a wholly other and far richer content,\nand a more embracing and unique[43] creation than ever can be thus\nprescribed. In particular cases such rules may prove, of assistance,\nin so far, that is, as they contain something really definite and\nconsequently useful for practice. But even here their guidance will\nonly apply to conditions wholly external.\n(_b_) This above indicated tendency has consequently been wholly given\nup; but writers in doing so have only fallen as unreservedly into\nthe opposite extreme. A work of art came to be looked upon, and so\nfar rightly, as no longer the product of an activity _shared by all\nmen_, but rather as a creation of a mind gifted in an extraordinary\ndegree. A mind of this type has in this view _merely_ to give free\nvent to its peculiar endowment, regarded as a specific natural power.\nIt has to free itself absolutely from a pursuit of rules of universal\napplication, as also from any admixture of conscious reflection with\nits creative and, as thus viewed, wholly instinctive powers, or rather\nit should be on its guard therefrom, the assumption being that such\nan exercise of conscious thought can only act on its creations as an\ninfection and a taint. Agreeably to such a view the work of art has\nbeen heralded as the product of _talent_ and _genius_; and it is mainly\nthe aspect of natural gift inseparable from the ordinary conception of\ntalent and genius, which has been emphasized. There is to some extent\nreal truth in this. Talent is specific, genius universal capacity. With\nneither[44] of these can a man endow himself _simply_ by the exercise\nof his self-conscious activity. We shall consider this at greater\nlength in a subsequent chapter[45].\nIn the present context we would merely draw attention to the false\nassumption in this view that in artistic production every kind of\nself-reflection upon the artist's own activity was regarded as not\nmerely superfluous, but actually injurious. In such a view the\nprocess of creation by talent or genius simply is taken to be a\ngeneral _state_; or we may define it more precisely as a condition of\ninspiration. To such a condition, it is said, genius is in some measure\nexalted by the subject-matter itself; it is also to some extent\nvoluntarily able to place itself under such a condition, a process of\nself-inhibition in which the genial service of the champagne bottle\nis not forgotten[46]. An idea of this kind was in vogue during the\nso-called \"Epoch of Genius,\" which originated with the early poetical\nwork of Goethe, receiving subsequent illustration in those of Schiller.\nThese poets by their rejection of all rules hitherto fabricated made\nas it were an entirely new start; with deliberate intention they ran\ncounter to such rules, and while doing so distanced all competitors by\nmany lengths. I do not, however, propose to discuss with more detail\nthe confusions which have prevailed over the conception of inspiration\nand genius, and the notion, which even at the present day finds\nadvocates, that inspiration simply by itself can effect anything and\neverything. The real and indeed sole point to maintain as essential is\nthe thesis that although artistic talent and genius essentially implies\nan element of natural power, yet it is equally indispensable that it\nshould be thoughtfully cultivated, that reflection should be brought\nto bear on the particular way it is exercised, and that it should be\nalso kept alive with use and practice in actual work. The fact is\nthat an important aspect of the creating process is merely facility\nin the use of a medium[47]; that is to say, a work of art possesses a\npurely technical side, which extends to the borders of mere handicraft.\nThis is most obviously the case in architecture and sculpture, less\nso in painting and music, least of all in poetry. A facility here\nis not assisted at all by inspiration; what solely indispensable is\nreflection, industry, and practice. Such technical skill an artist\nsimply _must_ possess in order that he may be master over the external\nmaterial, and not be thwarted by its obstinacy.\nAdd to this that the more exalted the rank of an artist the more\nprofoundly ought he to portray depths of soul and mind; and these are\nnot to be known by flashlight, but are exclusively to be sounded, if\nat all, by the direction of the man's own intelligence on the world\nof souls and the objective world. In this respect, therefore, once\nmore _study_ is the means whereby the artist brings to consciousness\nsuch a content, and appropriates the material and structure of his\nconceptions. At the same time no doubt one art will require such a\nconscious reception and cognitive mastery of the content in question\nmore than another. Music, for example, which has exclusively to deal\nwith the entirely undefined motion of the soul within, with the musical\ntones of that which is, relatively, feeling denuded of positive\nthought, has little or no need to bring home to consciousness the\nsubstance of intellectual conception[48]. For this very reason musical\ntalent declares itself as a rule in very early youth, when the head\nis still empty and the emotions have barely had a flutter; it has, in\nfact, attained real distinction at a time in the artist's life when\nboth intelligence and life are practically without experience. And\nfor the matter of that we often enough see very great accomplishment\nin musical composition and execution hung together with considerable\nindigence of mind and character. It is quite another matter in the\ncase of poetry. What is of main importance here is a presentation\nof our humanity rich in subject-matter and reflective power, of its\nprofounder interests, and of the forces which move it. Here at least\nmind and heart must themselves be richly and profoundly disciplined\nby life, experience, and thought before genius itself can bring\ninto being the fruit that is ripe, the content that has substance,\nand is essentially consummate. The early productions of Goethe and\nSchiller are characterized by an immaturity, we may even call it a\nrawness and barbarity, which really are appalling. This phenomenon,\nthat in the majority of those experiments we find a preponderating\nmass of features which are absolutely prosaic, or at least uninspired\nand commonplace, is a main objection to the ordinary notion that\ninspiration is inseparable from youth and its sirocco season. These two\nmen of genius were the first beyond question to give our nation true\nworks of poetry, are, in fact, our national poets; but for all that it\nwas only their mature manhood, which made it a present of creations\nprofound, sterling of their kind, creations of genuine inspiration, and\nno less technically complete in their artistic form[49]. We naturally\nrecall the case of the veteran Homer, who only composed and uttered his\nimmortal songs in his old age.\n(_c_) A third view, held relatively to the idea of a work of art as a\nproduct of human activity, concerns the position of such towards the\nphenomena of Nature. The natural tendency of ordinary thinking in this\nrespect is to assume that the product of human art is of _subordinate_\nrank to the works of Nature. The work of art possesses no feeling of\nits own; it is not through and through a living thing, but, regarded as\nan external object, is a dead thing. It is usual to regard that which\nis alive of higher worth than what is dead. We may admit, of course,\nthat the work of art is not in itself capable of movement and alive.\nThe living, natural thing is, whether looked at within or without, an\norganization with the life-purpose of such worked out into the minutest\ndetail. The work of art merely attains to the show of animation on\nits surface. Below this it is ordinary stone, wood, or canvas[50],\nor in the case of poetry idea, the medium of such being speech and\nletters. But this element of external existence is not that which makes\na work a creation of fine art. A work of art is only truly such in\nso far as originating in the human spirit, it continues to belong to\nthe soil from which it sprang, has received, in short, the baptism of\nthe mind and soul of man, and only presents that which is fashioned\nin consonance with such a sacrament. An interest vital to man, the\nspiritual values which the single event, one individual character, one\naction possesses in its devolution and final issue, is seized in the\nwork of art and emphasized with greater purity[51] and clarity than\nis possible on the ground of ordinary reality where human art is not.\nAnd for this reason the work of art is of higher rank than any product\nof Nature whatever, which has not submitted to this passage through\nthe mind. In virtue of the emotion and insight, for example, in the\natmosphere of which a landscape is portrayed by the art of painting,\nthis creation of the human spirit assumes a higher rank than the purely\nnatural landscape. Everything which partakes of spirit is better than\nanything begotten of mere Nature. However this may be, the fact remains\nthat no purely natural existence is able, as art is, to represent\ndivine ideals.\nAnd further, all that the mind borrows from its own ideal content\nit is able, even in the direction of external existence, to endow\nwith _permanence._ The individual living thing on the contrary is\ntransitory; it vanishes and is unstable in its external aspect. The\nwork of art persists. At the same time it is not mere continuation, but\nrather the form and pressure thereon of the mintage of soul-life which\nconstitutes its true pre-eminence as contrasted with Nature's reality.\nBut this higher position we have thus assigned to the work of art is\nyet further contested by another prevalent conception of ordinary\nideas. It is contended that Nature and all that proceeds from her are\na work of God, created by His goodness and wisdom. The work of art\nis on the contrary _merely_ a human product fashioned by human hands\naccording to human design. The fallacy implied in this contrast between\nthe products of Nature viewed as a divine creation and human activity\nas of wholly finite energy consists in the apparent assumption that\nGod is not operative in and through man, but limits the sphere of His\nactivity to Nature alone. We must place this false conception entirely\non one side if we are desirous of penetrating to the true idea of art;\nor rather, as opposed to such a conception we ought to accept the\nextreme opposite thereto, namely, that God is more honoured by that\nwhich mind makes and creates than by everything brought into being and\nfashioned in the natural process. For not only is there a divinity in\nman, but it is actually effective in him in a form which is adequate to\nthe essential nature of God in a far higher degree than in the work of\nNature. God is a Spirit, and it is only in man that the medium, through\nwhich the Divine passes, possesses the form of spirit fully conscious\nof the activity in which it manifests its ideal presence. In Nature\nthe medium correspondent to this is the unconscious sensuous[52] and\nexternal _materia_, which is by many degrees inferior to consciousness\nin its worth. In the products of art God works precisely as He works\nthrough the phenomena of Nature. The divine substance, however, as it\nis asserted in the work of art has secured, being begotten of spirit\nlife itself, a highway commensurable to its existence; determinate\nexistence in the unconscious sensuousness of Nature is not a mode of\nappearance adequate to the Divine Being.\n(_d_) Assuming, then, that the work of art is a creation of man in\nthe sense that it is the offspring of mind or spirit we have still\na further question in conclusion, which will help us to draw a more\nprofound inference still from our previous discussion. That question\nis, \"What is the human _need_ which stimulates art-production?\" On the\none hand the artistic activity may be regarded as the mere play of\naccident, or human conceits, which might just as well be left alone\nas attempted. For, it may be urged, there are other and better means\nfor carrying into effect the aims of art, and man bears within himself\nhigher and more weighty interests, than art is capable of satisfying.\nIn contrast to such a view art appears to originate in a higher\nimpulse, and to satisfy more elevated needs, nay, at certain times the\nhighest and most absolute of all, being, as it has been, united to the\nmost embracing views of entire epochs and nations upon the constitution\nof the world and the nature of their religion.\nThis inquiry, however, concerning a necessity for art which shall not\nbe merely contingent, but absolute, we are not as yet able to answer\nwith completeness; it demands, in fact, a concreter mode of exposition\nthan is compatible with the form of this introduction. We must\naccordingly deem it sufficient for the present merely to establish the\nfollowing points.\nThe universal and absolute want from which art on its side of essential\nform[53] arises originates in the fact that man is a _thinking_\nconsciousness, in other words that he renders explicit _to himself_ and\nfrom his own substance[54], what he is and all in fact that exists.\nThe objects of Nature exist exclusively in immediacy and _once for\nall._[55] Man, on the contrary, as mind _reduplicates_ himself. He is,\nto start with, an object of Nature as other objects; but in addition to\nthis, and no less truly, he exists _for himself_; he observes himself,\nmakes himself present to his imagination and thought, and only in\nvirtue of this active power of self-realization is he actually mind\nor spirit. This consciousness of himself man acquires in a twofold\nway; in the _first_ instance _theoretically._ This is so in so far as\nhe is under a constraint to bring himself in his own inner life to\nconsciousness--all which moves in the human heart, all that surges up\nand strives therein--and generally, so far as he is impelled to make\nhimself an object of perception and conception, to fix for himself\ndefinitively that which thought discovers as essential being, and in\nall that he summons out of himself, no less than in that which is\nreceived from without, to recognize only himself. And _secondly_, this\nrealization is effected through a _practical_ activity. In other words\nman possesses an impulse to assert himself in that which is presented\nhim in immediacy, in that which is at hand as an external something\nto himself, and by doing so at the same time once more to recognize\nhimself therein. This purpose he achieved by the alteration he effects\nin such external objects, upon which he imprints the seal of his inner\nlife, rediscovering in them thereby the features of his own determinate\nnature. And man does all this, in order that he may as a free agent\ndivest the external world of its stubborn alienation from himself--and\nin order that he may enjoy in the configuration of objective fact an\nexternal reality simply of himself. The very first impulse of the child\nimplies in essentials this practical process of deliberate change in\nexternal fact. A boy throws stones into the stream, and then looks\nwith wonder at the circles which follow in the water, regarding them\nas a result in which he sees something of his own doing. This human\nneed runs through the most varied phenomena up to that particular\nform of self-reproduction in the external fact which is presented us\nin human art. And it is not merely in relation to external objects\nthat man acts thus. He treats himself, that is, his natural form, in\na similar manner: he will not permit it to remain as he finds it; he\nalters it deliberately. This is the rational ground of all ornament\nand decoration, though it may be as barbarous, tasteless, entirely\ndisfiguring, nay, as injurious as the crushing of the feet of Chinese\nladies, or the slitting of ears and lips. For it is among the really\ncultured alone that a change of figure, behaviour, and every mode and\nmanner of self-expression will issue in harmony with the dictates of\nmental elevation[56].\nThis universal demand for artistic expression[57] is based on the\nrational impulse in man's nature to exalt both the world of his soul\nexperience and that of Nature for himself into the conscious embrace\nof mind as an object in which he rediscovers himself. He satisfies\nthe demand of this spiritual freedom by making explicit to, his\n_inner_ life all that exists, no less than from the further point of\nview giving a realized _external_ embodiment to the self made thus\nexplicit. And by this reduplication of what is his own he places\nbefore the vision and within the cognition of himself and others what\nis within him. This is the free rationality of man, in which art as\nalso all action and knowledge originates. We shall investigate at\na later stage the specific need for art as compared with that for\nother political and ethical action, or that for religious ideas and\nscientific knowledge.\n2. We have hitherto considered the work of art under the aspect that\nit is fashioned by man; we will now pass over to the second part of\nour definition, that it is produced for his _sense-apprehension_,\nand consequently is to a more or less degree under obligations to a\nsensuous medium.\n(_a_) This reflection has been responsible for the inference that the\nfunction of fine art is to arouse feeling, more precisely the feeling\nwhich suits us--that is, pleasant feeling. From such a point of view\nwriters have converted the investigation of fine art into a treatise on\nthe emotions and asked what kind of feelings art ought to excite--take\nfear, for example, and compassion--with the further question how such\ncan be regarded as pleasant, how, in short, the contemplation of a\nmisfortune can bring satisfaction. This tendency of reflection dates\nfor the most part from the times of Moses Mendelssohn, and many such\ntrains of reasoning may be found in his writings. A discussion of\nthis kind, however, did not carry the problem far. Feeling is the\nundefined obscure region of spiritual life. What is felt, remains\ncloaked in the form of the separate personal experience under its\nmost abstract persistence[58]; and for this reason the distinctions\nof feeling are wholly abstract; they are not distinctions which apply\nto the subject-matter itself. To take examples--fear, anxiety, care,\ndread, are of course one type of emotion under various modifications;\nbut in part they are purely quantitative degrees of intensity, and in\npart forms which reflect no light, on their content itself, but are\nindifferent to it. In the case of fear, for instance, an existence is\nassumed, for which the individual in question possesses an interest,\nbut sees at the same time the negative approach which threatens to\ndestroy this existence, and thereupon discovers in immediate fusion\nwithin himself the above interest and the approach of that negative as\na contradictory affection of his personal life. A fear of this sort,\nhowever, does not on its own account condition any particular content;\nit may associate with itself subject-matter of the most opposed and\nvaried character. The feeling merely as such is in short a wholly empty\nform of a subjective state. Such a form may no doubt in certain cases\nitself be essentially complex, as we find it is with hope, pain, joy,\nand pleasure; it may also in this very complexity appropriate various\nmodes of content, as, for example, we have a feeling of justice, an\nethical feeling, a sublime religious feeling, and so forth; but despite\nthe fact that a content of this kind is present in different modes of\nfeeling, no light whatever is thereby thrown on such content which will\ndisclose its essential and definite character. The feeling throughout\nremains a purely subjective state which belongs to me, one in which\nthe concrete fact vanishes, as though contracted to a vanishing point\nin the most abstract of all spheres[59]. For this reason an inquiry\nover the nature of the emotions which art ought or ought not to arouse,\ncomes simply to a standstill in the undefined; it is an investigation\nwhich deliberately abstracts from genuine content and its concrete\nsubstance and notion. Reflection upon feeling is satisfied with the\nobservation of the personal emotional state and its singularity,\ninstead of penetrating and sounding the matter for study, in other\nwords the work of art, and in doing so bidding good-bye to the wholly\nsubjective state and its conditions. In feeling, however, it is just\nthis subjective state void of content which is not merely accepted,\nbut becomes the main thing; and that is precisely why people are so\nproud of having emotions. And for no other reason that is why such an\ninvestigation is tedious owing to its indefinite nature and emptiness,\nand even repellent in its attention to trivial personal idiosyncrasies.\n(_b_) Inasmuch, however, as the work of art is not merely concerned\nwith exciting some kind of emotion or other--for this is an object it\nwould share without any valid distinction with eloquence, historical\ncomposition, religious edification and much else--but is only a work\nof art in so far as it is beautiful, it occurred to reflective minds\nto discover a _specific feeling for beauty_, and a distinct _sense\nfaculty_ correspondent with it. In such an inquiry it soon became\nclear that a sense of this kind was no definite and mere[60] instinct\nrigidly fixed by Nature, which was able by itself and independently\nto distinguish the beautiful. As a consequence the demand was made\nfor _culture_ as a condition precedent to such a sense, and the sense\nof beauty as thus cultivated was called _taste_, which, albeit an\ninstructed apprehension and discovery of the beautiful, was none the\nless assumed to persist in the character of immediate feeling. We\nhave already discussed the way in which abstract theory attempted\nto form such a sense of taste, and how external and one-sided that\nsense remained. While the critical sense generally of the time when\nsuch ideas were in currency was lacking in the _universality_ of its\nprinciples, as a _specific_ critique of particular works of art it\nwas less concerned to substantiate a judgment _more decisive_ than\nhitherto--indeed the material to effectuate this was not as yet\nforthcoming--than to promote in a general way the _cultivation_ of such\na taste[61]. Consequently this educative process also came to a halt\nin the region of the more indefinite, and merely busied itself by its\nreflections in the fitting out of feeling as a sense of beauty in such\na way that beauty could immediately be discovered whenever and wherever\nit might chance to appear. The real depth of the subject-matter\nremained notwithstanding a closed book to such a taste. Profundity of\nthis kind demands not merely sensitive reception and abstract thought,\nbut the reason in its concrete grasp and the most sterling qualities\nof soul-life. Taste on the contrary is merely directed to the outside\nsurfaces, which are the playground of the feelings, and upon which\none-sided principles may very well pass, as currency. But for this very\nreason our so-called good taste is scared by every kind of profounder\nartistic effect, and is dumb where the ideal significance[62] is in\nquestion, and all mere externalities and accessories vanish. For when\ngreat passions and the movements of a profound soul assert themselves,\nwe do not bother ourselves any more with the finer distinctions of\ntaste and its retail traffic in trifles. It is[63] conscious that\ngenius leaves such ground far behind it in its stride; and shrinking\nbefore that power feels on its part far from comfortable, not knowing\nvery well which way to turn.\n(_c_) Thus it is the further change has come about that critics of\nart-production no longer have an eye simply to the education of taste,\nor are intent upon the illustration of such a sense. The _connoisseur_,\nor art-scholar, has taken the place of the man, or judge of artistic\ntaste. The positive side of art-scholarship, in so far as it implies\na sound and exhaustive acquaintance with the entire embrace of what\nis distinctive and peculiar in a given work of art, we have already\nmaintained to be a necessary condition of artistic research. A work of\nart, owing to its nature, which, if it is material from one point of\nview, is also related to a particular person, originates from specific\nconditions of the most varied kind, among which as exceptionally\nimportant we may mention the date and place of its origins, the\ncharacteristic personality of the artist, and, above all, the degree\nof executive accomplishment secured by the art. All these points\nof view have to be taken into consideration if we wish to obtain a\nview and knowledge of such a work which is clear in its outlines, and\nfounded on a true basis, nay, even wish to enjoy it rightly. It is\nwith these that our art-scholarship is mainly occupied; and all that\nit can do for us in this way should be gratefully accepted. Though it\nis quite true such art-scholarship must be reckoned as of essential\nimportance, it ought not to be regarded as the sole, or indeed the\nhighest, constituent in the relation of the contemplative spirit to\na work of art and art generally. Such art-scholarship (this is the\ndefective tendency) may restrict itself wholly to a knowledge of purely\nexternal characteristics, either on the side of technique or historical\ncondition, or in other directions; it may continue to possess the\nbarest inkling of the true nature of a given work, or simply no\nknowledge at all. It may even form a depreciatory verdict on the\nvalue of profounder inquiries as compared with purely matter of fact,\ntechnical, and historical knowledge. Yet even so an art-scholarship,\nassuming it to be really genuine and thorough, at least proceeds upon\ngrounds and knowledge which are definite, and an intelligent judgment;\nand it is association with such that our more accurate review of the\ndistinct, if also to some extent exterior, aspects of a work of art,\nand our estimate of their relative significance, is secured.\n(_d_) Following the above observations upon the modes of inquiry which\nwere suggested by that aspect of a work of art in which, as itself an\nobject with a material medium, it possessed an essential relation to\nman as himself receptive through sense, we will now examine this point\nof view in its more essential connection with art itself. We propose to\ndo this partly (\u03b1) in respect to the art-product viewed as an object,\npartly (\u03b2) as regards the personal characteristics of the artist, his\ngenius, talent, and so forth. We do not, however, propose to enter\ninto matter which can in this connection exclusively proceed from the\nknowledge of art according to its universal concept[64]. The truth\nis we are not as yet in the full sense on scientific ground; we have\nmerely reached the province of external reflection.\n(\u03b1) There is no question, then, that a work of art is presented to\nsensuous apprehension. It is submitted to the emotional sense, whether\nouter or inner, to sensuous perception and the imaged sense, precisely\nas the objective world is so presented around us, or as is our own\ninward sensitive nature. Even a speech, for example, may be addressed\nto the sensuous imagination and feeling. Notwithstanding this fact,\nhowever, the work of art is not exclusively directed to the _sensuous_\napprehension, viewed, that is, as an object materially conditioned. Its\nposition is of the nature, that along with its sensuous presentation it\nis fundamentally addressed to the _mind._ The mind is intended to be\naffected by it and to receive some kind of satisfaction in it.\nThis function of the work of art at once makes it clear how it is that\nit is in no way intended to be a natural product or, on the side where\nit impinges on Nature, to possess the living principle of Nature. This,\nat least, is a fact whether the natural product is ranked lower or\nhigher than a _mere_ work of art, as people are accustomed to express\nthemselves in the tone of depreciation.\nIn other words the sensuous aspect of a work of art has a right to\ndeterminate existence only in so far as it exists for the human mind,\nnot, however, in so far as itself, as a material object, exists for\nitself independently.\nIf we examine more closely in what way the sensuous _materia_ is\npresented to man we find that what is so can be placed under various\nrelations to the mind.\n(\u03b1\u03b1) The lowest in grade and that least compatible with relation to\nintelligence is purely sensuous sensation. It consists primarily in\nmere looking, listening, just as in times of mental overstrain it may\noften be a relaxation to go about without thought, and merely listen\nand have a look round. The mind, however, does not rest in the mere\napprehension of external objects through sight and hearing; it makes\nthem objective to its own inward nature, which thereupon, is impelled\nitself to give effect to itself in these things as a further step\nunder a sensuous mode, in other words, it relates itself to them as\n_desire._ In this appetitive relation to the external world man, as a\nsensuous[65] particular thing, stands in a relation of opposition, to\nthings in general as in the same way particulars. He does not address\nhimself to them with open mind and the universal ideas of thought; he\nretains an isolated position, with its personal impulses and interests,\nrelatively to objects as fixed in their obduracy as himself, and makes\nhimself at home in them by using them, or eating them up altogether,\nand, in short, gives effect to his self-satisfaction by the sacrifice\nhe makes of them. In this negative relation desire requires for itself\nnot merely the superficial show of external objects, but the actual\nthings themselves in their material concrete existence. Mere pictures\nof the wood, which it seeks to make use of, or of the animals, which it\nhopes to eat up, would be of no service to desire. Just as little is it\npossible for desire to suffer the object to remain in its freedom; its\ncraving is just this to force it to annihilate this self-subsistency\nand freedom of external facts, and to demonstrate that these things\nare only there to be destroyed and devoured. But at the same time\nthe particular person is neither himself free, begirt as he is by\nthe particular limited and transitory interests of his desires, for\nhis definite acts do not proceed from the essential universality and\nrationality of his will, neither is he free relatively to the external\nworld, for desire[66] remains essentially determined by things and\nrelated to them.\nThis relation, then, of desire is not that in which man is related to\nthe work of art. He suffers it to exist in its free independence as\nan object; he associates himself with it without any craving of this\nkind, rather as with an object reflective of himself[67], which exists\nsolely for the contemplative faculty of mind. For this reason, as we\nhave said, the work of art, although it possesses sensuous existence,\ndoes not require sensuous concrete existence, nor yet the animated life\nof such objects. Or, rather, we should add, it _ought_ not to remain\non such a level, in so far as its true function is exclusively to\nsatisfy spiritual interests, and to shut the door on all approach to\nmere desire. Hence we can understand how it is that practical desire\nrates the particular works of Nature in the organic or inorganic world,\nwhich are at its service, more highly than works of art, which are\nobviously useless in this sense, and only contribute enjoyment to other\ncapacities of man's spirit.\n(\u03b2\u03b2) A second mode under which the externally present comes before\nthe conscious subject is, as contrasted with the single sensuous\nperception and active desire, the purely theoretical relation to\nthe _intelligence._ The theoretic contemplation of objects has no\ninterest in consuming the same in their particularity and satisfying\nor maintaining itself through the sense by their means; its object\nis to attain a knowledge of them in their _universality_, to seek\nout their ideal nature and principle, to comprehend them according\nto their notional idea. Consequently this contemplative interest is\ncontent to leave the particular things as they are, and stands aloof\nfrom them in their objective singularity, which is not the object of\nsuch a faculty's investigation. For the rational intelligence is not\na property of the particular person in the sense that desire is so;\nit appertains to his singularity as being itself likewise essentially\nuniversal. So long as it persists in this relation of universality to\nthe objects in question, it is his reason in its universal potency\nwhich is attempting to discover _itself_ in Nature, and thereby the\ninward or essential being of the natural objects, which his sensuous\nexistence does not present under its mode of immediacy, although such\nexistence is founded therein. This interest of contemplation, the\nsatisfaction of which is the task of _science_, is, however, shared in\nthis scientific form just as little by art as it shared in the common\ntable of those impulses of the purely practical desire. Science can,\nit is true, take as its point of departure the sensuous thing in its\nsingularity, and possess itself of some conception, how this individual\nthing is present in its specific colour or form. But for all that this\nisolated thing of sense as such possesses no further relation to mind,\ninasmuch as the interest of intelligence makes for the universal,\nthe law, the thought and notion of the object, and consequently not\nonly does it forsake it in its immediate singularity, but it actually\ntransforms it within the region of idea[68], converting a concrete\nobject of sense into an abstract subject-matter of thought, that is\nconverting it into something other than the same object of its sensuous\nperception actually was. The artistic interest does not follow such\na process, and is distinct from that of science for this reason.\nThe contemplation of art restricts its interest simply in the way\nin which the work of art, as external object, in the directness of\nits definition, and in the singularity wherein it appears to sense,\nis manifested in all its features of colour, form, and sound, or as\na single isolated vision of the whole; it does not go so far beyond\nthe immediately received objective character as to propose, as is the\ncase with science, the ideal or conceptive thinking of this particular\nobjectivity under the terms of the rational and universal notion which\nunderlies it.\nThe interest of art, therefore, is distinguishable from the practical\ninterest of desire in virtue of the fact that it suffers its object to\nremain in its free independence, whereas desire applies it, even to the\npoint of destruction, to its own uses. The contemplation of art, on\nthe other hand, differs from that of a scientific intelligence in an\nanalogous way[69] in virtue of the fact that it cherishes an interest\nfor the object in its isolated existence, and is not concerned to\ntransform the same into terms of universal thought and notion.\n(\u03b3\u03b3) It follows, then, that, though the sensuous _materia_ is\nunquestionably present in a work of art, it is only as surface or\n_show_ of the sensuous that it is under any necessity to appear. In\nthe sensuous appearance of the work of art it is neither the concrete\nmaterial stuff, the empirically perceived completeness and extension\nof the internal organism which is the object of desire, nor is it the\nuniversal thought of pure ideality, which in either case the mind\nseeks for. Its aim is the sensuous presence, which, albeit suffered\nto persist in its sensuousness, is equally entitled to be delivered\nfrom the framework of its purely material substance. Consequently, as\ncompared with the immediately envisaged and incorporated object of\nNature, the sensuous presence in the work of art is transmuted to mere\nsemblance or _show_, and the work of art occupies a midway ground, with\nthe directly perceived objective world on one side and the ideality of\npure thought on the other. It is not as yet pure thought, but, despite\nthe element of sensuousness which adheres to it, it is no longer purely\nmaterial existence, in the sense at least that stones, plants, and\norganic life are such. The sensuous element in a work of art is rather\nitself somewhat of ideal intension[70], which, however, as not being\nactually the ideal medium of thought, is still externally presented at\nthe same time as an object. This semblance of the sensuous presents\nitself to the mind externally as the form, visible appearance, and\nharmonious vibration of things. This is always assuming that it suffers\nthe objects to remain in their freedom as objective facts, and does not\nseek to penetrate into their inward essence by abstract thought, for by\ndoing so they would (as above explained) entirely cease to exist for it\nin their external singularity.\nFor this reason the sensuous aspect of art is only related to the two\n_theoretical_[71] senses of _sight_ and _hearing_; smell, on the other\nhand, taste, and the feeling of touch are excluded from the springs of\nart's enjoyment. Smell, taste, and touch come into contact with matter\nsimply as such[72], and with the immediate sensuous qualities of the\nsame; smell with the material volatization through the air; taste with\nthe material dissolution of substance, and touch or mere bodily feeling\nwith qualities such as heat, coldness, smoothness, and so forth. On\nthis account these senses cannot have to do with the objects of art,\nwhich ought to subsist in their actual and very independence, admitting\nof no purely sensuous or rather physical relation. The pleasant for\nsuch senses is not the beauty of art. Thus art on its sensuous side\nbrings before us deliberately merely a shadow-world of shapes, tones,\nand imaged conceptions[73], and it is quite beside the point to\nmaintain that it is simply a proof of the impotence and limitations\nof man that he can only present us with the surface of the physical\nworld, mere _schemata_, when he calls into being his creative works. In\nart these sensuous shapes and tones are not offered as exclusively for\nthemselves and their form to our direct vision. They are presented with\nthe intent to secure in such shape satisfaction for higher and more\nspiritual interests, inasmuch as they are mighty to summon an echo and\nresponse in the human spirit evoked from all depths of its conscious\nlife. In this way the sensuous is _spiritualized_ in art, or, in other\nwords, the life of _spirit_ comes to dwell in it under sensuous guise.\n(\u03b2) For this reason, however, a product of art is only possible in\nso far as it has received its passage through the mind, and has\noriginated from the productive activity of mind. This brings us to\nanother question we have to answer, and it is this: \"How is the\nsensuous or material aspect, which is imperative as a condition of\nart, operative in the artist as conjoined to his personal productive\nactivity[74]?\" Now this mode or manner of artistic production contains,\nas an activity personal to the artist, in essentials just the same\ndeterminants which we found posited in the work of art. It must be\na spiritual activity, which, however, at the same time possesses in\nitself the element of sensuousness and immediacy. It is neither, on\nthe one hand, purely mechanical work, such as is purely unconscious\nfacility in sleight of hand upon physical objects, or a stereotyped\nactivity according to teachable rule of thumb; nor, on the other\nhand, is it a productive process of science, which tends to pass\nfrom sensuous things to abstract ideas and thoughts, or is active\nexclusively in the medium of pure thought. In contrast to these the\ntwo aspects of mental idea and sensuous material must in the artistic\nproduct be united. For example, it would be possible in the case of\npoetical compositions to attempt to embody what was the subject-matter\nin the form of prosaic thought in the first instance, and only after\ndoing so to attach to the same imaginative ideas rhymes and so on,\nso that as a net result such imagery would be appendent to the\nabstract reflections as so much ornament and decoration. An attempt\nof this kind, however, could only lead us to a poor sort of poetry,\nfor in it we should have operative a twofold kind of activity in its\n_separation_, which in the activity of genuine artistic work only\nholds good in inseparable unity. It is this true kind of creative\nactivity which forms what is generally described as the artistic\n_imagination_. It is the rational element, which in its import as\nspirit only exists, in so far as it actively forces its way into the\npresence of consciousness, yet likewise, and only subject to this\ncondition, displays all its content to itself under a sensuous form.\nThis activity possesses therefore a spiritual content, but it clothes\nthe same in sensuous image, and for this reason that it is only able\nto come to a knowledge of the same under this sensuous garb. We may\ncompare such a process with that of a man of experience in life, a man,\nshall we add, of real geniality and wit, who--while at the same time\nbeing fully conscious in what the main importance of life consists,\nwhat are the things which essentially bind men together, what moves\nthem and is the mainspring of their lives--nevertheless has neither\nbrought home this content in universal maxims, nor indeed is able to\nunfold it to others in the generalities of the reflective process, but\nmakes these mature results of his intelligence without exception clear\nto himself and others in particular cases, whether real or invented,\nor by examples and such like which hit the mark. For in the ideas of\nsuch a man everything shapes itself into the concrete image determinate\nin its time and place, to which therefore the addition of names and\nany other detail of external condition causes no difficulty. Yet such\na kind of imagination rather rests on the recollection of conditions,\nhe has lived through, actual experience, than it is a creative\npower of itself. Memory preserves and renews the particularity and\nexternal fashion of such previous events with all their more distinct\ncircumstances, but on the other hand does not suffer the universal\nto appear independently. The creative imagination of an artist is\nthe imagination of a great mind and a big heart; it is the grasp and\nexcogitation of ideas and shapes, and, in fact, nothing less than\nthis grasp of the profoundest and most embracing human interests in\nthe wholly definite presentation of imagery borrowed from objective\nexperience. A consequence of this is, that imagination of this type[75]\nis based in a certain sense on a natural gift, a general talent for\nit, as we say, because its creative power essentially implies an\naspect of sense presentation. It is no doubt not unusual to speak in\nthe same way of scientific \"talent.\" The sciences, however, merely\npresuppose the general capacity for thought, which does not possess, as\nimagination does, together with its intellectual activity, a reference\nto the concrete testimony of Nature, but rather precisely abstracts\nfrom the activity that form in which we find it in Nature. It would be,\ntherefore, truer to the mark if we said there is no specific scientific\ntalent in the sense of a purely natural endowment. Imagination[76],\non the other hand, combines within it a mode of instinct-like\ncreativeness. In other words the essential plasticity and material\nelement in a work of art is subjectively present in the artist as part\nof his native disposition and impulse[77], and as his unconscious\nactivity belongs in part to that which man receives straight from\nNature. No doubt the entire talent and genius of an individual is\nnot wholly exhausted by that we describe as natural capability. The\ncreation of art is quite as much a spiritual and self-cognized process;\nbut for all that we affirm that its spirituality contains an element\nof plastic or configurative facility which Nature[78] confers on it.\nFor this reason, though almost anybody can reach a certain point in\nart, yet, in order to pass beyond this--and it is here that the art\nin question really begins--a talent for art which is inborn and of a\nhigher order altogether is indispensable.\nConsidered simply as a natural basis a talent of this kind asserts\nitself for the most part in early youth, and is manifested in the\nrestless persistency, ever intent with vivacity and alertness, to\ncreate artistic shapes in some particular sensuous medium, and to make\nthis mode of expression and utterance the unique one or the one of\nmain importance and most suitable. And thus also a virtuosity up to a\ncertain point in the technique of art which is arrived at with ease is\na sign of inborn talent. A sculptor finds everything convertible into\nplastic shape, and from early days takes to modelling clay; and so\non generally whatever men of such innate powers have in their minds,\nwhatever excites and moves their souls, becomes forthwith a plastic\nfigure, a drawing, a melody, or a poem.\n(_\u03b3_) Thirdly, and in conclusion: the _content_ of art is also in some\nrespects borrowed from the objective world perceived in sense, that\nis Nature; or, in any case, if the content is also of a spiritual\ncharacter, it can only be grasped in such a way, that the spiritual\nelement therein, as human relations, for example, are displayed in the\nform of phenomena which possess objective reality.\n3. There is yet another question to solve, namely, what the interest\nor the _End_ is, which man proposes to himself in the creation of the\ncontent embodied by a work of art. This was, in fact, the third point\nof view, which we propounded relatively to the art-product. Its more\ndetailed discussion will finally introduce us to the true notional\nconcept of art itself.\nIf we take a glance at our ordinary ideas on this subject, one of the\nmost prevalent is obviously\n(_a_) The principle of the imitation of Nature. According to this view\nthe essential aim or object of art consists in imitation, by which is\nunderstood a facility in copying natural forms as present to us in a\nmanner which shall most fully correspond to such facts. The success of\nsuch an exact representation of Nature is assumed to afford us complete\nsatisfaction.\n(_\u03b1_) Now in this definition there is to start with absolutely nothing\nbut the formal aim to bring about the bare repetition a second time\nby man, so far as his means will permit of this, of all that was\nalready in the external world, precisely too in the way it is there. A\nrepetition of this sort may at once be set down as\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) A _superfluous_ task for the reason that everything\nwhich pictures, theatrical performances represent by way of\nimitation--animals, natural scenery, incidents of human life--we have\nalready elsewhere before us in our gardens or at home, or in other\nexamples of the more restricted or extended reaches of our personal\nacquaintance. Looked at, moreover, more closely, such a superfluity of\nenergy can hardly appear otherwise than a presumptuous trifling; it is\nso because\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) It lags so far behind Nature. In other words art is limited in\nits means of representation. It can only produce one-sided illusions,\na semblance, to take one example, of real fact addressed exclusively\nto _one_ sense. And, moreover, if it does wholly rely on the bare\naim of _mere_ imitation, instead of Nature's life all it gives us\never is the mere pretence of its substance. For some such reason the\nTurks, who are Mohammedans, will not put up with any pictures or\ncopies of men and other objects. When James Bruce, in his travels\nthrough Abyssinia, showed a painted fish to a Turk, that worthy was\nat first astonished; but, quickly recovering himself, he made answer\nas follows: \"If this fish shall rise up against you at the last day,\nand say, 'You have certainly given me a body, but no living soul,'\nhow are you going to justify yourself against such a complaint?\" The\nprophet himself, moreover, if we may believe the Sunna, said to the\ntwo women Ommi Hubiba and Ommi Selma, who told him of certain pictures\nin the Aethiopian churches: \"These pictures will rise up in judgment\nagainst their creators on the Last Day.\" There are, no doubt, no less\nexamples of completely deceptive imitation. The painted grapes of\nZeuxis, have been accepted from antiquity and long after as an instance\nof art's triumph, and also of that of the principle of imitation,\nbecause, we are told, actual doves pecked at them. We might add to\nthis ancient example that more modern one of B\u00fcltner's monkey, which\nbit to pieces a painted cockchafer in R\u00f6sel's \"Diversions of Insects,\"\nand was consequently forgiven by his master, although he destroyed by\nthis means a fine copy of the precious work, because he proved thus\nthe excellence of its illustrations. But if we will only reflect a\nmoment on such and other instances we can only come to the conclusion\nthat instead of praising works of art, because they have deceived\n_even_ doves and monkeys, the foolish people ought to be condemned\nwho imagine that the quality of a work of art is enhanced if they are\nable to proclaim an effect of the same so miserable as the supreme\nand last word they can say for it. In short, to sum up, we may state\nemphatically that in the mere business of imitation art cannot maintain\nits rivalry with Nature, and if it makes the attempt it must look like\na worm which undertakes to crawl after an elephant.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) Having regard, then, to this invariable failure, that is,\nrelative failure of human imitation as contrasted with the natural\nprototype, we have no end left us but the pleasure offered by sleight\nof hand in its effort to produce something which resembles Nature. And\nit is unquestionably a fact that mankind are able to derive enjoyment\nfrom the attempt to reproduce with their individual labour, skill, and\nindustry what they find around them. But a delight and admiration of\nthis kind also becomes, if taken alone[79], indeed just in proportion\nas the copy follows slavishly the thing copied, so much the more icily\nnull and cold, or brings its reaction of surfeit and repugnance.\nThere are portraits which, as has been drily remarked, are positively\nshameless in their likeness[80]; and Kant brings forward a further\nexample of this pleasure in imitation pure and simple to the effect\nthat we are very soon tired of a man--and there really are such--who\nis able to imitate the nightingale's song quite perfectly; for we\nno sooner find that it is a man who is producing the strain than we\nhave had enough of it. We then take it to be nothing but a clever\ntrick, neither the free outpouring of Nature, nor yet a work of art.\nWe expect, in short, from the free creative power of men something\nquite other than a music of this kind, which only retains our interest\nwhen, as in the case of the nightingale's note, it breaks forth in\nunpremeditated fashion, resembling in this respect the rhythmic flood\nof human feeling, from the native springs of its life. And as a general\nrule this delight we experience in the skill of imitation can only be\nof a restricted character; it becomes a man better to derive enjoyment\nfrom that which he brings to birth from himself. In this respect the\ninvention of every insignificant technical product is of higher rank;\nand mankind may feel more proud at having invented the hammer, nail,\nand so forth, than in making themselves adepts as imitators. For this\nabstract zest in the pursuit of imitation is on the same lines as the\nfeat of the man who had taught himself to throw lentils through a\nsmall aperture without missing. He made an exhibition of this feat to\nAlexander, and Alexander merely made him a present as a reward for this\nart, empty and useless as it was, of a bushel of lentils.\n(_\u03b2_) Inasmuch as, moreover, the principle of imitation is purely\nformal, _objective beauty_ itself disappears, if that principle is\naccepted as the end. For the question is then no longer what is the\n_constitution_ of that which is to be imitated, but simply whether the\ncopy is _correct_ or no. The object and the content of the beautiful\ncomes to be regarded as a matter of indifference. When, in other words,\nputting the principle of mere imitation on one side, we speak, in\nconnection with animals, human beings, places, actions, and characters,\nof a distinction between beauty and ugliness, it remains none the\nless the fact that relatively to such a principle we are referring\nto a distinction which does not properly belong to an art for which\nwe have appropriated this principle of imitation to the exclusion\nof all others. In such a case, therefore, whenever we select objects\nand attempt to distinguish between their beauty and ugliness, owing\nto this absence of a standard we can apply to the infinite forms of\nNature, we have in the final resort only left us the _personal taste_,\nwhich is fixed by no rule, and admits of no discussion. And, in truth,\nif we start, in the selection of objects for representation, from\nthat which mankind _generally_ discover as beautiful and ugly, and\naccept accordingly for artistic imitation, in other words, form their\nparticular taste, there is no province in the domain of the objective\nworld which is not open to us, and which is hardly likely to fail\nto secure its admirer. At any rate, among men we may assume, that,\nthough the case of every husband and his wife may be disputed, yet at\nleast every bridegroom regards his bride as beautiful, very possibly\nbeing the only person who does so; and that an individual taste for a\nbeauty of this kind admits of no fixed rules at all may be regarded\nas a bit of luck for both parties. If, moreover, we cast a glance\nwholly beyond mere individuals and their accidental taste to that of\nnations, this again is full of diversity and opposition. How often we\nhear it repeated that a European beauty would not please a Chinaman,\nor even a Hottentot--a Chinaman having a totally distinct notion of\nbeauty from that of a black man, and the black man in his turn from\nthat of a European. Indeed, if we consider the works of art of those\nextra-European peoples, their images of gods, for instance, which have\nbeen imaginatively conceived as worthy of veneration and sublime, they\ncan only appear to us as frightful idols; their music will merely ring\nin our ears as an abominable noise, while, from the opposite point of\nview, such aliens will regard our sculptures, paintings, and musical\ncompositions as having no meaning or actually ugly.\n(_\u03b3_) But even assuming that we abstract from an objective principle\nof art, and retain the beautiful as established on the subjective\nand individual taste, we shall soon discover, from the point of view\nof art itself, that the imitation of natural objects, which appeared\nto be a universal principle, and indeed one secured by important\nauthorities, is not to be relied upon, at least under this general\nand wholly abstract conception of it. If we look at the particular\narts we cannot fail to observe that, albeit painting and sculpture\nportray objects which resemble those of Nature, or the type of which\nis essentially borrowed from Nature, the works of architecture on the\ncontrary--and this, too, is one of the _fine_ arts--quite as little as\nthe compositions of poetry, to the extent at least that these latter\nare not restricted to mere description, cannot justly be described as\nimitations of Nature. At any rate, if we are desirous of maintaining\nsuch a thesis with respect to the arts thus excluded, we should find\nourselves forced to make important deviations from the track, in order\nto condition our proposition in various ways, and level down our\nso-called truth at least to the plane of probability. But once accept\nprobability, and we should again be confronted with a great difficulty\nin determining precisely what is and what is not probable; and in the\nend no one could really think of or succeed, even if he did so, in\nexcluding from poetry all compositions of an entirely capricious and\ncompletely imaginative[81] character.\nThe end or object of art must therefore consist in something other than\nthe purely formal[82] imitation of what is given to objective sense,\nwhich invariably can merely call into being technical _legerdemain_\nand not _works_ of art[83]. It is no doubt an essential constituent\nof a work of art that it should have natural forms as a foundation,\nbecause the mode of its representation is in external form, and thereby\nalong with it in that of natural phenomena. In painting it is obviously\nan important study to learn to copy with accuracy colours in their\nmutual relations, such as light effects and reflections, and so forth,\nand, with no less accuracy, the forms and shapes of objects carried\ninto their most subtle gradations of line. It is in this respect that\nin modern times more particularly the principle of the imitation of\nNature and naturalism generally has come into vogue. The object has\nbeen to recall an art, which has deteriorated into weakness and\nnebulosity, to the strength and determinate outlines of Nature, or,\nin yet another direction, as against the purely arbitrary caprice and\nconvention of a studio, which is in truth as remote from Nature as it\nis from art, and merely indicates the path of art's declension, to\nassert the claim of the legitimate, direct, and independent, no less\nthan coherent stability of natural fact. But while admitting that from\na certain point of view such an effort is reasonable enough, yet for\nall that the naturalism which it demands, taken by itself, is neither\nthe substantive thing, not yet of primary importance, in the true\nbasis of art; and although the external fact in its natural appearance\nconstitutes an element of essential value, yet the objective fact alone\ndoes not supply the _standard_ of rightness, nor is the mere imitation\nof external phenomena, in their external shape that is, the _end_ of\nart.\n(_b_) And as a consequence of this we have the further question--\"What\nis the true _content_ of art, and with what aim is that content brought\nbefore us?\" On this head we are confronted by the common opinion that\nit is the task and object of art to bring before our sense, feeling,\nand power of emulation[84] _every thing_ that the spirit of man can\nperceive or conceive. Art has in short to realize for us the well-known\nsaying, \"_Nihil humani a me alienum puto._\" Its object is therefore\ndeclared to be that of arousing and giving life to slumbering emotions,\ninclinations, passions of _every_ description, of filling the heart up\nto the brim; of compelling mankind, whether cultured or the reverse, to\npass through all that the human soul carries in its most intimate and\nmysterious chambers, all that it is able to experience and reproduce,\nall that the heart is able to stir and evoke in its depths and its\ncountlessly manifold possibilities; and yet further to deliver to the\ndomain of feeling and the delight of our vision all that the mind\nmay possess of essential and exalted being in its thought and the\nIdea--that majestic hierarchy of the noble, eternal, and true; and no\nless to interpret for us misfortune and misery, wickedness and crime;\nto make the hearts of men realize through and through[85] all that\nis atrocious and dreadful, no less than every kind of pleasure and\nblessedness; and last of all to start the imagination like a rover\namong the day-dream playing-fields of the fancy, there to revel in the\nseductive mirage of visions and emotions which captivate the senses.\nAll this infinitely manifold content--so it is held--it is the function\nof art to explore, in order that by this means the experience of our\nexternal life may be repaired of its deficiencies, and yet from a\nfurther point of view that the passions we share with all men[86] may\nbe excited, not merely that the experiences of life may not have us\nunmoved, but that we ourselves may thereafter long to make ourselves\nopen channels of a universal experience. Such a stimulus is not\npresented on the plane of actual experience itself[87], but can only\ncome through the semblance of it, that is to say through the illusions\nwhich art, in its creations, substitutes for the actual world. And the\npossibility of such a deception, by means of the semblances of art,\ndepends on the fact that all reality must for man pass through the\nmedium of the vision and imaginative idea; and it is only after such\na passage that it penetrates the emotional life and the will. In such\na process it is of no consequence whether it is immediate external\nreality which claims his attention, or whether the result is effected\nby some other way, in other words by means of images, symbols, and\nideas, which contain and display the content of such actuality. Men are\nable to imagine things, which do not actually exist, as if they did\nexist. Consequently it is precisely the same thing for our emotional\nlife, whether it is the objective world or merely the show of the same,\nin virtue of which a situation, a relation, or any content of life, in\nshort, is brought home to us. Either mode is equally able to stir in\nus an echo to the essential secret which it carries, whether it be in\ngrief or joy, in agitation or convulsion, and can cause to flow through\nus the feelings and passions of anger, hate, pity, anxiety, fear, love,\nreverence and admiration, honour and fame.\nThe awakening of every kind of emotion in us, the drawing our soul\nthrough every content of life, the realization of all these movements\nof soul-life by means of a presence which is only external as an\nillusion--this it is which, in the opinion described, is pre-eminently\nregarded as the peculiar and transcendent power of artistic creation.\nWe must not, however, overlook the fact that in this view of art as a\nmeans to imprint on the soul and the mind what is good and evil alike,\nto make man more strong in the pursuit of what is noblest, no less than\nenervate his definite course[88], by transporting his emotional life\nthrough the most sensuous and selfish desires, the task as yet proposed\nto art remains throughout of an entirely formal character; without\npossessing independently an assured aim all that art can offer is the\nempty form for every possible kind of ideal and formative content.\n(_c_) As a matter of fact art does not possess this formal side,\nnamely, that it is able to bring before our senses and feeling and\nartistically adorn every possible kind of material, precisely as\nthe thoughts of ordinary reflection[89] elaborate every possible\nsubject-matter and modes of action, supplying the same with its\nequipment of reasons and vindications. In the presence, however,\nof such a variety of content we cannot fail to observe that these\ndiversified emotions and ideas, which it is assumed art has to\nstimulate or enforce, intersect each other, contradict and mutually\ncancel each other. Indeed, under this aspect, the more art inspires men\nto emotions thus opposed, to that extent precisely it merely enlarges\nthe cleavage in their feelings and passions, and sets them staggering\nabout in Bacchantic riot, or passes over into sophistry and scepticism\nprecisely as your ordinary free thinkers do. This variety of the\nmaterial of art itself compels us, therefore, not to remain satisfied\nwith so formal a determination. Our rational nature forces its way into\nthis motley array of discord, and demands to see the resurrection of\na higher and more universal purpose from these elements despite their\nopposition, and to be conscious of its attainment. Just in a similar\nmanner the social life of mankind and the State are no doubt credited\nwith the aim that in them _all_ human capacities and _all_ individual\npotencies should meet with expansion and expression in _all_ their\nfeatures and tendencies. But in opposition to so formal a view there\nvery quickly crops up the question in what _unity_ these manifold\nmanifestations are to be concentrated, and what _single end_ they must\nhave for their fundamental concept and ultimate end. Just as in the\ncase of the notional concept of the human State so too there arises in\nthat of human art the need, as to a part thereof, for an end _common_\nto the particular aspects, no less than in part for one which is more\nexalted and _substantive_ in its character[90].\nAs such a substantive end the conclusion of reflection is readily\nbrought home to us that art possesses at once the power and function to\nmitigate the savagery of mere desires.\n(_\u03b1_) With regard to this first conception we have merely to ascertain\nwhat characteristic peculiar to art implies this possibility of\neliminating this rawness of desire, and of fettering and instructing\nthe impulses and passions. Coarseness in general has its ground-root\nin an unmitigated self-seeking of sensuous impulses, which take their\nplunge off and are exclusively intent on the satisfaction of their\nconcupiscence. Sensual desire is, however, all the more brutal and\ndomineering, in proportion as, in its isolation and confinement, it\nappropriates the _entire man_, so that he does not retain the power to\nseparate himself in his universal capacity from this determinacy and to\nmaintain the conscious presence of such universality[91]. Even if the\nman in such a case exclaims, \"the passion is mightier than myself,\"\nthough it is true no doubt that for that man's mind the abstract ego is\nseparate from the particular passion, yet it is purely so in a formal\nway. All that such a separation amounts to is that as against the force\nof the passion the ego, in its universal form or competency, is of no\naccount at all. The savageness of passion consists therefore in the\nfusion[92] of the ego as such a universal with the confined content\nof its desire, so that a man no longer possesses volitional power\noutside this single passion. Such savageness and untamed force of the\npossibilities of passion art mitigates in the first instance to the\nextent that it brings home to the mind and imagination of man what he\ndoes actually feel and carry into effect in such a condition. And even\nif art restricts itself to this that it places before the vision of\nthe mind pictures of passion, nay, even assuming such to be flattering\npictures, yet for all that a power of amelioration is contained\ntherein. At least we may say, that by this means is brought before a\nman's intelligence what apart from such presentment he merely _is._ The\nman in this way contemplates his impulses and inclinations; and whereas\napart from this they whirl him away without giving him time to reflect,\nhe now sees them outside himself and already, for the reason that they\ncome before him rather as objects than a part of himself, he begins\nto be free from them as aliens. For this reason it may often happen\nthat an artist, under the weight of grief, mitigates and weakens the\nintensity of his own emotions in their effect upon him by the artistic\nrepresentation of them. Comfort, too, is to be found even in tears. The\nman who to start with is wholly given up to and concentrated in sorrow,\nis able thus, at any rate, to express that which is merely felt within\nin a direct way. Yet more alleviating is the utterance of such inner\nlife in words, images, musical sound, and shapes.\nIt was therefore a good old custom in the case of funerals and\nlayings-out to appoint wailing women, in order to give audible\nexpression to grief, or generally to create an external sympathy. For\nmanifestations of sympathy bring the content of human sorrow to the\nsufferer in an objective form; he is by their repetition driven to\nreflect upon it, and the burden is thereby made lighter. And so it has\nfrom of old been considered that to weep or to speak oneself out are\nequally means whereby freedom is secured from the oppressing burden, or\nat least the heart is appreciably lifted. Consequently the mitigation\nof the violence of passions admits of this general explanation that\nman is released from his unmediated confinement[93] in an emotion,\nbecomes aware of it as a thing external to himself, to which he is\nconsequently obliged to place himself in an ideal relation. Art, while\nstill remaining within the sphere of the senses, faces man from the\nmight of his sensitive experience by means of its representations.\nNo doubt we frequently hear that pet phrase of many that it is man's\nduty to remain in immediate union with Nature. Such union is in its\nunmediated purity nothing more or less than savagery and wildness;\nand art, precisely in the way that it dissolves this unity for human\nbeings, lifts them with gentle hands over this inclosure in Nature.\nThe way men are occupied with the objects of art's creation remains\nthroughout of a contemplative[94] character; and albeit in the first\ninstance it educates merely an attention to the actual facts portrayed,\nyet over and beyond this, and with a power no less decisive, it draws\nman's attention to their significance, it forces him to compare their\ncontent with that of others, and to receive without reserve the general\nconclusions of such a survey and all the ramifications[95] such imply.\n(_\u03b2_) To the characteristic above discussed adheres in natural sequence\nthe second which has been predicated of art as its essential aim,\nnamely, the _purification_ of the passions, an instruction, that is,\nand a building to _moral_ completeness. For the defining role that\nart has to bridle savage nature and educate the passions remained one\nwholly formal and general, so that the further question must arise as\nto a _specific_ kind and an essential and _culminating_ point of such\nan educative process.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) The doctrine of the purification of the passions shares in the\ndefect previously noted as adhering to the mitigation of desires. It\ndoes, however, emphasize more closely the fact that the representations\nof art needed a standard, by means of which it would be possible to\nestimate their comparative worth and unworth. This standard is just\ntheir effectiveness to separate what is pure from that which is the\nreverse in the passions. Art, therefore, requires a content which\nis capable of expressing this purifying power, and in so far as the\npower to assert such effectiveness is assumed to constitute the\nsubstantive end of art, the purifying content will consist in asserting\nthat effective power before consciousness in its _universality_ and\n_essentiality._[96]\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) It is a deduction from the point of view just described that it\nis the end of art to _instruct._ Thus, on the one hand, the peculiar\ncharacter of art consists in the movement of the emotions and in\nthe satisfaction which is found in this movement, even in fear,\ncompassion, in painful agitation and shock--that is to say, in the\nsatisfying concern of the feelings and passions, and to that extent in\na complacent, delighted, or enthusiastic attitude to the objects of\nart and their presentation and effect: while, on the other hand, this\nartistic object is held to discover its higher standard exclusively\nin its power to instruct, in the _fabula docet_, and thereby in the\nusefulness, which the work of art is able to exercise on the recipient.\nIn this respect the Horatian adage\nEt prodesse volunt et delectare poetae[97]\ncontains, concentrated into a few words, all that in after times has\nbeen drawn out as a doctrine of art through every conceivable grade of\ndilution to the last extreme of insipidity.\nIn respect, then, to such instruction we have to ask whether the idea\nis that the same ought to be direct or indirect in the work of art,\nexplicit or implicit.\nNow if the question at issue is one of general importance to art about\na universal rather than contingent purpose, such an ultimate end, on\naccount of the essential spirituality of art, can only be itself of\nspiritual import; in other words, so far from being of accidental\nimportance it must be true in virtue of its own nature and on its own\naccount. An end of this kind can only apply to instruction in so far as\na genuine and essentially explicit content is brought before the mind\nby means of the work of art. From such a point of view we are entitled\nto affirm that it is the function of art to accept so much the more\nof a content of this nature within its compass in proportion to the\nnobility of its rank, and that only in the verity of such a content\nwill it discover the standard according to which the pertinency of\nor the reverse of what is expressed is adjudged. Art is in truth the\nprimary[98] _instructress_ of peoples.\nBut, on the other hand, if the object of instruction is so entirely\ntreated as an _end_ that the universal nature of the content presented\ncannot fail to be asserted and rendered-bluntly and on its own account\nexplicit as abstract thesis, prosaic reflection or general maxim,\nrather than merely in an indirect way contained by implication in the\nconcrete embodiment of art, then and in that case, by means of such a\nseparation, the sensuous, plastic configuration, which is precisely\nthat which makes the artistic product a _work of art_, is merely an\notiose accessory, a husk, a semblance, which are expressly posited\nas nothing more than _shell_ and semblance. Thereby the very nature\nof a work of art is abused. For the work of art ought not to bring\nbefore the imaginative vision a content in its universality as such,\nbut rather this universality under the mode of individual concreteness\nand distinctive sensuous particularity. If the work in question\ndoes not conform to such a principle, but rather sets before us the\ngeneralization of its content with the express object of instruction\npure and simple, then the imaginative no less than the material aspect\nof it are merely an external and superfluous ornament, and the work\nof art is itself a shattered thing within that ornament[99], a ruin\nwherein form and content no longer appear as a mutually adherent\ngrowth. For, in the case supposed, the particular object of the senses\nand the ideal content apprehended by the mind[100] have become external\nto one another.\nFurthermore, if the object of art is assumed to consist in\nutilitarian _instruction_ of this kind, that other aspect of delight,\nentertainment, and diversion is simply abandoned on its own account\nas _unessential_; it has now to look for its substance to the utility\nof the matter of instruction, to which it is simply an accompaniment.\nBut this amounts to saying, that art does not carry its vocation and\npurpose in itself, but that its fundamental conception is in something\nelse, to which it subserves as a _means._ Art becomes, in short, merely\none of the many means, which are either of use, or may be employed\nto secure, the aim of instruction. This brings us to the boundary\nline where art can only cease to be an end on its own independent\naccount; it is deliberately deposed either to the mere plaything of\nentertainment, or a mere means of instruction.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) The line of this limit is most emphasized when the question\nis raised as to the end or object of highest rank for the sake of\nwhich the passions have to be purified or men have to be instructed.\nThis goal has frequently in modern times been identified with _moral\nimprovement_, and the end of art is assumed to consist in this that its\nfunction is to prepare our inclinations and impulses, and generally\nto conduct us to the supreme goal of moral perfection. In this view\nwe find instruction and purification combined. The notion is that art\nby the insight it gives us of genuine moral goodness, in other words,\nthrough its instruction, at the same time summons us to the process of\npurification, and in this way alone can and ought to bring about the\nimprovement of mankind as the right use they can make of it and its\nsupreme object.\nWith reference to the relation in which art stands to the end of\nimprovement, we may practically say the same thing as we did about the\ndidactic end. It may readily be admitted that art as its principle\nought not to make the immoral and its advance its end. But it is one\nthing deliberately to make immorality the aim of its presentation and\nanother not expressly to do so in the case of morality. It is possible\nto deduce an excellent moral from any work of art whatever; but such\ndepends, of course, on a particular interpretation and consequently on\nthe individual who draws the moral. The defence is made of the most\nimmoral representations on the ground that people ought to become\nacquainted with evil and sin in order to act morally. Conversely, it\nhas been maintained that the portrayal of Mary Magdalene, the fair\nsinner, who afterwards repented, has seduced many into sin, because\nart makes repentance look so beautiful, and you must first sin before\nyou can repent. The doctrine of moral improvement, however logically\ncarried out, is not merely satisfied that a moral should be conceivably\ndeducible from a work of art through interpretation; on the contrary,\nit would have the moral instruction clearly made to emerge as the\nsubstantive aim of the work[101]; nay, further, it would deliberately\nexclude from art's products all subjects, characters, actions, and\nevents which fail to be moral in its own sense. For art, in distinction\nfrom history and the sciences, which have their subject-matter\ndetermined for them, has a choice in the selection of its subjects.\nIn order that we may be in a position to estimate this view of the\nmoral end of art on the basis of principle, we ought above all to raise\nthe question as to the precise standpoint of the morality which is\nrecommended for our reception by this view. If we examine more closely\nthe standpoint of morality such, as is submitted us to-day under an\nenlightened interpretation[102], we soon discover that its conception\ndoes not immediately coincide with that which we describe in a general\nway as virtue, respectability[103], uprightness, and so forth. To be\na respectable honest man is not sufficient to make a man moral in the\nsense under discussion, for morality in this sense implies _reflection_\nand the definite consciousness of what is consonant with duty, and the\nacts which issue from such a consciousness. Now duty is itself the law\nof the will, which man, however, freely establishes out of himself,\nand thereon is taken to determine himself to this duty for duty's\nsake and its fulfilment's sake; in other words he only does good as\nacting under the conviction already secured that it is the good. This\nlaw--the duty which is selected and carried into effect for duty's\nsake to be the rule of conduct out of free conviction and the inner\nconscience--is, on its own account, the abstract universal of the will,\nwhich is the absolute antithesis to Nature, the impulses of sense,\nselfish interests, the passions and all that is commonly described\ncollectively as emotional life and heart. In this opposition the one\nside is regarded as _negating_ the other; and for the reason that both\nare present in the individual in their opposition, he is compelled,\nas determining himself from his own identity, to adopt the choice of\none to the rejection of the other. Such a decision and the act carried\nout in accordance with it merely become moral from the standpoint now\nconsidered on the one hand in virtue of the free conviction of duty,\nand on the other by reason of the victory secured not only over the\nparticular will, the natural motives, inclinations, passions and so on,\nbut also in virtue of the noble feelings and higher impulses. For the\nmodern ethic starts from the fixed opposition between the will in its\nspiritual universality and its sensuous natural particularity; it does\nnot consist in the perfected mediation of these opposed aspects, but in\ntheir mutual conflict as opposed to one another, which carries with\nit the demand, that the impulses in their antagonism to duty ought to\nyield to it.\nAn opposition of this nature is not merely present to mind in the\nrestricted confines of moral action; it asserts itself as a fundamental\nseveration and antithesis between that which is actual essentially,\nand on its own account, and that which is external reality and\nexistence[104]. Apprehended in entirely formal terms it is the contrast\nexposed by the universal, in so far as it is fixed in its substantive\nindependence over against the particular, as the latter is also on its\npart rigidly exterior to it. In more concrete form it appears in Nature\nas the opposition of the abstract law to the wealth of particular\nphenomena, each of which possesses its specific characteristics. It\nappears in mind as that between the sensuous and spiritual in man, as\nthe conflict of spirit with the flesh; it is that of duty for duty's\nsake; of the cold imperative with particular impulses, the warm heart,\nthe sensuous inclinations and impulses, in a word with man simply as\nindividual. Or it appears as the harsh antagonism between the inward\nfreedom and the external necessity of natural condition, and, lastly,\nas the contradiction of the dead, essentially emptied, concept, when\nconfronted with the fulness of concrete life, in other words, of theory\nand subjective thought as contrasted with objective existence and\nexperience.\nSuch are antithetical points of view, the discovery of which is not\nto be ascribed either to the ingenuity of reflective minds, or the\npedantry of a philosophical cult. They have in all ages, if in manifold\nguise, occupied and disquieted the human consciousness, although it\nis our more modern culture which has emphasized their opposition\nmost deliberately, and forced it in each case to the keenest edge of\ncontradiction. Intellectual culture, or rather the rapier edge of the\nmodern understanding, creates in man this contrast, which converts him\ninto some amphibious animal. He is compelled to live in two worlds\nmutually contradictory; and in this divided house consciousness,\ntoo, wanders aimlessly; tossed over from one side to the other it is\nunable to discover permanent satisfaction[105] for itself in either\none side or the other. For, on the one hand, we see mankind confined\nwithin common reality and earthly temporal condition, oppressed by\nnecessity and want, in Nature's toils, entangled in matter, in sensuous\naims and their enjoyment, dominated and whirled away by impulse and\npassion. On the other hand he lifts himself up to eternal idea's, to\na realm of thought and freedom. As Will he legislates for himself\nuniversal laws and destinations[106], he disrobes the world of the\nlife and blossom of its reality; he dissolves it in abstractions, that\nthe mind may vindicate its right and intrinsic worth by this very\ndissolution of Nature's rights and such maltreatment, a process in\nwhich he brings home to her again the necessity and violence he has\nexperienced at her hands. Such a cleavage of life and mind is, however,\naccompanied for modern culture with the demand that a contradiction\nso deep-seated should be dissolved. The mere understanding of\nabstract reflection is unable to disengage itself from the obstinacy\nof such contradictions. The solution consequently remains here for\nconsciousness a mere _ought_, and the present and reality is merely\nmoved within the continuous unrest of a to and fro, which seeks for\nthat reconciliation it is unable to find. The problem therefore arises\nwhether such a many-sided and fundamental antagonism, which is unable\nto pass beyond the mere ought and postulate of its solution, can be\nthe essential and wholly expressed truth, and[107], indeed, the final\nand supreme consummation. If the culture of the civilized world has\nfallen into such a contradiction it becomes the task of philosophy to\ndissolve the same, in other words to demonstrate that neither the one\nside or the other, in its one sided abstractness, should be held to\npossess truth, but that they contain within themselves the principle\nof their dissolution. The truth only _then_ comes before us in the\nreconciliation and mediation of both; and this mediation is no mere\npostulate, but is, in its essential nature, and in its actual presence\nthe at the same time accomplished and self-accomplishing. And, in\nfact, this view agrees directly with unwitting[108] faith and will,\nwhich always has before its conscious life this contradiction in its\nresolution, and in action accepts it as its aim and carries it into\neffect. All that philosophy achieves is to contribute the insight of\nthought into the essence of such cleavage. It demonstrates, or seeks to\ndemonstrate, how that which truth really is is simply the resolution of\nthe fracture, and, be it added, not in the sense that this antagonism\nand its alternative aspects in any way _are not_, but in the sense that\nthey are _there_[109] in reconciliation.\n(_d_) When discussing moral improvement as the ultimate end accepted\nfor art it was found that its principle pointed to a higher standpoint.\nIt will be necessary also to vindicate this standpoint for art.\nThereby the false position to which we have already directed attention\nvanishes, namely, that art has to serve as a means for moral ends and\nthe moral end of the world generally by means of its didactive and\nameliorating influence, and by doing so has its essential aim not in\nitself, but in something else. If we therefore continue still to speak\nof an end or goal of art, we must at once remove the perverse idea,\nwhich in the question, \"What is the end?\" will still make it include\nthe supplemental query, \"What is the use?\" The perverseness consists in\nthis that the work of art would then have to be regarded as related to\nsomething else, which is presented us as what is essential and ought\nto be. A work of art would in that case be merely a useful instrument\nin the realization of an end which possessed real and independent\nimportance outside the realm of art. As opposed to this we must\nmaintain that it is art's function to reveal _truth_ under the mode of\nart's sensuous or material configuration, to display the reconciled\nantithesis previously described, and by this means to prove that it\npossesses its final aim in itself, in this representation in short and\nself-revelation. For other ends such as instruction, purification,\nimprovement, procuring of wealth, struggle after fame and honour have\nnothing whatever to do with this work of art as such, still less do\nthey determine the fundamental idea[110] of it.\nIt is then from this point of view, into which the reflective\nconsideration of our subject-matter finally issues, that we have to\ngrasp the fundamental idea of art in terms of its ideal or inward\nnecessity, as it is also from this point of view that historically\nregarded the true appreciation and acquaintance with art took its\norigin. For that antithesis, to which we have drawn attention, did not\nmerely assert its presence within the general thought of educated men,\nbut equally in philosophy as such. It was only after philosophy was in\na position to overcome this opposition absolutely that it grasped the\nfundamental notion of its own content, and, to the extent it did so,\nthe idea of Nature and of art.\nFor this reason, as this point of view implies the reawakening of\nphilosophy in the widest connotation of the term, so also it is the\nre-awakening of the science of art. We may go further and affirm\nthat aesthetic as a science is in a real sense primarily indebted to\nthis re-awakening for its true origination, and art for its higher\nestimation.\nIV\nFrom this point of transition, I will briefly summarize the historical\nsubject-matter that I have in my mind's eye, partly on account of the\nhistorical importance itself, and in part because thereby the points\nof view are more clearly indicated to which importance is attached,\nand upon the basis of which we propose to continue the superstructure.\nIn its most general definition that basis consists in this, that the\nbeauty of art has become recognized as one of the means which resolve\nand bring back to unity that antithesis and contradiction between the\nmind and Nature as they repose in abstract alienation from each other\nin themselves, whether this latter is regarded as external phenomena or\nthe inward world of individual feeling and emotion[111].\n1. It was the philosophy of Kant which, in the first instance, not\nmerely experienced the want of such a point of union, but secured\ndefinite knowledge of it and brought it clearly before the mind.\nSpeaking generally, Kant accepted as his basis for intelligence no\nless than for the will the rationality which relates itself to itself\nor freedom, the self-consciousness that discovers and knows itself\nessentially as infinite. This knowledge of the absoluteness of reason\nin its essential substance, which has proved in more modern times the\nturning-point of philosophy, this absolute point of departure deserves\nrecognition, and does not admit of refutation, even though in other\nrespects the Kantian philosophy is inadequate. But at the same time it\nwas Kant who through falling back upon the fixed opposition between\nsubjective thought and objective things, between abstract universality\nand the sensuous individuality of the will, in a pre-eminent degree\nstrained to the extremest limit the very antithesis of morality we\nhave previously adverted to, inasmuch as over and above this he\nemphasized the practical operation of mind to the disadvantage of the\ncontemplative. In virtue of this fixity of the antithesis as cognized\nby the faculty of the understanding he had no other alternative than\nto express the unity exclusively in the form of subjective ideas for\nwhich no adequate reality could be demonstrated as correspondent; or,\non its practical side, as postulates, which it was no doubt possible\nto deduce from the practical reason, but whose essential being was\nnot within the cognition of thought, and the practical fulfilment\nof which remained throughout a mere \"ought\" deferred to infinity.\nAnd for this reason, though Kant did actually bring the reconciled\nopposition within the compass of intelligible ideas, he was neither\nable to develop its essential truth scientifically, nor to assert the\nsame as actual and exclusive reality. Unquestionably Kant did press\nbeyond this point, in the sense, that is to say, that he discovered the\nunity demanded in what he called the _intuitive_ understanding; but\nin this respect too he is held up by the opposition of subjectivity\nand objectivity, so that, while he no doubt offers us a resolution in\nan abstract sense of the antithesis between conception and reality,\nuniversality and particularity, understanding and sense-perception,\nand suggests the Idea, yet he once more conceives this resolution and\nreconciliation itself in a wholly _subjective_ sense, not as being\ntrue and real both essentially and on its own independent account. In\nthis respect the Critique of the power of the judgment, in which he\ninvestigates the aesthetic and teleological power of the judgment is\nboth instructive and remarkable. The beautiful objects of Nature and\nart, the products of Nature with their adaptations to ends, by means\nof which he approaches more closely the notion of the organic and the\nliving, he considers wholly from the point of view of the reflection\nwhich judges them subjectively. And indeed Kant himself generally\ndefines the power of judgment as \"the capacity to think the particular\nas comprised under the universal,\" and calls the power of judgment\n_reflective_ \"when it has only the particular submitted to it, and has\nto discover the universal under which it is subsumed.\" To this end it\nrequires a law, a principle, which it has to contribute to itself; and\nKant affirms _teleology_ to be this law. With regard to the conception\nof freedom which belongs to the practical reason the achievement of end\nor purpose gets no further than a mere \"ought\"; and in the teleological\njudgment, however, relatively to the living thing, Kant does manage to\nregard the living organism in such a way that the notional concept, the\nuniversal, succeeds in also including the particular, and as end does\nnot determine the particular and external, the structure of the members\nfrom outside, but as an inward principle, and under the mode, that the\nparticular conforms to the end spontaneously. Yet with such a judgment\nonce more it is assumed that the objective nature of the thing is not\nknown, but that it is only a mode of subjective reflection which is\nthereby expressed. In a similar way Kant so conceives the _aesthetic_\njudgment that it neither proceeds from the understanding, as such,\nin other words as the faculty of ideas, nor yet from the sensuous\nperception as such, and its varied manifold, but from the free play of\nthe understanding and the imagination. In this common agreement of the\nfaculties of knowledge the object finds its relation to the individual\nconsciousness, and its feeling of pleasure and contentment.\n(_a_) Now this general feeling of contentment is, in the first place,\nwithout any interest, that is to say, it is _devoid of relation_ to\nour _appetitive faculty._ If we have an interest of curiosity, shall\nwe say, or a sensuous interest excited for a physical want, a desire\nfor possession and use, then the objects are not important for their\nown sake, but in virtue of our need of them. In a case such as this\nwhat exists merely possesses a value in relation to such a need, and\nthe relation is of the kind, that the object is on the one side and on\nthe other is an attribute distinct from the object to which we relate\nit none the less. As an illustration if I consume the object in order\nto nourish myself therewith, this interest rests exclusively in me,\nand remains alien to the object. Now, in Kant's view, our position\nrelatively to the beautiful is not of this description. The aesthetic\njudgment suffers that which is externally presented to subsist in free\nindependence, proceeding as it does from the desire to permit the\nobject to persist on its own account and to retain its end unimpaired\nwithin itself. This is, as we have already observed, an important\nobservation.\n(_b_) In the second place, Kant maintains that the beautiful is\ndefinable as that which without a conception, _i.e._, without a\ncategory of the understanding, is placed before us as the object of a\n_universal_ satisfaction. To estimate the beautiful an educated mind\nis indispensable. The man in the street[112] has no judgment about\nthe beautiful; this judgment, in fact, claims universal validity.\nThe universal is no doubt in the first instance simply, _as such_,\nan abstraction, one which, however, is in its essential and on its\nindependent account, true; and consequently carries essentially the\nproperty and demand to pass also as universally valid. In this sense,\ntoo, the beautiful ought to be universally recognized, although the\nmere concepts of the understanding are compatible with no judgment\nthereupon. The good--the right which enters into particular actions,\nfor example--is subsumed under universal concepts, and the action is\naccepted as good, if it is conformable to such concepts. The beautiful,\non the contrary, ought, according to this view, to arouse a universal\nsatisfaction without any such mediation of concept. This simply means\nthat in the contemplation of the beautiful we are not conscious of the\nnotional concept or any subsumption under it, and do not permit the\nindependent passage of the separation between the particular object\nand the universal concept, which is present in all other cases of the\njudgment.\n(_c_) Thirdly, in this view of Kant, the beautiful ought to have the\n_teleological_ form to the extent that the teleological relation\nis apprehended in the object without the idea of an end. This is\nsubstantially a mere repetition of the view just discussed. Any natural\nproduct--take, for instance, a plant or an animal--is organized as\nadapted to an end, and is so immediately to us in this its teleological\npurpose, that we have no conception of the end on its own account as\nseparate and distinct from the actual presence of the object. It is\nin this way that the beautiful also is presented us teleologically.\nIn finite teleology end and means remain external to each other; the\nend stands in no essential inner relation to the material means of\nits execution[113]. In this case the idea of the end as recognized\nin apartness[114] is distinguishable from the object in which the\nend appears as realized. The beautiful, on the contrary, exists as\nteleological in the essential sense, without means and end appearing\nas disparate in aspects distinct from each other. For example, the\npurpose of the members of the organism is the principle of life which\nexists in the members as actual therein. In their separation[115] the\nparts cease to be members of a whole. For in the living thing the end\nand material medium of the end are so immediately united, that the\nexisting being only exists in so far as the end remains indwelling.\nThe beautiful, as thus regarded and in Kant's view, does not carry\nits teleological purpose as an external form attached to it: but the\nteleological correspondence of the inner and outer is to be regarded as\nthe immanent nature of the beautiful object.\n(_d_) Fourthly and finally the view of Kant posits the beautiful under\nthe mode that it is recognized without a universal concept as object\nof a _necessary_ feeling of satisfaction. Necessity is an abstract\ncategory, and indicates an ideal and essential relation between two\naspects or sides: if the one is, and because the one is, then, and for\nthat reason, the other is also. The one likewise includes the other\nwithin its determinate nature. Cause is meaningless without effect. The\npleasure which we obtain from beauty is necessary in this sense, and\nit is so wholly without a relation to conceptions, that is to say the\ncategories of the understanding. Thus, no doubt, we derive pleasure\nfrom what is symmetrical, for this is constructed in accord with an\nidea of the understanding. Kant, however, demands more as a definition\nof delight in art than the unity and uniformity of such an idea as this.\nNow what we find in all these theses of Kant is the non-severation\nof that which otherwise is assumed to be distinct in consciousness.\nIn the beautiful this separation is found to be abolished. The\nuniversal and particular, purpose and means, idea and object completely\ninterpenetrate each other. Thus, too, Kant sees the beauty of _art_\nas a concurrence, in which the particular itself is conformable to\nthe conception. Particulars, taken alone, are primarily, both as\nagainst each other and the universal, of a contingent nature; and\nthis very contingent element, whether we find it in sense, feeling,\nsusceptibility, or impulse, is now in the beauty of art not merely\n_subsumed_ under the categories of the understanding, and _dominated_\nby the notion of freedom in its abstract universality, but united to\nthe universal in such a way that it appears inwardly and on its own\nmerits as realized fact adequate thereto. By this means thought is\nincorporated in fine art, and the material is not externally defined\nby such thought, but continues to exist in its own freedom. In other\nwords, what is natural--the senses, emotional temperament, and so\nforth--possess in themselves measure, end, and agreement. Perception\nand feeling, too, in the same way are raised to a power of spiritual\nuniversality; and thought no less not merely renounces its hostility to\nNature, but is made blithe therein. Feeling, pleasure, and enjoyment\nare thereby justified and sanctified, and thus it is that Nature and\nfreedom, sense and idea in _one_ presence discover their just place and\ntheir satisfaction. Yet even this apparently complete reconciliation\nis ultimately still assumed to be[116] merely subjective in respect\nto our judgment no less than our productive activity, and not to be\nessentially and on its own account either the true or real.\nThese may, I think, be taken to be the main results of the Critique\nof Kant so far as they affect our present inquiry. It constitutes the\nstarting-point for the true conception of the beauty of art. Such a\nconception could, however, only make itself effective as the higher\ncomprehension of the true union of necessity and freedom, particular\nand universal, sensuous and rational, by its overcoming the defects\nstill latent in the previous standpoint.\nIt must in fact be admitted that the artistic sense of a profound\nand, at the same time, philosophical spirit anticipated philosophy in\nthe stricter sense by its demand for and expression of the principle\nof totality and reconciliation in its opposition to that abstract\nfiniteness of thought, that duty for duty's sake, that understanding\nfaculty devoid of any substantive content, which one and all apprehend\nnature and reality, sense and feeling, merely as a _limits_ something\ndownright alien or hostile. It is Schiller who must be credited with\nthe important service of having broken through the Kantian subjectivity\nand abstractness of thought, and of having ventured the attempt to\npass beyond the same by comprehending in thought the principles of\nunity and reconciliation as the truth, and giving artistic realization\nto that truth. For Schiller, in his aesthetic investigations, did not\nmerely adhere to art and its interest unaffected by their relation\nto philosophy proper, but he compared his own interest in the beauty\nof art in their due relation to philosophical principles; and it is\nonly from the starting-point of these latter and by their aid that\nhe penetrated the profounder nature and notional concept of Beauty.\nThus we are conscious that it was a feature of a certain period of\nhis productive activity that he was actively engaged with reflective\nthought, more perhaps than was wholly favourable to the simple and\ndirect beauty of his work as an art product. The deliberate character\nof abstract reflections, and even the interest of the philosophical\nnotion, arrest the attention in several of his poems. He has, in fact,\nbeen made the subject of stricture on this account; and especially\nhis work has been blamed and depreciated in its contrast with the\nequable serenity and straightforward simplicity of Goethe's ideas\nand more objective naturalism. But in this respect Schiller as poet\ndid but pay the debt of his century. A real ideal evolution[117] was\nresponsible, the recognition of which only redounds to the honour\nof this sublime soul and profound genius, as it has been no less of\nsignal profit to science and knowledge. This stimulating movement of\nscience during the same epoch also diverted Goethe from the sphere,\nmost distinctively his own, as poet. But just as Schiller was absorbed\nin the study of the ideal depths of the _mind_, so the characteristic\npredilection of Goethe inclined to the _physical_ aspect of art, to\nexternal nature, such as animal and vegetable organization, crystals,\ncloud-formation and colours. To such scientific inquiry Goethe applied\nhis extraordinary powers of intuition, which in these provinces have\ndriven off the field the theories of the mere understanding and their\nerrors, just as Schiller, on the other side, succeeded in demonstrating\nthe Idea of the free totality of Beauty as against the theory of the\nanalytical understanding relative to volition and thinking. An entire\nseries of Schiller's productions is devoted to this insight into\nthe nature of art. Above all in importance come the \"Letters upon\naesthetic education.\" In these letters the main point of departure is\nthat every individual man contains within himself the natural capacity\nof an ideal humanity. This genuine human being is represented by the\nState, which, in his view, is the objective, universal, and, in short,\nnormal form, in which the separate individuals or subjects of such\nhuman consciousness aim at making all coalesce and concentrate in\nunity. There were then, in his view, two imaginable ways in which man\nin the temporal process could thus coalesce with the human being in\nthe notional Idea[118]. On the one hand this could be effected in the\nsuppression of individuality by the State under its generic idea of\nmorality, law, and intelligence[119]: while, on the other, a similar\nresult could be effected by the individual himself raising himself to\nthe level of such a generic conception, in other words, by the man of\nthe particular temporal condition ennobling himself to the level of\nthe essential man of the Idea. Now, in this view, reason demands unity\nas such, the generic attribution; Nature, however, asks for variety\nand individuality, and both these legislatures make a simultaneous\nclaim upon man. Confronted with the conflict of these antagonistic\nrivals, aesthetic education simply consists in giving actual effect\nto the demand for their mediation and reconcilement. The aim of\nsuch an education is, according to Schiller, to give vital form to\ninclination, the senses, impulse and emotional life in such a way that\nthey become essentially permeated with mind; and, from the reverse\npoint of view, that reason, freedom, and spirituality come forth from\nthe grave-clothes of their abstractedness, are mated in union with the\nnatural element thus essentially rationalized, and thus receive the\nsubstance of flesh and blood. Beauty is therefore affirmed to be the\nconformative unification[120] of the rational and the sensuous, and\nthis union is pronounced the truly real.\nThis view of Schiller will in its general terms be all the more readily\nrecognized in \"Anmuth und W\u00fcrde[121],\" as also in his poems for the\nreason that the praise of women is in such works more particularly the\ntheme. It was pre-eminently in _their_ character that he recognized and\nemphasized the spontaneously present conjunction of the spiritual and\nnatural.\nThis unity of the universal and particular, of freedom and necessity,\nof spirituality and the natural element, which Schiller conceived\nwith scientific thoroughness as the principle and essence of art, and\nendeavoured indefatigably to call into actual life by means of art\nand aesthetic education, has received yet further recognition in _the\nIdea itself_, cognized as the supreme principle of knowledge and of\nexistence, the Idea in this sense being apprehended as sole truth and\nreality. By means of this acknowledgment science, in the philosophy\nof Schelling, attained its absolute standpoint; and although art had\nalready begun to assert its peculiar rights and dignity in their\nrelation to the highest interests of man, it was only now that the\n_notion_ itself and the scientific position of art were discovered.\nIt was then that art was--even if, from a certain point of view,\nwith a measure of perversity, which this is not the proper place to\ndiscuss--accepted with due reference to its exalted and true vocation.\nEven before this time and independently Winckelmann had been inspired\nby his observation of the ideals of the ancients in a way which\nprompted the creation of a new sense of artistic contemplation, the\ndisengagement of it from the association of vulgar aims and mere\nimitation of Nature, and exercised a mighty influence in the discovery\nof the idea of art in works of art and in its history. Winckelmann\nought, in fact, to be regarded as belonging to the type of men who have\nbeen able in the field of art to supply the mind with a new organ and\nwholly new methods of observation His views have, however, exercised\nless influence on the theory and the scientific knowledge of art.\nTo summarize these historical antecedents further yet more briefly,\nin association with the renaissance of our modern philosophy, A. W.\nand Friedrich von Schlegel, impelled by their zest for novelty and all\nthat was either distinctive or arresting, assimilated just so much\nof the philosophical ideas as was compatible with minds essentially\ncritical, though by no means really philosophical in any strict sense\nof the term. Neither of these writers in fact can claim the reputation\nof being speculative thinkers. They did, however, in virtue of their\ncritical sagacity, at least approach the standpoint of the Idea;\nand with the aid of remarkable boldness of speech and audacity of\ninnovation--to which, however, but very few ingredients of genuine\nphilosophy contributed--directed a brilliant polemic against views\nhitherto received, and by this means unquestionably introduced a novel\nstandard of criticism and new ways of looking at things which were\nof superior value to those they attacked. For the reason, however,\nthat their criticism was not accompanied with a knowledge of the\nnature of such a standard based on philosophical principles, a lack\nof definition and continuity was inseparable from this standard; and\nthey at one time attempted too much and again at another too little.\nDespite, therefore, of the fact that it may be reckoned to their\ncredit that they have once more drawn attention to and emphasized with\ngenuine enthusiasm much hitherto regarded as obsolete and too little\nappreciated by their times, the works of the older Italian masters, for\nexample, and certain Flemish paintings, as also the \"Niebelungen Lied\"\namong other things; despite the fact that they even endeavoured with\nzeal to acquire knowledge of matter barely known at all, such as the\npoetry and mythology of India, nevertheless they not only attached too\nhigh an importance to the works of such a period, but also themselves\ncommitted the mistake of admiring works of very average merit, such\nas the comedies of Holberg, or of attaching an absolute value to what\npossessed a purely relative worth, or even of boldly proving themselves\nthe enthusiasts of a perverse tendency and a subordinate standpoint as\nthough one of first-rate importance.\nFrom this tendency, and particularly from the opinions[122] and\ndoctrines of Friedrich von Schlegel, issued in all its manifold forms\nthe so-called _Irony._ The idea had its profounder root, as to one of\nits aspects, in the philosophy of Fichte, in so far as the principles\nof that philosophy were applied to art. Friedrich von Schlegel, as also\nSchelling, made the standpoint of Fichte their point of departure.\nSchelling passed wholly beyond it; Fried, von Schlegel elaborated it\nin his own peculiar fashion, and then flung himself free of it. With\nreference to the more intimate connection of the doctrines of Fichte\nwith one tendency of this irony, it is only necessary to emphasize\nthe following point in our present context, namely this, that Fichte\nposits the Ego as the absolute principle of all knowledge, reason, and\ncognition, and in fact posits it as the Ego which persists throughout\nin its abstraction of pure form. For this reason this Ego is, in the\nsecond place, wholly and essentially simple, and, on the one hand, it\nis the negation of every particularity, attribute--in short, every\ncontent--for every positive subject-matter[123] is overwhelmed in this\nabstract freedom and unity. On the other hand, every content, which is\nto pass muster for the Ego, is posited and recognized as exclusively so\nin virtue of the activity of the Ego. Whatever is, is only in virtue of\nthe Ego; whatever is through me (that is, my Ego) I am in turn able to\nannihilate.\nNow if we abide in these entirely vacant forms, which originate in the\nabsoluteness of the abstract Ego, nothing can then be regarded as of\nvalue in itself, that is, essentially and on its own account[124]. It\nis exclusively produced by the subjectivity of the Ego. But this being\nso, it follows that the Ego remains lord and master over everything.\nIn no sphere of morals or law, of all that is human or divine, profane\nor sacred, is there anything at all which would not in the first\ninstance have to be posited by the Ego, and which consequently could\nnot equally be nullified by the same agency. This is nothing less than\nmaking all that exists on its own actual and independent warranty a\nmere semblance, not true and a part of reality on account of itself\nand by its own instrumentality, but a mere _show_ in virtue of the\nEgo, within whose power and caprice it remains at the free disposition\nof such. To suffer its presence and to destroy it stands purely in\nthe favour of the Ego, which has attained the absolute standpoint as\nessentially the Ego, that and nothing more than that.\nThirdly, the Ego is a _living_, active individual, and its life\nconsists in bringing home its individuality to itself no less than\nto others, in giving expression to itself and revealing itself among\nphenomena[125]. For every man during his life endeavours to realize\nhimself and does realize himself. In relation to the beautiful and\nart this means that he lives the life of an artist, and shapes his\nlife _artistically._ But, according to the principle now discussed,\nI live as artist when all my action and expression whatever, in so\nfar as it has to do with a content, is for myself on the plane of\nmere _semblance_, and assumes a formal content which is wholly at my\ndisposal. So I am not truly _serious_ either about this content or,\nspeaking generally, about its expression and realization. Genuine\nseriousness only issues from a substantive interest, a subject-matter\nwhich itself possesses a rich content, such as truth, morality, and\nso on--in other words, from a content which as it stands I regard as\nessential, so that I only become essential on my own account, in so\nfar as I have absorbed myself in such a content, and have come to\nconform myself to it in the entire range of my thought and action.\nAt the standpoint at which the artist is the Ego, which both posits\nand resolves everything through its own essential fiat[126], for\nwhich no content of consciousness appears as absolute and essentially\nindependent, but only as itself a semblance created and destroyable,\nsuch seriousness can find no place, nothing here receiving a right to\nbe save the formalism of the Ego.\nNo doubt for others my self-revealment, in which I appear to them,\nmay be taken seriously, inasmuch as they interpret me as though in\nreality I was in earnest about the business; but therein they are\ndeluded, poor, _born\u00e9_ creatures, without the faculty or the power\nto comprehend and attain to the height of my argument. And by this\nit is brought home to me that _everyone_ is not so free (_e.g.,_\nthat is _formally_ free) as to see in all which is usually of value,\ndignity and sanctity to mankind, merely a product of each man's own\npossibilities of inclination, which is operative in permitting him to\ndetermine and make rich the course of his life, or the reverse. It is\nthus that this virtuosity of your ironical artist's life comes to be\ncredited as some _god-like geniality_, for which every conceivable\nthing is a purely spectral creature, to which the free creator, knowing\nhimself to be absolutely unattached, does not yoke himself, for he can\never annihilate the same no less than create it. Whoever has reached\nsuch a standpoint of god-like geniality consequently looks down in his\nsuperior fashion on all other mortals. They are ruled out as narrow\nand dull, in so far, that is, as law, morals, and the rest retain for\nthem a validity that is assured, obligatory, and essential. And the\nindividual who thus lives this artist life, which he does no doubt\nassociate with others, whether friends or mistresses or I know not\nwhat, yet as man of genius sets no real stock on such relations as they\nstand to his individual personality and particular actions. All these\nare as nothing in their contrast to the universal which is his in its\nown and independent warranty, namely that genius which faces all such\nwith irony. This is the universal import of the genial god-like irony\nas this concentration of the Ego in itself, for which all bands are\nbroken, and which can only live in the bliss of self-enjoyment. This\nirony was the discovery of Herr Fried, von Schlegel, and many have\nchattered about it after him, or it may be are giving us a fresh sample\nof such chatter.\nThe proximate form of this negativity which has been called irony is,\nthen, on the one hand, the illusory nature[127] of all that is matter\nof fact, or moral, or of substantive content, the nothingness of all\nthat is objective and of essential and independent worth. So long as\nthe Ego adheres to such, a standpoint as this, everything appears to be\nnull and void, the personal subjectivity alone excepted, which thereby\nbecomes hollow and empty, and nothing but conceit itself. Conversely,\nhowever, from the opposite point of view, the Ego may also fail to\nfind satisfaction in this self-delight; it may prove an insufficient\nsupply to its craving, so that it now feels a thirst for what is secure\nand substantive, definite and essential interests. From a situation\nsuch as this there arises unhappiness and the contradiction, that\nwhereas, on the one hand, the individual seeks to penetrate into truth\nand longs after objectivity, yet on the other he is unable to divest\nhimself of this isolation and self-seclusion, is unable to overcome\nthis unsatisfied and abstract soul-inwardness, and consequently is\nseized with a fit of sentimental yearning, which we have also marked\nas one of the emanations of the philosophy of Fichte. The discontent\nof this quiescence and impotence, which is unable either to act or set\nits hands to anything, lest it have to surrender the harmony within,\nand which remains unreal and empty, even though it may be essentially\nunflecked, despite all its craving for reality and the absolute--is\nthe source of morbid saintliness[128] and yearning. A soul that is\nfair or saintly in a true sense acts and is a reality. But all that\nyearning and heart burning is merely the feeling of the nothingness of\nthe empty and vain personage, who has it, and yet has not the power\nto cast himself adrift of this empty void, and fill himself with that\nwhich is solid and substantive. In so far, however, as the irony is\nmade an art type it did not restrict itself in giving artistic shape\nto the life and particular individuality of the man who appropriated\nthe irony. Over and beyond the artistic content of his own actions,\netc., the artist had also to produce objective works of art as the\ncreations of his imagination. The principle of such productions,\nwhich mainly are confined to the domain of poetry, is once more the\ndisplay of the god-like as Irony. The ironical here, however, as genial\nindividuality, consists in the self-annihilation of what is noble,\ngreat, and excellent. Consequently the independent figures of art\nwill also have to illustrate the principle of absolute subjectivity,\nand to do so by exhibiting all that is of human worth and dignity as\na mere naught in this process of self-annihilation. This implies not\nmerely that we are not to take seriously justice, morality and truth,\nbut that there is really nothing in what is highest and best. In short\nit amounts to this, that irony contradicts and annihilates itself as\nmanifested in individuals, characters and actions, and consequently\nis an irony which overreaches itself[129]. This mode or art-type,\nabstractly considered, approaches closely to the principle of comedy.\nAt the same time we ought fundamentally to distinguish the comic from\nthe ironical as thus associated. For the comic must be limited to the\nmaking null what is essentially itself of no worth, that is to say, a\nfalse and contradictory appearance, a whim, for instance, a piece of\negotism, a particular caprice, as set over against a mighty passion; or\neven some principle, _assumed_ to be efficacious, or rigid maxims may\nbe thus exposed in their nullity. But it is wholly a different matter,\nwhen what is in fact moral and true, generally something with really\nsubstantive core, is asserted in an individual and through the same\nas essentially of no account. Such an individual is then nugatory and\ndespicable in his character, and the weakness and absence of character\nare thus introduced into the representation. In this distinction,\ntherefore, between the ironical and the comic the point of real\nimportance is what is the nature of the _content_ which is destroyed.\nThey are in the case of irony evil, good for nothing subjects, persons\nunable to hold staunchly to their fixed and important purposes, only\ntoo ready to give it up and to permit its destruction within them.\nYour \"Irony\" loves this irony of the characterless. For true character\nimplies on the one hand an essential substance in its purpose, and on\nthe other adherence to such a purpose, so that individuality would be\nrifled of its veritable existence, if it was compelled to let it drop\nand give it up. This doggedness and stability constitutes the keynote\nof character. Cato can only live as Roman and republican. Now if\nirony is made the keynote of the representation, we have the extreme\nantithesis to art accepted as the true principle of the work of art.\nFor what we have here is in part insipid figures, in part figures\nthat have neither content nor defined position[130]. Seeing that what\nis of substance in them is proved to be an illusion. And, last of\nall, we have into the bargain those yearning floods and unresolved\ncontradictions of the soul. Compositions of this kind are not likely\nto arouse real interest. And for this very reason it is precisely from\nthe advocates of this Irony that we have the continuous round of lament\nover the public's want of critical sense, artistic insight and genius,\nwhich of course cannot appreciate the lofty ways of such an Irony; in\nother words what the public does not like is this very mediocrity,\nwhich is the half of it mere trifling[131], and the other half without\ndistinctive character. And it is right that these spectre-like,\nmoon-shine gazing natures are no favourites; it is a comfort to think\nthat this insincerity and hypocrisy is not in fashion, and that what\nmen, on the contrary, demand imperatively are full and veritable\ninterests, and no less so characters which remain true to the weighty\nsubstance at their core. We may add as a matter of historical interest\nthat it was Solger and Ludwig Tieck who above all accepted irony as the\nhighest principle of art.\nThis is not the place to speak of Solger at the length he really\nmerits; and I must content myself with a few general remarks. Solger\nwas not, as the others were, satisfied with a superficial philosophical\nculture. A truly speculative impulse of his innermost nature made him\nprobe the very depths of the philosophical idea. And in doing so he\ncame upon the dialectical phase of the Idea, that transition point\nwhich I call the infinite absolute negativity, the activity of the\nidea in its negation of itself as infinite and universal, in order to\npass into finiteness and particularity, and with no less truth once\nmore in order to annul this negation, and in so doing to establish\nagain the universal and infinite within the finite and particular.\nSolger did not get beyond this negativity; and unquestionably it is a\n_phase_[132] in the speculative idea; but nevertheless, as exclusively\nconceived in this dialectic unrest and dissolution of the infinite\nno less than the finite, it is _only_ such a phase contributory, and\nnot, as Solger imagined, the _Entire Idea._ Unfortunately Solger's\nlife was too early broken off to permit him to grasp the concrete\nevolvement of the philosophical Idea in all it implies. And so he never\ngot beyond this aspect of negativity, which possesses an affinity\nwith the dissolution by irony of all that is determinate no less than\nessentially substantive, a negative movement which he identified with\nthe principle of artistic activity. Yet in the actual conditions of\nhis life, and with due reference to the stability, seriousness, and\nsterling qualities of his character, he was neither himself an ironic\nartist in the sense we have previously described, nor was his really\nprofound instinct for true works of art, a sense which a long course\nof study of art had developed greatly, either of such an ironical\ncharacter. So much we will venture in the vindication of Solger, whose\nlife, philosophy, and actual contributions to art merit being wholly\nkept separate from the apostles of irony previously named.\nWith regard to Ludwig Tieck, his culture, too, dates from that period\nin which Jena was the literary centre. Tieck and others who belonged\nto these superior people are on excellent terms with such modes of\nexpression, without being able to tell us much what they mean. Thus\nTieck always insists on the importance of Irony. But when it comes\nto delivering judgment on great works of art, though his recognition\nand description of their greatness is no doubt beyond reproach, yet\nif one imagines that in any particular example--let us say \"Romeo and\nJuliet\"--we have the opportunity put for an explanation of that in\nwhich here the irony consists, we are wide of the mark. We hear nothing\nmore whatever about Irony.\nV[133]\n1. After the above introductory observations we may now pass on to the\nconsideration of our subject itself. We are, however, still within the\nintroduction; and being so I do not propose to attempt anything more\nthan indicate by way of sketch the main outlines of the general course\nof the scientific inquiry which is to follow it. Inasmuch, however,\nas we have referred to art as issuing from the absolute Idea itself,\nand, indeed, have assigned as its end the sensuous presentation of the\nAbsolute itself, it will be incumbent on us to conduct this survey of\nthe entire field in such a way, as at least to disclose generally, how\nthe particular parts originate in the notional concept of the beauty of\nart. We must therefore attempt to awaken some idea of this notion in\nits broadest significance.\nIt has already been stated that the content of art is the Idea, and the\nform of its display the configuration of the sensuous or plastic image.\nIt is further the function of art to mediate these two aspects under\nthe reconciled mode of free totality. The _first_ determinant implied\nby this is the demand that the content, which has to secure artistic\nrepresentation, shall disclose an essential capacity for such display.\nIf this is not so all that we possess is a defective combination.\nA content that, independently, is ill adapted to plastic form and\nexternal presentment is compelled to accept this form, or a matter that\nis of itself prosaic in its character is driven to make the best it can\nof a mode of presentation which is antagonistic to its nature.\nThe _second_ requirement, which is deducible from the first, is the\ndemand that the content of art should be nothing essentially abstracts\nThis does not mean, however, that it should be merely concrete in\nthe sense that the sensuous object is such in its contrast to all\nthat is spiritual and the content of thought, regarding these as the\nessentially simple and abstract. Everything that possesses truth for\nSpirit; no less than, as part of Nature, is essentially concrete,\nand, despite its universality, possesses both ideality[134] and\nparticularity essentially within it. When we state, for example, of\nGod that he is simple One, the Supreme Being as such, we have thereby\nmerely given utterance to a lifeless abstraction of the irrational\nunderstanding. Such a God, as He is thus not conceived in His concrete\ntruth, can supply no content for art, least of all plastic art.\nConsequently neither the Jews nor the Turks have been able to represent\ntheir God, who is not even an abstraction of the understanding in\nthe above sense, under the positive mode in which Christians have\nrepresented Him. For in Christianity God is conceived in His Truth, and\nas such essentially concrete, as personality[135], as the subjective\nfocus of conscious life, or, more accurately defined, as Spirit. And\nwhat He is as Spirit is made explicit to the religious apprehension\nas a trinity of persons, which at the same time are, in their\nindependence, regarded as One. Here is essentiality, universality, and\nparticularity, no less than their reconciled unity, and it is only\na unity such as this which gives us the concrete. And inasmuch as a\ncontent, in order to unveil truth at all, must be of this concrete\ncharacter, art makes the demand for a like concreteness, and, for this\nreason, that a purely abstract universal does not in itself possess the\nproperty to proceed to particularity and external manifestation, and to\nunity with itself therein.\nIf, then, a sensuous form and configuration is to be correspondent\nwith a true and therefore concrete content, such must in the third\nplace likewise be as clearly individual, entirely concrete and a\nself-enclosed unity. This character of concreteness, predicable of\nboth aspects of art, the content no less than the representation, is\njust the point in which both coalesce and fall in with one another.\nThe natural form of the human body is, for example, such a sensuous\nconcrete capable of displaying Spirit in its essential concreteness and\nof adapting itself wholly to such a presentment. For which reason we\nmust quit ourselves of the idea that it is a matter of mere accident\nthat an actual phenomenon of the objective world is accepted as the\nmode in which to embody such a form coalescent with truth. Art does\nnot lay hold of this form either because it is simply there or because\nthere is no other. The concrete content itself implies the presence\nof external and actual, we may even add the sensuous appearance. But\nto make this possible this sensuous concrete, which is essentially\nimpressed with a content that is open to mind, is also essentially\naddressed to the inward conscious life, and the external mode of its\nconfiguration, whereby it is visible to perception and the world of\nidea, has for its aim the being there exclusively for the soul and mind\nof man. This is the sole reason that content and artistic conformation\nare dovetailed one into the other. The _purely_ sensuous concrete, that\nis external Nature as such, does not exclusively originate in such an\nend. The variously coloured plumage of birds is resplendent unseen; the\nnotes of this song are unheard. The Cereus[136], which only blossoms\nfor a night, withers away without any admiration from another in the\nwilderness of the southern forests; and these forests, receptacles\nthemselves of the most beautiful and luxuriant vegetation, with the\nrichest and most aromatic perfumes, perish and collapse in like manner\nunenjoyed. The work of art has no such na\u00efve and independent being. It\nis essentially a question, an address to the responding soul of man, an\nappeal to affections and intelligence.\nAlthough the endowment by art of sensuous shape is not in this\nrespect accidental, yet on the other hand it is not the highest mode\nof grasping the spiritually concrete. Thought is a higher mode of\npresentment than that of the sensuous concrete. Though abstract in a\nrelative sense; yet it must not be one-sided, but concrete thinking, in\norder to be true and rational. The extent to which a definite content\npossesses for its appropriate form sensuous artistic representation,\nor essentially requires, in virtue of its nature, a higher and more\nspiritual embodiment is a question of difference exemplified at once\nif we compare the Greek gods with God as conceived under Christian\nideas. The Greek god is not abstract, but individual, and is in close\nassociation with the natural human form. The Christian God is also, no\ndoubt, a concrete personality, but under the mode of pure spiritual\nactuality, who is cognized as Spirit and in Spirit[137]. His medium of\ndeterminate existence is therefore essentially knowledge of the mind\nand not external natural shape, by means of which His representation\ncan only be imperfect, and not in the entire depths of His idea or\nnotional concept.\nInasmuch, however, as it is the function of art to represent the Idea\nto immediate vision in sensuous shape and not in the form of thought\nand pure spirituality in the strict sense, and inasmuch as the value\nand intrinsic worth of this presentment consists in the correspondence\nand unity of the two aspects, that is the Idea and its sensuous shape,\nthe supreme level and excellence of art and the reality, which is truly\nconsonant with its notion, will depend upon the degree of intimacy and\nunion with which idea and configuration appear together in elaborated\nfusion. The higher truth consequently is spiritual content which has\nreceived the shape adequate to the conception of its essence; and this\nit is which supplies the principle of division for the philosophy of\nart. For before the mind can attain to the true notion of its absolute\nessence, it is constrained to traverse a series of stages rooted in\nthis very notional concept; and to this course of stages which it\nunfolds to itself, corresponds a coalescent series, immediately related\ntherewith, of the plastic types of art, under the configuration whereof\nmind as art-spirit presents to itself the consciousness of itself[138].\nThis evolution within the art-spirit has further itself two sides\nin virtue of its intrinsic nature. _First_, that is to say, the\ndevelopment is itself a spiritual and universal one; in other words\nthere are the definite and comprehensive views of the world[139] in\ntheir series of gradations which give artistic embodiment to the\nspecific but widely embracing consciousness of Nature, man, and God.\n_Secondly_, this ideal or _universal_ art-development has to provide\nfor itself immediate existence and sensuous configuration, and the\ndefinite modes of this art-actualization in the sensuous medium are\nthemselves a totality of necessary distinctions in the realm of\nart--that is to say, they are the _particular types_ of art. No doubt\nthe types of artistic configuration on the one hand are, in respect to\ntheir spirituality, of a general character, and not restricted to any\none material, and the sensuous existence is similarly itself of varied\nmultiplicity of medium. Inasmuch, however, as this material potentially\npossesses, precisely as the mind or spirit does, the Idea for its\ninward soul or significance, it follows that a definite sensuous\ninvolves with itself a closer relation and secret bond of association\nwith the spiritual-distinctions and specific types of artistic\nembodiment[140].\nRelatively to these points of view our philosophy will divided into\nthree fundamental parts.\n_First_, we have a _general_ part. It has for its content object the\nuniversal Idea of fine art, conceived here as the Ideal, together with\nthe more elaborated relation under which it is placed respectively to\nNature and human artistic production.\n_Secondly_, we have evolved from the notional concept of the beauty of\nart a _particular_ part, in so far as the essential distinctions, which\nthis idea contains in itself, are unfolded in a graduated series of\n_particular_ modes of configuration[141].\n_Thirdly_, there results a _final_ part which has to consider the\nparticularized content of fine art itself. It consists in the advance\nof art to the sensuous realization of its shapes and its consummation\nin a system of the several arts and their genera and species.\n2. In respect to the first and second of these divisions it is\nimportant to recollect, in order to make all that follows intelligible,\nthat the Idea, viewed as the beautiful in art, is not the Idea in the\nstrict sense, that is as a metaphysical Logic apprehends it as the\nAbsolute. It is rather the Idea as carried into concrete form in the\ndirection of express realization, and as having entered into immediate\nand adequate unity with such reality. For the _Idea as such_, although\nit is both potentially and explicitly true, is only truth in its\nuniversality and not as yet presented in objective embodiment. The Idea\nas fine art, however, is the Idea with the more specific property of\nbeing essentially individual reality, in other words, an individual\nconfiguration of reality whose express function it is to make manifest\nthe Idea--in its appearance. This amounts to the demand that the Idea\nand its formative configuration as concrete realization must be brought\ntogether under a mode of complete adequacy. The Idea as so conceived,\na reality, that is to-say, moulded in conformity with the notional\nconcept of the Idea, is the Ideal. The problem of such consonancy\nmight, in the first instance, be understood in the wholly formal sense\nthat the Idea might be any idea so long as the actual shape, it matters\nnot what the shape might be, represented this particular Idea and no\nother. In that case, however, the required truth of the Ideal is a\nfact simply interchangeable with mere correctness, a correctness which\nconsists in the expression of any significance in a manner adapted to\nit, provided that its meaning is thereby directly discoverable in the\nform. The Ideal, however, is not to be thus understood. According to\nthe standard or test of its own nature any content whatever can receive\nadequate presentation, but it does not necessarily thereby possess a\nclaim to be the fine art of the Ideal. Nay, more, in comparison with\nideal beauty the presentation will even appear defective. And in this\nconnection we may once for all observe--though actual proof is reserved\nto a later stage--that the defects of a work of art are not invariably\nto be attributed to defects of executive skill. _Defectiveness of form_\narises also from _defectiveness of content_. The Chinese, Hindoos, and\nEgyptians, for example, in their artistic images, sculptured deities\nand idols, never passed beyond a formless condition, or a definition\nof shape that was vicious and false, and were unable to master true\nbeauty. And this was so for the reason that their mythological\nconceptions, the content and thought of their works of art, were still\nessentially indeterminate, or only determinate in a false sense, did\nnot, in fact, attain to a content which was absolute in itself. Viewed\nin this sense the excellence of works of art is so much the greater\nin the degree that their content and thought is ideal and profound.\nAnd in affirming this we have not merely in our mind the degree of\nexecutive mastery displayed in the grasp and imitation of natural\nform as we find it in the objective world. For in certain stages of\nthe artistic consciousness and its reproductive effects the desertion\nand distortion of the conformations of Nature is not so much due to\nunintentional technical inexperience or lack of ability, as it is to\ndeliberate alteration, which originates in the mental content itself,\nand is demanded by the same. From this point of view there is therefore\nimperfect art, which, both in technical and other respects, may be\nquite consummate in its _own specific sphere_, yet if tested with the\ntrue notion of art and the Ideal can only appear as defective. Only\nin the highest art are the Idea and the artistic presentation truly\nconsonant with one another in the sense that the objective embodiment\nof the Idea is in itself essentially and as realized the true\nconfiguration, because the content of the Idea thus expressed is itself\nin truth the genuine content. It is appertinent to this, as already\nnoted, that the Idea must be defined in and through itself as concrete\ntotality, thereby essentially possessing in itself the principle and\nstandard of its particularization and definition as thus manifested\nobjectively. For example, the Christian imagination will only be able\nto represent God in human form and with man's means of spiritual\nexpression, because it is herein that God Himself is fully known in\nHimself as mind or Spirit. Determinacy is, as it were, the bridge to\nphenomenal presence. Where this determinacy is not totality derived\nfrom the Idea itself, where the Idea is not conceived as that which\nis self-definitive and self-differentiating, it remains abstract and\npossesses its definition, and with it the principle for the particular\nmode of embodiment adapted to itself not within itself but as something\noutside it. And owing to this the Idea is also still abstract and the\nconfiguration it assumes is not as yet posited by itself. The Idea,\nhowever, which is essentially concrete, carries the principle of its\nmanifestation in itself, and is thereby the means of its own free\nmanifestation. Thus it is only the truly concrete Idea that is able to\nevoke the true embodiment, and this appropriate coalescence of both is\nthe Ideal.\n3. But inasmuch as in this way the Idea is concrete unity, this unity\ncan only enter the artistic consciousness by the expansion and further\nmediation of the particular aspects of the Idea; and it is through this\nevolution that the beauty of art receives a _totality of particular\nstages and forms._ Therefore, after we have considered fine art in its\nessence and on its own account, we must see how the beautiful in its\nentirety breaks up into its particular determinations. This gives, as\nour second part, the _doctrine of the types of art._ The origin of\nthese types is to be found in the varied ways under which the Idea is\nconceived as the content of art; it is by this means that a distinction\nin the mode of form under which it manifests itself is conditioned.\nThese types are therefore simply the different modes of relation which\nobtain between the Idea and its configuration, relations which emanate\nfrom the Idea itself, and thereby present us with the general basis of\ndivision for this sphere. For the principle of division must always be\nfound in the notional concept, the particularization and division of\nwhich it is.\nWe have here to consider _three_ relations of the Idea to its external\nprocess of configuration.\n(_a_) _First_, the origin of artistic creation proceeds from the\nIdea when, being itself still involved in defective definition and\nobscurity, or in vicious and untrue determinacy, it becomes embodied\nin the shapes of art. As indeterminate it does not as yet possess\nin itself that individuality which the Ideal demands. Its abstract\ncharacter and one-sidedness leaves its objective presentment still\ndefective and contingent. Consequently this first type of art is rather\na mere search after plastic configuration than a power of genuine\nrepresentation. The Idea has not as yet found the formative principle\nwithin itself, and therefore still continues to be the mere effort and\nstrain to find it. We may in general terms describe this form as the\n_symbolic_ type of art. The abstract Idea possesses in it its external\nshape outside itself in the purely material substance of Nature, from\nwhich the shaping process proceeds, and to which in its expression\nit is entirely yoked. Natural objects are thus in the first instance\nleft just as they are, while, at the same time the substantive Idea\nis imposed upon them as their significance, so that their function\nis henceforth to express the same, and they claim to be interpreted,\nas though the Idea itself was present in them. A rationale of this\nis to be found in the fact that the external objects of reality do\nessentially possess an aspect in which they are qualified to express\na universal import. But as a completely adequate coalescence is not\nyet possible, all that can be the outcome of such a relation is an\n_abstract attribute_, as when a lion is understood to symbolize\nstrength.\nOn the other hand this abstractness of the relation makes present\nto consciousness no less markedly how the Idea stands relatively to\nnatural phenomena as an alien; and albeit it expatiates in all these\nshapes, having no other means of expression among all that is real, and\nseeks after itself in their unrest and defects of genuine proportion,\nyet for all that it finds them inadequate to meet its needs. It\nconsequently exaggerates natural shapes and the phenomena of Nature in\nevery degree of indefinite and limitless extension; it flounders about\nin them like a drunkard, and seethes and ferments, doing violence to\ntheir truth with the distorted growth of unnatural shapes, and strives\nvainly by the contrast, hugeness, and splendour of the forms accepted\nto exalt the phenomena to the plane of the Idea. For the Idea is here\nstill more or less indeterminate, and unadaptable, while the objects of\nNature are wholly definite in their shape.\nHence, on account of the incompatibility of the two sides of ideality\nand objective form to one another, the relation of the Idea to the\nother becomes a _negative_ one. The former, being in its nature ideal,\nis unsatisfied with such an embodiment, and posits itself as its inward\nor ideally universal substance under a relation of _sublimity_ over and\nabove all this inadequate superfluity of natural form. In virtue of\nthis sublimity the natural phenomena, of course, and the human form and\nevent are accepted and left simply as they are, but at the same time,\nrecognized as unequal to their significance, which is exalted far above\nall earthly content.\nThese features constitute in general terms the character of the\nprimitive artistic pantheism of the East, which, on the one hand,\ncharges the meanest objects with the significance of the absolute\nIdea, or, on the other, compels natural form, by doing violence to its\nstructure, to express its world-ideas. And, in consequence, it becomes\nbizarre, grotesque, and deficient in taste, or turns the infinite but\nabstract freedom of the substantive Idea contemptuously against all\nphenomenal existence as alike nugatory and evanescent. By such means\nthe significance cannot be completely presented in the expression, and\ndespite all straining and endeavour the final inadequacy of plastic\nconfiguration to Idea remains insuperable. Such may be accepted as the\nfirst type of art--symbolic art with its yearning, its fermentation,\nits mystery, and sublimity.\n(_b_) In the _second_ type of art, which we propose to call\n\"_Classical_,\" the twofold defect of symbolic art is annulled. Now\nthe symbolic configuration is imperfect, because, first, the Idea\nhere only enters into consciousness in _abstract_ determinacy or\nindeterminateness: and, secondly, by reason of the fact that the\ncoalescence of import with embodiment can only throughout remain\ndefective, and in its turn also wholly abstract. The classical art-type\nsolves both these difficulties. It is, in fact, the free and adequate\nembodiment of the Idea in the shape which, according to its notional\nconcept, is uniquely appropriate to the Idea itself. The Idea is\nconsequently able to unite in free and completely assonant concord with\nit. For this reason the classical type of art is the first to present\nus with the creation and vision of the complete Ideal, and to establish\nthe same as realized fact.\nThe conformability, however, of notion and reality in the classical\ntype ought not to be taken in the purely _formal_ sense of the\ncoalescence of a content with its external form, any more than this was\npossible in the case of the Ideal. Otherwise every copy from Nature,\nand every kind of portrait, every landscape, flower, scene, and so\nforth, which form the aim of the presentment, would at once become\nclassical in virtue of the fact of the agreement it offers between such\ncontent and form. In classical art, on the contrary, the characteristic\nfeature of the content consists in this, that it is itself concrete\nIdea, and as such the concrete spiritual; for it is only that which\npertains to Spirit which is veritable ideality[142]. To secure such a\ncontent we must find out that in Nature which on its own account is\nthat which is essentially and explicitly appropriate to the spiritual.\nIt must be the _original_ notion itself[143], which has invented the\nform for concrete spirituality, and now the _subjective_ notion--in\nthe present case the spirit of art--has merely _discovered_ it, and\nmade it, as an existence possessed of natural shape, concordant with\nfree and individual spirituality. Such a configuration, which the\nIdea essentially possesses as spiritual, and indeed as individually\ndeterminate spirituality, when it must perforce appear as a temporal\nphenomenon, is the _human form._ Personification and anthropomorphism\nhave frequently been abused as a degradation of the spiritual. But\nart, in so far as its function is to bring to vision the spiritual\nin sensuous guise, must advance to such anthropomorphism, inasmuch\nas Spirit is only adequately presented to perception in its bodily\npresence. The transmigration of souls in this respect an abstract\nconception[144], and physiology ought to make it one of its fundamental\nprinciples, that life has necessarily, in the course of its evolution,\nto proceed to the human form, for the reason that it is alone the\nvisible phenomenon adequate to the expression of intelligence.\nThe human bodily form, then, is employed in the classical type of art\nnot as purely sensuous existence, but exclusively as the existence and\nnatural shape appropriate to mind. It has therefore to be relieved\nof all the defective excrescences which adhere to it in its purely\nphysical aspect, and from the contingent finiteness of its phenomenal\nappearance. The external shape must in this way be purified in order\nto express in itself the content adequate for such a purpose; and,\nfurthermore, along with this, that the coalescence of import and\nembodiment may be complete, the spirituality which constitutes the\ncontent must be of such a character that it is completely able to\nexpress itself in the natural form of man, without projecting beyond\nthe limits of such expression within the sensuous and purely physical\nsphere of existence. Under such a condition Spirit is at the same\ntime defined as particular, the spirit or mind of man, not as simply\nabsolute and eternal. In this latter case it is only capable of\nasserting and expressing itself as intellectual being[145].\nOut of this latter distinction arises, in its turn, the defect which\nbrings about the dissolution of the classical type of art, and makes\nthe demand for a third and higher form, namely the _romantic_ type.\n(_c_) The romantic type of art annuls the completed union of the Idea\nand its reality, and occurs, if on a higher plane, to the difference\nand opposition of both sides, which remained unovercome in symbolic\nart. The classical type of art no doubt attained the highest excellence\nof which the sensuous embodiment of art is capable. The defect, such\nas it is, is due to the defect which obtains in art itself throughout,\nthe limitations of its entire province, that is to say. The limitation\nconsists in this, that art in general and, agreeably to its fundamental\nidea, accepts for its object Spirit, the notion of which is infinite\nconcrete universality, under the guise of sensuously concrete form. In\nthe classical type it sets up the perfected coalescence of spiritual\nand sensuous existence as adequate conformation of both. As a matter of\nfact, however, in this fusion mind itself is not represented agreeably\nto its _true notional concept._ Mind is the infinite subjectivity of\nthe Idea, which as absolute inwardness[146], is not capable of freely\nexpanding in its entire independence, so long as it remains within the\nmould of the bodily shape, fused therein as in the existence wholly\ncongenial to it.\nTo escape from such a condition the romantic type of art once more\ncancels that inseparable unity of the classical type, by securing\na content which passes beyond the classical stage and its mode\nof expression. This content, if we may recall familiar ideas--is\ncoincident with what Christianity affirms to be true of God as Spirit,\nin contrast to the Greek faith in gods which forms the essential and\nmost fitting content of classical art. In Greek art the concrete ideal\nsubstance is potentially, but not as fully realized, the unity of the\nhuman and divine nature; a unity which for the very reason that it\nis purely _immediate_ and not wholly explicit, is manifested without\ndefect under an immediate and _sensuous_ mode. The Greek god is the\nobject of na\u00efve intuition and sensuous imagination. His shape is\ntherefore the bodily form of man. The sphere of his power and his being\nis individual and individually limited; and in his opposition to the\nindividual person[147] is an essence and a power with whom the inward\nlife of soul[148] is merely potentially in unity, but does not itself\npossess this unity as inward subjective knowledge. The higher stage\nis the _knowledge_ of this _implied_ unity, which in its latency the\nclassical art-type receives as its content and is able to perfectly\nrepresent in bodily shape. This elevation of mere potentiality into\nself-conscious knowledge constitutes an enormous difference. It is\nnothing less than the infinite difference which, for example, separates\nman generally from the animal creation. Man is animal; but even in\nhis animal functions he is not restricted within the potential sphere\nas the animal is, but becomes conscious of them, learns to understand\nthem, and raises them--as, for instance, the process of digestion--into\nself-conscious science. By this means man dissolves the boundaries of\nhis merely potential immediacy; in virtue of the very fact that he\nknows himself to be animal he ceases to be merely animal, and as mind\nis endowed with self-knowledge.\nIf, then, in this way the unity of the human and divine nature,\nwhich in the previous stage was potential, is raised out of this\nimmediate into a self-conscious unity, it follows that the genuine\nmedium for the reality of this content is no longer the sensuous\nand immediate existence of what is spiritual, that is, the physical\nbody of man, but the _self-aware_ inner life of _soul itself._ Now\nit is Christianity--for the reason that it presents to mind God as\n_Spirit_, and not as the particular individual spirit, but as absolute\nin spirit and in truth--which steps back from the sensuousness of\nimagination into the inward life of reason, and makes _this_ rather\nthan _bodily_ form the medium and determinate existence of its content.\nSo also, the unity of the human and divine nature is a conscious unity\nexclusively capable of realization by means of _spiritual_ knowledge,\nand in _Spirit._ The new content secured thereby is consequently not\nindefeasibly bound up with the sensuous presentation, as the mode\ncompletely adequate, but is rather delivered from this immediate\nexistence, which has to be hypostatized as a negative factor, overcome\nand reflected back into the spiritual unity. In this way romantic art\nmust be regarded as art transcending itself, albeit within the boundary\nof its own province, and in the form of art itself.\nWe may therefore briefly summarize our conclusion that in this third\nstage the object of art consists in the free and concrete presence\nof spiritual activity[149], whose vocation it is to appear as such a\npresence or activity for the inner world of conscious intelligence. In\nconsonance with such an object art cannot merely work for sensuous\nperception. It must deliver itself to the inward life, which coalesces\nwith its object simply as though this were none other than itself[150],\nin other words, to the intimacy of soul, to the heart, the emotional\nlife, which as the medium of Spirit itself essentially strives after\nfreedom, and seeks and possesses its reconciliation only in the inner\nchamber of spirit. It is this inward or ideal world which constitutes\nthe content of the romantic sphere: it will therefore necessarily\ndiscover its representation as such inner idea or feeling, and in the\nshow or appearance of the same. The world of the soul and intelligence\ncelebrates its triumph over the external world, and, actually in the\nmedium of that outer world, makes that victory to appear, by reason of\nwhich the sensuous appearance sinks into worthlessness.\nOn the other hand, this type of art, like every other, needs an\nexternal vehicle of expression. As already stated, the spiritual\ncontent has here withdrawn from the external world and its immediate\nunity into its own world. The sensuous externality of form is\nconsequently accepted and represented, as in the symbolic type, as\nunessential and transient; furthermore the subjective finite spirit\nand volition is treated in a similar way; a treatment which even\nincludes the idiosyncrasies or caprice of individuals, character,\naction, or the particular features of incident and plot. The aspect\nof external existence is committed to contingency and handed over to\nthe adventurous action of imagination, whose caprice is just as able\nto reflect the facts given _as_ they are[151], as it can change the\nshapes of the external world into a medley of its own invention and\ndistort them to mere caricature. For this external element has no\nlonger its notion and significance in its own essential province, as in\nclassical art. It is now discovered in the emotional realm, and this\nis manifested in the medium of that realm itself rather than in the\nexternal and _its_ form of reality, and is able to secure or to recover\nagain the condition of reconciliation with itself in every accident,\nin all the chance circumstance that falls into independent shape, in\nall misfortune and sorrow, nay, in crime itself.\nHence it comes about that the characteristics of symbolic art, its\nindifference, incompatibility and severance of Idea from configurative\nexpression, are here reproduced once more, if with essential\ndifference. And this difference consists in the fact that in romantic\nart the Idea, whose defectiveness, in the case of the symbol, brought\nwith it the defect of external form, has to display itself as Spirit\nand in the medium of soul-life as essentially self-complete. And it\nis to complete fundamentally this higher perfection that it withdraws\nitself from the external element, It can, in short, seek and consummate\nits true reality and manifestation nowhere but in its own domain.\nThis we may take to be in general terms the character of the symbolic,\nclassical, and romantic types of art, which in fact constitute\nthe three relations of the Idea to its embodiment in the realm of\nhuman art. They consist in the aspiration after, the attainment and\ntranscendency of the Ideal, viewed as the true concrete notion of\nbeauty.\n4. In contrast to these two previous divisions of our subject the\n_third_ part presupposes the notional concept of the Ideal, and the\nuniversal art-types. It in other words consists in their realization\nthrough specific sensuous media. We have consequently no longer to deal\nwith the inner or ideal evolution of the beauty of art in conformity\nwith its widest and most fundamental determinations. What we have\nnow before us to consider is how these ideal determinants pass into\nactual existence, how they are distinguishable in their external\naspect, and how they give an independent and a realized shape to every\nelement implied in the evolution of this Idea of beauty as _a work of\nart_, and not merely as a _universal type._ Now it is the peculiar\ndifferences immanent in the Idea of beauty which are carried over by\nit into external existence. For this reason in this third fundamental\ndivision these general art-types must themselves supply the basic\nprinciple for the articulation and definition of the _particular\narts._ Or, to put the same thing another way, the several species\nof art possess in themselves the same essential differences, which\nwe have already become acquainted with as the universal art-types.\n_External_ objectivity, however, to which these types are subjected\nin a sensuous and consequently _specific_ material, necessitates the\ndifferentiation of these types into diverse and independent modes of\nrealization, in other words, those of particular arts. Each general\ntype discovers its determinate character in one determinate external\nmaterial or medium, in which its adequate presentation is secured\nunder the manner it prescribes. But, from another point of view, these\ntypes of art, inasmuch as their definition is none the less consistent\nwith the fact of the _universality_ of their typical import, break\nthrough the boundaries of their _specific_ realization in some definite\nart-species, and achieve an existence in other arts no less, although\ntheir position in such is of subordinate importance. For this reason,\nalbeit the particular arts belong specifically to one of these general\nart-types respectively, the _adequate_ external embodiment whereof\nthey severally constitute, yet this does not prevent them, each after\nits own mode of external configuration, from representing the totality\nof these art-types[152]. To summarize, then, in this third principal\ndivision we are dealing with the beauty of art, as it unveils itself in\na world of realized beauty by means of the arts and their creations.\nThe content of this world is the beautiful, and the true beautiful,\nas we have seen, is spiritual being in concrete form, the Ideal; or\napprehended with still more intimacy it is the absolute mind and truth\nitself. This region of divine truth artistically presented to sensuous\nvision and emotion forms the centre of the entire world of art. It\nis the independent, free and divine Image[153], which has completely\nappropriated the externality of form and medium, and now wears them\nsimply as the means of its self-manifestation. Inasmuch, however, as\nthe beautiful is unfolded here as _objective_ reality, and in this\nprocess is differentiated into particular aspects and phases, this\ncentre posits its extremes, as realized in their peculiar actuality, in\nantithetical relation to itself. Thus one of these extremes consists\nof an objectivity as yet devoid of mind, which we may call the natural\nenvironment of God. Here the external element, when it receives form,\nremains as it was, and does not possess its spiritual aim and content\nin itself, but in another[154]. The other extreme is the divine as\ninward, something known, as the manifold particularized _subjective_\nexistence of Deity. It is the truth as operative and vital in sense,\nsoul, and intelligence of particular persons, which does not persist\nas poured forth into its mould of external shape, but returns into the\ninward life of individuals. The Divine is under such a mode at once\ndistinguishable from its pure manifestation as Godhead, and passes\nitself thereby into the variety of particularization which belongs to\nevery kind of particular subjective knowledge, feeling, perception,\nand emotion. In the analogous province of religion with which art, at\nits highest elevation, is immediately connected, we conceive the same\ndistinction as follows. First, we imagine the natural life on Earth in\nits finitude as standing on one side; but then, secondly, the human\nconsciousness accepts God for its object, in which the distinction\nbetween objectivity and subjectivity falls away; then, finally, we\nadvance from God as such to the devotion of the _community_, that is to\nGod as He is alive and present in the subjective consciousness. These\nthree fundamental modifications present themselves in the world of art\nin independent evolution.\n(_a_) The _first_ of the particular arts with which, according to their\nfundamental principle, we have to start is architecture considered\nas a fine art. Its function consists in so elaborating the external\nmaterial of inorganic Nature that the same becomes intimately connected\nwith Spirit as an artistic and external environment. Its medium is\nmatter itself as an external object, a heavy mass that is subject\nto mechanical laws; and its forms persist as the forms of inorganic\nNature co-ordinated with the relations of the abstract understanding\nsuch as symmetry and so forth. In this material and in these forms the\nIdeal is incapable of realization as concrete spirituality, and the\nreality thus presented remains confronting the Idea as an external\nfabric with which it enters into no fusion, or has only entered so\nfar as to establish an abstract relation. And it is in consequence\nof this that the fundamental type of the art of building is that of\n_symbolism._ Architecture is in fact the first pioneer on the highway\ntoward the adequate realization of Godhead. In this service it is put\nto severe labour with objective nature, that it may disengage it by\nits effort from the confused growth of finitude and the distortions of\ncontingency. By this means it levels a space for the God, informs His\nexternal environment, and builds Him His temple, as a fit place for\nthe concentration of Spirit, and its direction to the absolute objects\nof intelligent life. It raises an enclosure for the congregation of\nthose assembled, as a defence against the threatening of the tempest,\nagainst rain, the hurricane, and savage animals. It in short reveals\nthe will thus to assemble, and although under an external relation, yet\nin agreement with the principles of art. A significance such as this it\ncan to a greater or less extent import into its material and its forms,\nin proportion as the determinate content of its fabric, which is the\nobject of its operations and effort, is more or less significant, is\nmore concrete or more abstract, more profound in penetrating its own\nessential depth, or more obscure and superficial. Indeed architecture\nmay in this respect proceed so far in the execution of such a purpose\nas to create an adequate artistic existence for such an ideal content\nin its very forms and material. In doing so, however, it has already\npassed beyond its peculiar province and is diverted into the stage\nimmediately above it of sculpture. For the boundary of sculpture\nlies precisely, in this that it retains the spiritual as an inward\nbeing which persists in direct contrast to the external embodiment\nof architecture. It can consequently merely point to that which is\nabsorbed in soul-life as to something external to itself.\n(_b_) Nevertheless, as above explained, the external and inorganic\nworld is purified by architecture, it is co-ordinated under symmetrical\nlaws, and made cognate with mind, and as a result the temple of God,\nthe house of his community, stands before us. Into this temple, in\nthe _second_ place, the God himself enters in the lightning-flash of\nindividuality which smites its way into the inert mass, permeating the\nsame with its presence. In other words the infinite[155] and no longer\npurely symmetrical form belonging to intelligence brings as it were\nto a focus and informs the shape in which it is most at home. This is\nthe task of _sculpture._ In so far as in it the inward life of Spirit,\nto which the art of architecture can merely point away to, makes its\ndwelling within the sensuous shape and its external material, and\nto the extent that these two sides come into plastic communion with\none another in such a manner that neither is predominant, sculpture\nreceives as its fundamental type the _classical_ art-form.\nFor this reason the sensuous element on its own account admits of no\nexpression here which is not affected by spiritual affinities[156],\njust as, conversely, sculpture can reproduce with completeness no\nspiritual content, which does not maintain throughout adequate\npresentation to perception in bodily form. What sculpture, in\nshort, has to do is to make the presence of Spirit stand before us\nin its bodily shape and in immediate union therewith at rest and\nin blessedness; and this form has to be made vital by means of the\ncontent of spiritual individuality. The external sensuous material\nis consequently no longer elaborated either in conformity with its\nmechanical quality alone, as a mass of weight, nor in shapes of the\ninorganic world simply, nor in entire indifference to colour, etc. It\nis carried into the ideal forms of the human figure, and, we may add,\nin the completeness of all three spatial dimensions. In other words and\nrelatively to such a process we must maintain for sculpture that in\nit the inward or ideal content of Spirit are first revealed in their\neternal repose and essential self-stability. To such repose and unity\nwith itself there can only correspond that external shape which itself\npersists in such unity and repose. And this condition is satisfied by\nconfiguration viewed in its _abstract spatiality._[157] The spirit\nwhich sculpture represents is that which is essentially sound, not\nbroken up in the play of chance conceits and passions; and for this\nreason its external form also is not dissolved in the manifold variety\nof appearance, but exhibits itself under this one presentment only as\nthe abstraction of space in the totality of its dimensions.\nAssuming, then, that the art of architecture has executed its temple,\nand the hand of sculpture has placed therein the image of the god, we\nhave in the _third_ place to assume the _community_ of the faithful\nas confronting the god thus presented to vision in the wide chambers\nof his dwelling-place. Now this community is the spiritual reflection\ninto its own world of that sensuous presence, the subjective and inward\nanimating life of soul, in its union with which, both for the artistic\ncontent and the external material which manifests it, the determining\nprinciple may be identified with particularization in varied shapes\nand qualities, individualization and the life of soul[158] which they\nimply. The downright and solid fact of unity the god possesses in\nsculpture breaks up into the multiplicity of a world of particular\nsouls[159], whose union is no longer sensuous but wholly ideal.\nHere for the first time God Himself is revealed as veritably\nSpirit--viz., the Spirit revealed in His community. Here at last He\nis seen apprehended as this moving to-and-fro, as this alternation\nbetween His own essential unity and His realization in the knowledge\nof individual persons and that separation which it involves, as also\nin the universal spiritual, being[160] and union of the many. In such\na community God is disengaged from the abstraction of His unfolded\nself-seclusion and self-identity, no less than from the immediate\nabsorption in bodily shape, in which He is presented by sculpture. He\nis, in a word, lifted into the actual sphere of spiritual existence\nand knowledge, into the reflected appearance, whose manifestation\nis essentially inward and the life of heart and soul. Thereby the\nhigher content is now the nature of Spirit, and that in its ultimate\nor absolute shape. But at the same time the separation to which\nwe have alluded displays this as _particular_ spiritual being, a\nspecific emotional life. Moreover, for the reason that the main\nthing here is not the untroubled repose of the God in himself[161],\nbut his manifestation simply, the Being which is _for another_,\nself-revealment in fact, it follows that, on the plane we have now\nreached, all the varied content of human subjectivity in its vital\nmovement and activity, whether viewed as passion, action, or event,\nor more generally the wide realm of human feeling, volition and its\ndiscontinuance, become one and all for their own sake objects of\nartistic representation.\nAgreeably with such a content the sensuous element of art has likewise\nto show itself potentially adapted to such particularization and the\ndisplay of such an inward content of heart and mind. Media of this\ndescription are supplied by colour, musical tones, and finally in sound\nas mere sign for ideal perceptions and conceptions; and we further\nobtain the means of realizing with the use of such media a content\nof this kind in the arts of painting, music, and poetry. Throughout\nthis sphere the sensuous medium is found to be essentially disparate\nin itself and throughout posited[162] as ideal. In this way it\nresponds in the highest degree to the fundamentally spiritual content\nof art, and the coalescence of spiritual significance and sensuous\nmaterial attains a more intimate union than was possible either in\narchitecture or sculpture. At the same time such a union is necessarily\nmore near to soul-life, leaning exclusively to the subjective side\nof human experience; one which, in so far as form and content are\nthus constrained to particularization and to posit their result as\nideal, can only be actually effected at the expense of the objective\nuniversality of the content as also of the fusion with the immediately\nsensuous medium[163].\nThe arts, then, which are lifted into a higher strain of ideality,\nabandoning as they do the symbolism of architecture and the classical\nIdeal of sculpture, accept their predominant type from the _romantic_\nart-form; and these are the arts most fitted to express its mode of\nconfiguration. They are, however, a totality of arts, because the\nromantic type is itself essentially the most concrete.\n(_c_) The articulation of this _third sphere_ of the particular arts\nmay be fixed as follows:\n(_\u03b1_) The _first_ art which comes next to sculpture is that of\npainting. It avails itself for a medium of its content and the plastic\nconfiguration of the same of visibility as such, to the extent that\nit is differentiated in its own nature, in other words is defined in\nthe continuity of colour. No doubt the material of architecture and\nsculpture is likewise both visible and coloured. It is, however, not,\nas in painting, visibility in its pure nature, not the essentially\nsimple light, which by its differentiating of itself in its opposition\nto darkness, and in association with that darkness gives rise to\ncolour[164]. This quality of visibility made essentially ideal[165]\nand treated as such no longer either requires, as in architecture, the\nabstractly mechanical qualities of mass as appropriate to materials of\nweight, nor, as is the case with sculpture, the complete dimensuration\nof spatial condition, even when concentrated into organic forms. The\nvisibility and the making apparent, which belong to painting, possess\ndifferences of quality under a more ideal mode--that is, in the\nspecific varieties of colour--which liberates art from the objective\ntotality of spatial condition, by being limited to a plane surface.\nOn the other hand the content also attains the widest compass of\nparticularity. Whatever can find a place in the human heart, as\nemotion, idea, and purpose, whatever it is capable of actually\nshaping--all such diversity may form part of the varied presentations\nof painting. The entire world of particular existence, from the most\nexalted embodiment of mind to the most insignificant natural fact,\nfinds a place here. For it is possible even for finite Nature, in its\nparticular scenes and phenomena, to form part of such artistic display,\nprovided only that we have some reference to conscious life which makes\nit akin to human thought and emotion[166].\n(_\u03b2_) The _second_ art which continues the further realization of the\nromantic type and forms a distinct contrast to painting is that of\n_music._ Its medium, albeit still sensuous, yet proceeds into still\nprofounder subjectivity and particularization. We have here, too, the\ndeliberate treatment of the sensuous medium as ideal, and it consists\nin the negation and idealization into the isolated unity of a single\npoint[167], the indifferent external collocation of space[168], whose\ncomplete appearance is retained by painting and deliberately feigned\nin its completeness. This isolated point, viewed as this process of\nnegation, is an essentially concrete and active process of cancellation\nwithin the determinate substance of the material medium, viewed, that\nis, as motion and vibration of the material object within itself and in\nits relation to itself. Such an inchoate ideality of matter, which no\nlonger appears under the form of space, but as temporal ideality[169],\nis sound or tone. We have here the sensuous set down as negated, and\nits abstract visibility converted into audibility. In other words sound\nliberates the ideal content from its fetters in the material substance.\nThis earliest[170] secured inwardness of matter and impregnation of\nit with soul-life supplies the medium for the intimacy and soul of\nSpirit--itself as yet indefinite--permitting, as it does, the echo\nand reverberation of man's emotional world through its entire range\nof feelings and passions. In this way music forms the centre of the\nromantic arts, just as sculpture represents the midway point of arrest\nbetween architecture and the arts of the romantic subjectivity. Thus,\ntoo, it forms the point of transition between the abstract, spatial\nsensuousness of painting and the abstract spirituality of poetry.\nMusic carries within itself, like architecture, and in contrast to the\nemotional world simply and its inward self-seclusion, a relation of\nquantity conformable to the principles of the understanding and their\nmodes of co-ordinated configuration[171].\n(_\u03b3_) We must look for our _third_ and most spiritual type of artistic\npresentation among the romantic arts in that of _poetry._ The supreme\ncharacteristic of poetry consists in the power with which it brings\ninto vassalage of the mind and its conceptions the sensuous element\nfrom which music and painting began to liberate art. For sound, the\nonly remaining external material retained by poetry, is in it no\nlonger the feeling of the sonorous itself, but is a mere sign without\nindependent significance. And it is, moreover, a sign of idea which has\nbecome essentially concrete, and not merely[172] of indefinite feeling\nand its subtle modes and gradations. And this is how sound develops\ninto the Word, as essentially articulate voice, whose intention it is\nto indicate ideas and thoughts. The purely negative moment to which\nmusic advanced now asserts itself as the wholly concrete point, the\npoint which is mind itself, the self-conscious individual, which\nproduces from itself the infinite expansion of its ideas and unites\nthe same with the temporal condition of sound. Yet this sensuous\nelement, which was still in music immediately united to emotion, is in\npoetry separated from the content of consciousness. Mind, in short,\nhere determines this content for its own sake and apart from all else\ninto the content of idea; to express such idea it no doubt avails\nitself of sound, but employs it merely as a sign without independent\nworth or substance. Thus viewed, the sound here may be just as well\nreproduced by the mere letter, for the audible, like the visible, is\nhere reduced to a mere indication of mind[173]. For this reason, the\ntrue medium of poetical representation is the poetical imagination and\nthe intellectual presentation itself; and inasmuch as this element\nis common to all types of art it follows that poetry is a common\nthread through them all, and is developed independently in each.\nPoetry is, in short, the universal art of the mind, which has become\nessentially free, and which is not fettered in its realization to an\nexternally sensuous material, but which is creatively active in the\nspace, and time belonging to the inner world of ideas and emotion. Yet\nit is precisely in this its highest phase, that art terminates, by\ntranscending itself; it is just here that it deserts the medium of a\nharmonious presentation of mind in sensuous shape and passes from the\npoetry of imaginative idea into the prose of thought.\nSuch we may accept as the articulate totality of the particular\narts; they are the external art of architecture, the objective art\nof sculpture and the subjective arts of painting, music, and poetry.\nMany other classifications than these have been attempted, for a work\nof art presents such a wealth of aspects, that it is quite possible,\nas has frequently been the case, to make first one and then another\nthe basis of division. For instance, you may take the sensuous medium\nsimply. Architecture may then be viewed as a kind of crystallization;\nsculpture, as the organic configuration of material in its sensuous\nand spatial totality; painting as the coloured surface and line, while\nin music, space, as such, passes over into the point or moment of\ntime replete with content in itself, until we come finally to poetry,\nwhere the external medium is wholly suppressed into insignificance.\nOr, again, these differences have been viewed with reference to their\npurely abstract conditions of space and time. Such abstract divisions\nof works of art may, as their medium also may be consequentially traced\nin their characteristic features. They cannot, however, be worked out\nas the final and fundamental principle, because such aspects themselves\nderive their origins from a higher principle, and must therefore fall\ninto subordination thereto.\nThis higher principle we have discovered in the types of art--symbolic,\nclassical, and romantic--which are the universal stages or phases of\nthe Idea of beauty itself.\nTheir relation to the individual arts in their concrete manifestation\nas embodiment is of a kind that these arts constitute the real and\npositive existence of these general art-types. For _symbolic_ art\nattains its most adequate realization and most pertinent application\nin _architecture_, in which it expatiates in the full import of its\nnotion, and is not as yet depreciated, as it were, into the merely\ninorganic nature dealt with by some other art. The _classical_ type of\nart finds its unfettered realization, on the other hand, in sculpture,\ntreating architecture merely as the enclosure which surrounds it,\nand being unable to elaborate painting and music into the wholly\nadequate[174] forms of its content. Finally, the _romantic_ art-type\nis supreme in the products of painting and music, and likewise in\npoetical composition, as their preeminent and unconditionally adequate\nmodes of expression. Poetry is, however, conformable to all types of\nthe beautiful, and its embrace reaches them all for the reason that\nthe poetic imagination is its own proper medium, and imagination is\nessential to every creation of beauty, whatever its type may be.\nTo sum up, then, what the particular arts realize in particular works\nof art, are according to their fundamental conception, simply the\nuniversal types which constitute the self-unfolding Idea of beauty.\nIt is as the external realization of this Idea that the wide Pantheon\nof art is being raised; and the architect and builder thereof is the\nspirit of beauty as it gradually comes to self-cognition, and to\ncomplete which the history of the world will require its evolution of\ncenturies.\n[Footnote 1: The introduction begins as an introduction of lectures.\nBut as the work is merely based to a large extent on notes for\nlectures, or on a manuscript which did not preserve the lectures as\nthey were delivered, it will be found most convenient to ignore this\nfact, and in references to regard it simply as a written treatise.]\n[Footnote 2: Hegel, alluding no doubt to the words of the Gospel, puts\nit \"born and born again from mind (spirit).\"]\n[Footnote 3: It is assumed that such a fancy is seized and defined as\nsuch in separation from other experience.]\n[Footnote 4: The sentence is slightly ironical.]\n[Footnote 5: _Dem Scheine._]\n[Footnote 6: _Raisonnements_: a disparaging expression.]\n[Footnote 7: Hegel here means the formal character, not the material on\nwhich it is imposed in the several arts.]\n[Footnote 8: Hegel says, \"as that which has no right to be,\" _das\nNichtseyn sollende._]\n[Footnote 9: _Erscheine_ as contrasted with _scheine._]\n[Footnote 10: _Das An-und-F\u00fcrsichseyende._ That which is explicitly to\nitself self-determinate being, no less than essentially such in its\nsubstantive right.]\n[Footnote 11: _Besonnener Art._ Possibly Hegel means \"one more\ncompatible with common sense.\"]\n[Footnote 12: I think by the words _kunst wieder hervorzurufen_ Hegel\nrather means to call up art as it was previously cultivated than merely\nto \"stimulate art production.\" The latter is, however, Professor\nBosanquet's translation.]\n[Footnote 13: _Subjective_ apparently in the sense of being wholly\npersonal to the writer or philosopher in so far as the form of his\ntreatise deals in classification and arrangement peculiar to himself\nand so _external_, if not entirely arbitrary.]\n[Footnote 14: I agree with the note of Professor Bosanquet (Trans., p.\n21) that the word _element_ refers here to the mental constituents of\nart, as contrasted with the sensuous medium.]\n[Footnote 15: That is to say, the essential formative process involved\nin its necessity.]\n[Footnote 16: There must be a misprint or oversight in Professor\nBosanquet's rendering of this passage (p. 21). As the sentence now\nstands it does not appear to me to make sense.]\n[Footnote 17: _Von ihm._ The pronoun, I take it, must refer here to\n_das Andere_ rather than the subject of the verb.]\n[Footnote 18: \"Makes itself an alien to itself\" perhaps expresses the\nGerman better.]\n[Footnote 19: That is, the work of art.]\n[Footnote 20: _Haltpunkte._ Points of arrest in essential ideas\nnecessary which restrain this tendency to purely arbitrary caprice.]\n[Footnote 21: I do not think the first part of this sentence ironical.\nHegel admits that a general knowledge is a legitimate feature of modern\nculture. But he points out that people are only too ready to confuse\nsuch a general knowledge with real art scholarship. To bring out this I\nhave translated rather freely.]\n[Footnote 22: Detail of historical fact and artistic observation.]\n[Footnote 23: It is historical, first, regarded as a survey of\nhistorical condition, and, secondly, because facts are collected\nwhether in relation to ancient or modern art as a historian collects\nhis facts.]\n[Footnote 24: Lit., the inmost or most ideal (meaning).]\n[Footnote 25: _Vollkommen._ Complete or rather completely articulate\nand rounded in itself. It is not easy to select the English word that\nexactly corresponds.]\n[Footnote 26: _Bestimmte Individualit\u00e4t._ The definition may, as Hegel\nsays, be more significant, but it is for all that not very clearly\nexpressed. Professor Bosanquet translates the words \"determinate\nindividual modification.\"]\n[Footnote 27: My view is that what Hegel means to say is that in\ncaricature ugliness is emphasized and made more (_n\u00e4her_) a part of\nthe content than belongs to the true nature of the characteristic of\nwhich it is (in Hegel's opinion) no essential determinant or property.\nThe view stated in the sentence is therefore a kind of _reductio ad\nabsurdum._ Professor Bosanquet's translation appears to me to leave it\ndoubtful whether the view stated is a just one or not. He translates\n_n\u00e4her_ by \"closely,\" not the comparative. In my view Hegel agrees\nthat caricature may be characteristic, but he does not agree that it\nis a genuine property of the characteristic where it is pressed to the\nexcess of ugliness.]\n[Footnote 28: _Bestimmung._]\n[Footnote 29: That is, in Hegel's view.]\n[Footnote 30: _Das Wahre_.]\n[Footnote 31: _Den denkenden Begriff._ It is possible that the \"notion\nof thought\" would express Hegel's meaning, as it would be a less\nstrange expression. But I have retained the more literal translation\nas the reference may be to the self-evolution of Thought in its own\ndialectical process, thought or the Idea thinking out itself in the\nHegelian sense. Professor Bosanquet seems to assume this, as he\ntranslates \"the thinking Idea.\"]\n[Footnote 32: _Kunstsch\u00f6nen._ I have translated this by the expression\n\"fine art\" because Hegel in the opening of the introduction makes the\nexpression interchangeable with _sch\u00f6ne kunst._ At the same time it\nmust be recollected that the emphasis here is even more on \"beauty\"\nthan the fact that it is the beauty of human art. And it is for\nthis reason, I presume, that Professor Bosanquet translates it here\n\"artistic beauty.\" The only objection I have to make to this, apart\nfrom Hegel's words I have referred to, is that the expression \"artistic\nbeauty\" is sometimes used to signify beauty that is capable of being\nexpressed by art. Of course that is excluded from Hegel's use of the\nterm; he means the beauty of artistic work.]\n[Footnote 33: _Subjektiven._]\n[Footnote 34: Independent, that is, of the consciousness of any\nparticular individual. Hegel does not necessarily mean independent of\nconsciousness altogether. He has, no doubt, generally in his mind the\nkind of scepticism which received its most logical exposition in Hume.]\n[Footnote 35: This appears to me the meaning of _zuf\u00e4lliger Sinn._\nProfessor Bosanquet translates it \"accidental sense.\" By that I presume\nhe understands the meaning to be \"a sense of beauty that is entirely\npersonal to the recipient,\" it may be possessed by one man, but not by\nanother. Hegel's illustration hardly supports this, so it seems to me.]\n[Footnote 36: I do not know the exact translation of _lemmatisch_, and\nby a curious slip the sentence is omitted from Professor Bosanquet's\ntranslation. The general sense is plain enough. Every particular\nscience accepts its subject-matter as a _datum_. It starts from the\nempirical fact. Whether it admits the assumption or not, it does assume\nsuch facts. It is obvious that Hegel's adoption of this standpoint is\nonly relatively true.]\n[Footnote 37: Hegel means, I presume, mainly in the introduction.\nAfter that he does in a qualified degree discuss the profounder import\nof the Idea of Fine Art. His statements are not perhaps wholly free\nfrom inconsistency, because he has previously said that apart from an\nencyclopaedic consideration of all the sciences, it was not possible to\ndo so, and also some of His statements seem to imply that he does not\nintend to do so.]\n[Footnote 38: That is, in the first Part of the entire treatise.]\n[Footnote 39: What Hegel means by the _die letzte einleitende\nBetrachtung_ I am not quite sure. I presume he means the introduction\nto the first Part. The whole of this paragraph is not very clear.]\n[Footnote 40: By man's sensitive life in its widest sense is, I think,\nintended.]\n[Footnote 41: The German words are _machen_ and _nachmachen._ We have\nno exact equivalents.]\n[Footnote 42: _Lit._, \"to fill out (_ausf\u00fcllen_) in complete\nequipment.\"]\n[Footnote 43: _Individuelle._]\n[Footnote 44: The German will admit of the interpretation that the\nreference is merely to genius, but I think Hegel clearly means that\nneither one nor the other can be thus conjured up.]\n[Footnote 45: At the end of the first main division of the work.]\n[Footnote 46: One of Meredith's correspondents has put the question\nwith all gravity whether he considered inspiration could be assisted\nby wine drinking. With equal gravity our humourist replied that though\nwine might be something of a restorative after mental effort it was\nnot his experience that it contributed to first-rate artistic work. He\nactually mentions the case of Schiller. Though I have read somewhere\nthat this poet used to be inspired by the smell of rotten apples I do\nnot recollect reading that he favoured the champagne bottle. Meredith\nalso mentions the case of Hoffmann, and adds that the type of his work\ndoes not increase our respect for the precedent.]\n[Footnote 47: _Eine \u00e4usserliche Arbeit._ A craftsmanship which\nhas to deal with the outside surface. We may translate \"external\ncraftsmanship\"; but the translation in the text gives the meaning best,\nI think.]\n[Footnote 48: _Keinen geistigen Stoff._ Professor Bosanquet translates\n\"spiritual content.\" I imagine the emphasis to be mainly on the absence\nof positive ideas available to knowledge. In any case Hegel appears\nto press his point of contrast too far. Men of genius such as Mozart\n(who was probably in his mind) and Schubert may bear him out. But on\nthe other hand we have a Keats, Shelley, and Raphael. Genius matures\nrapidly, but the greatest works of musical art no less than any other\nimply a real maturity of mind at least, and more than is here assumed\nof, I should say, a rich experience. Mozart, of course, upsets any\ntheory, and it is questionable even whether Mozart is really an\nexception. It depends on the point of view from which we are estimating\nthe intelligible content of music as an expression of soul-life.]\n[Footnote 49: The \"Iphigenie\" was completed in Goethe's thirty-eighth\nyear, fourteen years later than \"G\u00f6tz.\" The bulk of his more important\nworks are of the same date or later. Schiller's \"Wallenstein\" was\ncompleted after his thirty-fifth year.]\n[Footnote 50: This is surely not quite accurate. The medium of painting\nin the sense that speech or writing is the medium of poetry is not\ncanvas or panel but oil or other colour. Canvas would correspond with\nthe blank pages of a book.]\n[Footnote 51: Free, that is, from accidental and irrelevant matter.]\n[Footnote 52: Professor Bosanquet translates _sinnliche_ here as\n\"sensitive.\" I am inclined to think that Hegel here rather leaves out\nof sight the fact that in the process of Nature we have sensitive\norganic life no less than unconscious inorganic. His contrast is rather\nbetween the conscious life of man and unconscious nature, the conscious\nlife that is not self-conscious being for the object of the contrast\ntreated as equivalent to unconscious. He would also apparently ignore\nthe fact that man himself and the higher beauty which attaches to him\nis also from ope point of view a part of the natural process.]\n[Footnote 53: That is, apart from purely personal ends in its pursuit,\nwhich are accidental to its essential notion.]\n[Footnote 54: That is, in the medium of conscious life.]\n[Footnote 55: _Einmal._ They are there, but they do not know they are\nthere.]\n[Footnote 56: _Aus geistiger Bildung, i.e._, a high level of mental\nculture is necessary before the advent of civilized manners and\ncustoms in which spiritual life is reflected with real refinement and\ndirectness.]\n[Footnote 57: _Bed\u00fcrfniss zur Kunst._]\n[Footnote 58: _Lit._, \"In the form of the most abstract single\nsubjectivity.\" That is to say, that the main fact about it is that it\nis felt; but, except in respect to intensity, it cannot be described\nas an object of thought with defining attributes, It is abstract\nindividual sensation.]\n[Footnote 59: By the expression _Kreis_ Hegel would mean rather an\nindefinite sphere than a definite circle. The simile is perhaps not\nvery apt. The idea, apparently, is of a sphere of feeling, that is,\nsuch as being self-complete, but is so abstract or indefinable that the\nintroduction into it of positive ideas such as justice, etc., are the\nmere entrance of spectral forms which vanish in such an indefinable\nmedium, without disclosing their nature. They are felt but not cognized\nfor what they really are.]\n[Footnote 60: _Blinder_, blind in the sense that it is not guided by\ndeliberate and self-conscious reason, _i.e._, mere animal instinct.]\n[Footnote 61: A difficult sentence to translate. I have followed\nProfessor Bosanquet in assuming that the substantive with which\n_mangelhaft_ agrees must be borrowed from the following sentence,\nthough it seems also to be carried on in a loose kind of way from the\nprevious sentence (_Gesckmacksinn._) The entire sentence is built,\nas we have it, on the further confusion that there are two parallels\nwhich before the sentence ends are regarded as one! That is to say, the\ngeneral critical sense is contrasted with the critique of particular\nworks of art and further the defect of that general sense in its\nneglect of _universal_ principles is further contrasted with the way\nthe specific critique deals with _particular_ works. I hardly think,\nhowever, that my admirable predecessor is justified in ignoring the\ncomparative degree of _bestimmteres_, or in his translation of _Zeug_\nas \"power.\" I take it to mean the material of actual works of art.\nThe sentence is a good example of, some of the difficulties of Hegel\ntranslation.]\n[Footnote 62: _Die Sache._ The subject-matter in its most real sense as\n\"content.\"]\n[Footnote 63: That is, the so-called \"good taste.\"]\n[Footnote 64: _Begriff._ Concrete notional Idea.]\n[Footnote 65: That is, in his physical form.]\n[Footnote 66: Hegel is here considering desire abstractedly, that\nis, on its own account (_als solche._) It may of course in its turn\nsubserve a rational purpose, such as the preservation of health or\nlife. But the contrast here is between the relation of appetite, and\nthat of the theoretic faculty to objects.]\n[Footnote 67: _Sein Objekt._ The object in which he finds himself;\nrather this, I think, than that which he has created.]\n[Footnote 68: _Innerlich_, _i.e._, in the world of mind as contrasted\nwith that of the sensuous _vorhandene._]\n[Footnote 69: Hegel or his editors have \"in a converse way.\" This is\nobviously a mistake. In both examples the point is that the object\nis _preserved_ as against _desire_ with its destruction, and the\n_contemplative intelligence_ with its ideal transformation.]\n[Footnote 70: _Ein ideelles._ The meaning is, I think, that the\n_materia_ is stamped with the hall-mark of deliberate artistic purpose.\nThe ideality, though relatively jejune on such a work as the pyramids,\nin the higher reaches of art such as poetry and music affects of course\nthe medium itself, the musical chord being pure ideality. Professor\nBosanquet's translation omits this and the previous sentence, probably\nby an oversight. But it is also possible that this thinker conceived\nthe statement _as here expressed_ to be misleading, or at least open to\nmisconception. In architecture and even painting it is obvious, from\na certain point of view, the sensuous _materia_, if directed to an\nartistic end, remains none the less the material borrowed from natural\nfact though the fact as natural may be modified in its form. Painting\nmay _represent_ the semblance, but it employs a medium simply sensuous.\nHegel has mainly before his attention here obviously the arts of\npainting, poetry, and music.]\n[Footnote 71: They are _theoretical_ because as applied to a work of\nart they imply the presence of the contemplative faculty. In a later\nsection of the work Hegel makes a more complete analysis of what is\nimplied in the sense of hearing as applied to musical composition and\nin the colour sense. In both cases it is obvious the mind contributes\nto the facts cognized. Hearing is, however, from Hegel's point of view\nthe most _ideal_ of the two, and he conceives the position of the ears\nitself points to this distinction.]\n[Footnote 72: It may at least be questioned whether the ground given\nhere of this distinction, or part of it, is strictly accurate. It may\nbe said that our sense of sight and hearing are both in contact with\nthe waves of the medium, the vibration of which produces the impression\nwe call sound or light. The most obvious distinction then appears to be\nthat the natural object is left as it is by hearing and sight. This at\nleast holds good as against taste. But at least it may be questioned,\nI think, whether the sense of touch may not be the source of artistic\nenjoyment, certainly in the case of the blind. And the sense of smell\nat least leaves objects as they are, and some may contend that it is\na source of enjoyment of the beauty of Nature. Hegel would reply, of\ncourse, that no works of human art are enjoyed by such means. The main\nground is, however, that sight and hearing are the senses closest to\nintelligence.]\n[Footnote 73: By _Anschauungen_ Hegel apparently has in mind all the\nideas of poetry. We should certainly rather have expected the word\n_Vorstellungen_, the word used being rather \"visible perceptions.\" But\nthe three words here seem generally to denote the subject-matter of\npainting, music, and poetry.]\n[Footnote 74: Lit., \"Operative in the artist viewed (_i.e._, the\nartist) as the personal energy (_Subjektivit\u00e4t_) which creates.\"\nProfessor Bosanquet's translation \"as a productive state of the person\"\nwould appear to make \"the sensuous side\" a subjective state of the\nartist. But apart from construction, can we speak of this as a \"state\"?\nIt is modified by his energy--but it can hardly be regarded as a part\nof it.]\n[Footnote 75: I find it impossible to fix any one English equivalent\nto Hegel's use of the words _Einbildungskraft_, _Phantasie_, or\n_Vorstellung_, in the sense at least that fancy, imagination, or\nphantasy have been used and defined by famous English writers.\nGenerally speaking, I should say that _Phantasie_, or as it is called\nsometimes \"artistic\" or \"creative\" _Phantasie_, stands for the most\nintellectual faculty, though _Vorstellung_ is also used in much the\nsame sense. But it is impossible to arrive at any clear distinction\nsuch as was originally made so profoundly by Ruskin between fancy, the\ninstrument of poetical talent, the surface gift, and imagination or,\nas he called it, _penetrative_ imagination, which summarizes all the\npowers of a genius and personality and enters into the heart of the\nsubject-matter by an illuminating flash which _reveals_ reality rather\nthan illustrates by means of image. The present passage appears to me\neven more unsatisfactory than the more carefully digested analysis\nat the end of Part I, when Hegel discusses the artist. It not merely\nignores the indispensable presence of imagination in the pioneers\nof science, but appears to myself to confuse talent as the natural\ngift of a man with the mode in which it is exercised in presenting\nideas in sensuous imagery, or at least makes the former depend on the\nlatter. Professor Bosanquet translates _Phantasie_ here by \"fancy.\"\nBut \"fancy\" is, in our way of looking at it, precisely not the faculty\nwhich _distinctively_ belongs to \"the great mind and the big heart or\nsoul,\" though other parts of the description are more applicable. And\nin short, as I say, to fix definite English equivalents to Hegel's\nphraseology appears to me impossible.]\n[Footnote 76: _Die Phantasie_.]\n[Footnote 77: This is, I presume, Hegel's way of putting the simple\nfact, that much of the process of artistic production is unconscious.\nOne man instinctively draws, or picks up his notes on the piano,\nanother cannot. I think Hegel rather refers to this _original_ talent\nthan the much more important one in which genius, right into maturity,\nrides over difficulties without knowing how it does so. Such happy\nor even miraculous effects--such as artists sometimes playfully call\nthem--are obviously in part, if only in part, the result of profound\nartistic experience. He is dealing almost exclusively with the natural\nbias, which makes one man naturally an artist, whether creative or\nexecutant, and is absent from another. He hardly approaches the\nquestion what constitutes the artist of genius as contrasted with the\nman of natural talent.]\n[Footnote 78: This confirms the conclusion above.]\n[Footnote 79: _F\u00fcr sich._ If merely admired as imitation and nothing\nmore.]\n[Footnote 80: _Zur Ekelhaftigkeit._ \"Sickeningly like\" is Professor\nBosanquet's closer translation. The expression \"damnably like\" is not\nunknown.]\n[Footnote 81: I think with Professor Bosanquet that _phantastischen_\nis here not \"fantastic\" but strictly derived from _Phantasie_ in its\nsense of imagination. \"Completely,\" of course, as involving no direct\nimitation of Nature.]\n[Footnote 82: Formal, _i.e._, implying no creative supplement from the\nartist, purely mechanical.]\n[Footnote 83: It would be both instructive and interesting to discuss\nif, and how far, and by virtue of what, that distinct type of modern\nart known as \"still life,\" such as a few objects of the library, or\neven a shell or two and so on up to more important organic life was\nexcluded from this condemnation. It is quite clear that Ruskin would\nhave a good deal to say that would imply important qualification.]\n[Footnote 84: _Begeisterung._ I think this must be the meaning.\nInspiration hardly makes sense. It is art that is inspired, not those\nwho attend the celebration.]\n[Footnote 85: _Im Innersten_ is I think here obviously to be taken with\nthe verb, not with the substantives.]\n[Footnote 86: _Ueberhaupt._]\n[Footnote 87: The meaning of _in diesem Gebiete_ is, I presume, the\nactual world. But if so it is simply otiose, and I have left it out.]\n[Footnote 88: _Bestimmung._ The translation given appears to be the\nsense, though we should rather say weaken a _man_ from the pursuit of a\ndefinite course. Professor Bosanquet, who translates the word \"aim\" a\nlittle lower down, evades the word here.]\n[Footnote 89: _Raisonnirende_ here and _raissonnement_ below have\na depreciatory sense--and signify ordinary reasoning in the first\ninstance and the methods of the popular secularist in the second.]\n[Footnote 90: A sentence omitted by Professor Bosanquet, and it seems\nto amount to little more than a more generalized statement of what has\ngone before. The end of art both directly and indirectly concerns its\nsubject-matter, or rather, as Hegel puts it, the need of the notion or\nIdea of it carries us to a further end beyond the end shared in common\nby its particular content.]\n[Footnote 91: I follow Professor Bosanquet in his translation of the\nwords _als Allgemeines f\u00fcr sich zu zuerden_; but I am not sure that the\nmore literal translation is not simply as the words stand, the sense\nbeing not to be self-conscious of himself (_f\u00fcr sich_) as the universal\nprinciple, to be aware of this property, but rather as universal\nprinciple to become _for_ himself, _i.e._ \"independent of desire.\"]\n[Footnote 92: _Einheit_--unity to the point of fusion, identity.]\n[Footnote 93: _Unmittelbaren Befangenheit._ \"Sunkenness\" is Professor\nBosanquet's translation.]\n[Footnote 94: _Theoretic_ as a direct transcript of _\u03b8\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1, \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd._]\n[Footnote 95: _Gesichtspunkte._ The various points of view necessary to\narrive at such a general conclusion.]\n[Footnote 96: Though not entirely confident I am right in accepting\nthe words _zu bringen_ as a repetition of the _hervorzubringen_\njust before, the alternative of Professor Bosanquet which takes the\nwords _wird zu bringen seyn_ as equivalent to _gebracht seyn sollte_\ncertainly appears to me no direct translation.]\n[Footnote 97: \"Poets aim at utility and entertainment alike.\"]\n[Footnote 98: I think that Hegel in his use of _erste_ here rather\nrefers to the fact of past history than a fact in the individual\nhistory of nations. \"Art is, in the early days of history, the\ninstructress of nations,\" gives, I think, his meaning. It is the first\ninstructress in the history of nations.]\n[Footnote 99: I venture to think if Professor Bosanquet's translation\nwere the right one the German would be _ein in sich selbst\ngebrochenes._ I do not think _in ihm selbst_ can be a German rendering\nof \"in itself.\" But I admit the translation is tempting whether Hegel\nhad in his mind the \"house divided against itself\" or not.]\n[Footnote 100: Lit., \"the spiritual universal,\" _i.e._, the universal\nsubstance of its ideal content.]\n[Footnote 101: Precisely as Ruskin, for example, in his \"Modern\nPainters\" condemns both Titian and Tintoret, not because they painted\nthe _Paradise_ or the _Assunta_, to produce fine paintings, or even\nbecause they did not or did themselves believe in the truth of their\nsubject-matter, but because they did not paint _in order to make\nconverts_, an extraordinary lapse of judgment.]\n[Footnote 102: _Im besten Sinne des Wortes._]\n[Footnote 103: Professor Bosanquet points out in a note on this\npassage (p. 101) that _Sittlichkeit_ here, which he translates, as I\nhave done, \"respectability,\" is the _habit_ of virtue, without the\nreflective aspiration after goodness as an ideal. Of course there is\nno depreciation in the use of the term. It is simply the morality of\nordinary people, who do generally what their neighbours think the right\nthing. The word _moralit\u00e4t_ and _moralisch_, which I have only been\nable to translate by a paraphrase, is the morality of the standpoint\ndiscussed, which is very much that of Kant or \"Duty for duty's sake\" in\nBradley's \"Ethical Studies.\"]\n[Footnote 104: That is the contingency of the world of Nature as\ncontrasted with the essential stability of mind or spirit.]\n[Footnote 105: Lit., \"To satisfy itself in its _real_ or independent\nself (_f\u00fcr sich_).\" It cannot identify itself with either side as its\nwholly real self made therein explicit. It is neither fish nor fowl.]\n[Footnote 106: _Bestimm\u00fcngen_ may here be a reference to man's broadest\nspiritual characterizations as one of the human family, the race, the\nnation, and so forth, or, as I think, a reference to his vocation,\nfuture destiny, general welfare.]\n[Footnote 107: _An und f\u00fcr sich Wahre._]\n[Footnote 108: _Unbefangenen_, _i.e._, the na\u00efve outlook of ordinary\nlife.]\n[Footnote 109: Professor Bosanquet merely translates _are not_ and\n_are_ in italic as in the text, which of course, except that he adds\na comma after _are_, is a literal translation. But the sense, as I\nunderstand it, is that the writer says it is not in the sense that\nthese two contradictories do not exist _at all_ (_i.e._, as relative\nreality), but rather in the sense that in _philosophical thought_\nwhich grasps their essence they are not only present but present as\nreconciled factors of one truth. Professor Bosanquet's translation\nappears to me to amount to this: that all Hegel maintains is that\nthe sense he means is not that such contradictory elements are _not_\nreconciled, but in the sense that they _are_ reconciled. Perhaps this\nis his view. But if so, I fail to see the importance of the antithesis,\nwhich appears to me between _gar nicht sind_ and _in Vers\u00f6hnung sind._\nHegel before had expressly said that such contradictory sides were\nreconciled in philosophy, so I do not see why he should so emphatically\nrepeat himself. The comma, of course, may be a misprint.]\n[Footnote 110: _Begriff._ Notion, or concrete Idea of it.]\n[Footnote 111: Of that world in its opposition to reason.]\n[Footnote 112: _Der Mensch als er geht und steht._ The man in ordinary\nconditions\u2014-the _average_ man, however, rather than the _natural_ man,\nwhich carries slightly different associations.]\n[Footnote 113: The difference between a material instrument, which is\na mere means to an end conceived by the craftsman, such as a plough\nfor ploughing, a rake for raking, and a purpose inseparable from the\norganic whole as a mouth for eating, for without life the organism\ncollapses.]\n[Footnote 114: _F\u00fcr sich._]\n[Footnote 115: In his history of Aesthetic in Germany L\u00f6tze disputes\nthis. It seems to some extent a question of definition. In Hegel's view\na dead body is not a human body in the full sense, but the _corpse_ of\na man. A hand separated from the body, whether we call it a hand or\nnot, is no longer, whatever it may be, a living member, its essential\nsignificance as a hand has disappeared. It was only a hand in its\ncoherence as part of a larger whole. It may still for a time preserve\nthe semblance of its life, but it is cut off as the withered leaf.\nThese are facts at least that are undeniable, and the objection appears\nto me based on a misunderstanding. A hand is only _an und f\u00fcr sich_\nhuman when it is part of a living man. What is the organic reality in\nthe complete sense is the man as a _whole._ The hand is merely the\nextremity of one of his arms. You may call a dead hand a hand if you\nlike. The point is what was implied in the fact that you called it a\nhand at all whether alive or dead.]\n[Footnote 116: That is, by Kant, of course.]\n[Footnote 117: By _Verwicklung_ I understand the general evolution of\nideal philosophy which the defects of the Kantian Critique stimulated.\nProfessor Bosanquet apparently limits it to a perplexity personal to\nSchiller.

The words _an und f\u00fcr\nsich_ are obviously the wider explication of _in sick selbst_, the\nauxiliary, as not unfrequently in Hegel, being almost equivalent to\n_n\u00e4mlich._ Whether a misprint or an oversight I have translated subject\nto this correction.]\n[Footnote 125: I presume the revelation is not merely that of visible\nshape or even mainly.]\n[Footnote 126: _Das alles aus sich setzende und aufl\u00f6sende Ich._ The\nthree points emphasized by Hegel in Fichte's \"Philosophy\" are: (_a_)\nThe Ego is abstract; (_b_) Everything is a _show_ for it; (_c_) Its own\nacts are a semblance.]\n[Footnote 127: Hegel uses the word _Eitelkeit_ and _eitle_ in their\ndouble sense of empty-nothingness--futility and vain or conceited. This\ncannot be readily reproduced in English.]\n[Footnote 128: _Sch\u00f6nseligkeit._ Borrowed no doubt from Goethe's notion\nof a \"fair soul.\"]\n[Footnote 129: Like the \"vaulting ambition\" of Shakespeare which falls\non the other side, is _\u00fcber sich selbst._]\n[Footnote 130: _Haltung._ Professor Bosanquet translates this\n\"conduct.\" I rather think it refers to \"bearing, demeanour.\" They are,\nas we say, \"featureless, flaccid figures.\"]\n[Footnote 131: _L\u00e4ppische._ I am not quite sure what is exactly\nmeant. Professor Bosanquet translates it \"grotesque.\" But the word\nis a provincial form of _Schlaff_ apparently--loose, flaccid and so\nchildish, trifling.]\n[Footnote 132: _Moment._ A phase in an evolutionary, or, as it is here,\na dialectical process. A momentary feature of it.]\n[Footnote 133: This final section is called the Division of the\nSubject.]\n[Footnote 134: _Subjektivit\u00e4t._ That is, the ideality of consciousness,\nor thought.]\n[Footnote 135: Professor Bosanquet, in his note on this passage,\nexpresses the opinion that Hegel when he writes thus is referring \"To\nthe self-consciousness of individual human beings as constituting,\nand reflecting on, an ideal unity between them.\" This no doubt, as he\nsuggests, does put a somewhat unnatural meaning on the word \"person\"\nor \"subjekt.\" No doubt there is a sense in which we can ascribe\npersonality to a state, or nation, in the concrete unity of its life.\nBut while admitting that unity such as this, which is not sensuous but\nideal, can be \"effective and actual,\" I find it difficult to conclude\nthat Hegel did himself hold that the unity of the Divine Being was\n_merely_ identical with the unity or totality of concrete human life\nas reflected upon by single individuals. How far is human life as a\nwhole on this Earth a unity or totality at all? That question has\nbeen discussed by Professor Bradley and others with very different\nconclusions. Nay, how far does human existence itself exhaust the\nactually present realization or self-realization of self-conscious\nSpirit or Intelligence? Whatever maybe the wisest answer to such and\nother questions I can hardly think that Hegel would have accepted\nProfessor Bosanquet's interpretation as completely adequate.]\n[Footnote 136: _Fackeldistel_. \"Torch thistle,\" a plant of the genus\nCereus.]\n[Footnote 137: Or, \"as mind and in mind.\"]\n[Footnote 138: That is to say, presents to itself to conscious grasp of\nitself as such Art-spirit (_als k\u00fcnstlerischer._)]\n[Footnote 139: The two evolutions here alluded to are (i) that of a\nparticular way of regarding Nature, man, and God in a particular age\nand nation such as the Egyptian, Greek, and Christian viewed in express\nrelation to art; (ii) The several arts--sculpture, music, poetry,\netc., each on their own foundation and viewed relatively to the former\nevolution.]\n[Footnote 140: The point, of course, is that the different media of the\nseveral arts are inherently, and in virtue of the fact that we have\nnot here _mere_ matter as opposed to that which is intellectual rather\nthan sensuous, but matter in which the notional concept is already\nessentially present or pregnant (sound is, for instance, more ideal\nthan the spatial matter of architecture), adapted to the particular\narts in which they serve as the medium of expression.]\n[Footnote 141: Professor Bosanquet explains these \"plastic forms\"\n(_Gestaltungs formen_) as the various modifications of the\nsubject-matter of art (Trans., p. 140 note). I am not quite sure of\nthe meaning here intended. It would apparently identify the term with\nthe _Gebilde_ referred to in the third division. I should myself\nrather incline to think that Hegel had mainly in his mind the specific\ngeneral types, that is, the three relations of the Idea itself to its\nexternal configuration, viewed as a historical evolution, which Hegel\ncalls symbolic, classical, and romantic. Perhaps this is what Professor\nBosanquet means. But in that case it does not appear to me so much the\nsubject-matter as the generic forms in the shaping of that matter.]\n[Footnote 142: _Das wahrhaft Innere._ That is, the inward of the truth\nof conscious life.]\n[Footnote 143: Means apparently the notion in its absolute sense.]\n[Footnote 144: Because it represents spirit as independent of an\nappropriate bodily form.]\n[Footnote 145: What appears to be denoted by _Geistigkeit_ is the\ngeneric term of intelligence--that activity of conscious life which\ndoes not necessarily make us think of a single individual--the common\nnature of all spirit.]\n[Footnote 146: By _Innerlichkeit_, which might also be rendered as pure\nideality, what is signified is that in a mental state there are no\nparts outside of each other.]\n[Footnote 147: _Subjekt_, _i.e._, the individual Ego of\nself-consciousness.]\n[Footnote 148: _Das subjective Innere,_ lit., the subjective inner\nstate.]\n[Footnote 149: _Geistigkeit._ Professor Bosanquet translates it here\n\"intellectual being.\"]\n[Footnote 150: The distinction between a percipient and an external\nobject falls away.

A picture is equally so in respect\nof the third dimension, which has to be read into it. Poetry is almost\nwholly ideal, uses hardly any sensuous element, and appeals almost\nwholly to what exists in the _mind._\"]\n[Footnote 163: By particularization is meant the variety in the\nmaterial of colours, musical tones, and ideas, which latter are really\nquite as much the medium of poetry as written language. The _sensuous_\nmedium is here an abstract sign and, as Hegel would contend, nothing\nmore than this.]\n[Footnote 164: Reference, of course, to Hegel's unfortunate acceptance\nof Goethe's theory of colour.]\n[Footnote 165: The colour of art is not merely ideal as applied to\nonly two dimensions of space, but also is \"subjective\" in the artistic\ntreatment of it under a definite \"scheme.\" It is not clear whether\nHegel alludes also to this; apparently not, though it is the most\nimportant feature. In fact, even assuming his theory of light to be\ncorrect, it is difficult entirely to follow his distinction between the\nappearance of colour on a flat or a round surface. As _natural_ colour\nthe one would be as ideal as the other. Only regarded as a composition\nwould painting present distinction.]\n[Footnote 166: It is obvious that the reference here is mainly to\nan intentional appeal to the human soul through the content of the\ncomposition. But the appeal may also be made through the technique and\nartistic treatment of the medium itself.]\n[Footnote 167: The parts of a chord are not in space, but are ideally\ncognized. Hegel describes this by saying that music idealizes space and\nconcentrates it to a point. It would perhaps be more intelligible to\nsay that it transmutes the positive effects of a material substance in\nmotion into the positive and more ideal condition of time. The point\nwhich is continually negated is at least _qu\u00e2_ music the point, or\nrather, moment, of a temporal process.]\n[Footnote 168: By the indifferent externality of space is signified the\nfact that the parts of space, though external to each other, are not\nqualitatively distinguishable.]\n[Footnote 169: Succession in time is \"more ideal\" than coexistence in\nspace because it exists only as continuity in a conscious subject.]\n[Footnote 170: Painting no doubt introduces ideal elements into the\nartistic composition of colour, but the colour still remains the\nappearance of a material thing or superficies.]\n[Footnote 171: That is to say, music or harmony is based on a solid\nconformity to law on the part of its tones in their conjunction and\nsuccession, their structure and resolution.]\n[Footnote 172: As in painting.]\n[Footnote 173: The views here propounded suggest considerable\ncriticism. It appears to me that the stress here laid upon the\nintelligible content of poetry as contrasted with the sensuous\nqualities of its form as modulated speech is certainly untenable.\nWhat we call the music of verse may unquestionably be most intimately\nassociated with the ideal content expressed; but apart from the\nartistic collocation of language as sound no less than symbol we\ncertainly do not get the art of poetry. Even where Hegel deals directly\nwith rhythm and rhyme in the body of the treatise I think it is clear\nhe underrates all that is implied in the difference between the musical\nexpression of poetry as contrasted even with the sonorous language of\nmere prose. A further question upon which more doubt is permissible is\nhow far the actual script in written or printed letters is not entitled\nto be regarded as at least in part the sensuous medium. No doubt the\npoem is not dependent upon it as a painting is upon colour, or the\ncanvas which supports it, for it may be recited. But at least it is\npractically dependent upon it for its preservation. The point may very\npossibly appear, however, as nugatory or entirely unimportant, beside\nthe question whether the medium of the art is not really imaginative\nidea rather than articulate speech.]\n[Footnote 174: _Absolute Formen._ Adequate in the sense of being\nunconditionally so.]\nFIRST PART\nTHE IDEA OF FINE ART, OR THE IDEAL\nTHE POSITION OF ART RELATIVELY TO FINITE REALITY, RELIGION, AND\nPHILOSOPHY\nThe conclusion of the introduction brings within sight the more\nmethodical exposition of our subject. It will in the first place be\nuseful as a point of departure for a true philosophy of the beautiful\nto sum up shortly the position of Fine Art in its general relation\nto the Real, no less than to emphasize the salient features which\ndistinguish the philosophy of Fine Art from other philosophical\ninquiries.\n(_a_) With this object in view we will first enumerate the diverse\nattempts which have been made to apprehend the beautiful in thought,\nplacing each in the order which will best assist a critical verdict.\nWe have already contributed something to this in our introduction.\nAnd, moreover, we may add that the mere inquiry what others have\ncontributed either rightly or wrongly to our subject, at least with\nthe hope of ascertaining something really instructive to an exposition\nwhich claims to be wholly scientific, will not assist us much. So far\nfrom this being so we must preface our remarks with the admission that,\nin the opinion of many, the beautiful, for the very reason that it\nis the beautiful, does not admit of such intellectual apprehension,\nis, in short, no object intelligible to human thought. To such a\nthesis we must for the present--in our response to those who at this\ntime of day contend that all Truth is ultimately incomprehensible,\nand only the finiteness of the phenomenal and the contingent matters\nof temporal existence is within our mental grasp--reply that it is\nprecisely Truth, and Truth alone, which is to be thus _comprehended_,\nand for this reason that it possesses the absolute _notion_, or, more\nsuccinctly, the Idea for its basic support. Now beauty is no other\nthan a particular determination under which the True is expressed\nand revealed to us; and it lies open to the fullest comprehension of\nthought in so far as such can equip it with the armoury of the concrete\nnotion. It is quite true that no idea has suffered more severely in\nour own time from misconceptions than this which we call the notion\nin its fullest explication. One is only too often misunderstood to\nmean a determination which is abstract and one sided, or at least a\nconception of the analytical understanding. As thus understood neither\nthe totality of Truth nor the idea of beauty as a concrete whole can be\nbrought home to a thinking consciousness. But the idea of beauty, as we\nhave already observed, and shall seek to make more intelligible as we\nproceed, is no such abstraction of the mind: rather it may be defined\nas the absolute notion in its self-evolved concreteness, or still more\nspecifically defined, the absolute Idea.\n(_b_) And, further, we cannot more succinctly define the _absolute\nIdea_, in the above use of the expression, than by saying it is\nmind (Spirit): and we may add that the mind thus referred to is not\nmind regarded as finite, that is, subject to the conditions and\nlimitations of sense-perception, but the universal and _absolute_\nIntelligence[175], which, out of its own free activity, determines\nTruth in the profoundest signification of the term. To the ordinary\nconsciousness of everyday life the object of perception, no doubt,\nbreaks away from mind, as though our thought stood in opposition\nto Nature, which receives from us a validity equal at least to the\nconsciousness which perceives it. But in this way of looking at Nature\nand the conscious subject as two neighbours set over against one\nanother in territories equally self-subsistent it is only the finite\nand limited mind, not that which it is as an infinite substance and\nin its notional truth, which is apprehended. Nature is not thus to\nbe set over against absolute Mind, either as conjoint with a sphere\nof the Real of equal worth, or as an independent boundary thereto.\nRather the aspect which Nature appears to hold in this respect is\nthat which mind or spirit itself sets up, and of which it becomes\nthe product as a Nature in which limit and boundary are themselves\ndetermining constituents. In fact, Mind in its absolute or infinite\nsubstance can only be apprehended as this free activity, which is\nmanifested in self-development through differentiation. This object,\nthis _other_, through which such differentiation proceeds, is regarded\nin such opposition as Nature, but as the object of intelligence it is\nquite as much indebted to Mind for the free gift and fulness of its\nown essential substance. We must therefore conceive Nature as herself\ncontaining in potency the absolute Idea. She is that Idea in _apparent\nshape_, which mind, in its synthetic power, posits as the object\nopposed to itself. She is so far a product, a creation. The truth\nof Nature therefore is simply the determination by mind of its own\nsubstance, its ideality and power of determination, through a process\nwhich no doubt begins with a separation of itself into two factors\nwhich apparently negate each other, but which, by the very activity\nof such negation and separation, passes beyond the contradiction\nit implies to a unity which heals the fracture. Instead of finding\nour-elves opposed to a limit and a barrier we have a totality in which\nthe parts which opposed each other are fused together by the free\nuniversality of mind. This ideality, in other words this infinite\npower of determination[176], is that which constitutes the profound\nnotion of Mind's _subjectivity._ As subjectivity mind is, in the first\ninstance, merely Nature, Mind, or Spirit that is _not explicitly_\nunfolded, mind which has not arrived at the grasp of its true notion.\nNature is here set up in opposition to Mind, not as an object which\nitself has created, but as one whose limits it fails to overcome,\nan object, moreover, which, as assumed to be already subsisting in\nindependence, Mind remains alongside of in the internal seclusion of\nknowledge and volition, and is only able to constitute the other side\nof Nature. The finiteness of scientific theory, no less than that of\npractical life, is to be, found in this limited mode of consciousness,\nwhere intelligence is restricted to the use of finite categories and\nthe formal \"ought\" in the realization of ethical perfection[177]. We\nfind here, as we have pointed out was the case with Nature, that\nthe phenomenal is not adequate to the essential truth of that which\nappears; what we receive is still the confusing medley of abilities,\npassions, intentions, opinions, and talents, which no sooner make\nthemselves felt than they are displaced, working at cross purposes\nas often against as on the side of each other, in a strife between\nvolition, opinion, and reflection, which brings to the surface every\nphase of fortuitous experience in all its confusing variety. It is\nthe standpoint of the entirely finite, temporal, contradictory, and\nfor that reason transitory, unsatisfied, and unreconciled spirit. For\nthe satisfactions which obtain in such a consciousness, through the\nfiniteness which inseparably clings to its entire outlook, itself so\nlimited and confused, are of a purely relative and isolated validity.\nIt is inevitable that consciousness, volition, and thought should make\nan effort to rise above this condition and seek for the universality,\nunity, and satisfaction which it eventually finds in the infinite\nsubstance of Spirit and its Truth. This unity and satisfaction, to\nwhich mind is carried forward by the impulse of its own ideal activity,\ntransmuting the raw material of its finite conditions, constitutes the\nfirst revelation of that which the world of appearances is under a\nmore notional grasp of it. Mind grasps its finiteness as the negation\nof its own essential substance, and is aware of its infinity. And this\nessential truth of the finite mind is the absolute Mind or Spirit. In\nthis form of self-consciousness mind is merely actualized as absolute\nnegativity. The element of finitude which it confronts is apprehended\nas such and annulled. In this, the highest sphere of its activity,\nmind becomes the object of volition. The Absolute itself becomes the\n_object_ of mind. Spirit, as self-consciousness, differentiates itself\nas the _knowing subject_ from the absolute Spirit as the _object_\nof knowledge. Mind in this latter sense, in contradistinction from\nmind which has not overcome the conditions of finite perception, may\ntherefore be defined as a finite mind in possession of the principle\nof differentiation from its true object. In the higher and more\nspeculative consideration of truth, however, it is the _absolute\nmind itself_, which, in order to unfold explicitly the knowledge of\nitself, essentially becomes a principle of differentiation to itself,\nand thereby posits the finitude of mind, within which it becomes for\nitself absolute object of the knowledge of itself. It is now absolute\nmind within the ideal community[178] which belongs to it, the actual\nAbsolute of itself in the form of Mind and knowledge[179].\nThis is, in fact, the starting-point of the Philosophy of Fine Art.\nFor the idea of Fine Art is neither the _logical Idea_, absolute\nThought, that is, which develops itself in the medium of its freest\nactivity, nor is it the Idea of _Nature_ apprehended under more finite\ncategories. Its province is rather that of Mind untrammelled by either\nthe judgments or the actions of the _finite_ spirit.\n(_c_) The realm of Fine Art is the realm of _absolute Spirit._ We can\nbut briefly indicate the reason why this is so. A fully philosophical\nproof belongs rather to treatises which immediately deal with those\nquestions of philosophy we have noticed already, by which we mean those\nwhich treat of Logic, whose content, as above explained, is that of the\nabsolute Idea, or the philosophy of Nature, or lastly, the philosophy\nof Mind in its determinate spheres of finitude. For in these sciences\nthe object is to show not merely how the logical Idea presupposes the\nobjective particularity of Nature as a vehicle to its determinate\nexistence, but also how it is capable of passing from such externality\nto mind, and, finally, of freeing itself from all the finitude that\nclings to it and of attaining to Spirit in its eternal concreteness and\ntruth.\nFrom such a point of view, which is also applicable to art when\nregarded in all the fulness of worth it in truth implies, we are\njustified in associating it with the self-same province which belongs\nto religion and speculative philosophy. In every direction in which\nMind or Spirit becomes identical with the absolute Mind it frees itself\nfrom the restricting limits of its positive existence, and, while\nliberating itself from the contingent relations, which pertain to it\nin its temporal existence, and the finite content of its objects and\ninterests, is made aware of and discloses the entire wealth of reality\nit contains.\nIt may be of service here to expand more completely the position which\nArt thus occupies in its relation respectively to the life of Nature\nand Spirit.\nA survey of the entire field of human existence presents to the\nordinary consciousness of mankind the widest variety of interests and\nmeans of satisfaction. There is, in the first instance, the complex\nsystem of purely physical necessities, to the satisfaction of which the\nwhole economy of industrial enterprise, through all its complicated\ntissue of commerce, merchandize, and technical crafts, is actively\npursued. If we raise the level of our review to a more spiritual range,\nwe are confronted with the world where rights are established and\nenforced, the world of legislative enactment, family life, division of\nsocial classes, in a word, the concrete living organism of the State.\nAnd more than this, there is the religious want, which asserts itself\nin the hearts of particular men and women, and finds its satisfaction\nin the life of a church. Finally, there is the many-sided and\nintricately specialized activity of scientific research, the organized\neffort to integrate all knowledge, and the comprehension which that\nknowledge implies, in one all-embracing system. Within this latter\nare comprised the activities of the fine arts, the interest, that is\nto say, in beauty, and which derives its spiritual nutriment in the\nrealization of that beauty in plastic shapes.\n(_d_) The question becomes inevitable how far a spiritual want of this\nkind is bound up as a necessary element in the life of man and his\nworld-history. In the first instance these two spheres[180] appear\nsimply as immediate factors of our entire survey. It is, however, the\nrequirement of philosophy to probe more deeply into that which binds\nthem as essential and necessarily interacting constituents of one\norganic whole. For on closer inspection it will be found that they do\nnot stand in relation to one another on the mere basis of utility;\nrather we shall discover that only through the one we shall fully\ncomprehend the other. In other words, the one circle overlaps the\nother, in the sense that the higher forms of its activity are found\nto be a part of the other; and that which is of less value in its own\nprovince is lifted into a finer atmosphere; and what had failed to free\nitself from its original bounds is now enlarged to liberty through the\nprofounder satisfaction it receives in the widening of the range of its\ninterests[181]. And it is this which makes clear the necessity of the\nideal bond.\nWe will recall now for a moment the analysis we established of the\nnotion of the beautiful and that of art generally. Two opposed aspects\ncome under notice. In the first place we have a content, an end, a\nsignificance; and in addition to that we get the artistic expression\nof the same, the appearance and realization of such content; and,\nthirdly, these two aspects of the artistic product so pass into each\nother that the rationality or particularity is nothing short of the\nexpression of the artistic purpose, nothing more or less is given us\nthan the essential expression of the entire content. What we designate\nas content, \"significance,\" is just this simplicity of idea, the work\nof art resolved into its simplest yet most comprehensive determinants,\nas it exists for mind in contrast with the actual work executed. As\nan example we may summarize the content of a book from a few words or\nsentences the book contains, and nothing may be necessary to expound\nthe content of that book sufficiently in its general import. This\nsimple idea, the thesis or main problem of our book, which forms the\nfundamental basis on which the entire structure is built, is the\nabstract significance. It is only the detailed exposition which gives\nus the concrete totality.\nBoth sides, however, of this opposition do not stand in an indifferent\nor purely external relation one to the other, as, for instance,\nis the case when we contrast with it the particular content of an\nabstract mathematical figure, such as a triangle or an ellipse, to\nwhich the external particularity of its size or figure is related\nwithout affecting its significance. Rather in the former case we shall\nfind that the content of its form, taken in abstraction in itself,\npossesses a determinate impulse in the direction of realization and\nthereby concreteness. There is in it essentially the \"_should_\" of\npurpose. However strongly form is here posited in independence, we are\nunable to rest satisfied with such abstraction, and ask for something\nmore. This is at first apprehended merely as an unsatisfied want, a\ndesire in the conscious subject, which strives to annul itself and\nsecure satisfaction. From such a standpoint all we can say is that the\ncontent is purely self-contained, or _subjective_, over against which\nthe objective other-than-itself is placed in opposition in such a way\nas to emphasize the desire to make the subjective content _objective._\nSuch a conflict between the subjective content and the objective,\nreality which confronts it, no less than the mere impulse to transcend\nthe opposition, is a universal characteristic of the determination of\nall self-conscious life[182]. Even that aspect of human life which we\ncall physical, and still more that world of man's spiritual aims and\ninterests depends on this necessity to carry forward that which is at\nfirst purely subjective and ideal into the objective world, that a\nfuller satisfaction in its essential substance may be realized. But\nso long as the content of aims and interests is merely and at first\napprehended in the one-sided form of subjective consciousness, and\nthat one-sidedness is apprehended as a mere limit, this loss makes\nitself simply felt as unrest or pain. It is a negative something\nwhich is bound to resolve itself as such negativity, and, in order to\nremove the sense of defect, exerts an impulse to transcend the barrier\nitself, already an object of consciousness and thought. And, moreover,\nthis transcendency does not merely amount to this, that the objective\n\"other\" ceases to be an opposed factor to the general subjective\nconsciousness: rather in the more determinate connection, this defect\nof _subjective_ thought is itself and _within_ itself a defect and\n_negation_ which involves an impulse to negate and pass beyond. In\nother words the conscious subject is implicitly and according to its\nessential notion the _complete whole_[183], that is, not merely what\nis inward, but the realization no less of that which is inward or\nideal in and through what is without. If we assume that it exists only\nabstractly in one form we have to face the contradiction that whereas\nit is, according to its concrete notion the whole, yet according to its\nmode of existence it remains merely one side of that totality. It is\nonly through the entire resolution of such a contradiction that life\nbecomes affirmative. To pass through each phase of this opposition,\ncontradiction and its final abrogation is the higher and legitimate\ndemand of conscious life. That which remains always affirmative, is,\nand remains, without life. Life is built upon negation and pain. It\nis only by crushing out such contradictions in the crucible of fuller\nlife and knowledge that it remains in its affirmative substance. If it\nanchor wholly on contradiction without such a possibility of resolution\nit must be infallibly wrecked thereon.\nSuch, then, is the nature of these determinations of thought regarded\nin their abstraction to which it was necessary to draw attention at the\npresent stage.\nThe most exalted content which lies within the grasp of self-conscious\nlife may be concisely called _freedom._ Freedom is the highest\ndetermination of Spirit. In its formal aspect freedom, in its first\ninstance, consists in this, that the subject thereof ceases to find a\nlimit or barrier in the material which is set over against it; this\nis no longer an element foreign to it, but one in which it finds\nitself again. Even under this formal definition of it all necessity\nand misfortune disappears; the individual consciousness is reconciled\nwith the world, finds satisfaction in such reconciliation, and all\nopposition and contradiction is thereby dissolved.\nBut over and above this, on closer inspection, we find that it is\nuniversally the rational--that is to say ethical relations in practical\nlife, truth in thought--which constitutes the content of freedom. But,\nfurthermore, inasmuch as freedom itself is in the first instance only\nsubjective, not wholly carried into effect, there must remain for\nthe individual an element of unfreedom, a somewhat purely objective\nopposed to it as a necessity of Nature; and it is accompanied likewise\nwith the demand to secure a reconciliation of this opposition. From\nthe reverse point of view a similar contradiction is apparent in the\ninternal domain of the subjective consciousness itself. We have, on\nthe one hand, that which is universal and self-subsistent in its own\nright, in other words the universal dictates or principles of justice,\ngoodness, and truth. On the other there are the various impulses of\nmankind, all the emotions, preferences, and passions which exercise\ntheir power over the heart of each man and woman individually. This\nopposition no less than the other excites conflict and contradiction,\nand in this strife man becomes subject to every conceivable longing,\nthe profoundest grief, and, in a word, to every kind of worry and\ndiscontent. It is the prerogative of the spiritual life of mankind\nto be a veil severed and broken asunder, tossed as it must be on the\nwaves of contradiction. The animal creation lives at peace with itself\nand its environment. Man is unable to find a complete refuge in that\nwhich is exclusively inward, the soul as such, pure thought, in the\nworld of legal obligation and its _universality._ He is dependent also\nupon his sensuous existence, his emotions, and all that appeals to his\nheart and soul. It is the part of philosophy to give expression to this\ncontradiction in thought, as it extends throughout its all-embracing\ncompass, and to overcome the same with a reconciliation equally\ncomprehensive.\nIn the immediacy of everyday life, however, man seeks to secure an\n_immediate_ satisfaction. Perhaps the most obvious example of such\na resolution is to be found in the domain of animal wants and their\nsatisfaction.\nThe states of hunger, thirst, fatigue on the one hand, and feeding,\ndrinking, sleep on the other, with all such similar states, illustrate\nthe contradictions and resolutions to which we here refer.\nIn this sphere of human existence, which is fundamentally the same as\npurely animal life, the content of such satisfaction is, however, of a\nfinite and limited range. Such satiety carries with it no permanence,\nbut moves forward without rest to a renewed sense of want. Men eat,\ndrink, and sleep, and on the morrow are as hungry and weary as before.\nMan is compelled, therefore, to strive for a freedom more lasting in\nthat element of the spiritual life which he appropriates in knowledge\nand volition, the sciences and his social activities. The ignorant\nman is unfree because he faces a world which is foreign to himself, a\nworld which tosses hither and thither aimlessly, to which he is joined\nas an appendage, unable to unite that foreign world to itself, and to\nfeel itself at home there as in its own demesne. The merest impulse of\ncuriosity, the awakening of the love of knowledge, the lowest phase\nof animate unrest, and the highest grasp of philosophical insight are\nultimately derived from the same source, namely, the desire to overcome\nevery condition that is unfavourable to freedom, and to bring the\nworld of everyday life, and that of the subject which reflects upon\nit, into one harmonious unity. If we consider the world of _action_\nthe result is the same; freedom in human action is the attempt to\nmake positive or real the reason of the Will. Reason is realized by\nvoluntary action through the life of the State. In a State that is\ndifferentiated through itself on any rational principle, all the laws\nand social institutions which belong to it are simply a realization of\nfreedom according to their own essential determinants. This being so,\nthe reason that belongs to any citizen discovers in such institutions\nits own essential life: and, so long as such is not in revolt from\nthose laws, proceeds with them as with its own kith and kin rather than\na foreign adversary. We not infrequently find licence identified with\nfreedom. But the freedom of licence is irrational; it depends upon a\nchoice and self-determination which has nothing to do with a rational\nwill, but is rather the product of accidental impulses and their\ndependence on the world of sense and physical Nature.\nWe may conclude, then, that the physical needs of man, no less than\nhis knowledge and power of volition, receive in fact, each in its\nown sphere, a satisfaction in the world, and deliberately break up\nthe contradiction between the subjective and objective, that is to\nsay, between the freedom of consciousness and the external necessity\nof things with which it is confronted. The content, however, of\nsuch a freedom and the satisfaction which is therein experienced\nis still subject to _limitations_, and for this reason both still\nretain an element of _finitude._ And wherever we find such an element\nsupervening it is inevitable that the original contradiction should\nagain reassert itself, and the self-satisfaction only maintain a\nrelative significance. For example, in the sphere of jurisprudence and\nits realization in the State it is true enough that the rationality\nof each citizen, his will and his freedom are recognized; he is a\nperson and as such is respected; he is the owner of property, and\nif that property is in danger the courts of law reassert his rights\nin their integrity. This recognition, however, and the freedom it\nestablishes are confined to single relations and isolated objects,\nsuch as a particular house, a sum of money, some particular right\nor law, in fine some particular transaction in the practical world.\nWhat the consciousness has at any one time before it are particular\nthings, which no doubt are related to one another, and in fact form a\nnucleus of such relations; but, on the other hand, they are appropriate\nto categories of purely relative validity, are subject to various\nconditions of tenure, which make the satisfaction only immediately\nexperienced when their predominance is reasserted, or at any rate\nfail to establish any degree of permanence. And further than this\nthe life of the State in its organic entirety, as a related whole of\nmonarch, government, courts of justice, military control, and general\ngrouping of all the various societies which compose it, no less than\nthe obligations and duties which such arrangements presuppose, the\naims and satisfaction to which they are directed, the entire scope of\nits civic and commercial activities already referred to, in one word\nthe complete organism of a nation's life, is indeed in a genuine State\ncomplete in itself, and in a sense rounded off as a real totality. At\nthe same time we must observe that the fundamental _principle_, for\nthe realization of which the State exists, and wherein the individual\nman finds his satisfaction as a citizen, is, despite all the variety\nof that life, all the manifold differentiation of class within itself\nand as related to the world without, still a whole that is _one-sided_\nand in a real sense abstract. It is only the rational freedom of the\n_will_ made explicit in a particular totality. It is, in short, only\nthe national life, and further the life of a _particular_ nation;\na life, moreover, in which freedom is realized in a _particular_\nsphere of existence as individualized reality. And on this account\nit is that we are necessarily conscious, that rights and obligations\nin the mere bounds of civic existence, on the plane, that is to say,\nof merely this world's or temporal existence, do not discover the\nabsolute satisfaction we are seeking. We require as rational beings a\nhigher realization of their objective truth as private individuals,\na fuller sanction of their imperative validity than they themselves,\nin such a sphere, can offer us. What mankind, pressed on all sides\nby the boundaries of his purely terrestrial life, in fact requires\nis that region of more essential reality, in which every opposition\nand contradiction is overcome, and freedom can finally claim to be\nwholly at peace with itself. And this is, of course, nothing other\nthan absolute Truth itself, no merely relative truth. In the Truth,\naccording to its highest notion, all must be brought home to one unity.\nIn it there can be no more opposition between freedom and necessity,\nSpirit and Nature, knowledge and the object of knowledge, law and\nimpulse, between whatever form, in fact, the opposition of these\ncontradictory phenomena of human experience may assume.\nIt is in virtue of such truth that proof is possible that neither\na freedom which is essentially subjective and disparate from every\nelement of necessity is true in the absolute sense; nor, on the other\nhand, is it admissible to predicate truth of a necessity conceived in\nabsolute isolation from consciousness. Our ordinary conscious life\nfails to overcome this contradiction, and either plunges desperately\ninto the same, or thrusts it on one side and makes its escape from it\nin some other way. Philosophy will, however, so address itself to the\ntwo determinating factors of the contradiction as to show that they are\napprehended as isolate from each other in abstraction, not according\nto their concrete notion; and by the grasp of this latter it will\ndemonstrate the one-sidedness in its relative character, placing these\nopposing aspects in the fuller union and harmony which is truth. It is\nthe function of philosophy to grasp and formulate this notion of truth.\nUnquestionably philosophy recognizes the concrete notion throughout;\nand it is in virtue of this that it is Thought with full grasp of\ntruth. But what we call the notion is something other than this,\ntruth, that is, in its essential verity together with the existence\nwhich is either adequate to it or is not so. In all finite reality the\ndeterminations, which are essential to ideal truth, appear separable\nfrom each other, dividing the veil of that which in its absolute Truth\nis a complete totality. Take the case of a living being. Under such\nfinite categories we are forced to regard it as a subject in opposition\nto the inorganic Nature which environs it. Both the points of view are\nno doubt present in the notion, but they are there reconciled. Finite\nexistence, however, thrusts them apart. It is, in short, an existence\nor reality which is unequal to the unity of the notion. We may\ntherefore say that the notion is valid in every sphere of actuality. At\nthe same time the main point to be determined is whether the notion in\nits ideal concreteness is actually completed in the particular unity\npresented, wherein the two aspects posited in opposition persist in\nno ultimate self-subsistence and coherence over against each other,\nbut are rather ideal phases which tend to pass into a higher unity\nwhich cancels such opposition. And the reality of this highest mode\nof union is only reached when we enter the sphere of truth, freedom,\nand the satisfaction which they create. The higher life which belongs\nto this sphere, this supreme enjoyment of truth, which as feeling is\ncalled \"blessedness,\" and as conscious thought \"contemplation,\" we may\ndescribe generically as the life known to religion. For religion is\njust this universal domain[184], in virtue of which the _one_ concrete\ntotality of the World comes to each man in union with himself, as his\nessential substance, while it remains no less for consciousness the\nessential truth of Nature. And it is this profounder truth of the Real\nwhich alone proves itself invincible over all that is merely particular\nand finite, being as it is the one absolute harmony wherein all that is\notherwise discordant and opposed is finally resolved. Now it is through\nits direct concern in the true, regarded as the absolute object of\nconsciousness, that Art belongs to the supreme sphere of Spirit, and\nit is to be placed, in respect to its content, if in a more specific\nsense, on the same basis as religion and philosophy. I connect these\ntwo last for the reason that philosophy has no other object than God.\nIn its substance it is in fact rational theology, and in its service of\nthe truth a continual service of God.\n(_e_) Accepting, then, this fundamental similarity of content these\nthree spheres of absolute Spirit only differ in the _forms_ under\nwhich they present their object, that is, the Absolute, to human\nconsciousness. The differences which are perceptible in these modes of\npresentment are due to the notion of the absolute Spirit (Mind) itself.\nSpirit, in its truth, is essential substance brought home to itself. It\nis, therefore, no essence which lies outside and in abstract relation\nto objectivity, but rather is, within the compass of that objectivity,\nthe re-collected presence[185] of the substance of all objects within\nfinite spirit. It is the finite which grasps its own essential\nuniversality, and, in doing so, grasps essential Being in the absolute\nsense. The _first_ mode of this comprehension is an _immediate_ one,\nthat is to say, it is a sensuous cognition, a cognition in the form and\nsemblance of the object of sense-perception, in which the Absolute is\npresented directly to the understanding[186] and feeling. The _second_\nform is that of the _conceptive_ or imaginative consciousness. _Last_\nof all, we have the _free thought_ of absolute Spirit. The form of\n_sensuous perception_ is appropriate to art in the sense that it is art\nwhich presents truth to consciousness in its sensuous semblance; but\nit is a semblance which, under the mode of its appearance, possesses\na higher and profounder meaning and significance, although it is\nnot its function to render the universality of the notion wholly\nintelligible through the medium of sense. It is indeed rather the\n_unity_ to which art attains with that of the particular appearance\nwhich constitutes the essence of the beautiful, the essence of the\nartistic product. This union is perfected in art not _entirely_\nthrough sensuous objectification, but also through the medium of\n_imaginative conception._ This is exceptionally so in the art of\npoetry. At the same time, even in this, the most intellectual or\nideal art, the union between significance and the individual mode of\nits presentation is present with the same, although it is displayed\nto the imaginative consciousness, and every part of its content is\nconceived in its immediacy and visualized for the imagination[187]. And\ngenerally we must accept the fact that art, possessing as it does truth\nor Spirit for its object, is unable to reproduce the same by merely\ncopying particular objects of Nature, such as the sun, moon, earth,\nand stars. Such are, no doubt, objects of sensuous perception; but,\nsimply as such, they are isolated and can offer no reflection of what\nis spiritual. In thus attributing to art this absolute significance\nas a manifestation of Spirit we have expressly set on one side the\nconception of art which finds its content of too various a nature, or\ntoo much occupied with interests foreign to it, to merit such a view.\nAnd at the other extreme religion, no doubt, frequently summons art\nto her service, in order to bring the truths of religion more near\nto the emotion, or to clothe the same in imaginative form. In both\ncases unquestionably art is rendering a service to a province not,\nin strictness, its own. At the same time where art is found in most\nexalted perfection, in that case no doubt it unfolds in plastic guise\nthe mode of exposition most adequate and essentially necessary to the\ncontent of the truth accepted. Among the Greeks, for example, Art was\nthe highest medium under which the community conceived its gods, and\nbecame conscious of truth. For this reason we may justly say that the\npoets and artists of Greece created the gods of their people. In other\nwords, they defined for the imagination of their people the active life\nand energy of the Divine Presence, giving Them the definite content\nof a religion. And this statement must not merely be taken to imply\nthat all Greek artists did was to clothe in imagery or embellish with\nthe beauty of poesy vague conceptions and hearsays which, as general\nreligious maxims or isolated determinations of conscious life, were\nalready present before the era of such poetic creations. The truth of\nthis artistic production is rather to be found in this, that art and\npoetry were the exclusive forms in which these creative artists could\nbring to life and expression the ideas which fermented in themselves.\nIn other phases of that consciousness, where we find the content less\ncompletely represented by the plastic imagery of art, the scope of Art\nas the handmaid of religion is of less importance.\nWe have thus indicated what was, at any rate, once the true position of\nArt in its relation to the highest interests of man's spiritual life.\nBut inasmuch as art is preceded in Nature and the finite processes of\nlife by a kind of antenatal history, so too there is a history that\nfollows its culmination, which in other terms passes over and beyond\nits purely conceptive or plastic grasp of the Infinite. For art carries\nin the notion that gives it life a limit; and it is from this boundary\nthat the human consciousness passes beyond into forms more adequate\nto its spiritual import. It is this inherent _shortness of the mark_\nthat fixes the subordinate position we are only too ready to assign to\nart in our daily life nowadays. For us European art is no longer the\nhighest means in which the actuality of truth is possessed. Speaking\ngenerally, thought has long ago pronounced a verdict upon art when it\ndefined it as the portrayal of the Divine by concepts which appeal to\nsense-perception. This was the judgment passed on it by the Jews and\nthe followers of Mohammed. Nay, we find it present among the Greeks\nthemselves, as the strong opposition of Plato and Homer and Hesiod to\nthe popular conception of the gods proves clearly. There is a period in\nthe education of every civilized nation, when art becomes a sign-post,\nas it were, to that which stands beyond her border. The evolution of\nChristendom is itself an illustration. The historical features of\nthat religion, the resurrection of Christ, His life and death, have\ndoubtless offered to the art of painting a mighty field on which to\nexercise its imaginative bounty; and the Church has either surrounded\nsuch art with its magnificent protection, or suffered it simply to work\non unheeded. But as the love of knowledge and scientific research, and\nyet more the felt want of a more intimate and personal spirituality\nnecessitated the Reformation, the religious imagination was called away\nfrom the sensuous medium which enwrapped it, and centred once for all\nupon the inward spirituality of emotional life and conscious thought.\nIn this way there grew up, so to speak, that posterior twilight of\nArt's history I referred to, where the want has found a dwelling in\nman to rest satisfied alone with the pure medium of the soul as the\nultimate form of truth. In the earliest beginnings of art we shall\nfind mystery still present, a secret strain and longing which persists\nbecause Art's imaginative powers are unable to envisage to sense the\ncomplete truth of its content. When once, however, the mind of man has\nsucceeded in endowing such content with perfect outward shape in art,\nit is driven inevitably away from this objective realization to its own\nfree spiritual activity as from something repellent to it. A period\nsuch as this is our own. We may, indeed, express the hope that art will\nrise to yet higher grades of technical perfection; but in any case Art\nin its specific form has ceased to meet the highest requirements of\nspiritual life. We may still wonder at the unrivalled excellence of the\nstatues of the gods of Hellas, and imagine that God the Father, Christ,\nand the Virgin Mary have received ideal representation at the hands of\nmore recent painters. But it is of no use. Our knees no longer bow to\nthem.\nThe sphere of conscious life nearest to that of art is that of\nreligion. The form which belongs to the religious consciousness is that\nof the _imaginative concept._ The Absolute is here removed from the\nexternality of artistic production, and received in a more spiritual\nway by the imagination, so that the heart and emotions, the inner life\nof the individual that is to say, become its vehicle. This progress in\nspiritual insight from art to religion may be further defined by the\nstatement that art is only one aspect of the religious consciousness.\nIn other words, when a work of art objectifies the truth or mind for\nsense-perfection, and apprehends this form of the Absolute as the one\nappropriate to its vision, religion blends with the same the devotional\nattitude that flows from the inner life confronted with the absolute\nreality as thus presented. Devotion is a type of emotional existence\nwhich is, strictly speaking, outside the province of art. It originates\nin the fact that the individual suffers that object which art has\nrendered visible to sense to penetrate the arcana of his emotional\nlife, and so completely identifies himself with it that this inward\npresence, which the imagination and the inherent might of feeling has\nrendered possible, becomes an essential phase in the manifestation\nof absolute reality. Devotion is this cultus of the community in its\npurest, most intimate, and subjective form; a culture, in which the\nprinciple of objectivity is at the same time consumed and absorbed, and\nthe content thereof is transmuted without such objectivity into the\npossession of heart and soul.\nThe _third_ and last form or phase in the evolution of absolute mind\n(spirit) is _philosophy._ In the boundaries of the religious sphere,\nwhere God is apprehended in the first instance perforce as an external\nobject, and men are taught that there is a God, and how He has revealed\nHimself and still is revealed to mankind, the subjective consciousness\nis indeed made the vehicle of such knowledge, and the religious sense\nimparted stirs and fills the heart of the community; but the inwardness\nof devotion which is born of the emotions and the imagination is not\nthe highest form of inwardness. We are bound to recognize that the\npurest form of knowledge is conscious _thought_ in its freest activity.\nIn this alone the content of knowledge is, adequate to the demands\nof that which is consciously apprehended: here alone we are in the\npresence of that most intelligent form of cultus, which seeks wholly\nto appropriate to itself, and to grasp in concrete thought what is\notherwise only the evanescent content of feeling or the imagination.\nIn the purview of such a philosophy art and religion, as two aspects\nof one truth, become related under a unifying conception. On the one\nhand, though philosophy, by its surrender of all sensuous externality,\nhas lost the _objective_ presentation of art, yet it has exchanged\nit for the highest form under which concrete reality is objectively\napprehended and redeemed, in other words, that of _speculative reason._\nIt has, on the other, lost the emotional subjectivity of the religious\nconsciousness in the same pure medium. For while human thought is\nthe most inward and appropriate vehicle of subjective life, such\nthought, in its fullest grasp of truth, the Idea, is actuality in the\nmost objective and universal sense of the term, and is only to be\napprehended by pure thought in the medium native to itself.\nWith this adumbration of the difference between the spheres of art,\nreligion, and philosophy we must on the present occasion rest content.\nThe sensuous mode of consciousness is that which first appears in\nthe history of mankind. The earliest stages of religion are for this\nreason indistinguishable from a religion of art and its sensuous manner\nof presentation. In the religion of Spirit for the first time is God\nas Spirit cognized also on a higher plane, and one more adequate\nto thought, wherein it likewise follows as a corollary, that the\npresentation of truth in sensuous shape is not truly adequate to Spirit.\nNow that we know something of the position which art occupies in the\nfield of spiritual activity, and that which belongs to the philosophy\nof art among the several philosophical sciences, we will proceed in\nthis introductory portion of our work in the first place to investigate\nthe general idea of the beauty of art.\nSUBDIVISION OF SUBJECT\nIDEA OF THE BEAUTY OF ART, OTHERWISE, FINE ART\nTo arrive at the Idea of Fine Art in all its concreteness it will be\nnecessary for us to consider it under three phases.\n1. The _first_ is concerned with the _notion_ of the beautiful\ngenerally.\n2. The _second_ is that of _natural_ beauty, the defects of which will\ndemonstrate the necessity of the _Ideal_ as _Fine Art._\n3. In the _third_ of these aspects the subject of our investigation\nwill be the _Ideal_ in its _positive realization_, in other words as\nthe artistic display of this Ideal in particular _works of art._\n[Footnote 175: The German word here is _Geist._ I have translated it\nas best seems to suit the particular context in which the German word\noccurs.]\n[Footnote 176: _Unendliche Negativit\u00e4t._]\n[Footnote 177: This is the \"Ought\" of practical feeling. As such just\nas in the case of the analytical sciences, what it lacks is objective\ndetermination (see \"Phil. of Mind,\" trans. of W. Wallace, p. 94).]\n[Footnote 178: _In seiner Gemeinde._ We should rather expect _in seiner\nGebiete._]\n[Footnote 179: The reference here appears to be to the three attitudes\nof thought to the objective world which may be generally indicated\nas that of ordinary consciousness, that of empiricism and that of\nspeculative Philosophy.

The\nentire content of the Real is, on the contrary, all included under the\nform of self-conscious thought.]\n[Footnote 184: He means, I think, province of the universal, rather\nthan \"universal expansion of horizon.\"]\n[Footnote 185: The words of Hegel are \"_innerhalb derselben im\nendlichen Geiste die Erinnerung des Wesens aller Dinge_.\" He no doubt\nhas in his mind the derivation of the word _Erinnerung._ It is the\n_inwardization_ or idealization of such substance.]\n[Footnote 186: _Anschauung_, that is to say, it is the object of man's\nreceptive senses.]\n[Footnote 187: The punctuation is clearly wrong. It is also very\npossible that _derselben_ is a misprint for _dieselbe._ But in any case\nthere should be comma rather than semicolon.]\nCHAPTER I\nTHE NOTION OF THE BEAUTIFUL IN ITS GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE\nI\nWe have defined beauty to be the Idea of the beautiful.\nBy this definition is implied that we have to conceive the beautiful\nas Idea, and, moreover, as Idea in a determinate shape, as _Ideal._\nIdea, as thus posited, is just this, the conceptive notion, the\nrealization of the same, and the unity of both. The notion, as such, is\nnot yet the Idea, although the terms notion and idea are often loosely\ninterchanged. Idea is the notion only as presented in, and brought\ninto coalescence with, its objective reality. This unity, however, is\nby no means to be regarded as the mere _neutralization_ of notion and\nreality, so that the individual character and quality of either is\nabsorbed; as, for example, where we find that in a chemical compound\nsalt-potash and acid tend to neutralize each other in so far as they\nhave weakened their opposition. In this unity, on the contrary, the\nnotion is retained as the commanding factor. It is already implicitly,\nin virtue of its own nature, this very identity. Out of its own wealth\nit evolves the reality as part of itself, by means of a process which,\nbeing no other than that of development, surrenders nothing of its\nown nature, but brings into more concrete actuality the riches of the\nnotion, and for this reason continues in unity with itself and its\nobjective realization. Such a unity of the notional concept and its\nrealization is the Idea defined in abstract terms. The word idea is,\nof course, frequently used by authors of works dealing with the theory\nof art. It must, however, be admitted that many connoisseurs of high\nstanding are particularly severe upon its employment. The latest and\nmost interesting example of this polemical attitude is to be found\nin Herr von Rumohr's \"Italian investigations.\" This work is based on\nthe practical interest that the arts excite, and is wholly unconcerned\nwith that which for brevity we may call the Idea. The truth is that\nthis writer, who appears to have no knowledge of the development of\nphilosophy in modern times, freely confuses the expression as above\ndefined with the undetermined conceptions of the phantasy, or the\nabstract and characterless Ideal of well-known art theories or schools\nof art, ideas which present a lean contrast to the clearly defined and\nrichly caparisoned objects of Nature in their truth, and which this\nwriter opposes to the idea and empty Ideal, which the artist himself\nevolves from his own consciousness. We have, of course, no more right\nto suppose that creative work can be the result of such poverty, than\nwe can with justice assume that a thinker can think with conceptions\nwholly indeterminate, and persist in his thought with a content\ndestitute of all defined relation. Such an objection, however, does not\napply in any respect to the Idea in the sense we use the expression.\nThis Idea is through and through concrete; a whole which consists of\nrelations and is simply beautiful from being in direct union with the\nobjective form adequate to its expression.\nHerr von Rumohr has placed on record in this very book (Book I, pp.\n145-46) the following assertion, that \"beauty in the most comprehensive\nmeaning of the term, and as it is understood by intelligent people of\nour day, includes every quality of an object, which may either stir the\nsense of sight with satisfaction, or through that sense attune the soul\nand delight the mind.\"\nThese qualities are then further subdivided into three classes\nas follows: \"First, there is all that is perceptible through the\neye; secondly, that which is apprehended by means of the peculiar,\npresumably innate sense of mankind for spatial relations; and thirdly,\nall that in the first instance works upon the understanding, and\nonly indirectly through cognition on the emotions.\" This third and\nmost important determination rests apparently on forms \"which quite\nindependently of all pleasure to the sense and the beauty of extended\nshape arouse in us a specific delight which is ethical or spiritual\nin its quality, which in part to all appearance proceeds from the\nenjoyment we derive from the images excited (I presume he means ethical\nor spiritual ones)[188], and in part from the pleasure which the mere\nactivity of an intelligent appreciation infallibly brings with it.\"\nSuch are the principal factors according to which this undoubted\nconnoisseur of art defines his subject relatively to the beautiful. It\nmay very possibly pass muster with a certain type of uncritical reader.\nIt is, however, very unsatisfactory regarded from the philosophical\nstandpoint. For what does it at bottom amount to but this, namely, that\nthe sense of vision or spiritual sense, we may add the understanding\nitself, are moved pleasurably, or excite a feeling which results in\nawakened pleasure. The entire argument hinges on this one aspect of\nawakened gratification. This reduction, however, of the activity of the\nbeautiful to terms of feeling--that which pleases and charms us--has\nbeen disposed of once for all by Kant. His exposition has already left\nfar behind the feeling for the beautiful.\nWe will direct our attention now from this polemical tractate to a\nfurther consideration of the Idea its hostility has failed to weaken.\nIn this, as already stated, is comprehended the concrete _unity_ of the\n_notion_ and its objective realization.\n(_a_) Now, first, we will observe, in directing our attention more\nclosely to the essential nature of the notion, that it is no purely\n_abstract unity_ opposed to the _differences_ of _phenomenal reality_;\nrather, as the notion, it is already the unity that integrates\nthose relations, and by doing so is concrete totality. The abstract\nconceptions such as man, the quality blueness, and their like, are not\nnotions as such at all, but rather should be called abstract general\nconcepts, which are only raised to the dignity of the notion, when\nwe have demonstrated that they contain opposing factors in unity,\nand, in such a way, that this self-related nexus of unity constitutes\ntheir notional truth. For instance, the concept \"blueness\" as a colour\nreceives such a notional value when it is grasped as the unity, and,\nindeed, the specific unity of light and darkness[189]. In the same way\nthe concept \"man\" contains within it the opposing factors of sense,\nlife, and reason, body and mind (spirit); but a particular man is not\nto be regarded as a whole consisting in some way of these two aspects\nof his personality placed in a relation of indifference side by side\nas constituents of the same. Rather, in virtue of the notion, such\na whole contains these constituents in concrete and mediated[190]\nunion. Add to this that the notion is so completely the absolute bond\nand unity of its differences, that independently they cease to exist,\nthey are unable to assert the particularity, in virtue of which they\nmight escape from such a union. For this reason the notion includes\nall its determining constituents in the form of its own _ideal unity_\nand universality, which constitute its _subjective_ character in\ncontradistinction from the real as the object of sense-perception. For\nexample, gold is, as a particular object, of specific weight, definite\ncolour, and placed in a certain relation to specific acids. Such are\nvaried characteristics of gold, and yet are invariably found in a\nunified whole. The smallest speck contains them all in inseparable\nunion. By analysis or abstraction we indeed separate them, but in their\nnotion they are inseparably one. The inability of the differences,\nwhich the notion in its truth essentially possesses, to stand alone\nin their isolated self-identity is of a similar nature. A still more\napposite illustration is presented by the unique concept of the\nself-conscious Ego in its universality. For that which we call soul, or\nmore appositely the Ego, is the notion itself in its free existence.\nThe Ego contains a congeries of most distinct concepts and thoughts\nin itself; it is a world of ideas; yet none the less this infinitely\ncomplex content, in so far as it lies within the Ego, remains without\na vestige of substantiality or materiality packed within this ideal\nunity, as the pure and throughout fluid transparency of the Ego itself\nreflected to itself. And this is precisely the way in which the notion\nretains its varied determinations in ideal unity.\nThe determinants of the notion which are most cognate to the notion as\nsuch are the _universal_, the _particular_, and the _single_. Every one\nof these determinate qualities taken by itself is a mere abstraction.\nAs thus regarded, however, abstract, that is to say, from one another,\nthey are not present in the notion: that is rather their ideal _unity._\nThe notion is therefore the universal, which, on the one hand, negates\nitself to a condition of relativity and _particularization_, but, on\nthe other, this riving asunder, in so far as it is negation of the\nuniversal, is itself again _annulled._ For the universal as present\nin the particular, which itself is only the particular aspects of the\n_universal_ itself is present in no particular absolutely, but rather\nin that very particular reaffirms once more its essential unity as\nuniversal. In this return upon itself the notion is infinite negation;\nnegation, I mean, not as against another, but self-determination, in\nwhich alone it subsists in its positive and correlative unity. In this\nway it is _singularity_ in its truth; it is the universal nexus which\nshuts itself up with itself in its particulars. As the highest example\nof this property of the notion we would refer back to what we have\nalready, if in a summary way, said about the essential activity of\nSpirit.\nThrough this infinite capacity of return upon itself the notion is\nalready, by virtue of its intrinsic wealth, totality. It finds the\nunity of itself in the being of another, and for this reason possesses\na free activity, being, however, negation as self-determination, not\nas the alien limitation of its own substance through something other\nthan itself. But regarded as such totality the notion is already in\npotential possession of all phenomenal reality, and is that which\nmediates and restores the unity of the Idea. And whoever ventures\nto think that in the Idea we have presented to us something totally\ndifferent and apart from the notion, has as little knowledge of the\nnature of the Idea as he has of the notion. At the same time there\nis, no doubt, a difference between the notion and the Idea, and it\nis this: in the former the particularization is only an abstract\nparticularization, for this reason that in the notion the determinate\nrelations are alone coherent in its transparent medium, that is to say,\nin its unity and ideal universality. The notion, therefore, itself\nremains subject to the one-sidedness of its particular material, and\nis hampered with the defect that although in its own nature it is a\ntotality, yet it is only in the aspect of it as unity and universality\nthat it is entitled to free self-development. But inasmuch as this\ndefect in its completeness is foreign to its own essential form, the\nprocess of its activity is to remove it. It negates itself as this very\nideal unity and universality and allows that which is enclosed in the\nbarren chamber of ideal subjectivity to flow forth freely into real and\nsubstantive _objectivity._ In other words, the notion through its own\nactivity posits itself as objective reality.\n(_b_) Objectivity is therefore, truly apprehended, the _real existence_\nof the _notion._ It is, however, the notion under the mode of\nself-substantive particularization and of a differentiation of all\n_antithetical_ phases[191] of reality, whose ideal unity the notion in\nits subjective capacity constituted.\nBut inasmuch as it is the _notion_, and only the notion, whose function\nit is to endow objectivity with its determinate existence and reality,\nso too it is only through objectivity that the _notion_ is unveiled in\nits actuality. The notion is, however, the mediating and _ideal unity_\nof all its particular antitheses. Within its differentiated reality\nthis ideal unity, effective throughout particularity in modes adequate\nto the notion, has to establish itself in them, precisely in a way\nsimilar to that in which the realized particularity of their unity, as\nthus mediated to the point of ideality, has also to exist in them[192].\nThis is the might of the notion, which refuses to surrender or forfeit\nits universality among the _disjecta membra_ of the objective world,\nbut rather reveals its essential unity through such reality and within\nit. For it is nothing less than the very life of the notion to preserve\nits unity in the material which is offered it. Only by so doing is it\nreal and veritable totality.\n(_c_) This totality is the _Idea._ The Idea is not simply the ideal\nunity and subjectivity of the notion. It is quite as much its true\nand objective reality; it is, however, an objectivity which does not\nconfront the notion as an opposing factor, but is rather that in\nwhich the notion itself is self-determined. In whichever aspect we\ncontemplate the notion, whether as subjective to our apprehension, or\nas objectively real, the Idea it manifests is a totality. But it is\nmore than this. It is the unity which for ever is mediating between and\nbringing into more perfected harmony the two totalities. Only as thus\napprehended is the Idea truth and indeed all truth.\n2. All that exists, then, has only truth in so far as it is a definite\nexistence of the Idea. For the Idea is alone the truly real. The truth\nof the phenomenal is not derived from the fact that its particular\nexistence is of an inward or external character, and as such is in\na general sense reality; it is so wholly in virtue of the fact that\nsuch reality is adequate to the notion. Then alone is determinate\nexistence real and true. And the truth, to which we here refer, is\nnot a _subjective_ interpretation of it, namely, that a particular\nexistence is accordant with my own conception of it. It is truth in the\nobjective sense that the reality of the Ego, or of any external object,\naction, or circumstance actually contributes to the realization of\nthe notion. If this identity is not established the existence remains\npurely phenomenal. Instead of the objectification of the notion in its\ncompleteness what obtains is purely a detached aspect of it; and with\nregard to this, whatever self-subsistence it may appear to have in\nopposition to the unity and universality of the notion, such can only\nwork to its final confusion by setting it in hostility to the true\nnotion itself. Our conclusion, therefore, is that only the reality\nwhich adequately expresses the notion is truly reality, and the reason\nit is so is that therein the Idea manifests itself as existence.\n3. We have maintained that beauty is _Idea_. It follows that\n_beauty_ and _truth_ are, in one aspect of them, _identical_. In\nother words, beauty must itself in its intrinsic being be true. A\ncloser investigation will further show to us that truth must be\n_distinguished_ from beauty.\nThe idea is true in the sense that it is so by virtue of its essential\nbeing and according to its fundamental principle[193], and as such\ntruth it is thought[194]. It is not its sensuous and external\nexistence, but the _universal_ Idea of thought as present in this. At\nthe same time the Idea is driven to seek its realization in external\nand objectively determined existence, both in the sphere of Nature\nand that of Mind. The true, in the absolute sense, also exists. And\nin so far as, in this its external existence, it is immediately\napprehended by consciousness, and the notion rests in immediate unity\nwith its external appearance, the Idea is not only true, but is also\n_beautiful._ The _beautiful_ may therefore be defined as the _sensuous\nsemblance_[195] of the Idea. For the sensuous condition and the\nobjective world generally maintain no real self-subsistence in beauty,\nbut have merely to surrender the immediacy of their _being._ In beauty\nsuch are posited simply as the determinate existence and externality\nof the notion, and as a form of reality, which itself manifests the\n_notion_ in unity with its external appearance in this its particular\nobjective existence. For this reason it can only pass as the semblance\nof the notion.\n(_a_) Accordantly with this it is impossible for the understanding[196]\nalone to grasp the significance of beauty. For inasmuch as objective\nreality is apprehended by this faculty as something at least quite\nother than ideality, sensuous perception, as something very different\nfrom the notion, the external object as something that is anywhere\nrather than within world of the conscious self, to that extent it\ncannot fail to emphasize the contradictions implied in such separation,\nrather than penetrate to the ideal unity we have above described. The\nunderstanding remains rooted in the finite, the incomplete and untrue\nabstraction. The beautiful is on the contrary itself essentially\n_infinite_ and free.\nFor although the content of beauty is stamped with particularity and\nto that extent limited, such content is essentially in its mode of\nenvironment a totality that is infinite[197] and a free existence; and\nit is both for the reason that it is the notion, which does not pass\nbeyond this its objective semblance, and so fall into finite and one\nsided abstraction with it, but rather is immersed as a blossom with\nthis its objectification and through the imminent unity and perfection\nof such inclusion is revealed as essentially infinite. With equal\ntruth we may affirm that the notion in sealing, as it were, with a\nsoul the real existence, in which it is part of the objective world,\nis itself by itself freely manifest in that world. For the notion will\nnot suffer that external existence in the sphere of beauty to follow,\nas it would otherwise, the laws that therein are paramount: rather\nit determines out of its own riches the articulation and form of its\nappearance therein; and it is precisely this harmony of the notion with\nthe mode of its external existence which constitutes the essential\nlife of beauty. And the bond which braces all together, no less than\nthe power behind it, is self-conscious life, unity, soul, and artistic\npersonality.\n(_b_) We conclude, then, that if we consider beauty in its relation to\nconscious life, on the _subjective_ side that is, it is neither to be\nadequately apprehended by an intelligence that persists in the unfree\nmedium of purely finite existence, nor is it the object of the finite\nWill. We will enlarge a little on both points.\nAs finite intelligence we are aware in feeling of the inner no less\nthan the outer objects of consciousness; we observe them, perceive\nthem to be true to our senses, allow them to form part of the content\nof our perceptions, concepts, and finally, no doubt, to become the\nabstractions which our understanding presents to us, reflecting\non their appearance, and endowing them with the abstract form of\nuniversality.\nNow the finiteness and absence of freedom inseparable from this mental\nattitude consists in the assumption that the things perceived are\nself-subsistent. We direct our attention to these objects, suffer them\nto impress us, form our ideas of them, possessed with the faith in\ntheir material existence as objects, and convinced that all we have\nto do is to perceive them as they appear to our passive reception,\nto preserve, in short, the formal side of our attention intact,\nholding such unfettered by our fancies, opinions, and prejudices.\nIn thus accepting this one-sided freedom of objects we posit at\nthe same time the want of freedom in their mental apprehension. To\nsuch the content is one wholly _given_ from outside; and instead of\na true self-determination through difference we have nothing but\nthe reception and acceptance of what is presented as a part of the\nobjective thing. We would arrive at truth by the suppression of all\nthat belongs to ourselves[198].\nA criticism of like nature, though the defect is here just at the\nother extreme, may be applied to the finite _Will._ In this theory\ninterests, objects, intentions, and conclusions are all relegated to\nthe subject, whose will it is to enforce them as against the existence\nand properties of the material thing. This it can only do by the\nannihilation of the object itself, or at least, in so far as it can\nmodify or change its form and energies, by transmuting its qualities,\nor permitting them to exercise such a change on each other, as water\nmay exercise on fire, fire on iron, iron on wood, and so forth. We now\nfind that it is the particular things, which the subject has enrolled\nin its service, as things to be regarded and treated as _useful_,\nwhich in their turn have been deprived of their self-subsistence.\nIn other words, they have come to be regarded as objects, whose\nnotion and meaning is not their own, but derived from the reflecting\nconsciousness, so that what is most essential to them is precisely this\nrelation of service in which they stand to the subjective purpose, that\nis, our own intelligence. The values of either side of the relation\nare thus completely reversed. The objective thing has lost freedom and\nthe conscious subject secured it. As a matter of fact, the freedom\non _both_ aspects of the relation is, owing to the finitude and\nabstraction it implies under such a view, a purely supposititious one.\nIn the sphere of _theory_ here it is the assumed independence of the\nobjective world which creates the finitude and bondage of the conscious\nEgo. In that of the practical world this dependence is due to its\none-sidedness, the conflict and contradiction of its aims within and\nthe impulses and passions which press from without, no less than to\nthe unreconciled opposition of a world of objects. For the separation\nand opposition of these two aspects of one whole, that is, objects\nand relating self-conscious life, is presupposed in, and indeed is an\naccurate definition of, this point of view.\nAnd, similarly, with reference to the lack of freedom in the object.\nHere, too, in the sphere of intelligible conception, the independence\nof the object is assumed, but the freedom assumed is only apparent. For\nit is only posited as bare objectivity without securing the presence\nof its notion, as the unity and universality of the conscious subject,\nwithin such objectivity. It still remains outside it. Every object thus\nplaced external to the notion merely exists as particularity, which\ncomes back to us in external guise together with its manifold, and\nis, in all the unlimited scope of its relations, through its contact\nwith other objects, subject to the conditions of its origin, change,\nopposing force and final overthrow. In the _practical_ world the\ndependence of the object is expressly, in this view, assumed, and the\nopposition of the thing is posited in definite relation to volition\nwithout possessing in itself the power of ultimate self-subsistency\npermitted to the latter.\n(_c_) The apprehension of the object as _beautiful_ unites these two\nabstract points of view. It in fact annuls the one-sidedness of both\nwhether relatively to the subject of consciousness or its object, and\nby doing so cancels the finitude and lack of freedom which characterize\nthem.\nPhilosophically regarded[199], the reason is this, that the object is\nnot apprehended in its existence as an isolated thing whose notion\nas the object of human thought is removed from the objectivity which\nbelongs to it as something outside it, and which in its particular\nreality extends and is dissipated in every conceivable direction\nas a manifold content of intelligible relations. An object which\nis beautiful suffers its own notion to appear as realized in its\nobjective presence, and reveals in that appearance the unity and life\ninseparable from the conscious subject. For this reason the object may\nbe conceived as sweeping back into the curve of its unity that impulse\nof continuous externality, cancelling its dependence on other objects,\nand transmuting to our vision its unfree finitude into free infinity.\nFurthermore, the Ego in its relation to the object of beauty ceases\nto be merely the abstract attention or sensuous perception, and the\nfloating away of such perceptions into equally abstract reflections.\nRather, it is itself concretely realized in this object, being at once\nthe unity and reality of its notional idea, and uniting for itself\nin its rounded concreteness that which has hitherto remained, as\nabstractly perceived, apart in the Ego of the subject of perception and\nthe thing perceived.\nComing now to the practical import of this relation as it applies to\nthe object of beauty, we have already drawn attention to the fact at\nsome length, that in the contemplation of it the element of sensuous\npassion drops away. All personal impulse that the individual may\nfeel toward the object is done away with through that very aesthetic\ncontemplation, which regards it as self-subsistent in itself, in other\nwords, its own object. For this reason, the purely finite relation\nof the object also disappears, the relation, that is, in which it\nsubserved, as a means for their realization, aims which were foreign\nto it, and towards the fulfilment of which it was either presented\nas unfree or was compelled to take up, however strange, into its\nown existence. At the same time that relation of the Ego in the\npractical world which we found to be unfree disappears, inasmuch as it\ndifferentiates itself no longer in subjective motives and their means\nor material, remaining fixed in the finite relation of the formal\n\"ought\" for the carrying out of its subjective ends in the object, but\nis here confronted with the notion and its aim completely realized.\nWe may say, then, that the aesthetic contemplation of the beautiful is\na liberal education, a portrayal of the object in its free and infinite\nbeing, with no detracting consideration of its use or employment\nfor finite wants and purposes. Further, the _object_ as a _thing of\nbeauty_ is neither under force or compulsion at our hands, nor is it\nin conflict with and overcome by other things outside it. It is of the\nessence of beauty that the notion, end and soul thereof, no less than\nits existent form, and variety generally, manifest themselves out of\ntheir own intrinsic wealth rather than through the energy of something\noutside them. The reason of this lies in the fact, already insisted\nupon, that their truth consists solely in the unity and harmony of\ntheir notion with their objective existence. And inasmuch as the notion\nis itself concrete totality, its objective reality also appears as\na manifestation of the same, homogeneous in all its parts, which,\nas thus imbedded in the notion, appear to fall into such ideal unity\nand animation. For this harmony of the notion and its envisagement is\nnothing less than perfected suffusion[200]. Accordingly the exterior\nform and shape is manifested, not as such by its separation from other\nmaterial, or as an impression mechanically related to aims which\nare foreign to it, but as the form of reality wherein the notion\naccommodates itself out of its own stuff and substance. Finally,\nhowever much the particular aspects, parts or articulations of the\nbeautiful object are presented in the ideal unity of the notion and\nits unified envisagement, that harmony must be so rendered visible to\nsense, that in relation to one another they preserve the semblance of\nself-subsistent freedom; in other words they must not only possess the\nideal unity of the _notion as such_, but must reflect back the side\nof a reality which is substantially objective also. Both aspects, in\nshort, must be present in beautiful objects; for these are, on the\none hand, the _necessity_ posited through the notion and discovered\nin the harmonious conclusion of these particular aspects, and on the\nother, the envisagement of their freedom as essentially one with the\nwhole, and _not merely_ that of the _unity_ which exists between the\nparts. Necessity in its full definition means the just relation of\nthe two aspects, which coalesce so completely that to posit one is to\nposit the other. Such a necessity must unquestionably be present in\nbeautiful objects. It is not, however, under the mode of necessity that\nit appears; rather it should conceal itself beneath the semblance of\nunintentional accident. Otherwise the particular parts of such a real\npresence lose the position they should occupy according to their own\nreal existence, and only appear in the service of their ideal unity, to\nwhich they therefore remain in abstract subordination.\nIn virtue of the freedom and infinitude above analysed, which is\ninherent in the notion of beauty, whether we view it in its objective\npresence as a thing of beauty, or under its aesthetic contemplation, we\ndisengage the province of the beautiful from the relations of finite\ncondition, to exalt it into that of the Idea and its truth.\n[Footnote 188: This is, of course, a note of Hegel himself.]\n[Footnote 189: This, of course, has reference to Hegel's unfortunate\nbelief in Goethe's theory of colour.]\n[Footnote 190: Mediated (_vermittelt_), because the concrete is first\napprehended through its differences, and only after reflection do we\narrive at the notional unity which transcends and unites them.]\n[Footnote 191: _Momente._ Phases asserted and reconciled in the evolved\nnotional unity, organic or otherwise.

The most elementary form of existence, which the\nIdea take to itself is _Nature_, and the first form of beauty is that\nof _Nature._\nA. THE BEAUTY OF NATURE AS SUCH\n1. In the world of Nature we must distinguish between the modes\naccording to which the notion becomes existent reality in order to be\npart of the Idea.\n(_a_) In the _first_ place the notion is absorbed so immediately in\npure objectivity, that, in its character of subjective and ideal\nunity, it wholly fails to assert itself, and passes over instead as a\nthing without a soul into the raw _materia_ presented to sense. The\npurely mechanical or physical bodies in their isolated singularity\nare of this order. A particular metal is, for example, essentially no\ndoubt a manifold of mechanical and physical qualities; every part of\nit, however, has such qualities equally in itself. Such a body not\nmerely fails to possess any entire articulation of its parts in the\nsense that every one of its different parts receives for itself a\nparticular material existence, but even the negative ideal unity of\nsuch differentiation is absent, which might assert itself as animating\nprinciple[201]. The difference here is a purely abstract multiplicity,\nand the unity posited the indifferent equilibrium of identical\nqualities.\nThis is the first mode of the existence of the notion. The differences\nhere receive no independent existence, and the ideal unity is not found\nas ideality. For this reason such isolated bodies are essentially\ndefective and abstract existences.\n(_b_) Natural objects of a higher order suffer the differences asserted\nby the notion to appear as free, so that each one as external to\nanother is itself independently existent. Here we have for the first\ntime the true character of objectivity. Objectivity is just this\nindependent assertion of the segregated differences determined by the\nnotion. On this plane of existence the notion asserts itself in such a\nway that it is at least a totality of its differences, which is truly\nrealized, in so far as the particular bodies, while they each severally\npossess independent existence for themselves, are at the same time\nmembers of _one inclusive system._ Of such a character is the solar\nsystem. In one aspect of them the sun, comets, moon, and planets appear\nas independent heavenly bodies apart from one another; in another,\nhowever, they derive their definite character from being parts of\none system of such material bodies. Not only their specific modes of\nmotion, but also their physical qualities, are only to be deduced from\ntheir relation to this system. This nexus which binds them together\nconstitutes that inward unity which relates these particular existences\ntogether in one whole.\nBut further than this, in this conception of system the operation of\nthe notion is not exhausted in the _existent unity_ of independent\nbodies as essential parts of it. For just as the differences are real\nthe unity which relates them to the totality has to assert itself\nas real. This unity, in other words, differentiates itself from\nthe multifold particularity of those objective bodies of which it\nis the integrating principle. And on this plane of existence it is\ndifferentiated therefore itself against such a particularity as real,\nindependent and objective existence. In the solar system the sun exists\nover against all particularity related to that system, as such a unity\nof the system.\nSuch a material existence of the ideal unity of the notion is still\nvery defective; for whereas on the one hand we have this unity posited\nin its reality only as the relation or material connection between the\nseverally independent bodies, on the other we have it posited as a\nbody which belongs to that system, whose unity, in opposition to its\nreal differences, it essentially represents. The sun, in short, which\nwe take to be[202] the soul of the system, has itself an independent\nentity apart from the members which form the explicit content of this\nsoul. It is itself only _one_ particular mode or phase of the notion,\nthat, namely, of unity in its _difference_ from the actual separation\nof the several parts, a unity which remains outside itself, and is\nconsequently abstract. For however much the sun by virtue of its\nphysical quality is plainly a principle of unity, the illuminating\nbody as such, this is after all merely an abstract identity. For light\nis simple, undifferentiated appearance and nothing more. We find\ntherefore in the solar system the unity of the notion indeed objective,\nand the totality of its differences explicitly realized, each body\nmaking visible _one_ particular phase[203] of the notion; but here,\ntoo, it lies absorbed in its objective reality, and it fails to assert\nitself in such material as is truly inherent and explicit ideality.\nThe form of its existence which here prevails remains the independent\nsegregation of its particular phasal units[204].\nIt is, however, essential to the true existence of the notion, that the\n_differences_ of the objectively real, the reality, that is to say, of\nthe separate independent parts and the equally independent unity that\nis therein objectively realized, should as such be together brought\nback into unity. Only thus such a totality of innate differences can\nmake wholly explicit either the notion as the realized differentiation\nof its characteristics, or at the same time release each particular\nthat belongs to it from the element of isolated independence which it\ncancels by enabling the ideality, in which these differences recover\ntheir subjective unity, to assert itself fully as the universal\nprinciple of their animated being. In that case they become no longer\n_parts_ hanging loosely to one another by a bond that still leaves\ntheir particularity unaffected, but genuine _members_ of one body.\nThey no longer possess an existence in their isolated singularity,\nbut retain such truly in the ideal unity which binds them together.\nOnly in such an organic articulation the ideal unity of the notion is\npresent to the parts thus integrated. It is at once their support and\nimmanent soul; here for the first time the notion is not overwhelmed in\nobjective reality, but passes over into actual existence as the inward\nidentity and universality, which it essentially is.\n(_c_) But this _third_ mode of Nature's manifestation is a determinate\nexistence of the _Idea_, and the Idea as thus manifested in Nature\nis _Life._ Dead or inorganic nature is not adequate to express the\nIdea; only the organic life of Nature unfolds its reality. For in life\nwe shall find, _first_, that the objective reality of the notion as\ndifferentiated is presented as such reality; _secondly_, however, that\nthe negation of such differences is entirely one of distinction in that\nreality[205], the ideal subjectivity of the notion overcoming to itself\nthis very reality; _thirdly_, the unifying principle of animation is\nnow the positive appearance of the notion in the form of its bodily\nsubstance, that is to say, the form of infinity, which is sufficiently\npowerful to assert itself thus formally in its content.\n(_\u03b1_) If we ask ordinary consciousness[206] for a definition of Life,\nwe have two determinations presented, either the imaginative conception\nof it as bodily life, or as soul-life. In the same view we distinguish\nthese two determinations with qualities peculiarly belonging to each.\nThis _contrast_ we set up between soul and body is also of great\nimportance in the more philosophical consideration of our subject. And\nit is no less part of our inquiry to investigate it. At the same time\nwe would point out that the philosophical interest concentrates itself\nquite as much on the _unity_ which exists between soul and body, a part\nof this inquiry which a really adequate survey of the subject has at\nall times found beset with the greatest difficulties. It is, however,\nprecisely in virtue of this unity that Life is the first genuine\nappearance of the Idea in Nature. We must consequently apprehend the\nidentity of soul and body as no fortuitous connection[207], but a\nunion of profounder significance. In other words, we must recognize\nthe body and its members as the objective existence of the notion\nitself in systematic articulation, which in the members of the living\norganism, secures an objective existence for its determinate features,\nanalogously no doubt, if on a higher plane, to the facts presented\nby the solar system. Within this real existence the notion asserts\nitself in like manner as the ideal unity of all these determinate\nparts. This ideal unity is the soul. The soul is the substantive unity\nand interfused universality which is no less a simple relation of\nself-determining than it is ideal Being-for-itself or self-coherent\ntotality. This is the higher view of the union between soul and body.\nTo put it in other words both are not merely distinct aspects set side\nby side; they are one and the same totality of identical determinants.\nJust as the Idea generally can only be grasped in its explicit reality\nas the notion evolving itself as such[208], in which conception the\ndifferentiation and unity of both sides, that is both the notion and\nits objective reality, are inseparably present, in the same way Life\nmust be conceived as the unity of both soul and body.\nAnd further, the subjective no less than substantive unity of soul\nwithin the body is presented us and exemplified in Feeling. The feeling\nof a living organism is, that is to say, not merely an independent\nproduct of a particular member, but it is also this ideal and simple\nunity of the entire organism. It is carried through every member of\nthe body is felt throughout in more than a hundred places at once; and\nindeed, to put it shortly, rather than saying there are many thousand\nsensitive points[209] in a single organism we should more justly say\nthere is but one, namely, the subject of consciousness. And inasmuch\nas the animating principle of organic Nature includes in itself this\ndistinction between the real existence of the organic members, and the\nabstract or simple self-coherence within such parts, which we call the\ngrowing soul, mediating between them both by virtue of its inherent\nunity, such a principle of Life stands on a higher plane than that of\ninorganic Nature. Only with Life is the Idea existent, and only thus is\nthe Idea truth. No doubt even in the organic world this truth can be\nextinguished. We find the body unable to perfect its essential ideality\nand animating energy. Such is the case in disease. Here we find the\nnotion deprived of its controlling sovereignty, and other powers are\npotent with it. Such a life is, however, defective and crippled: it\nmerely continues, because the inadequacy of reality to the notion has\nnot reached the point of absolute contradiction; it is still only\nrelatively valid. Once assume that all harmony between the two sides is\nbroken, that all genuine articulation of the members of the body and\ntheir true identity has dropped away, and life is dissolved in death.\nThe several members are now mere appendages to each other, with no\nprinciple of Life to hold them in unsevered unity.\n(_\u03b2_) We must add that when we stated the soul is the totality of the\nnotion regarded as the subjective and ideal unity, the body on the\nother hand, as distinguished by its members, is the same totality\nbut rather in its material aspect as the juxtaposition and sensuous\naccretion of all the several parts, affirming at the same time that\nboth soul and body are posited as _one_ in the living organism, there\nis no doubt something contradictory in the statement. For the ideal\nunity, so far from being this material juxtaposition of parts, in which\neach particularity possesses its independent consistency and exclusive\ncharacter, is rather in direct antithesis to such external reality.\nThat what is diametrically opposed should nevertheless be identical is\nobviously a contradiction in terms. The man, however, who declares the\nnon-existence of anything from the fact that it carries in our notion\nof it a contradiction which implies the identity of opposed antitheses,\nsimply excludes Life itself from the idea of existence. For the force\nof Life and still more the power of Spirit (mind) consists in this\nvery movement, namely, to assert the law of contradiction inherent\nwithin them, to bear the burden thereof and to overcome it. This\naffirmation and resolution of the contradiction which obtains between\nthe ideal unity and material juxtaposition of the members, constitutes\nthe appointed _process_ of life itself. And Life is simply _process._\nAnd this process of life includes an activity which has two distinct\nfunctions. On the one hand it has continually to affirm the material\nexistence of the physical distinctions[210] among the members of the\norganism thus determined; on the other, just in proportion as such\ndistinctions grow obdurate in their independent particularity, and tend\nto remain fixed in absolute separation from each other, it has to make\ngood once more that universal ideality, which is the principle of their\nlife. This is the idealism of Life's process. Philosophy is not the\nonly idealism; far from it. Nature herself in her domain of actuality\ncreates in the life-process just that which the philosophy of idealism\ncompletes in the world of contemplative thought. Only where we have\nthese two aspects of one activity, that is, the constant realization\nof the corporeal definition of the organism no less than the synthetic\naffirmation of such material presentment in the ideal unity, which\nit is as one with the notion[211], then and only then we have the\ncompleted process of Life, whose more primitive forms[212], however,\nthis is not the place to discuss. Through this unity of Life's energy\nin both its branches all the members of the organism are up held in\ntheir integrity, and continually flushed anew with the ideality of\ntheir life. This ideality is furthermore declared by the organic parts\nin the fundamental law of their being, that this unity of Life is not\nso much an accidental quality as, on the contrary, the substance of it.\nIn this alone they are able to preserve their specific character. This\nit is which precisely constitutes the difference between the part of a\nmere conglomerate and the member of an organism. The particular parts\nof a house, for example, the stones, windows, and so forth, remain just\nwhat they are, whether they form part of the structure of a house,\nor whether they do not. Their relationship to one another is quite\nindifferent, and the conceptual notion remains in their case a purely\nexternal form, which possesses no life in these parts raising them to\nthe ideality of a subjective unity.\nThe members of an organism have, it is true, an external reality, but\nfor all that it is the notion of Life which constitutes the inward,\nnay, the characteristic being of such reality, a reality which is not\nexpressed through one external form uniting them, but in the ideal\ncoherence of their parts in one living whole. For this reason the limbs\nhave no such reality as belongs to the stones of a building, or the\nplanets, moon, and comets in the solar system. Their reality is one\nwholly within the content of the organism, and all appearance to the\ncontrary is, as such, ideally imposed on them. Dissever the hand from\nthe body and it loses its independent existence as a member of the\norganism which made it what it was. Its activity, form, and colour,\nall that constitutes it, is at once changed; it enters the process of\ncorruption, and ultimately ceases to exist[213]. Consistent character\nit only possesses as a limb of organic life, reality only in constant\nreunion with that ideal unity which sustains it. And that is just the\nsuperior mode of reality which the living organism possesses in itself.\nThe real or positive is for ever being set up as both the negation\nof itself and withal the ideal resumption of itself, such ideality\nconstituting, in fact, both the maintenance and specific character of\nthe mode under which each of the separate parts of the bodily presence\nare associated together.\n(_\u03b3_) The reality, then, which the Idea wins for itself in the life\nof Nature is reality as a phenomenal process. Such an _appearance_\nstated in its simplest terms is this, that a reality exists, but its\npotential being[214] is not immediately in its possession, rather it is\nat the same time negatively affirmed[215] in the particular form that\nbelongs to it. The negation of the immediately external and particular\nmembers of a body is not only a negative relative relation as the\nactivity of the inherent idealization[216], but is as such a positive\nrealization[217].\nHitherto we have considered the particular objects of the real as\npositive in their self-exclusive particularity. This independence,\nhowever, is negated in the living object, and the ideal unity asserted\nwithin the bodily organism is alone found to assert over itself the\nfull force of positive determination. Such a positive ideality in\nthe principle of negation it asserts is the soul. On the appearance\nof the soul in the body we have at once such an affirmative presence\nas the one indicated. The soul not merely asserts itself as a power\nagainst the subdivision of the bodily members, it is their plastic\ncreator[218], which preserves as inward and ideal that which is\nexternally minted in the shape of physical members. And consequently\nit is this very positive and ideal inward[219] which appears in the\nouter structure; in other words, the external, so far as it is a mere\nexternal, is a mere abstraction, a mere aspect that is untrue for\nthe whole. In organic life the external we are confronted with is an\nexternality through which the inward is made visible. The outward, that\nis to say, declares itself in its potential nature as that inward,\nwhich is its notion. Further to this notion appertains the reality\nin which it as notion is made visible. Inasmuch, however, as in the\nobjective world the notion, strictly as such, is the principle of\nsubjective life and self-determined life becoming _explicit_ in its\nown objective reality[220], life exists only as a _living thing_, an\nindividual subject. It is only with life thus concentrated to a point\nthat we find this negating _centrum_ of unity. And it is negative in\nthis sense that the ideal explicitly self-unified totality[221] can\nonly now stand forth in its reality by virtue of this principle of\nideality being asserted through the differentiation of its positive\npresence, together with which the ideal unity of such totality is at\nthe same time incorporated. It is of the greatest importance to make\nclear this aspect of the principle of subjectivity. It is only as the\nsingle living thing thus unified by such a principle that life is\nactually present.\nIf we inquire further in what manner the Idea is manifested within the\nactual life of such living individuals our survey will be as follows:\n_first_, this principle of Life will be realized as the totality of an\norganism possessing bodily shape; _secondly_, this physical shape is\nnot presented as a rigid product[222], but as a continous process of\nideal generation, in which a living soul asserts itself. _Thirdly_,\nthe changes and determinations through which this totality passes\nare not imposed externally to it, but are changes of form which are\nevolved from its inherent nature, imposed on itself and for itself, in\na process wherein it stands self-determined as the subjective unity no\nless than the ultimate end of its being.\nThis free self-subsistence of the subjective principle of life is\nespecially exemplified in the spontaneous motion of a living organism.\nThe inanimate bodies of inorganic Nature are fettered to the conditions\nof Space, which limits them to one place, or they are only moved from\nit by external forces. The motion, in short, does not originate in\nthemselves; and, when it is visible upon them, it appears as an energy\nwhich is foreign to them, to remove which the only force they exert\nis that of reaction. And if the motion of the planets with similar\nphenomena appear to be otherwise produced, such are at least wholly\nfettered by natural laws and their abstract necessity. The living\nanimal, on the contrary, in its freedom of motion, negatives this\nenforced limitation to one spot by virtue of its own activity. It is\nthrough such self-determination the continuous liberation of itself\nfrom the material isolation. And for the same reason it is in this\nfreedom of motion, if only in a subordinate degree, the release of\nitself from the former abstractness referable to the particular modes\nof motion, their direction and their speed. Under a yet closer view,\nmoreover, the animal, regarded by itself in its organism, presents the\nsame sensuous matter that is moved; and here, too, life is as before a\nfreedom of motion within this organic reality, evidenced in the flow of\nblood and the movement of the limbs.\nMotion, however, is not the only expression of animated life. The free\ntones of the voice of animals, which are unknown in the inorganic\nworld, where bodies merely roar and clatter through the blow of objects\nexternal to them, these already present to us the higher expression\nof animated subjectivity. The most intimate and vital expression of\nsuch ideal activity is, however, brought before us when we find the\nliving individual able to concentrate itself as individuality over\nagainst the objective world, while at the same time it appropriates\nand transfigures that world _for its own._ And this is accomplished in\npart through observation by means of vision, and partly for practical\npurposes, in so far as such an individual brings the outer world\ninto subjection to himself, utilizes the same, assimilates it as a\nmeans of nourishment, and in this manner continually reproduces his\nindividuality in that objective _alterum._ Such a process, of course,\nas it ascends through stronger organisms, assumes more and more\nemphatic degrees of unsatisfied desire, assimilation, satisfaction, or\nsatiety.\nSuch, then, are the activities, in which the notion of animated life\nmakes itself apparent. Moreover, the principle of Ideality thus\nrendered visible is not merely the result of _our_ reflection; it\nis _objectively_ real itself in the living subject, whose existence\nconsequently we may go so far as to call an objective idealism. And\nit is the soul, as before stated, which, as this ideal energy, brings\nabout its own manifestation[223], always reducing the _purely_ external\nreality of the body to an appearance, and thereby affirming itself as\nobjective totality in that very bodily shape.\n2. Now it is as the Idea made objectively visible to the senses that\nthe animated life of Nature is _beautiful_; in so far, that is to\nsay, as the truth or the Idea, presented in the form of Nature, where\nunder it first appears, in other words life, is immediately given in\nthe particular shape of reality adequate to it. Owing, however, to its\nsensuous immediacy the living beauty of Nature is neither beautiful\n_for itself_ nor is the beauty strictly that which is _the outcome_ of\nitself, a product, that is, of its purely objective appearance. The\nbeauty of Nature is only beautiful for another, that is _for us_, the\nconsciousness that apprehends its beauty. The question therefore arises\nin what way and by virtue of what characteristics the principle of life\nappears to us beautiful in its _immediate_ existence.\n(_a_) If we look at the practical way in which a living object\nbecomes visible and preserves itself, the first thing which rivets\nour attention is _spontaneous motion._ This motion, regarded simply\nas motion, is nothing more than the entirely abstract freedom of\nmotion from place to place and from time to time, which we find\nexemplified in the spontaneous, but entirely haphazard movements of\nanimal life. In music and the dance we have, it is true, motion in\nits generic significance; but here motion is not merely a matter of\nchance and impulse, but it exhibits the laws which regulate it; it\nis defined, complete in itself and subject to measure; and it is all\nthis, though we still abstract from it the significance whereof it is\nthe beautiful expression. If we again interpret the motion of animals\nas the realization of an aim originating within themselves, this\nexcited impulse is still entirely accidental, an end of most restricted\nimport. If we further extend our survey and conceive such motion as\nthe activity and working together of all parts of the animal organism\ntowards a definite purpose, we shall merely find that such a conception\nis rendered possible by our own effort of imagination[224]. The case is\njust the same if we reflect upon the way in which an animal gratifies\nits physical wants, obtains nourishment through the organs which\ngrasp it, consume it, digest it, and generally is a subject of the\nprocess which preserves its life. For in this case also we have either\nonly before us single desires and their spontaneous and haphazard\ngratification, in which the inward activity[225] of the organism is not\npresent at all, or at least all these activities and their means of\nexpression have become the subject of our imaginative reflection, which\nis at pains to understand such a process by relating it to definite\nends, and to establish a harmony between aims assumed to belong to the\nanimal itself and the organs which fulfill them.\nWe shall rather find that neither the sensuous perception of single\nhaphazard appetites, arbitrary movements and efforts towards\nself-satisfaction, nor the fanciful consideration of the animal\norganism as one directed by purpose will present to us purely animal\nlife as a part of the beauty of Nature. The beauty consists in the\nappearance of individual form, both in repose and motion, quite apart\nfrom the relation of its self-gratification to any purpose thus\nsubserved, as it is apart from the entirely isolated contingency of\nself-imposed movement[226]. Such beauty is related to the _form_ alone,\nbecause it is only as such that it is the external appearance, in which\nthe objective idealism of the principle of life makes itself known\nto us as a thing perceived and contemplated upon through the senses.\nThought apprehends this \"objective idealism\" in the medium of its\nnotion, appropriating the same in the element of _universality_ which\nbelongs to it, albeit the contemplation of its beauty is inseparably\nbound with its _phenomenal reality._ And this reality is the external\nform of the articulated organism, which is, in our view of it, quite\nas much determinate particularity as it is a semblance, namely, that\nof the physical manifold of the separate members, which can only form\npart of the concrete totality of the _living form_ under the guise of\nphenomenal appearance.\n(_b_) From the explanation of the notion of life already given we\nmay deduce more narrowly the form of this appearance as follows. The\nform is one of spatial extension, limitation, and configuration,\ndistinguished through its various shape, colour, and motion, being, in\nfact, a manifold of such distinctions. If, however, the organism which\nmanifests these differences is a living organism, it will inevitably\nappear that the organism does not derive its true existence from such\na _manifold_ and its physical configurations. This is brought about by\nthe fact that the different parts, which are apprehended by us through\nthe senses, are at the same time conjoined together in one totality;\nthey appear consequently as the _members_ of one individual existence,\nwhich is a unity of such differences, and which not merely possesses\nthem in their difference, but as parts of one homogeneous whole.\n(_\u03b1_) In the first place, however, this unity will assert itself as\nthe _purposeless_ identity of such differences, that is to say with\nno abstract relation to any causal end whatever. The parts in such\na case are not rendered visible to sense merely as a means to or in\nthe service of some defined purpose, nor are they able to fix the\ndeterminate relation of form and structure which they occupy one over\nagainst the other.\n(_\u03b2_) Rather the contrary is the case, for, in the _second_ place, the\nbodily members have for our sense-perception the appearance of being\nquite _accidental_ in their form; in other words the determination of\none appears to be quite indifferent to that of another. In other words,\nwe can never conclude because one has a certain form another will have\nthe same, as would be the case if a material uniformity was clear\nbetween them. Where uniformity is the rule an abstract determination\nof some kind of form, size, or whatever it may be, is the property\nof all parts. The windows of a building, for example, are all of one\nsize, or at least are placed together in one row. Or we may illustrate\nthe same similarity with the uniform worn by all soldiers belonging\nto one regiment. We have various parts of such clothing differing in\ncolour, texture and the rest, but their formal opposition is no matter\nof chance; each has its causal connection with some other; it is\nthere because the other is there. Neither is there here any complete\ndistinction of form, nor any unique independence wholly asserted. With\nthe individual organism of life the case is entirely otherwise. Here\nevery part is absolutely distinguished; the nose from the forehead, the\nmouth from the cheek, the breast from the neck, the arms from the legs,\nand so on. Inasmuch as for our sense-perception every member possesses\nits unique form rather than one which belongs to another, or one which\nis determined by that of another, the members appear as self-subsistent\nparts, and for this reason free and spontaneous[227]. For the material\njuxtaposition of the parts alone throws no light upon their particular\nform.\n(_\u03b3_) _Thirdly_, it is obvious there must be for our imaginative\nperception a more inward bond of connection present in the\nself-subsistence of the organism, if the unity is not offered us in\nits rational, spatial, temporal, or quantitative relations such as\nare presented in the examples of uniformity referred to, which, as we\nhave seen, the unique particularity of the parts can extinguish. This\nidentity is not sensuous and immediately present to perception in the\nway the distinction between the members is presented; it is rather a\nsecret and _inward_ bond of necessity and harmonious relation between\nthe members and their form. If it were only inward, quite out of\nreach of our vision, such a necessary unity would be apprehended only\nin thought, removed from our sense-perception altogether. In such a\ncase, however, it would fail to enter into the beautiful object of our\nvision, and what we found as such in the living, object would cease to\nbe the Idea in its own objective and phenomenal reality. Such a unity\nmust consequently enter into what is externally perceived, although it\nis, as the ideal principle of life within it, not entirely apparent\nto sense or confined in spatial dimensions. It appears in fact in\nthe individual totality as the universal ideality of its members,\nconstituting thus the fundamental basis which supports and holds them\ntogether, the subject of the living subject. And this subjective unity\nin organic life finds its first direct expression in feeling. In the\nemotional life the Soul finds its true expression as _Soul._ For\nsoul the mere juxtaposition of limbs have no real truth, and in the\npresence of its subjective ideality the purely spatial multiplicity\nof external configuration ceases to exist. Such a manifold, with its\nunique differentiations, its organic articulation of parts[228] is\nno doubt presupposed; but when and in so far as the soul expresses\nitself through such in feeling the more inward unity ever-present\nto life asserts itself equally as the dissolution of all absolute\nindependence between the physical parts, which reveal now not merely\ntheir _materia_, but also that wave of animation which fuses all in\ntheir soul.\n(_c_) To start with, however, we must observe that the emotional\nexpression of soul-life neither offers us the visual impression of any\nnecessary inter-dependence between the separate members, nor indeed the\nperception of an identity which is necessary between such _physical_\narticulation and the _subjective_ unity conferred on it by simple\nfeeling. We will investigate this more narrowly.\n(_\u03b1_) If indeed the form and only the form renders in some way visible\nthis inward harmony and its necessity, it may be because we look\nupon this juxtaposition as the _habitual_ relation of such members,\na connection which brings to our view some specific type and the\noft-repeated formal exemplifications of such a type. But the necessity\nof custom is after all only a _subjective necessity._[229] According\nto such a principle we may find certain animals ugly for no other\nreason than that we find in them an organism which differs from our\nordinary experience, or runs contrary to it. For this reason we call\nthe organisms of certain animals bizarre in so far as the way in which\ntheir organs are related together is foreign to what is more common to\nour experience or entirely contradicts it. Fishes whose bodies are in\nsize out of all proportion to their length of tail, or those in which\nwe find eyes together on one side of the head only, are an example. In\nthe world of plants we are already prepared to find many such strange\ndepartures from type, although the cactus with its spines, and the more\nrectilinear shaping of its angular junctures[230] may still arouse our\nwonder. The more a man is educated, however, in all branches of natural\nhistory, the more able he will be to recognize in their truth the\nsubordination of all parts of organic life, and carry in the memory the\ngreatest variety of types in their proper classification, and the less\nanything he may observe will surprise him.\n(_\u03b2_) A profounder penetration into this correlation of the parts will,\nhowever, in the _second_ place, tend to give us that truer insight\ncompetent to determine from one of the parts the entire form to which\nit must belong. Cuvier is a famous example of such aptitude: a man\nof science, who by the examination of a single bone, whether fossil\nor otherwise, was able to specify at once by its characteristics the\nkind of animal to which it belonged. An excellent illustration this of\n_ex ungue leonem._ So from a claw or a thigh bone we may discover the\nconformation of the teeth, or _vice versa_ from the teeth that of the\nhip-bone, or that of the vertebral column. Such a profound synthesis\nof the type and the knowledge it implies carries us, however, beyond\nhabitual experience only. We must assume, to render it possible,\nprevious thought and the systematic arrangement of the isolated facts\nof science. Our example Cuvier had no doubt secured from previous\nexperience a determinate content and some specific quality which\nprevailed in each generic conception, and asserted itself as a unity\nof principle in all particulars however distinct, and so enabled\nhim to recognize their affinity. Such a specific quality is that of\nflesh-eating, which is then the determinating principle of the form of\nthe other members of the organism to which it belongs. A flesh-eating\nanimal requires teeth and jaws of exceptional vigour; when hunting it\nwill require claws to seize its prey, mere hoofs are insufficient. Here\nin short is a quality which necessarily determines for us the form and\nprinciple of affinity among all the organic members. A conception of\nsuch a typical character is the ordinary one we form of the strength\nof an eagle or a lion. We may no doubt find something both beautiful\nand instructive[231] in this way of regarding the animal world, in so\nfar as we derive from it some unified idea of its configuration, which\nis not a mere repetition of that unity in all the parts, but gives\nfull value to the distinctions they possess. For all that it must be\nremembered the dominant factor of this survey is not the _perception\nof our senses_, but the generic _thought_ of our minds with which it\nis made to conform. Reviewed in this light we ought not to say that we\nfind the object as such _beautiful_, but rather attribute that beauty\nto the _reflection_ of our own minds upon it. And if we examine these\nreflections more closely we shall find they are after all a deduction\nof our principle of unity from a limited aspect of the organic whole.\nWe concentrate our attention, for example, on the mode in which\nit is nourished, _i.e._, whether such an animal is carnivorous or\nherbivorous. Through such a limited determination we are still removed\nfrom a vision of the coalescent unity of the whole we identified with\nthe notion, the soul itself.\n(_\u03b3_) The truth is we can only, in this sphere, bring before our\nconsciousness the entire unity of life by means of our thought and\ngrasp of reason. In the natural world the _soul_, in its full activity,\nis not found; that is to say, the subjective unity, in its pure\nideality, does not exist there for a self-consciousness.\nIf, however, by means of thought, we endeavour to grasp the nature of\nsoul-life according to its essential notion we shall find two aspects\nunder which we may regard it; first, as the form subject to such a\nprinciple of animation; secondly, as the notion of soul for thought\nin all that the conception implies. Such a complete grasp of its true\nnature is not possible in the sensuous perception of the objects of\nbeauty. Such must neither pass before us as thought, nor must we\nallow the interest of Thought as such to form a barrier of difference\nor opposition between itself and the vision revealed to us. We are\nleft, then, with no alternative but to consider, under this point of\nview, the object as wholly presented to sense; we must assume that in\nthe sphere of Nature a _sensuous_ perception of the natural form is\nour genuine mode of contemplating the beautiful. \"Sense,\" that is the\nmaster-key[232] to the position; a word which in itself is interpreted\nin two opposed senses. In the first place we may indicate thereby the\norgans of immediate[233] perception, secondly, by the \"sense of a\nthing\" we may refer to the significance, or the element of thought and\nthe universal within it. In this way \"Sense\" is related on one side to\nthe immediate externality of existence, and on the other to its inward\nor essential nature. A sensuous perception of that existence in fact\npreserves both sides in unity, or rather in one direction so presents\nthe aspect that is opposed to it in the immediate sense vision as to\ninclude therein both the essence and notion of the object. But for the\nreason that it combines these opposed determinations in unfractured\nunity, the notion is not presented as such to consciousness, but is\nrather to be dimly foreshadowed there[234]. We accept, for example,\nas a determinate fact the existence of three realms of Nature, which\nwe define as that of the mineral world, that of plants, and finally\nthat of animals; we can conclude from this, as already foreshadowed\nby its truth regarded as a process rising from plane to plane, that\nthere is an inward necessity inherent in the notional articulation\nof its divisions, and do not confine ourselves only to the purely\nimaginative conception of it as a world conforming on its exterior\nside only to a final end. In the same way when confronted with the\nvariety of the external presentment in each of these realms, the\nsense-perception surmises a controlling unity intelligible to mind, a\nprogress subject to laws of thought, visible no less in the formation\nof mountain ranges than in the orderly succession of plant-life and\nof the animal races. The same tendency is presupposed when, after an\nexamination of the form of any particular animal organism, an insect's,\nfor example, as subdivided into head, body, abdomen, and extremities,\nwe conclude the correlation of such parts to be based on a rational\nprinciple, and are confident that though, at first blush, it may appear\nquite accidental that we are in possession of five senses, we shall\ndiscover a true bond of relation between that number and the notion\ntherein asserted. Of just this type is Goethe's method of observing\nand accounting for the innate reason of Nature and her phenomena. With\nan extraordinary intuitive sense he directed his attention directly\nto[235] the objects of experience, entirely convinced of the ideal bond\nof unity which explained their interconnection. History may be written\nwith a like object. The narration of facts and individual lives is\ngiven in such a way as indirectly to throw a light on the essential\nsignificance which such events or persons contributed to the period in\nwhich they are necessarily bound together in one organic whole.\n3. Consequently we may affirm that Nature generally, regarded as the\nsensuous manifestation of the concrete notion and the Idea, is to\nbe considered an object of beauty in so far as by such a sensuous\nperception of natural forms some kind of foreshadowing of the notional\nunity consonant to them is surmised, and we are able through the\nchannels of sense to discover not merely their form, but somewhat of\nthe inner necessity which binds together all their parts. Further than\nthis incomplete surmise of the notion the sensuous contemplation of\nNature as beautiful is not carried. This way of comprehending things,\nfor which the separate parts, despite their appearance of independent\nfreedom among themselves, nevertheless reveal to the sight the harmony\nthat exists there either in the characteristics of _their form_, or\ndetached portions of it or their motion and so forth, remains for\nall that _indefinite_ and _abstract._ The inward unity is not open\nto external sense, nor can it appear in its ideal and concrete form\nto such perception[236], whether imaginative or no; such at most\nacquiesces generally in the universality of a law of connection\ninherent in every living thing.\n(_a_) It is, then, in the first instance only in this bond of union\nwhich reveals itself as a necessary adjunct of vitality from the\nobjectivity of Nature, in so far as the same is presented in forms\nadequate to the notion, that we have before us the beauty of Nature.\nWith this coalescence the _materia_ is wholly identical; the form\nis immediately at home in the matter, as its true essence and its\nconforming energy[237]. This description may in fact stand for us, so\nfar as beauty at this stage is concerned, as a general definition of\nit. We admire, for example, the natural form of a crystal on account of\nthe law of uniformity it manifests, a law which through no mere action\nof forces external to it, but by virtue of its own specific definition\nand free activity, free in all its aspects as itself an object, is\nmanifested there. For although an activity external to it could as\nsuch equally be free, yet in crystals the conformative activity is not\nextraneous to the object; rather it is a form operative as belonging\nto the mineral's innate character. We may define it as the free force\nof its substance, which out of its own resources informs itself and\nis not merely passively receptive of its environment. Consequently\nwe find here the constituent material in its realized form as a free\nand independent creation. In still higher and more concrete mode the\nimmanent form projects itself through the living organism and all its\nparts, in the articulate form and, above all, in its motion and its\nvital expression as feeling. For in this last case we have the inward\nvitality pregnant itself as living.\n(_b_) It is moreover through this indeterminacy of the beauty of\nNature, originating in its inward principle of animation that (_\u03b1_)\nboth in virtue of the conception of life and the intuition of its true\nnotion no less than of the habitual types conformable to its adequate\npresentment, we are able to distinguish between animals which are\nbeautiful and those which are ugly. Animals incapable of vitality,\nsuch as the sloth, which creeps about with difficulty, and whose entire\nmode of life is suggestive of incapacity for motion or activity, offend\nour aesthetic sense for this very reason[238]. Activity and mobility\nare precisely the qualities which assert the higher ideality of life.\nFor the same reason we condemn forms of amphibious life, certain\nspecies of fishes, crocodiles, toads, and many kinds of insects;\nan additional reason will influence our similar attitude to hybrid\nspecies, where confusion of form marks the passage from one determinate\ntype to another; the ornithorhyncus is an example[239], an animal which\nwith its mixture of bird and four-footed beast may indeed astonish\nus, but at the same time is repulsive to our sense of beauty. Such\nfeelings of repulsion can no doubt be traced entirely to our habitual\nprepossessions which have moulded for the imagination a fixed type of\nanimal species consonant to experience. But even so there is already\nactively present the intuitive surmise that the configuration of a\nbird, for example, is related in its parts by a necessary principle\nof unity, and cannot as such graft upon itself forms which belong\nto other species without being thereby transformed into a hybrid\nvariety. Such abnormal deviations from type appear to us both strange\nand contradictory. Neither the one sided narrowness of organization,\nwhich is so defective and mean in its manifestation, that it exercises\nno activity over the straitened conditions of its environment, nor\nconfusions and passages of type, which, albeit they are not so enclosed\nwithin themselves, are unable to hold fast the distinctive features of\ntheir type, belong strictly to the sphere of natural beauty.\n(_\u03b2_) There is another sense in which we attribute beauty to Nature,\nnamely, when we have the collective picture of a landscape before us\nrather than observe the living form of a simple object. Here we have\nno organic articulation of parts such as is derived from their notion\nand is presented to us as such ideal unity in spontaneous life. We have\ninstead a rich variety of objects both organic and inorganic, which are\nunited together on one or more planes of vision in their distinctive\nfeatures, contour of mountains, winding outlines of rivers, groups\nof trees, huts, dwellings, palaces, and cities of mankind, ships,\nroadways, heaven and sea, valley and rock-cleft. We find, in addition\nto this variety and proceeding therefrom, a delightful or imposing\nharmony which appeals to our sense and interests us.\nIt is lastly a peculiar characteristic of the beauty of Nature that it\nshould excite or exercise a harmonious influence over our emotional\nlife. A mood of this kind is aroused by the stillness of moonlight,\nthe peace of a valley, through which some brook or other meanders, the\nsublimity of the immeasurable storm-tossed sea, the tranquil depth of\nthe star-strewn heavens. But the significant factor in this case is not\nso much to be found in the objects as in the peculiar moods they arouse\nin our feelings and affections. On analogous grounds we attribute\nbeauty to animals, when the expression of their life directly suggests\nhuman qualities, such as courage, strength, cunning, good nature, and\nthe rest. Such, no doubt, in one aspect of it, truly expresses the\nnature of the animals themselves; but there is also our own conception\nof its affinity to ourselves, and the mood in which we receive it.\n(_c_) However much animal life, as the culminating point of natural\nbeauty, unfolds its freest expression as a living principle, it\nis comparatively narrow in its range and subject to very limited\nqualities. The circle of such existence is a strait one; and in this\nthe predominant interests are those of the satisfaction of natural\ninstincts such as hunger and sex-attraction. Soul-life, regarded as\nthe inward principle expressed through external figure, is poor,\nabstract, and empty of content. Add to this the consideration that\nthis inward is not manifested at all as _inward._ The soul in its\nessential substance is not revealed by the life of Nature; it is, in\nfact, the determining characteristic of Nature that its soul remains\nshut in itself, does not, in other words, proclaim itself in its\nideality. As already pointed out, the soul of an animal is not this\nideal unity _self-acknowledged._ If it were otherwise we should have\nthe manifestation of such personality brought home to others. Only in\nthe self-conscious Ego do we find the ideal in its simplest terms,\nwhich is itself an ideal medium to itself, knows itself as this simple\nunity, and thereby endows itself with a reality, which is not limited\nto bodily and sensuous form, but is itself of an ideal character. Here,\nfor the first time, reality is in possession of a form adequate to\nthe notion; or rather the notion sets itself up as its own opposite,\nmakes itself objectively real and finds its own realization in that\nobjectivity. The animal life, on the contrary, is only _potentially_\nsuch a unity as that in which reality as bodily form is other than the\nideal unity of soul. In self-consciousness we have this unity realized,\nwhose opposing factors are constituent elements of one transparent\nideality. And it is as this concrete totality of self-consciousness\nthat the Ego is manifested to others. The forms of animal life\nmerely enable us through imaginative perception to divine the soul's\nexistence. Such only possess the troubled semblance of a soul,\nbetrayed to us through the breath or exhalement which permeates the\nwhole, gives some unity to all the members, and reveals in the entire\ninstinctive life the first germs of an independent character. Herein\nlies the primary defect of the beauty of Nature, even when taken at its\npoint of culminating form: and it is precisely this defect which will\nintroduce us to the necessity of _the Ideal_ as the beauty of art. But\nbefore we consider at length the nature of this Ideal, there are two\ndeterminations involved as the most immediate result of this inherent\ndefect in natural beauty, which invite our attention.\nWe have stated that in the animal form the soul appears as the bond of\nconnection within the organism and the unified point of animation only\nunder a cloud[240] and destitute of any fully realized content. We only\nfind there a quite indeterminate and restricted mode of soul-life. We\nwill now consider the abstract limitations of this mode more closely.\nB. THE EXTERNAL BEAUTY OF ABSTRACT FORM REGARDED AS UNIFORMITY,\nSYMMETRY, CONFORMITY TO RULE AND HARMONY AND REALITY IN THE SENSE OF\nABSTRACT UNITY OF THE PHYSICAL MATERIAL.\nThere is in Nature an external reality which is, of course, visible\nand definitely objective, but the inward unity of which, instead of\npresenting itself in the concrete inwardness referable to the unity of\nsoul-life, only goes to the point of indeterminacy and abstraction. In\nother words, it stops short of the inwardness self-actualized in an\nideal form and as the particular existence conformable to its ideal\ncontent. Its appearance is that of the defining principle on the face\nof external reality. Now the specific characteristics of inwardness in\nall its concreteness should be these. First, the principle of soul-life\nis asserted for itself no less than is potentially replete with\ncontent. Secondly, external reality interpenetrates this ideal arcanum,\nand by so doing fully reveals its true form as such external reality.\nA concrete unity of this nature is not reached by mere natural beauty:\nit lies beyond as the Ideal. On this plane of existence we cannot say\nthat such a concrete unity enters into the manifestation of form. We\nhave to deduce it through analysis, examining in their separation and\nsingularity the _distinguishing features_ which the unity supports. The\nform that informs here and the sensuous external reality _fall apart_\nfrom one another; or rather we have _two_ distinct aspects which we are\ncompelled to consider separately. By virtue of this fact, which we may\neither regard as a division of the material of sense or as a review\nof certain facts taken in abstraction, the inward unity, which is one\naspect of the external reality, itself falls outside it; that is to\nsay, it is not itself asserted in that rational reality as the wholly\nimmanent form of the entire notion which constitutes it, but rather as\nan Ideality and determinacy imposed externally.\nSuch are the points of view thus presented us which we will now\nconsider more closely.\nFirst, then, we have to discuss\n1. THE BEAUTY OF ABSTRACT FORM\nThe form of natural beauty in its abstraction is a form which is\ndeterminate and thus of limited range; in a further aspect of it\nit is focussed in a unity of abstract relation to itself[241]. On\ncloser inspection we shall, however, find that the external manifold\ncontrols this form of abstract beauty by reason of its own determinacy\nand unity. We must not, however, imply in these latter any immanent\ninwardness or form of vital ideality, but regard them as purely\nmaterial definitions and unity of the external medium. Forms of such a\ncharacter are uniformity, symmetry, or conformity to rule, and finally\nharmony.\n_(a) Uniformity_\nUniformity is, speaking generally, equality in external presentment,\nor, more specifically, the unbroken repetition of one and the same\ndefinite form, supplied by the determining unity to the form of\nobjects. Such a unity, in virtue of its initial abstraction, is at the\nfurthest extreme removed from the rational totality of the concrete\nnotion. Its beauty is therefore a beauty which is referable to the\nfaculty of the analytical understanding. The fundamental process of\nthat faculty is to perceive objects in their abstraction, not in their\nself-determined completeness and identity. For example, among all lines\nthe straight line is that which is most uniform, because it alone\nmanifests one abstract and undeviating direction. For the same reason\nthe cube is a figure dominated by regularity of content. All its sides\nare of the same size, the same length of line and the same angles,\nwhich, on account of their being rectangular, however much their size\nis changed, manifest no change in the form of their angles as is the\ncase with angles which are obtuse or acute.\nWith this characteristic of uniformity we must closely connect that\nof _symmetry._ Form is unable long to rest in that barest abstraction\nof its determination, namely, undifferentiated equality. A diverse\nrelation is sure to assert itself, breaking into the empty form of\nidentity. In this way we obtain _symmetry_, which consists in no\nmere identical repetition of one form, but in a combination with\nsome such form analogous to it, identical, that is to say, in its\nself-determination, and yet manifesting a distinct contrast with it.\nThrough such a combination we obtain another kind of equality and\nunity, whose determination is more extensive and more varied. If, for\nexample, on one side of a house we meet with three windows of the same\nsize separated at equal intervals of distance, then three or four more\nof loftier size than the first-mentioned standing at more extended or\ncloser intervals in relation to them, and again three more precisely\nsimilar in size and distance to our original ones, we have then before\nus a symmetrical arrangement. Mere uniformity and repetition of the\nsame distinctions will never produce this result. We may find such\ndistinguishing features in size, position, form, colour, tones, and\nmany others like them, which, however, to produce symmetry must be\nharmoniously related to similar forms of construction. When we find a\ncombination which presents to us an arrangement of such distinguishing\ncharacteristics according to some clearly uniform principle that then\nis symmetry.\nBoth these attributes, uniformity and symmetry, being the\ndeterminations of the form and unity of external appearance, are\nmainly applicable to _distinctions in size._ For it stands to reason\nthat what is expressly posited as external rather than truly immanent\ndetermination is generally a quantitative[242] determination, whereas\nthe qualitative fixes the inherent character of anything. Consequently\nthat which is assumed only to affect the external appearance cannot be\nconcerned with the changes which are found in the qualitative aspect.\nSize, on the other hand, and its alteration regarded merely as size,\nis for the qualitative determination, when it is unable to assert\nitself in terms of measure, an indifferent determination. That is to\nsay, measure is quantity, precisely in so far as it can give to itself\nan aspect which qualifies it, and thereby a qualitative determination\nis united to the purely quantitative one. As thus explained[243]\nuniformity and symmetry are merely restricted to the determinations\nof size and their uniform appearance or arrangement of differences\nin symmetrical order. Further inquiry will show us that this due\nco-ordination of size is as applicable to the forms of organic life as\nit is to those of inorganic Nature. The human organism is, for example,\nat least in a certain degree both uniform and symmetrical. We have two\neyes, two arms, two legs, similar hip-joints, shoulder-blades, and so\non. Of other portions of the body the reverse is the case. We find\nno conspicuous uniformity in the heart, lungs, bowels, or liver. The\nquestion arises what precisely constitutes the difference here. The\nside on which uniformity, whether of size, form, or position mainly\nasserts itself, is obviously the aspect of the organism viewed from\nthe outside. The uniform and symmetrical determination, in complete\nconformity with what we should expect, is most apparent where the fact\nas objectively determined is itself the external envisagement itself,\nand carries with it the least impression of inherent life. The reality,\nwhich is most constant to this pure externality, rests satisfied\nwith the abstract unity congenial to it. Within the organism, on the\ncontrary, where we find the heart of the life-process, and still more\nopenly in the medium of untrammelled reason uniformity gives way before\nthe subjective unity of life. Nature is, no doubt, in its opposition\nto mind, a determinate existence external and independent; but even in\nher we find that uniformity only pre-eminently asserts itself where\nexternality is the predominant principle.\n(_\u03b1_) Reviewing, then, shortly the _prominent classifications_ of\nnatural objects, we observe, in the first place, that minerals, taking\nthe crystal for an example, as structures destitute of the principle\nof life, are characterized in their fundamental form by uniformity\nand symmetry. As already remarked, their form, it is true, is one\nappropriate to themselves, is not merely the determination of external\nforces. Through an unseen energy the form that makes them what they\nare as products of Nature creates their configuration both within and\nwithout. This activity, however, is not yet the completed energy of the\nconcrete notion as an ideal principle, which directs the independent\nconsistency of the positive reality, subsuming them under an ideal\ntotality such as is present in animal life. The unity and definition of\ntheir form persists in purely abstract one-sidedness, and we have as\nthe characteristics of a unity which is wholly on the outside the bare\nforms of uniformity and symmetry, the determinating factor in each case\nbeing an abstraction.\n_(\u03b2) Plant life_ is, of course, many degrees above the order of\ncrystals. From the very commencement its evolution is marked by a\nharmonious articulation, and consumes material in a constantly active\nprocess of self-nourishment. But plant-life also is not yet really\nthe living whole[244]. Although organically divided into parts, its\nactivity is still one that consists wholly in assimilation[245]. It is\nrooted in the earth with no independent power of motion from place to\nplace; its growth is continuous, and such energy of assimilation and\nself-nourishment as it possesses is not the tranquil self-subsistence\nof a completely individualized organic existence, but rather a\ncontinuous extension of its growth as an external object. An animal\ngrows just as a plant grows, but at a determinate point that growth\nin its external size ceases, and that which reproduces itself in\nself-subsistence is one and the same individual. Plant-life, however,\nenlarges without intermission, and only its decease renders the further\nincrease of its boughs and leaves impossible. And, moreover, all\nthat it separately produces in this process is for ever the repeated\npattern of the same organism in its entirety. For every bough is a\nnew plant, and not, as in the case with the animal organism, only\nan isolated member. On account of this persistent enlargement of\nitself through all the separate plant formations whereof it consists\nplant-life is without the subjective animation peculiar to sensation\nand the ideal unity which belongs to it. And, generally speaking,\nwe may say that plant-life, however much the digestive process is\nan inward one, in which we find nourishment is assimilated and the\norganism determines the form which is impressed on its substance out\nof itself by virtue of the increasing freedom of the notional type\nworking through that substance, nevertheless substantially, through the\nentire process of its life, it remains rooted to externality without\neither a true independence or unity, and such self-subsistence as it\npossesses is continuous without a break. And it is on account of this\ncharacteristic of plant-growth, namely, that it is for ever asserted\non the side of externality, that we find uniformity and symmetry to be\nthe fundamental unity of its self-expression as it is a predominant\nprinciple of its structure. No doubt uniformity is not so regnant here\nas we observed it to be in the formation of minerals, and it is not\nexpressed in the same extreme degree through the abstract straight line\nand right angle: but it prevails here notwithstanding. The stem for the\nmost part runs on a straight line; the rings of plants of higher type\nform themselves in circles; leaves closely approach the configuration\nof crystals; and, at least as the basis of their type, we find that the\nblossoms themselves in the number of their leaves, their position and\nform are determined with uniformity and symmetry.\n(_\u03b3_) Finally, in the living organism of _animals_ a difference is\nasserted in the reduplicated structure of the members. In the bodies\nof animals, more particularly if we examine the higher species, the\norganism is a more inward, self-contained and self-determined totality;\nlike a sphere, it returns, so to speak, on itself, while still\nremaining an external organism. It is an external process, and yet, as\na process, asserted against externality. The more important organs are\nthose within, such as heart, lungs, and liver, and in these the life\nis bound up. Such are not determined under the simple characteristics\nof uniformity. In those members, however, even of the animal organism,\nwhich are fixed in direct relation to the outside world, symmetrical\narrangement prevails. Among such must be reckoned the members and\norgans which assert the subjective principle externally no less than\nthose which are the instruments of the active life. The sense-organs,\nsuch as sight and hearing, belong to the former; all that we see and\nhear is left as we found it. The organs of smell and taste already mark\nthe point of union with an activity exercised externally. We only smell\nthat which is already assimilated[246] by the organ of sense, and we\nonly exercise our taste through an act of destruction. We have, it is\ntrue, but one nose, but it is subdivided into two sections, each of\nwhich is uniform in structure. The same description is applicable to\nthe lips and teeth and other organs like them. Further than this the\neyes and ears, and the limbs employed in motion from place to place,\nor for direct control over external objects, in other words, legs and\narms, are entirely uniform in position, form, and other qualities.\nWe find, therefore, that in the organic world no less than in the\ninorganic uniformity asserts a very real predominance, qualified,\nhowever, by the fact that its presence is limited to those members\nwhich are the instruments of the organism in its direct relation to\nthe external world. On those through which the life-process returns\non itself by virtue of its own subjective principle there is no such\nimpression of uniformity.\nSuch, then, are the leading characteristics of the forms of uniformity\nand symmetry, and the manner in which they are asserted in the\nconfiguration of natural phenomena.\n_(b) Conformity to Rule_\nWe now propose to distinguish the more generic conception of conformity\nto law[247], so far as it appears on a higher plane of organic\nevolution than that already adverted to, and marks the passage of\nthe same to the freedom of natural no less than spiritual life,\nfrom the more abstract forms discussed above. Taken by itself, no\ndoubt, conformity to rule is not alone sufficient to give us the\nsubjective unity and freedom of _totality_; but we do find in the\nconfiguration to which it corresponds a totality of essentially\n_distinguished characteristics_, such as do not merely emerge in\n_difference_ and opposition, but betray both _unity_ and determinate\nconnection in such totality. A unity thus controlled, albeit still\nonly positively asserted in quantitative substance, is no longer\nreferable to essentially exterior distinctions of mere size numerically\nascertainable, but already introduces to our notice a qualitative\nrelation of consistency between these contrasted determinations. In\nother words we have here neither the abstract repetition of one and\nthe same determinant[248], nor a uniform interchange of similarity\nand dissimilarity[249], but the contemporaneous association of aspects\nessentially distinct from one another. We find, in fact, our sense of\nsight gratified by the association of these distinguishing features in\ntheir completeness. And it is the principle of reason which affords\nus such satisfaction, gratifying our sense only through the totality,\nor rather through the very totality of differences the nature of the\nfact requires. Such a connection, however, still remains an unexplained\nnexus, which sense-perception arrives at partly on account of its\npersistent repetition, and in part through an intuition of deeper\nsource.\nA few examples will make clear the process of definition from\nuniformity to conformity with law. Parallel lines of equal length are\nabstractly uniform. A further step is taken when we compare geometrical\nfigures of the same form, triangles, for example, but assume their size\nto be unequal. Here the angles subtended by the corners of each and\nthe relation of line to line is the same, but we find such similarity\nin different _quanta._ Take again the circle, it does not possess the\nuniformity of the straight line, but at the same time the determination\nof abstract equality strictly applies to it, for all its radii are of\nequal length. The circle is consequently still but a curved line that\nawakes no particular interest[250].\nOn the other hand, there is still less uniformity in the _ellipse_ and\nthe _parabola_, and they are only understood through the law of their\nform. In other words the _radii vectores_ of the ellipse are both\nunequal and in conformity with rule, and the same qualification applies\nto the greater and lesser axis of their lines of differentiation[251];\nmoreover, their foci are not central as is the case with the circle. We\nfind in these examples, therefore, a qualitative relation of difference\nassert itself in the law applicable to such lines and constructive of\ntheir interconnection. If, however, we divide the ellipse by means of\nits greater and lesser axes we obtain four equal sections; regarded as\na whole, therefore, we still find the principle of uniformity paramount\nin this figure. Of a higher degree of freedom in its conformity to law\nis the _oval._ We know there is such a law, though mathematicians have\nbeen unable to express its formula. This figure is not an ellipse, but\nthe higher curve differs from that below it. Still we find that even in\nthis example of freer eccentricity in Nature, if we divide it through\nits greater axis, we have still two equal halves. The final expression\nof mere uniformity in conformity to law is shown in lines, which, as in\nthe example of the oval, when divided through the smaller[252] axis,\ngive us unequal sections, neither section being a mere repetition of\nthe other. The so-called undulatory line is an example of this, in the\nsense Hogarth describes it as the line of beauty. Thus the inclination\nof the arms as they fall on either side of the human body is opposed.\nHere we have conformity to rule without uniformity pure and simple.\nSuch a kind of conformity especially characterises with its variety the\nconformation of the nobler living organisms.\nConformity to law is, then, an attribute of substantiality, binding\ntogether both its differences and its unity; but it remains still\nabstract on the side of its controlling form, unable to supply\nindividuality with the freedom of motion, or rather by virtue of that\nform is entirely without the higher freedom of subjectivity, and quite\nincapable of revealing the vitality and ideality proper to it.\n_(c) Harmony_\nOn a higher plane in the sphere of abstract beauty must be placed\n_harmony._ In harmony we find qualitative distinctions are held\ntogether, and further held together in a totality of differentiation,\nsuch as is based on the essential nature of the fact itself. This\nconsistency of support is derived from conformity to law, in so far\nas that form unfolds what is essentially uniformity, and thereby\npasses beyond the mere characteristics of equality and repetition.\nBut in doing this the distinctions of quality assert themselves not\nonly in their difference of opposition and contradiction, but in\naspects of a unity that rivets them together, a unity in which all\ndistinguishing features, it is true, are maintained in their proper\nplace, but still only as belonging to one single whole. This unity of\naccordance is what constitutes harmony. We may either regard it as a\ntotality of aspects essentially distinct, or as the resolution of the\nelement of mere contradiction asserted by them, revealing their more\nvital interconnection and ideal solidarity. In this sense we refer\nto the harmony of form, or colour, or musical tone. As an example,\nwe have blue, yellow, green, and red as the fundamentally necessary\ndifferentiation of colour[253].\nIn these irresolvable data of the spectrum we have not merely the\ninequality we found in symmetry, but contradictory opposites, such as\nyellow and blue, their neutralization and withal concrete identity.\nThe beauty of their harmony is revealed in the avoidance of their\ncrude opposition, which is softened thereby in such a way as to put\nbefore us the concordance hidden beneath their difference. They do,\nin fact, emanate from one source, namely colour, which is not an\nabstract conception[254], but an essential totality. So far, indeed,\ncan the compulsive force of such totality carry us, that we can, as\nGoethe has pointed out, when we have but one colour presented to us,\nstill subjectively recognize another at the same time. In the same\nway the tonic, mediant, and dominant are essential distinctions among\nmusical tones, which the unity of harmony associates through their\ndifference in one whole. We may submit the harmony of form, which is\ndifferentiated through the varied aspects of position, repose, and\nmotion to a similar analysis. If we suffer any one of the subordinate\ndistinctions to assume an exclusive predominance the unity which\nrelates them will be destroyed.\nHarmony, however, is not to be confused with free ideal subjectivity\nand soul-life. In the latter the unity manifested is not merely an\ninterconnection and concordance, but a positive negation of difference,\nwhich, for the first time, reveals their concrete and ideal unity. A\nconcrete unity such as this is not the result of harmony. Such concrete\nunity is, for example, that which we find in the actually melodious\nthing[255], which no doubt possesses harmony as its fundamental form,\nbut at the same time possesses the higher characteristic of free\nsubjectivity, and by means of song gives expression to that. Harmony\nalone has nothing to do with the appearance of subjective life, as\nsuch, nor of that of mind, although it is the highest manifestation of\nabstract form, and stands in close affinity to free subjectivity. Such,\nthen, is our determination of abstract unity as we find it brought\nbefore us in the specific modes of abstract form.\n2. BEAUTY AS ABSTRACT UNITY OF THE MATERIAL MEDIUM\nThe side of abstract unity which we have now to consider is not that\ndirectly related to form, but to the sensuous material simply in which\nit is asserted. The unity is manifested on this side as the entirely\nundifferentiated concordance of the particular sensuous material. It\nis the one form of unity, which the material of sense, in its purely\nobjective aspect, is capable of receiving. On this plane and under the\nabove noted relation[256] the abstract _purity_ of the _materia_ in\nits form, colour, or tone constitutes what is most essential to it.\nEntirely straight drawn lines, which run without a shadow of difference\nin their straightness or strength, bare superficies and similar\nexamples please us by virtue of their persistent regularity and their\nuniform homogeneousness. The purity of the heavens, the translucence\nof the atmosphere, a mirror-like lake the smoothness of the ocean's\nface, all give pleasure by virtue of this unity. We find the same\ntruth brought home to us by purity of tone. The voice when purely\nproduced, though taken quite by itself, possesses an attraction for us\ninexpressibly delightful; vocal notes which are not thus pure on the\ncontrary, by permitting us to hear the organ of production along with\nthem, disturb or weaken the pure resonance and definition of their\nmusic. In much the same way human speech possesses pure tones in its\nvowels, a, e, i, o, u, and its compound vowels, ae, \u00fc, and \u00f6. Popular\ndialects are particularly characterized by impurity of vocalization\nand mediate tones such as oa. Purity of tones consists further in this\nthat the vowels are associated with consonants, whose sound does not\ntend to blurr the sonority of the vowel tones, as is too frequently the\ncase with our northern languages, when contrasted with the way in which\ntheir purity is preserved by the Italian, a characteristic which makes\nthat language so adaptable to singing. We experience an enjoyment of\nsimilar nature through the sight of colour in its simplest purity of\ntint, an absolutely pure red or blue for example, not by any means a\ncommon occurrence, such pristine colours being often weakened through\nthe addition to them of yellow or tints of each other[257]. Violet can\nno doubt appear to us as a pure colour, but only in an external object,\nnot, that is to say, as a compounded colour[258], for it is not itself\nan elementary colour belonging to colour's essential differentiation.\nIt is these elementary or cardinal colours, easily recognized by sense\nin their purity, which, on account of their crude opposition, are most\ndifficult to unite together in harmony. Colours, on the contrary,\nwhich are blurred in their transparency by many other tints, although\nnot so antagonistic to general harmony, fail to give us such direct\nenjoyment from the very fact that the energy of opposition in them is\nweakened. Green, for instance, is a compound of blue and yellow, but it\nis the neutralization of these cardinal colours, and for that reason\nless attractive to us in its own purity than blue and yellow in their\nsecure[259] opposition. Such are the points of most importance we have\nto remark upon in dealing with the abstract unity of form no less than\nthe simplicity and purity of the sensuous material. In whichever aspect\nwe regard our subject-matter we have to review that which is by virtue\nof its abstract character destitute of life, and a unity with no true\nactuality. Ideal subjectivity is inseparable from this, and such is\nentirely absent from the beauty of Nature even at the highest potency\nof its manifestation. This essential defect points us imperatively\nforward to the Ideal, which Nature is unable to reveal to us, and in\ncontrast with which the beauty of Nature appears as a subordinate mode.\nC. DEFECTIVE ASPECTS OF THE BEAUTY OF NATURE\nThe true object of our inquiry is the beauty of art viewed as the only\nreality adequate to the Idea of beauty. We have hitherto treated the\nbeauty of Nature as the first mode of the existence of the beautiful.\nWe have now to inquire more closely into that which distinguishes\nnatural beauty from that of art.\nAs an abstract proposition we may affirm that the Ideal is beauty in\nits rounded completeness. Nature, on the contrary, brings before us\nbeauty in its incompleteness. Such abstract predicates do not, however,\nhelp us much, for our real problem is rather to explain exactly what\nit is which makes the difference between the completeness of the one\nfrom the incompleteness of the other. Our inquiry therefore hinges on\nthe question how it comes about that Nature is necessarily incomplete\nas a mode of beauty and how this incompleteness is asserted. When we\nhave answered that we shall be in a better position to deduce both the\nnecessity and essential significance of the Ideal.\nWe have already in following the process of Nature up to its\nculminating manifestation in animal life drawn attention to the modes\nof beauty revealed in that process. It is now of the first importance\nthat we fix our attention more definitely on the culminating phase of\nthat evolution where we find subjectivity and individuality presented\nto us in the living organism.\nWe have already referred to the beautiful as the Idea in a manner\nidentical to that we employ when we speak of the good and true as the\nIdea, in the sense, that is to say, where we characterize the Idea as\nthe wholly substantial and universal, the absolute substance--with no\nsensuous material therewith--of reality, in short, the consistency\nof the world. Determined more strictly, however, as already pointed\nout, the Idea is not merely substantiality and _universality_, but\nthe unity of the _notion_ and its _reality_, just that, the notion\nrevealed to us as notion in its coincident objectivity. It was Plato\nwho, as we have remarked in our introduction, posited the Idea as\nthat which was alone true and universal, and, indeed, as the one\n_concrete_ Universal. The Platonic _Idea_ is, however, not itself as\nyet the concrete _real_, for apprehended under the _notion_ and its\n_universality_ it is already coincident with the real. Apprehended,\nhowever, only in its _universality_[260], it is not _realized_,\nrealized, that is to say, as Truth in its self-determinate realization.\nIt is still only the _potency_ of such self-realization. But just\nas the notion is not the notion of real existence without its full\nobjectivity, in the same way the Idea without its realization in the\nobjective world is not the Idea in its Truth as existent reality. The\nIdea must proceed to such realization, which is only present itself\nfor the first time in a really existent subjectivity adequate to the\nnotion, and its ideal unity and self-determination. In the generic\nspecies we find its reality first manifested as free and concrete\nindividuality. Life only exists as a _living thing_; goodness is only\nrealized in _particular_ men; and all truth is simply the consciousness\nof _knowledge_--Spirit which has come to its own vital inheritance.\nOnly the concrete singularity is both true and really existent, mere\nabstract universality and particularity is not so. This self-subsistent\nactuality, this subjectivity is the point on which everything turns,\nand which we must fully grasp in its significance. Subjectivity may be\ndefined as ideal determination by virtue of a principle of ideal unity\nwhich asserts itself through _negation_ of the differences presented\nto it as consistent parts of one objective reality[261]. The unity of\nthe Idea and its realization is the _negative_ unity of the _Idea_\nas such and its _reality_; it is at once and at the same time the\n_subsumption_ and _deposition_ in a unified content of the difference\nasserted on either side. Only in this active process is the unity of\nthe Idea affirmatively determined in its full activity, a unity and\nsubjectivity whose process of self-determination is infinite. We have\nconsequently to apprehend the Idea of the beautiful in its realized\nmode of existence as essentially concrete subjectivity and, moreover,\nas individual substantiality, by virtue of which it is the Idea really\nexistent, possessing the form of its reality in concrete and individual\nsingularity.\nBut here we must distinguish between _two_ distinct modes of\nsingularity or individuality, namely, that which is immediately\npresented us by _Nature_ and that which is predicated of _mind_\n(spirit). In both forms it is given determinate existence, and\nconsequently is in both substantive content, the Idea in short, and\nin the particular sphere of our inquiry for both forms the Idea\nas beauty. Viewed in this way we may affirm if we please that the\nbeautiful of Nature has a _similar_ content with that of the Ideal. In\ncontradistinction, however, to such a point of view we must not fail to\nobserve that the difference of form, in which the Idea herein attains\nreality, that is to say the difference between the individuality\nwhich prevails in the spheres of Nature and Spirit, the difference\nasserted in its respective appearance, this it is which constitutes an\n_essential distinction._ As we shall see, the real point of our inquiry\nis this, namely, which of these two forms is really the one most\nadequate to the Idea, for it is obvious that it is only in the entirely\nadequate form that the totality of the Idea is _in its full content_\nexplicitly realized. This is the more immediate point we have now to\nexamine in so far as the difference between natural beauty and the\nIdeal falls into line with the formal differentiation of singularity.\n_Immediate_ singularity is no doubt primarily found in the domain of\nSpirit no less than in Nature as such. For, in the first place, Spirit\nis possessed of an external existence in bodily form; secondly, even\nin spiritual relations, Spirit, in the first instance, only exists in\nits union with immediate reality. Subdividing our inquiry in conformity\nwith such facts, we will consider the nature of immediate singularity\nfrom _three_ different points of view.\n1. (_a_) We have already seen that the animal organism preserves its\ndeterminate existence through a persistent evolutionary process of\nits own in opposition to an environing inorganic Nature, which it\nassimilates by means of consumption and digestion, compelling thereby\nwhat is external to submit to that process, and asserting its own\nindependent existence by so doing. We found at the same time that\nthis living process is a system of activities, which is realized in\na system of organs, whose functional action consists in those very\nactivities. The one and single aim of this homogeneous system is\nthe self-preservation of the living totality thereof through such a\nprocess. The animal life consists, therefore, in a life of sensuous\nimpulses, whose general course and satisfaction is realized in the\nabove-mentioned organic system. The living organism is for this reason\narticulated in its parts under a _teleological principle_, and the\nprinciple or end subserved is self-preservation. Life is immanent in\nevery member; they are united to life, and life is one with them. And\nthe net result of this animate process is that the animal is maintained\nas a thing conscious of itself as an individual subject of feeling,\nlife and the self-enjoyment its singularity procures for it. We have\nonly to compare animal life with plant life to see the difference\nimplied in the absence of such a sense-consciousness. The plant simply\nbrings to the birth new specimens of its species, without even being\nable to concentrate any single one on that point of negation, which\nconstitutes self-singularity. We must, however, add that even in the\nanimal organism and its life we never have actually before our eyes the\ntrue manifestation of this _centre of unity_, but rather simply the\n_manifold_ of its members. Life is still too deficient on the side of\nfreedom and in opposition to the mere caprice of sense-life to manifest\nsuch a subjective individuality as is capable of breaking through the\nexternal envisagement of its organic parts. The vital centre of such\nactivities in the animal organism still remains veiled from vision, and\nall that we see are the mere outlines of the figure, and this for the\nmost part concealed from our view by feathers, scales, hair, fur, or\nspines. There can be no question that coverings of this nature, though\ncharacteristic of the animal world, are coverings which partake of the\nform of the vegetable world. And it is precisely at this point that\nthe beauty of animal life declares its essential insufficiency. That\nwhich the organism makes most visible to us is not the soul-principle.\nThat which is directed outward and throughout appears is not the life\nwithin, but rather formations accepted from a lower plane of existence\nthan the essential embodiment of life. The animal is _only_ fully alive\nbeneath that outer crust, and consequently for this very reason that\nits _inwardness_[262] is not wholly made real in a form adequate to\nreveal it, we are unable to see the principle of Life everywhere shine\nfreely through it; it remains _only_ an _inwardness_, and the shell is\n_external only_ unpermeated by the vital principle.\n(_b_) The _human_ body, in virtue of its more exalted station, presents\nus with a striking contrast. In this we are everywhere reminded that\nman is in possession of a unity of feeling, a soul. The human skin\nis not covered over plant-like with an apparently lifeless sheath;\nthe pulsation of the blood is visible throughout the entire surface;\nthe beating heart of life is everywhere at the same time apparent;\nand we have in this outward manifestation, as it were, the real\nfount Of life made visible, the _turgor vitae_ as it streams from\nits centre. In the same way the human skin, sensitive throughout in\nits minutest parts, reveals to us the _morbidezza_ of its colouring,\nthose tints of flesh-colour and vein-colour which are the despair of\nan artist. On the other hand, however much the human body presents,\nas the apparent mirror of Life, a contrast with that of animals, it\nundoubtedly expresses also the natural process of self-preservation in\nthe subdivision of the skin, and the indentations, wrinkles, pores,\nsmall hairs and veins which we find attach thereto. In fact the skin\nitself, though permitting the inner life to shine through it, is\nnone the less an external protection of that life, a means obviously\nintended for such self-preservation. The supreme significance, however,\nof the contrast here presented is traceable in this extraordinary\nsensitiveness of the human cuticle, which, although not absolutely\nthe seat of feeling itself, alone renders such feeling possible. But\nat the same time even in this direction we are made conscious of the\ndefect, that this sensitiveness does not penetrate as a vital impulse\nof concentrated emphasis equally through all the members. We find in\nthe human body itself certain organs whose form is entirely appropriate\nto mere animal functions, while others give a more adequate expression\nto the entire soul-life, its feelings and passions. Regarded in this\nway it is obvious that even in the human body the inner life of soul\nhas not found its complete reflection in all parts of its external\nrealization.\n(_c_) The same defect is apparent on the higher plane of the\n_spiritual_ world and its organizations, if we consider such under\nthe aspect of life as immediately presented. The more extensive and\nthe richer their configurations are, the more we shall find that the\nfundamental object of the inner life of such totalities requires other\nmeans co-operative with such externality for its adequate expression.\nSuch organizations no doubt appear in immediate reality as organic\nwholes in which definite purpose is realized, and the realization of\nsuch purpose is manifested by the mediation of voluntary effort. Every\ncentre of such a spiritual organism, such as the State or the family,\nthat is to say each individual organic totality, is in possession of a\n_will_ capable of such exercise, and appears in unity with the other\nmembers of the same organism; but the _one_ inner soul of this nexus,\nthe freedom and reason of the aim of all is not visible in external\nreality as such in the absolute freedom of its subjective and universal\nprinciple of life, nor is it thus manifested in every part.\nThe same thing may be observed in particular actions and events, where\nwe find a similar organic totality present. The inner motive from which\nthey proceed is not wholly made visible upon the external surface\nof their actual presence. What we do find is a total presentment of\n_fact_, whose most fundamental ground of unity and vitality still\nremains _hidden from sight._\nFinally, when we consider from the same point of view any single\nindividual we are confronted with the same truth. Every human person\nis a self-rounded totality, held together by the central unity of\nlife. In the immediate envisagement of reality, that is in his life,\naction, avoidance of action, desires and impulses, he only appears in\na fragmentary way; none the less it is only from a general survey of\nall his actions or sufferings that we are able to form an estimate\nof character. The centre of unity which thus concentrates to a point\nthe entire subject-matter of our extended survey is not as such either\nvisible or directly apprehended.\n2. The second point of importance to which we would draw attention\nis this. With the immediate appearance of individuality the Idea, as\nwe have already indicated, receives determinate existence. Through\nthis very immediacy however it becomes interwoven with the complexity\nof the external world, is conditioned by the limitations of external\ncircumstance and the relative character of means and ends which are\nfound there, in one word is carried into the finitude of external\nNature. For though immediate singularity is in the first place a fully\nrounded off unity, it is for the same reason only self-exclusive\nas a centre of negation opposed to _others_, and is, by virtue of\nits immediate singularity, influenced by, no less than related to,\na totality of real existence other than its own, upon which it is\ndependent in a thousand different ways. The Idea, in short, is in this\nvery immediacy realized in every direction as _individual distinction._\nIt is consequently now merely a reflex of the inherent energy of the\nnotion which binds all individual existence, that of Nature no less\nthan mind in reciprocal correlation[263]. Such a relation to the\nexistences themselves is a purely external one, and appears also to\nthem as a single _external necessity_ uniting each part of the manifold\nin one shifting complexus of interrelated reciprocity. The immediacy\nof determinate existence is therefore, as thus regarded, a system of\nnecessary relations between apparently self-subsistent individual\nthings and forces, in which each singular entity is committed as a\nmeans to the service of ends foreign to it, or itself is compelled to\nutilize that which is external to itself as such a means. And inasmuch\nas the Idea is under this aspect wholly realized on the ground of\nexternality, there appears at the same time the unrestrained play of\nevery caprice and accident, no less than the uncontrolled discharge of\nthe burden of indigence. Singularity as immediate appearance lives and\nmoves in the realm of unfreedom.\n(_a_) The individual _animal_ is, for example, fettered wholly within\nthe bounds of its natural environment of air, water and land. Its\nentire way of living, the mode of its self-nourishment, everything that\nconcerns it, is thereby determined. It is this which differentiates\nwith such variety the species of animal life. We find, moreover,\nintermediate strains, such as swimming birds and suckling animals,\nwhich live in the water, amphibious species and others which still\nfurther mediate between the more obviously generic. These are,\nhowever, mere confusions of race, and indicate no higher mediation\nof considerable range. Throughout we find the animal subject in its\nself-preservation to the absolute necessities of external nature, cold,\ndrought, or insufficient supply of the means of nourishment. Under this\ndespotic dominion it is liable through the parsimony of circumstance to\nlose the fulness of external form, the blossom of its beauty, in short\nto become as it were the reflex of starving Nature herself. External\nconditions fix imperatively the measure of beauty it either preserves\nor forfeits.\n(_b_) The human organism, in its particular bodily existence is\nsubject, if not in the same measure, to external forces of Nature, and\nis compelled to face the same contingencies, deficient livelihoods, and\nevery kind of harassing disease and misery.\n(_c_) If we carry investigation further to that still higher plane\nof immediate reality where _spiritual_ interests are predominant we\nshall find this dependence on external condition for the first time\nemphasized in its full relativity. Here we are face to face with the\nprose of human existence in its entire length and breadth. The contrast\nalready noticed between ends subservient to purely physical wants, and\nthose profounder aims of spiritual life, and the conflict which tends\nto inflict a loss on one side or the other, already opens our view of\nit. Add to this every individual man, in order to preserve himself as\nsuch, is compelled to make himself in many ways subservient to others,\nand the limited aims of others, and on the other hand, in order to\nsatisfy his own narrow interests, to accept the service of others as a\nmere means for their fulfilment. The individual, then, as he appears\nin the prose-life of everyday existence, is not therefore active\nout of his own particular totality, nor is he intelligible so much\nin virtue of himself as in virtue of that which he is not[264]. For\nindividual man stands in a relation of dependence to the influences,\nlaws, organizations and other social relations of civic life which\nhe finds already existing around him, and to which he must submit\nwhether he forfeit his own independent soul-life thereby or not. And\nmore than this, each separate individual is not presented to others\nas such totality, but is only reflected in whatever isolated interest\nthey may happen at the time to possess in his actions, desires, and\nopinions. And what interests mankind mainly is some relation to\ntheir own particular thoughts and aims. Even historically important\nactions and events, with which the community is expressly associated,\nappear in this field of relative appearances merely as a manifold of\nisolated efforts. It is a varied collection to which each contributes\nas he may, with aims by no means identical, some of which meet with\nsuccess while others miscarry, and indeed, be they ever so fortunate,\nare significant in a very subordinate degree if we consider them as\ncontributions to the wellbeing of all. What the majority may carry\nthrough, in contrast with the entire aggregate of events and the end\napplicable to all[265], to which it furnishes its quota, is after all\na mere patch; nay, even men of eminent standing, who feel and are\nfully conscious of the universal passage of events[266], as their own\nworld, are for all that clearly immeshed in the same net of particular\ncircumstances, conditions, and a thousand other hindrances involved\nin their relative position. On all these grounds it is plain that in\nthis sphere of exterior life the individual world is unable to offer\nus the vision of that independent and complete freedom of the living\nprinciple, such as is essential to the true notion of beauty. It is,\nof course, true that the immediate appearance of human reality and\nits events and organizations is not without system, and as such is a\ntotality of activities; but this whole is rather in its appearance a\nmere mass of isolated fragments. Moreover the practical concerns of\nsuch activities are divided and subdivided into countless parts, and in\nsuch a way that each single part is in touch with the merest fraction\nof all; and, in short, however much individuals may remain steadfast to\ntheir own purposes, and only bring forth to the light that which their\nown interest has employed as a means, the self-subsistence and freedom\nof their will remains more or less of a formal character, determined by\nexternal circumstance or accident, and constantly thwarted by natural\ncauses[267].\nThis is the prose of the world, as presented to our own consciousness\nno less than to that of others; a world of finitude and change, a world\nimmeshed in relation and submerged beneath the pressure of necessity,\na world from which no individual can extricate himself. The central\nparadox of life confronts every unit of the living whole. On the one\nhand there is the impulse of individuality to perfect its isolated\nunity in self-exclusion; on the other there is the necessary condition\nof dependence on others from which none may claim immunity. However\nprolonged the struggle to overcome this contradiction may be the effort\nof that interminable battle only terminates with life itself.\n3. Thirdly, the immediate singularity of the worlds of Nature and Mind\nis not merely conditioned by dependence on others, but is deficient in\nany complete self-subsistency owing to its _confined_ nature, or with\nmore accuracy, because it is particularized in its own specific mode of\nmanifestation.\n(_a_) We will explain our meaning further. Every single specimen of\nlife in the animal world is from the first fettered by a definite,\nthat is to say, a restricted and constant species, beyond the limits\nof which it cannot pass. There is in the spiritual world, no doubt, a\ngeneral picture of life and its organization, which floats vaguely\nbefore our vision; but in the real world, which is one with Nature,\nthis universal organism breaks up into a multitude of particulars,\neach of which possesses the determinate type of form and grade of\ncultivation in which it is related to a definite portion of the\nsocial organism. In addition to this and within these insuperable\nlimits, we find the pressure of that element of contingency, as\nregards general condition or external environment, predominantly\nasserted both uniquely and in haphazard fashion throughout every one\nof those individual units. Such a state of things disturbs our vision\nof the self-subsistency and freedom, which the idea of true beauty\nimperatively requires.\n(_b_) As already observed, it is unquestionably true that Spirit\ndiscovers in its own bodily organism the notion of life completely\nrealized. This is so much the case that, in contrast with it, the forms\nof the animal world appear not only as incomplete, but in inferior\nspecies as even pitiable objects. The human organism is also, however,\nbroken up, if to a less, degree, in racial subdivisions and the\nascending grades of beauty which distinguish such races. Moreover, in\naddition to this obviously very general line of demarcation, we have\npresented to us all the accidental variety of qualities, peculiar to\ndistinct families and their interfusion with one another, such as modes\nof life, facial expression, and general demeanour. We must further\nassociate with such characteristic traits, which all of them emphasize\na condition of essentially unfree particularity, those peculiarities\nwhich are inseparable from activity employed in the endless round of\ncommercial life or professional career; qualities which find their\nultimate expression in the specific habits or idiosyncracies of any\nexceptionally marked character or temperament, or, as the reverse side\nof the picture, in the various confusions of arrested development.\nPoverty, care, anger, coldness, and indifference, the rage of passion,\nthe obstinate retention of narrow purposes, indications of change\nand division in the spiritual world, entire dependence on that of\nNature--in one word all that is implied in the transitory condition of\nhuman life--leaves its indelible, if quite incalculable, expression\non the varied surface of the faces of mankind. Who has not crossed\nweather-beaten types of such, on which the storm of all the passions\nhas imprinted its disturbing wave; or others, where the coldness and\nsuperficiality of the soul within is all the impression we receive; or,\nlastly, as the final verdict of self-absorbed particularity[268], cases\nin which the general type seems almost totally to have disappeared.\nThere is no end to the caprice of the human features. Speaking\ngenerally, we would associate with this ground the fact that the beauty\nof children most arrests us. In their faces we find all pronounced\nidiosyncracies slumber as it were beneath a quiet veil; no dominating\npassion as yet ravages their soul; not one of the thousand interests of\nthe grown man has engraved for ever the expression of its necessity on\nthese mobile features. This envisaged innocence of the child, however,\nthough we may discover in its flexible animation the possibility of\nLife's completed fulness, obviously fails to reveal those profounder\nindications of a spirit which has been carried forward to explore\nthe range of its own recesses and to make its life one with rational\npurpose.\nWe may regard, then, immediate existence, both in the purely physical\nand spiritual sense of the term, as a _finitude_, or more justly as a\nfinitude which does not satisfy its notion and for this very reason\ndeclares its finitude. For the notion, and more concretely still, the\nIdea, is essentially _independent_ and _free._ Purely animal life,\nalthough as Life it is the Idea, is no manifestation of infinity as\nsuch or freedom. This is alone possible under conditions, where we find\nthe notion penetrate so completely the reality which is adequate to\nit, that it finds itself entirely at home therein, with no extraneous\nmatter, to disturb its possession. Then alone do we find it a really\nfree and concrete individuality. The natural life, on the contrary,\nis unable to overcome the element of feeling to which it is attached,\nand which renders it incapable of penetrating the entire reality\nwhich enrings it. It finds itself, moreover, immediately conditioned\nin itself, restricted in its range and dependent, a result which is\ndue to the fact that its freedom is not truly self-determinate, but\nconditioned by the external: object. And the same thing is true of the\nimmediate and finite reality of the spirit world in its knowledge,\nvolitional action, and fateful history. For although in this latter\ncase we find centres of unity expressed which have a real significance,\nneither these any more than the particularities they unite have truth\nas they stand by themselves; but only that truth which, in their\nreciprocal relation to each other, they manifest as constituent\nparts of a whole. And this whole, albeit in a sense adequate to its\nnotion, does not correspond to it in such a way as to manifest itself\nin its full totality[269], which consequently still remains aloof\nfrom such envisagement, or rather, is only apprehended in the ideal\nworld of thought. In other words, the notion finds no fully adequate\npresentation in external reality, such as is powerful enough to marshal\nhomogeneously all the numberless fragments of particularity, and to\nconcentrate them into _one_ expression and _one_ single form.\n(_c_) This, then, is the fundamental reason which prevents Spirit\nitself, on the finite planes of determinate existence, and under\nthe restricting conditions of its externality and necessity, from\nrediscovering the immediate vision and enjoyment of its freedom. It\nis consequently driven by its absence to seek that vision in a higher\nsphere. That sphere is art, and its realization is the Ideal.\nWe have thus seen that it is the defects of immediate reality which\ndrive us forward inevitably to the idea of the beauty of art. We are\nfurther under an obligation to prove that its fundamental object[270]\nis to manifest here on this very plane of rational reality and in its\nfreedom the envisagement of life, and, most important of all, the life\nof Spirit. Here, then, we have at last the external revealed to us in a\nform adequate to the notion. Here, for the first time, truth is lifted\nup from its environment of temporal conditions, from its running to\nand fro among the whirl of finite particularity, and attains repose;\nnay, more than this, discovers an external form, from which the hunger\nof Nature and the prose of life no longer stare at us. Here at last we\nhave a form worthy of substantial truth, which is wholly self-contained\nand self-dependent, determining with freedom its own content, and not\ndriven from such self-assertion by the weight of that of others.\n[Footnote 201: _Als Beseelung sich kund g\u00e4be._ The reference is to\nthe second class which follows rather than truly animates life. The\nsun is such an animating principle. How far modern physics with its\ninvestigations of the laws of motion that obtain among the chemical\natoms of any specific form of matter and its denial of all dead matter\nwould have modified Hegel's view is an interesting question.]\n[Footnote 202: _Wir wollen betrachten._ Hegel seems to be conscious\nhimself that there is something fanciful in this interpretation of the\nsignificance of what is simply an arbitrary, if systematic, arrangement\nof bodies according to natural laws.]\n[Footnote 203: _Ein besonderes Moment._ See note [191] on p. 152.

I would\nrather remind the general reader that in this entire discussion of\nthe principle of individuality and its modes of real existence we are\nface to face with one the fundamental difficulties of the Hegelian\nphilosophy, the passage of the Idea to Nature. Readers who wish to see\ndifficulties more fully developed on this aspect of Hegel's thought\nshould read Professor Seth's interesting and on the whole moderately\nworded criticism contained in his little book \"Hegelianism and\nPersonality\" (Blackwood and Sons; see particularly Lecture IV, Thought\nand Reality).]\n[Footnote 264: _Aus Anderem_, _e.g._, the not-self of experience.]\n[Footnote 265: _Des totalen Zwecks_.]\n[Footnote 266: I think the expression _das Ganze der Sache_ means this\nrather than the entire \"organic whole of living reality.\"]\n[Footnote 267: It is well for the general reader to remember that we\nhave here no full account of what constitutes the _content_ of a free\nwill.

But it is just possible that a certain type of aggressive\ngenius may also be denoted.]\n[Footnote 269: The totality of the notion.]\n[Footnote 270: _Beruf_, _i.e._, that which it professes to do.]\nCHAPTER III\nTHE BEAUTY OF ART, OR THE IDEAL\nIn our consideration of the beauty of art we will confine our attention\nto three fundamental points of view:\n_First_, the Ideal in its essential import.\n_Secondly_, the determination of the Ideal in a particular work of art.\n_Thirdly_, the creative subjectivity of the artist.\nA. THE IDEAL SIMPLY, OR AS SUCH\n1. The most general conclusion which may be gathered from the\nexamination we have already made in a merely formal way of the Ideal\nof art may be thus summarized. Truth, in its unravelment as external\nreality, is only fully in possession of a true and determinate\nexistence, however much it may combine and retain in embracing unity\na manifold content, in so far as every portion of the content thus\nunfolded permits this unity, which may be called either the animating\nsoul or the unified totality, freely to appear. To take the human form\nonce more under review as the most direct illustration of this, we have\nalready remarked that it is a totality of organic members each of which\nis penetrated by the notion, differentiated thus in every particular\norgan by some particular mode of activity and the specific motion\ncongenial to it. If we ask ourselves now in which particular organ the\nsoul appears as such in its entirety we shall at once point to the eye.\nFor in the eye the soul concentrates itself; it not merely uses the eye\nas its instrument, but is itself therein manifest. We have, however,\nalready stated, when referring to the external covering of the human\nbody, that in contrast with the bodies of animals, the heart of life\npulses through and throughout it. And in much the same sense it can\nbe asserted of art that it has to convert every point of the external\nappearance into the direct testimony of the human eye, which is the\nsource of soul-life, and reveals Spirit. Take the famous adjuration of\nPlato to the stars in the lines:\nWhen thou gazest forth at the stars, my star,\nWould that I were the heavens and thence on thee\nCould gaze forth out of a thousand eyes.\nConversely we may exclaim that art gives to her forms the dilation\nof a thousand-eyed Argus, through which the inward life of Spirit at\nevery point breaks into view. And not merely is it the bodily form,\nthe expression of countenance, the attitude and demeanour which thus\navails; the same appearance is everywhere visible in actions and\nevents, speech and voice-modulation, in short, under every condition of\nlife through which it passes, and under which it is possible for soul\nto make itself recognized in its freedom and ideal infinity.\n(_a_) And, in close connection with this inquiry into the\ninterpenetration through all parts of the animating soul, we may justly\nask ourselves, what precisely we understand under this conception\nof a soul which is throughout visible: or to restrict attention to\ndefinite limits we may inquire what are the specific characteristics\nof the soul whereof art reveals to us the truest manifestation. For in\nordinary parlance one refers to the animating principle[271] peculiar\nto metals, stones, wild animals, to say nothing of that belonging\nto every kind of human character and its expressions. To natural\nobjects, however, such as stones and plants, the expression \"soul\" in\nthe complete acceptation of the term above mentioned is not strictly\napplicable. Such soul as purely natural objects possess is entirely\nfinite, transitory, and rather a specific nature than a soul. The\ndeterminate individuality of such existences is consequently completely\nexposed in their finite existence; and, inasmuch as all that is\npresent there is a positive limit of restriction, such appearance as\nthere may be of a further claim to independence and freedom is only\nan appearance; ideal characteristics which may indeed be imported\ninto them from without by means of art, but are not in the nature of\nthe objects by themselves. In the same way the soul of sense-feeling,\nthrough which Nature manifests first the Life-principle only betrays\na subjective individuality, which still remains shut within itself,\nunable to assert its reality in the further sense of a return upon\nitself in a consciousness which shall attach to it the form of\ninfinity. Its content is, therefore, of a restricted nature, and its\nmanifestation in part the unrest, power of motion, sexual impulse,\nanxiety or fear of the dependent life; and, in part, it is the mere\nexpression of an _inwardness_ capable of overcoming its finitude. The\nanimating life of Spirit (mind) brings us first into contact with the\nfree infinity capable within its own external and determinate existence\nof remaining constant to the inner principle of unity, and, in the\nact of expression, still reflected back upon its ideal substance. To\nSpirit consequently is it alone permitted to impress the hall-mark of\nits infinity and free self-recurrence on its external expression, even\nthough by such expression it enters the realm of narrow boundaries.\nAt the same time we may observe that Spirit, too, is only free and\ninfinite in so far as it truly apprehends its universality, and\ndeliberately posits for itself and accepts those ends which are\nadequate to its own notion. Consequently, in so far as it fails to\ngrasp its own freedom it can only exist in a restricted content,\na character that is stunted, a temperament at once crippled and\nsuperficial. In combination with nullity of this kind the manifestation\nof Spirit must perforce remain wholly formal. We shall only find here\nthe abstract crust of self-conscious Spirit, whereof the content\ncontradicts the infinity of its freedom. Only by virtue of a genuine\nand essentially substantive content through which the restricted and\nmutable particularity derives its essential self-subsistency--so\nthat definite structure and intrinsic worth, determined limit and\nsubstantial content, are realized in one totality--is such existence\nthereby able, through the very mode of expression which confines it,\nto proclaim itself also in its universal substance of self-contained\nsoul-life. It is, in short, the province of art to comprehend and\nenunciate determinate and rational existence in its _truth_, that is to\nsay, in the form adequate to its substance, the truly explicit content.\nAnd, consequently, the truth of art cannot consist in a mere conformity\nsuch as that to which we restrict the so-called imitation of Nature;\nexternal form must express harmoniously an internal content which is in\nitself harmonious throughout, and consequently can express itself as\nsuch.\n(_b_) Art then, by comparing what is otherwise stained and rent\nthrough the contingent elements of external existence with the harmony\nthat is essential to its notional truth, rejects that in the world\nof appearance which it is unable to combine in such a unity, and for\nthe first time through this _purification_ reveals the Ideal. It\nis possible to regard such a result as the flattery of art, as we\nsometimes hear it said, for example, that portrait-painters flatter.\nBut even the portrait-painter, a type of art in which the Ideal is\nless prominent than in many others, should at least flatter in this\nsense, that he is bound to treat with indifference all that is merely\nthe external detail of form, texture, and colour, the mere adjuncts,\nthat is to say, of physical life such as hairs, pores, scars, and other\nexternal accidents, in his undivided effort both to apprehend and\ndeliver the subject selected in its universal character and permanent\nspiritual individuality. It is one thing to imitate a physiognomy in\nthe general outlines of purely superficial repose apparent at any time;\nit is quite another to detect and delineate the particular features\nwhich reveal the fundamental soul-life or character of the sitter.\nAs already remarked, the Ideal is only truly found when the external\npresentment is in itself a vehicle of the soul. It is one of our latest\nfashions to attempt, by means of those so-called \"living pictures,\" an\nintentional and gratifying imitation of famous masterpieces. In these\nwe find a fair reproduction of general accessories, such as grouping\nand draping; but, instead of the spiritual expression of the figures,\nhave only too often to put up with faces absolutely commonplace. Such\na defect mars the entire reproduction. The Madonnas of Raphael, on the\ncontrary, in every detail of their countenance--whether it be cheeks,\neyes, nose, or mouth--exhibit with harmonious consistency one supreme\ntype of sacred joy, the pious, modest love of a devoted mother. We may\naffirm, if we will, that all women are capable of such emotion; but, at\nany rate, not every formal shape of feminine countenance is capable of\nexpressing the depth of the same so consummately.\n(_c_) This reference, then, of all points of external existence to\ntheir spiritual significance, so that the external appearance unveils\nin adequate measure the spirit thereof, is just what constitutes the\nnature of the Ideal. It is, however, a \"carrying back\" into inwardness,\nin which we do not find the universal thus carried back to its\nextremest limit to the form of abstract _thought_, that is to say, but\nis rather suffered to rest halfway at the point in which we find the\npurely external and the purely inward meet together harmoniously. The\nIdeal is consequently the reality selected out of the mass of chance\nparticulars, in so far as the inner core in this external totality thus\nraised in opposition to universality is itself manifested as _living\nindividuality._[272] For the individual subjectivity, which not only\ncarries in itself a substantive content, but permits the same to appear\nin its own external appearance, stands in this central position, that\nin it all that is substantially the content is not suffered in its\nuniversal aspect to appear as an abstraction of itself, but still\nremains enclosed within the sphere of individuality, and consequently\nappears associated with a determinate existence, which now for its\npart, freed from mere finitude and transitory condition, is gathered\nup in a free and harmonious expression of most intimate soul-life.\nSchiller, in his poem \"The Ideal and Life,\" contrasts the reality and\nits pains and struggles with \"the still shadowland of Beauty.\" Such\na land of shadow is the Ideal. The _spirits_ which rise up here have\nlost in death immediate existence, are released from the hunger of\nNature, freed from the claims which fettered them in subjection to\nexternal forces and all the changes and confusions which are linked\ntogether with finite appearance. But however much the Ideal treads\nunder foot the mere object of sense and natural form, it draws at the\nsame time the very wealth of it to itself, for it is art that is able\nto assign the very limits to all that the external appearance required\nfor its self-preservation within which the external thing may appear\nas the manifestation of spiritual freedom. For this reason it is the\nIdeal which alone among things envisaged to sense presents a free and\nself-contained content reposing on its own resources, in complete\nsensuous enjoyment and satisfaction with itself. The music of this\nrapture may be heard through every embodiment of the Ideal. However far\nthe external form may be carried the soul of the Ideal is never wholly\nabsorbed in it. And in truth such manifestation is only beautiful in so\nfar as its beauty not merely permeates the whole, but is a subjective\nunity, by virtue of which the subject-matter of the Ideal must appear\nemergent from all the fracture of its former individual parts and their\nrespective ends and energies, raised in the Ideal itself to a higher\ntotality and self-subsistence.\n(_\u03b1_) We may in this respect point to the blessed repose[273], this\nself-contentment in its own self-secure consummation, as the crown of\nthe Ideal. The ideal form of art stands like some blissful god before\nus. For the blessed gods are ultimately above and beyond the grim\nearnest of actual necessity, anger, and interest in finite existence\nand purely finite ends; and this positive withdrawal involved in the\nnegation of all isolated particularity give them the characteristics of\ncheerfulness and repose. In this sense we may interpret that phrase of\nSchiller: \"Life is earnest, Art is _cheerful._\" Pedants, no doubt, have\noften enough cracked a joke over it, inasmuch as poetry in general,\nand Schiller's in particular, is a serious matter; and in truth no\nideal art is without such a quality; but for all that in this very\nearnestness the essential character of cheerfulness[274] remains. This\nforce of individuality, this triumph of self-concentrated freedom, is\nthat which we recognize in an exceptional degree in ancient works of\nart and the blithesome repose of their figures. And this is not merely\nthe case when we face a satisfaction that involves no struggle, but\neven in an example where the subject is rent by some breach in the\nentire content of its existence. For when the heroes of tragedy are\nrepresented as subject to Fate we find that the demeanour they present,\nwhich may be summed up in the words, \"It is so!\" still remains a simple\nwithdrawal into personality[275]. The subject thus depicted remains\nthroughout true to himself. He surrenders that which is seized from\nhim, but the aims he pursued are not simply taken away; he suffers them\nto lapse and consequently does not lose his initiative. The man who is\nthe bondman of Destiny may lose his life, but not his freedom. This\nrepose on the essential birthright of Spirit is that which is able to\npreserve and reveal the blithe atmosphere of repose in grief itself.\n(_\u03b2_) In romantic art, it is true, the breach or dissonance of the\nsubjective principle is carried further, inasmuch as in it the\nexposed contradictions are emphasized and their division can be\npreserved. Thus, to take an example, we find the art of painting, in\nits representation of the Passion, not unfrequently dallies round\nthe expression of ribaldry visible in the hideous contortions and\ngrimaces of tormenting common soldiers; and, in its attachment to\nsuch discordant emotions, especially when depicting what is criminal,\nshameless, or evil, permitting the glad serenity of the Ideal to pass\naway. Even when such disruption loses its force, we find frequently\nthat ugliness, or, at least, the absence of real beauty, is set up in\nits place. In another school of the earlier Flemish art of painting\nthe downright directness and truth of the representation, no less than\nthe inextinguishable confidence of the faith to which it testifies,\ntend to assert, in despite of itself, a reconciliation in the feelings\nof all who behold it[276]. But such an unyielding result falls[277]\nshort of the entire cheerfulness and satisfaction appropriate to the\nIdeal. However, it is possible also in romantic art, albeit here\nthe representation of suffering and grief penetrates the soul and\nits emotions more deeply than is the case with antique art, that\nthe delineation may reveal to us a spiritual intimacy, a delight in\nresignation, a blessedness in pain, a rapture in sorrow, nay, even\na voluptuous ecstasy in martyrdom[278]. Not only in painting but in\nthe profoundly religious music of Italian composers, we find this\necstasy and illumination of grief abundantly expressed. We may, as a\nsummary definition in romantic art, call it \"the smile through tears.\"\nThe tears have their origin in affliction, the smile in blithesome\nserenity, and consequently this smile through weeping indicates, as it\nwere, the point of self-repose in the midst of pain and suffering. It\nis hardly necessary to add that the smile indicated here is no mere\nsentimental emotion, no mere vanity of the subject treated or dabbling\nwith beauty[279] over painful effects and insignificant traits of\nsubjective feeling; rather (on its artistic side) it must appear as the\nfirm delineation and freedom of beauty in defiance of all pain, in the\nspirit of what was said of Ximenes in the romances of the Cid, \"how\nbeautiful she was in tears.\" In contrast to this emotional abandonment\nin men is either ugly and repellent, or actually ridiculous. Children,\nfor example, break into tears at the slightest provocation, and we can\nonly laugh at them. The tears, however, in the eyes of a man of earnest\nand self-contained character, under stress of deep feeling, betray a\nvery different type of emotion. Laughter and tears can, however, very\nreadily fall apart as unrelated, and are, as such, falsely utilized as\na vehicle of art in such abstraction; the laughter chorus in Weber's\n\"Freisch\u00fctz\" may be cited as an example. Laughter, after all, is a kind\nof explosion, which it is impossible to exercise without restraint and\npreserve the Ideal. Another example of this laughter, which is nothing\nbut laughter, occurs in a duet of Weber's \"Oberon,\" throughout which\nwe are in a continual state of anxiety for the prima donna's throat\nand lungs. How very differently the inextinguishable laughter of the\ngods affects us in Homer, a sound which breaks from the blessed repose\nof divinity, and rather expresses gladsome serenity than abstract\nand wanton abandonment. Just as little ought weeping, devoid of all\nrestraint, to be introduced into the ideal work of art, of such a kind\nas that we may hear in all its comfortlessness in another part of the\n\"Freisch\u00fctz.\" And speaking generally, in music singing must take to\nitself the kind of joy and rapture which we catch from the lark in the\nopen sky. Shrieking, whether of pain or delight, is not music at all.\nEven in the expression of suffering the sweet tones of the plaint must\npenetrate and clarify the sorrows, so that it continually may seem to\nus worth all the suffering to arrive at such sweetness of plaint in its\nexpression. And this is the sweetness of melody, the singing of every\nkind of art.\n(_\u03b3_) Regarded in a certain relation to this fundamental axiom of art\nwe may find some justification for the principle of irony in its modern\nsense; but it must not be overlooked that irony is frequently destitute\nof all real seriousness, and is particularly prone to expatiate over\nbad subject-matter; and, in another aspect of it, it is apt to run to\nseed in the mere yearning of emotion rather than actively participate\nin practical life, as is proved by the case of Novalis, one of the\nfiner temperaments who have made this point of view their own, and\nfor lack of definite interest, or through shrinking from the real\nworld, are driven up and down, and cajoled into this sort of spiritual\nconsumption. This is the kind of yearning which will not descend\nto mere practical business and production, because it is afraid of\nsoiling itself with the contact of finite things, although it already\nsecretly feels the defects of such exclusion. No doubt we find in\nirony that absolute principle of negativity, in which the subject of\nconsciousness becomes self-centred through the annihilation of definite\nrelations and particulars; but in this case the act of annihilation\nof definite relations and particulars, as we have already pointed out\nwhen discussing the principle, is not, as in comedy, essentially in\nits right place, simply exposing its own want of substance, but is\ndirected quite as often against everything else excellent in itself\nand of sterling worth. Whether we regard irony, then, as this art of\nuniversal destruction, or as the yearning of which we have spoken in\ncontrast with the true Ideal, it betrays a secret lack of proportion\nand restraint which is detrimental to the artist. Substantive form is\nwhat the Ideal demands, which, owing to the fact that it is clothed in\nthe form and figure of external things, is unquestionably qualified\nby particularity no less than limitation; but this limitation of its\nform is at the same time included in such a way that everything merely\nexternal in its appearance is annulled and abolished. Only through\nthis negation of mere externality is the determinate form of the Ideal\na real exposition of the substantive content which belongs to it in a\nmode of appearance susceptible to sense-perception and the imagination.\n2. The plastic presentment of form, which is as much a constituent\nfeature of the Ideal as it is of the essentially homogeneous character\nof its content, and the way these two aspects are fused together,\nrender necessary an inquiry into the relation obtaining between the\nideal representation of art and Nature. For this external aspect and\nits embodiment is closely associated with that which we generally\ncall Nature. In this connection we once more come upon that old and\never-renewed and still unsettled dispute, whether the representation\nof art should follow the objects of Nature as they appear strictly to\nsense, or should rather ennoble and illumine them. The right of Nature,\nthe rule of beauty, the Ideal and the truth of Nature--with indefinite\nconceptions such as these arguments for and against may be bandied\nabout for ever. A work of art, we are told, should unquestionably be\nnatural, but there is such a thing as a mean or ugly Nature, we must\nnot of course imitate _that_; on the other hand--and so our disputants\nwrangle on and never come to a satisfactory conclusion.\nIn recent times the opposition between the Ideal and Nature has once\nmore been emphasized and received an exceptional significance through\nthe writings of Winckelmann. Winckelmann's enthusiasm, as already\npointed out[280], was first awakened by his study of the antique and\nits ideal forms. This insight into the peculiar excellence of classic\nart he thoroughly mastered and only ceased from his labours after\nmaking all that he had learned through his study of such masterpieces\nfamous throughout Europe. From this recognition, however, originated a\nkind of craze for ideal representation, which, despite all its belief\nin the discovery of beauty, was really a relapse into flatness, absence\nof vitality, and superficiality. It is this kind of emptiness more\nparticularly in the art of painting, which Herr von Rumohr had before\nhim in the polemical writings I have already noticed.\nThe theory of art has to solve this difficulty. As for its interest, on\nthe practical side of art, we shall do well to pass it wholly by. We\nmay formulate principles as we please for mediocrity and the talents\nthat express it, the result is always the same. Whether our theory\nis a distorted one or unexceptionable all we shall get is something\ncommonplace or weak. At the same time Art and more particularly\npainting has unquestionably received a stimulus other than that we have\ndeprecated from this very quest of so-called Ideals; and, through the\nrenewed interest thereby excited in old Italian and German painters,\nhas at least made an effort to secure a profounder and more vital\ncontent in its work.\nThe world is quite as tired of hearing the praises of that equally\nexclusive Ideal in the opposite camp, namely, that of undiluted realism\nin art. Theatregoers are, to take an example close at hand, heartily\nsick of the realistic type of domestic drama. The old story over and\nover again--disputes between husband and wife, sons and daughters, the\nsource of our income, the inventory of our expenses, the servility of\nministers and the intrigues of their lackeys and secretaries, down to\nthe question of the last sixpence between the dame of the house and\nher kitchen-maid, or up to the last gossip of the daughters over their\ntouching love-affairs in the parlour--such tales of woe most of us will\nprefer to take where, we may at least get them without adulteration--at\nhome.\nIn this opposition between Ideal and Nature writers have been inclined\nto regard one type of art to the exclusion of others, with an especial\npredilection, however, for painting, whose subject-matter is the\nparticularity of sense-perception. We will test our problem by putting\nthe question to start with wholly in general terms, thus: \"Is art to\nbe prose or poetry?\" Now what is truly poetical in art is just that\nwhich we have called the Ideal. If the question of difficulty in\nquestion is a mere matter of terminology we are quite prepared to call\nthe Ideal something else. But, however called, the question remains\nwhat it is which constitutes poetry or prose in art. And although the\nadherence to what is in itself poetical in the determination of it by\ncertain crafts may lead those arts into confusion, and, indeed, has\nalready done so, it is contended that in so far as any subject has an\nexpress affinity with poetry, such has been also the subject of genuine\npictorial treatment, genuine for the simple reason that such a content\nis unquestionably of a true poetical nature.\nWell, let us examine a concrete case. The present exhibition of art\n(1818) contains several pictures, all of which are of one school, the\nso-called D\u00fcsseldorf. Every one of these have borrowed subjects from\npoetry, and indeed from the emotional side of poetry peculiarly adapted\nto pictorial representation. The more often and carefully we examine\nthese pictures, the more complete will be our impression of their\nexcessive sweetness and insipidity[281].\nIn the foregoing contradiction there are present the following general\ncharacteristics[282]:\n(_a_) First, there is the formal ideality of the work of art, that is\nto say, the element of poetry in its general signification, which is,\nas the term implies, something composed and brought together by man,\nwhich he has taken into his imagination[283] and then actively worked\ninto the artistic composition.\n(_\u03b1_) The nature of the content of such a translation may however, be\na matter of indifference or, apart from the artistic representation we\nthus obtain of common life, may only interest us indirectly for the\nmoment. In this way the Dutch school of painting, for example, has\nrecreated, as it were, by means of human workmanship, the evanescent\neveryday appearances of natural objects in countless new artistic\neffects. Velvet, armour, light, horses, work-folk, old cronies,\npeasants puffing their smoke from old pipe stumps, the glitter of wine\nin transparent tumblers, rustics in soiled jackets playing with cards\nas ancient--such and a hundred other subjects like them which trouble\nus little enough in everyday life, for the best of reasons, that\nalthough we too may have our game at cards, our drink, and our gossip\nwe are really occupied with quite another class of interests--all this\nmedley of objects is brought before us in their pictures. Now the claim\nof art in the representation of such things is precisely this external\nshow, or reappearance of them as a product of spiritual activity,\nwhich has transmuted that which was purely external and sensuously\nmaterial into a new medium supplied by mind. For instead of wool or\nsilk that are tangible, instead of actual hair, glasses, flesh, and\nmetals, all we see now is colour; instead of the three dimensions which\nare essential to external Nature, we have only superficies; and yet,\ndespite all our losses, we have a representation identical with that of\nreality.\n(_\u03b2_) In opposition to the immediate and prosaic reality of objects,\nthen, this _show_ of things which is effected by the mind is the\nwonder of ideality, a jest, if anyone cares to put it so, and an\nirony directed against purely external existence. Only contrast with\nit the preparations Nature or man has to make in ordinary life, the\ncountless instruments of every kind they have to employ to effect the\nsame result. What opposition the material of such objects--take a\nmetal for example--may offer to any active effect upon it. The world\nof ideas, on the contrary, out of which art creates its products, is\na malleable and simple element, which readily converts everything,\nwhich either Nature or man in his purely natural existence is forced\nto leave bluntly just as they are, to the uses which are appropriate\nto it. In the same way the objects of ordinary apprehension and man\nas we meet him in everyday life are of no incommensurable wealth, but\nsubject to limitations--precious stones, plants, animals, etc., by\nthemselves are of a certain positive and particular character. But\nman in his creative capacity is an entire world of content, which\nhe has filched from Nature, and piled together in the comprehensive\ntreasure-house of his world of images, and which he is now free to give\nforth again simply and without the restraint of external conditions and\nthe detailed processes of actual phenomena. In this idealization art\nstands midway between the purely objective and restricted existence and\nthe entirely subjective world of idea. It gives indeed objects, but\nthey are supplied from the life of mind; it offers them for uses other\nthan those which belong to them; it concentrates their entire interest\nin the abstract form of the ideal show which it therewith manifests to\naesthetic contemplation, and to that alone.\n(_\u03b3_) Art consequently, through the ideality above explained, _exalts_\nobjects otherwise unimportant, determining them, despite their ordinary\ncharacter, in a fixed relation to her own medium and essential aim,\nand by so doing secures from us a sympathy in subject-matter which\notherwise would not have enlisted our serious attention. We find the\nsame transformation in the relation of art to Time. Its position is\nhere too frankly ideal. That which in Nature rapidly passes by in art\nis secured with permanence; the flash of a smile, the sudden curve of\nroguish merriment on the lips, a glance, a gleam of sunshine, together\nwith all those evanescent traits of human life, events and accidents\nwhich come and are gone, and are as quickly lost to memory. There is\nnothing which she cannot wrest from momentary existence, and in this\nrespect even becomes the vanquisher of Nature herself.\nIn this formal ideality of art, however, it is not the content itself\nwhich makes the pre-eminent claim upon us, but the satisfaction we\nderive from the act of artistic reproduction. The representation must\ncertainly strike us as natural, but it is not the reality of Nature\nthat we require; it is rather that of the process of reproduction, this\nvery deposition, in fact, of material conditions which is the poetical\nand ideal element of the work in the formal sense above indicated[284].\nWe delight in a manifestation, which appears to us a product of Nature,\nand which is nevertheless a product of mind without the means at\nNature's disposition. The objects charm us not so much by virtue of\ntheir approach to Nature, but rather because the _artist_ has been able\nto effect that approach.\n(_b_) A further and still profounder reason for our interest in\nartistic products consists in this, that the content is not brought\nbefore us in those forms in which it is found in immediate existence,\nbut, being itself minted by the mind, is capable of considerable\nextension and modification within such forms. All that exists in\nNature is particular, and, indeed, limited in every direction by\nsuch particularity. The creative faculty[285], however, contains an\nintrinsic determination of universal import. And all that it produces\npossesses forthwith a character of universality distinct from the\nparticularity of Nature. The creative faculty thereby secures this\nadvantage; that being of a wider range it is more qualified to grasp\nideal significance, and to insist on that explicitly in all that it\nshows us.\nIt is quite true that a work of art is not entirely the imaginative\nconcept in its universal aspect, but rather the determinate form of\nits envisagement. It is for all that bound, emanating as it does from\nthe creative medium and operations of mind, and despite the living\nresemblance to real things we may find upon it, to permeate the whole\nwith this universal quality. And in this we have that higher ideality\nof the poetical product as contrasted with the purely formal ideality\nof the art of production. From this point of view it is the task of\na work of art to grasp the object in its universal relations, and in\nthe envisagement it presents to let fall everything which stands in a\nwholly external or indifferent relation to the content. An artist for\nthis reason will refuse to accept all forms and means of expression\noffered him by the external world, on the mere ground that he finds\nthem there. His main effort will be, if at least his aim be a real\npoetical creation, to secure that which will appropriately work in\nwith his own imaginative conception; and, if he looks to Nature for\nassistance in supplying him with details, or, generally, as material\nto translate into his work, he will utilize such, not because he finds\nthem so in Nature, but because they fall in their _right_ place as a\npart of his composition and are rightly made for him. This \"right\" of\nthe artist is a higher one than the mere right of immediate _fact._\nIn his representation of the human form, for instance, an artist will\nnot attempt such imitation as we find attempted by those restorers of\nancient pictures, who reproduce old cracks, which through the swelling\nof either paint or varnish have involved all the older parts of the\npicture in a kind of arabesque, even on the portions restored. The\nportrait-painter will rather permit the tracery of the flesh, and _a\nfortiori_ such incidents as freckles, pustules, warts, and so forth,\nto disappear entirely. In this respect the painter Denner, so famous\nfor his close realization of Nature, is by no means an ideal master.\nFor the same reason indications of muscles and veins may be given,\nbut their distinction and relief should be far slighter than that we\nobserve in Nature. In all such impressions little or nothing of spirit\nis manifested, and the expression of spirit is what is essential in\nthe human form[286]. I cannot think it therefore wholly a disadvantage\nthat we moderns have less to do with the nude in sculpture than\nthe ancients. On the other hand the general style of our dress in\ncomparison with the ideal drapery of classical times is less artistic\nand more commonplace. The object in both cases is to cover the form.\nThe drapery, however, we find in the antique is, taken by itself, a\nmore or less formal smooth surface only so far determinate in its\nadjustment to the frame by its attachment to the shoulder. In other\nrespects the garment remains entirely formal[287], hanging down simply\nand freely by virtue of its own immanent weight, or only determined\nthrough the position of the body and the pose and motion of the limbs.\nIn the determination thus implied we find the external shape entirely\nreflecting the mutable expression of the spirit which animates the\nbody. The particular form of the garment, the folds of it, the motion\nof it either up or down is clothed in the shape dictated direct from\nthe inward impulse, and as each may momentarily appear appropriate to\nthe particular pose or movement--and it is this form of determination\nwhich constitutes the ideality of such drapery. In the clothing we\nhave adopted nowadays, on the contrary, the entire material is, from\nthe first, cut out and worked up stiffly into the forms of particular\nlimbs, so that anything approaching spontaneity in its rise and\nfall is impossible. Even the character of the folds is determined by\nprevious models, and generally both cut and fall are worked out wholly\nby the technical rules and craftsmanship of the tailor. It is true,\nof course, that the configuration of the limbs determines generally\nthe form of such clothing; but in this arrangement of the bodily form\nwe merely have either a perverse imitation, or an enveloping of human\nlimbs according to the convention of fashion and the accidental taste\nof the times. The cut of our cloth once made is irrevocably made,\nand neither the position of the body nor the motion of the limbs can\nappreciably affect it. We may move our arms and legs about as much\nas we please, the sleeves of our jackets and our trousers remain\nunalterable. Folds or creases may perhaps appear in them, but even\nthen only on the lines of the original cutting out, as we see them,\nfor example, on the statue of Scharnhorst. Our modern way of clothing\nis consequently, as an external cover, not sufficiently differentiated\nfrom the inner life to appear on its reverse side as the formal\nexpression of that life; instead of this we have a false imitation of\nthe human form stereotyped in the preordained and unalterable cut of\nour tailor.\nA criticism similar to that we have directed to the representation by\nart of the human form and its exterior clothing might be applied to a\nwhole multitude of things which make up the external show of life, or\nminister to its wants, such as eating, drinking, and sleeping--things\nnecessary enough in themselves and useful to all men, which, however\nmuch in their manifold variety, as constituent features of the physical\nlife of mankind, they may blend with those activities more directly\nrelated to its spirit, do not themselves form part of such activities,\nor stand in essential relation either to their determinations or\ntheir interests, and thereby contribute to what is the truly ideal or\nuniversal element in the content of human life. Physical aspects of\nlife such as these may no doubt receive poetical treatment in art;\nand it is generally admitted that the descriptions of a poet such\nas Homer in this direction adhere very closely to Nature. Yet we\nfind that even Homer, despite all his _\u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1_, all the vividness\nof his presentment, is forced to limit his descriptions to general\nobservations; no one expects to find in him an entirely accurate\npicture of the facts in all their detail as they actually would occur\nin life. He may give us, no doubt, in his delineation of the bodily\npresence of Achilles, the lofty brow, the prominent nose, the long\nand stalwart legs, but he is not likely to include in the picture\nevery detail of the veritable existence of limbs point for point, and\nthe relation in which they stand to one another in colour, size, and\nso forth, in other words to offer us Nature's reality instead of an\nartist's portrait. And the reason is obvious inasmuch as in the art of\npoetry the type of expression is always the universal concept of the\nimagination as distinguished from the bare particularity of Nature.\nInstead of the fact the poet always gives us the denominant, the word,\nin which the particular thing is universalized; for the word is a\nproduct of mental conception, and as such already carries in itself\nthe nature of a universal. One is entitled to say, of course, that\nit is _natural_ in the formation of concepts and speech to employ a\nnomenclature, the word, as such an infinite[288] abridgment of the\nexistence we find in Nature; but if we do so the Nature to which we\nrefer it would not merely be opposed to the natural existence with\nwhich we compare it, but would be just that which cancels it. We are\ntherefore confronted with the question in what sense we use the word\nNature when we contrast it with the characteristic of poetry. The mere\nundefined use of the word Nature by itself tells us nothing at all.\nWhat poetry should always give us is the energetic, the essential,\nthe truly characteristic; and this fundamental expressiveness is\nprecisely the Ideal and not the merely immediate, to enumerate all the\ndetails of which in the narration of an event or the portrayal of a\nscene will render either of these simply dull, spiritless, tedious,\nand intolerable. In the manifestation of this universality, however,\none type of art will reveal more clearly its ideal characteristics;\nanother will rather emphasize, by a restricted use of material form,\nthe infinite detail of external reality. Sculpture, for example, is\nin its presentments more abstract than painting; in poetry the epic\ntype, in its realization of the external appearance of life itself,\nwill not be so complete as a dramatic poem should be. On the other\nhand it will surpass the latter in its portrayal of the fulness of\nits imaginative vision, the epic poet being most indebted to concrete\npictures his imagination borrows from past history. In contrast with\nhim the dramatist is mainly restricted to the motives of an action, the\nattitude of the will to it, the psychological problem in short.\n(_c_) It is, then, _Mind_ (Spirit), which gives external realization in\na particular form to the inward world of content which is of essential\ninterest to it; and it is in close relation to this fact that we should\nconsider the question, what precise significance we are to infer from\nthe opposition above discussed between the Ideal and _naturalness._\nAnd first we must observe that from such a point of view the word\n_natural_ is not employed in the most genuine signification of the\nterm. As a description of the external form imposed upon facts by mind\nit obviously is neither the immediate naturality we find in animal\nlife, nor that presented in Nature's landscape. Rather its very form\nof determination, in so far, that is to say, as we see the mind here\ngiving to itself an embodiment, will show us that it is an expression\nof mind, an expression moreover suffused with ideality. For this\ntaking up into the mind, this plastic recreation of form on the part\nof mind is nothing less than idealization. It is sometimes remarked\nof the countenances of dead people that they take on themselves once\nmore the lineaments of childhood. The obdurate expression of passion,\ncustom and strife, the characteristic seal of their life of strenuous\naction, passes off, and the indeterminacy of the features of a child's\nface reappears. In life, however, all traits whatsoever, the entire\npresentment in fact, receive their characteristic expression from the\nworld of soul; and in much the same way the different races and classes\nof mankind reflect the distinguishing features of their spiritual\ntendencies and activities in their external manifestation. In all such\norganizations that which is outward is visibly permeated with mind;\nand, by virtue of its energy, already confronts _mere_ Nature as an\nidealized creation. Only a clear perception of this truth will enable\nus to sift this significant question of an opposition between Nature\nand the Ideal to the bottom. If we do not possess this we shall find\nourselves maintaining that the forms in which Spirit is visualized as\na part of Nature have already lost in that real appearance, which is\nindependent of art's imitative action, such an intrinsic completeness,\nbeauty, and excellence, that it is quite impossible that there can be\nanother and more exalted type of beauty, which presents itself as the\nIdeal in contradistinction to this immediate reality, and this all\nthe more for the reason that art is unable entirely to attain even to\nthat which is present in Nature herself. Or, if our thoughts lean to\nthe opposite extreme, we shall look to art to supply us independently,\nin opposition to Nature's reality, with more ideal modes of\nrepresentation. The polemics of Herr von Rumohr, which we have already\ncriticized, are well worthy of attention in this connection. This\nwriter, at any rate, whatever others may say who have the word Ideal so\nfrequently on their lips in depreciation of the vulgarity of Nature,\nrefers to the Idea and the Ideal in phrases of respect and contempt\nwith absolute impartiality.\nThe real truth of the matter is rather this. There is in the spiritual\nworld, both outwardly and inwardly regarded, a Nature of vulgar type,\nwhich testifies to its meanness outwardly for the simple reason that\nits inward content is mean, that is to say, when all that it can\nrealize externally in its activities are the aims of envy, jealousy,\nand avarice in every detail of sensuous life. Such a poverty-stricken\nNature can no doubt form part of the subject-matter of art, and has\nbeen treated as such. When this is the case, however, as we have\nalready explained, it is not the subject-matter, but wholly the\nartistic handling of it, which creates an interest of any permanent\ncharacter; and the artist will look in vain for sympathy in his\nsubject, or rather the mere material of his subject from the true\nconnoisseur. A particularly pertinent illustration of this type of\nart is the so-called _genre_ painting, which has not shown itself\nabove accepting subjects of this character, the artistic treatment\nof which has been carried by the Dutch school to the extreme limit\nof perfection. It may, however, be as well to ask ourselves,\nfirst, what the precise contribution of the Dutch has been to this\n_genre_-painting, what, in short, is the nature of content their\ndainty pictures express, pictures which at least have asserted an\nextraordinary power of attraction and obviously cannot be shelved right\naway beneath the common stigma of vulgarity. We shall not improbably\nfind, on closer examination, that the subject-matter of these pictures\nis not so contemptible as it is often taken to be[289].\nThe Dutch have selected the subject-matter of their artistic production\nout of their own substance, out of the actual presence of their daily\nlife. To have once for all realized that presence even in art is no\nmatter of reproach to them. To estimate the character of their artistic\ninterest we must view them in close connection with the actual panorama\nof their own times. This is a problem of history. The Dutchman has\nin great measure himself created the ground wherein he lives and\nfinds a home, and has been forced continuously to preserve and defend\nthat home against the invasion of the sea. The citizens of the towns\nno less than the rural population have together, through courage,\nendurance, and bravery, repulsed the power of Spain in the hands of\nPhilip II, son of Charles V, the sovereign of a world-wide empire,\nand in fighting their battle for civic freedom, they were fighting\nthat of religious liberty. This staunch sense of citizenship, this\npassionate love of enterprise in the narrow limits of their fatherland,\nno less than abroad on the high seas, this careful and at the same\ntime clean and dainty mode of life, together with the geniality and\ninvincible self-respect which distinguishes them, all this is as much\nthe fruit of their own actions as it is the general content of their\nartistic production. Such a content as this is no common material,\nthough obviously it is not of the kind we must suppose we can approach\nwith the supercilious superiority of critics for whom the exalted\ntaste of courts and fine society is everything. From a sterling\nnational self-consciousness of this sort Rembrandt painted his famous\n\"Night-Watch\" now in Amsterdam, Van Dyck so many of his portraits,\nWouvermans so many of his battle-pieces; nor should even those\nreflections of rustic drinking-bouts, jovialities, and other scenes of\nmerriment be wholly excluded from the category. And in illustration of\nits excellence we would point, by way of contrast, to a work in this\nyear's exhibition, which, though not downright bad _genre_-painting,\nis much inferior to the handling by old Dutch masters of similar\nsubject-matter, coming nowhere near to their freedom and joy of life.\nIn this picture a housewife is seen entering an alehouse to give her\nhusband a good scolding. Here we have just a scene of cantankerous and\nwaspish human-kind and nothing more. These Dutchmen painted their folk\nvery differently; whether we find them among their cups, at weddings\nor dances, feasting or drinking, nay, even when the matter proceeds to\nribaldry and blows, liveliness and lustiness is the prevailing temper.\nYoung maids and women laugh with the rest, and a feeling of free and\nabandoned merriment carries all before it. This intimate delight in all\nenjoyment justifiably human, which will even absorb itself wholly in\nanimal life and crop up at times as mere satiety and grossness; this\nfreshly awakened sense of freedom and life, fully grasped and embodied\nin composition and colour, is what constitutes the higher spiritual\nimport[290] of these Dutch pictures.\nOn much the same grounds the beggar boys of Murillo, in the central\ngallery of the Munich collection, are excellent. Superficially\nregarded, the subject here, too, is of a vulgar character. The mother\nis scolding one of the youngsters, as he quickly munches a piece of\nbread; two others hard by, ragged and poor, are eating melons and\ngrapes[291]. But in this very poverty of half-nakedness what gleams\nforth from the entire composition as the soul of that beggar life is\nits complete carelessness and spontaneity. No dancing dervish himself\ncould give it us more frankly in its impression of entire health and\njubilant vitality. This freedom from all external care, this inward\nliberty reflecting itself in that which is visible, is precisely that\nwhich the notion of the Ideal demands. There is in Paris a certain\nportrait of a boy by Raphael; the head leans propped at leisure on\none arm, and gazes with such ecstasy of careless contentment into the\nopen landscape that we are loth to turn away from a picture expressive\nof such health and exuberant animation. We receive a delight of very\nmuch the same nature from these lads of Murillo. It is obvious enough\nthat neither their objects nor their interests aim high, but this is\nno result of stupidity; there they chaffer on God's earth with, we may\nalmost say, the bliss and contentment of the Olympian gods themselves.\nThey, too, have their business; but though we hear little about it\nthey are a genuine sample of humanity, neither morose nor discontented\nwith their lot. Feeling this ground-root in them of all sterling\nperformance we can readily imagine that in favourable conditions youth\nsuch as this might be capable of most things. A composition of this\nkind is entirely on a different level from the one above mentioned of\nthe scolding housewife, or two others we might also contrast with it,\nof a certain peasant mending his whip and a postillion sleeping on a\nstraw pallet[292]. Such paintings of _genre_ should unquestionably be\nof small size; and, indeed, in their total impression on the sense,\nthey must be made to appear of comparative insignificance, that we may\nnot feel the character of their subject-matter and its presentment\nhas received undue prominence. It would be intolerable to have such\nsubjects painted life size as though the fulness of the reality were\nsufficiently attractive to claim our attention.\nSuch are the principles which should regulate our artistic treatment\nof and sympathy with that which it is usual to stigmatize as mean or\nvulgar in ordinary life.\nThere is, no doubt, plenty of material for art to appropriate of\nhigher grade than the representation of animal spirits and downright\ncitizenship in all their essentially insignificant detail. Man has\nclearly more serious interests and objects than these, interests which\nhave unfolded as his own spirit has widened and deepened, and in\nharmony with which it is his truest interest to remain. An art will\ntake highest rank which sets before itself the task of giving adequate\nrepresentation to this more vital, or at least more profound, content.\nAnd here at once we are confronted with the old question, what is\nthe source which will supply us with the forms most fitting to such\ncreations of mind. On the one side theorists maintain the opinion that,\ninasmuch as the artist creates these lofty ideas, which he desires to\nclothe in artistic form, he must, also supply their artistic forms,\ncreate, for example, from his imagination the ideal figures of Greek\ngods, Christ, his apostles, saints, and so on. In strenuous opposition\nto this view Herr von Rumohr has entered the lists. This writer is\nof opinion that art is on a false track in supposing that the artist\ndiscovers the forms of his production in himself rather than in Nature,\nand it is under this conviction that he has reviewed the masterpieces\nboth of Italian and Dutch painters. On this head he finds it a matter\nof censure (\"Italian Investigations,\" i, p. 105) \"that the theory\nof art, during the sixty years which have elapsed, should be at the\npains to prove that it is an object, or rather the main object, of\nart to improve upon creation as it is particularised, and by doing so\nto substitute forms which have no particular relation to anything,\nwhich would ape Nature's creation by going several points beyond her,\nand release mortal man from all responsibility for the fact that\nNature has not known how to make her appearance more beautiful.\" And\nconsistently with such a point of view he further advises the artist\n\"to have nothing to do with the gigantic task of attempting to ennoble\nor elucidate the natural form, or attempt any such exalted function\nof the human Spirit under what name soever it may be written down in\nworks upon art\" (_ibid._ p. 63). He is, in short, wholly convinced\nthat, however exalted and spiritual[293] the subject to be treated may\nbe, completely adequate forms are to be found in Nature as immediately\nperceived, and consequently maintains (p. 83), \"that the exposition of\nArt, even in the case of subject-matter as highly _spiritual_ as it is\npossible to conceive, is never indebted to a symbolism capriciously\ncreated by man[294], but depends wholly for its consistency upon what\nis presented as significant by Nature in organic form.\" No doubt in\nadvancing this Herr von Rumohr has particularly under review the ideal\ntypes of antique art as they are expounded by Winckelmann. It is for\nall that the abiding service of Winckelmann to have pointed out and\nset forth in harmonious relation these very types, although he may\ndoubtless have, committed errors of judgment with regard to particular\nmasterpieces while carrying through the same. As a possible example\nof such an oversight Herr von Rumohr thinks he has made out (p. 115)\nthat the increase of length in the lower half of the body, which\nWinckelmann has characterized as an ideal feature of the antique,\nis really borrowed from Roman statuary. And naturally enough, as an\nopponent of the Ideal, improves the occasion by insisting that the\nartist should unreservedly take Nature into his confidence in the\nstudy of form. Here, and here alone, he will find the presence of true\nbeauty. To quote this writer once more it is affirmed (p. 144), \"that\nthe beauty of most importance depends on a symbolic of forms rooted in\nNature rather than human caprice, a beauty through which these forms\nare nourished into their characteristic and symbolic relations, in\nthe vision of which we necessarily have brought back to our memory\ndefinite images and conceptions, and are made more definitely conscious\nof previously dormant feeling.[295]\" I And so finally it appears that\nin this writer's view (p. 105) \"a mysterious trait of our spiritual\nlife, what many would perhaps call Idea, seems to bind together the\nartist and the appearances of Nature, in which latter he is constantly\nand continuously learning to recognize the true character of his own\nartistic purpose[296], and to find himself in a position through them\nto give expression to it.\"\nThere can be no question, of course, that ideal art has no business at\nall with \"a symbolism capriciously created;\" and, if it really is the\ncase that these ideal types of the ancients have been composed only to\nreduce the veritable forms of Nature to false and empty abstraction,\nwe may freely admit that Herr von Rumohr is justified in his most\ntrenchant opposition.\nFor our own part we would emphasize the points of fundamental\nimportance to be grasped in this antithesis between the ideal of art\nand Nature as follows:\nThe forms which are borrowed from immediate Nature to determine an\nideal content must be assumed to be thus taken symbolically in the\nusual sense of the term, namely, that they are not thus immediately\nsignificant in themselves, but only as the external embodiment of that\nwhich is inward and spiritual, the content, in fact, they express. It\nis only Spirit, even in the reality which they possess outside the\nlimits of art, which constitutes their ideality in its contrast with\nthat they entirely owe to Nature simply as such, and which is unable\nto reveal to us what is essentially mind. It is the object of art, on\nits more noble plane, to give external shape to the inward content of\nSpirit. This content we discover in the conscious life of men realized\nin the world. As such it possesses--we include with it our conscious\nhuman experience generally--an external semblance directly presented in\nand through which it finds expression. So much may readily be conceded.\nAt the same time from a philosophical point of view it is simply futile\nto inquire whether we ought to look to the direct facts of Nature alone\nfor objects and physiognomical traits of beauty and expression to serve\nas entirely adequate materials for art's representation, shall we say,\nof the majesty, repose, and power of a Jupiter or of a Juno, Venus,\nPeter, Christ, Madonna, or any other divinity, or saint. Arguments may\nbe supported on either side, and the question can only remain finally\nundecided, being wholly empirical. For the only sufficient way of\ndeciding the matter would be to contrast what is borrowed with the\nrealities it purports to represent, and this, in the assumed case of\nthe Greek gods, might be matter of some difficulty; and, to take the\npresent day, one man will see traits of beauty in their perfection\nwhere another a thousand times more acute will see nothing. But over\nand above such considerations we must observe that the mere beauty\nof form will never give us that we have named the Ideal, inasmuch as\nthe individuality of the content is a constituent part of it, and\ntherein form is necessarily included. A human face, for example, may\nbe both regular and beautiful in its outlines and yet remain cold and\ndevoid of all expression. The ideal figures of the Greek gods are,\non the contrary, true individualizations; the universality of their\nideal conception does not exclude the characteristic determination\nwhich belongs to each of them. And the vitality of the Ideal consists\njust in this, that this determinate and fundamental spiritual\nsignificance, which it is the function of art to exhibit, should\nwholly transfuse by appropriate artistic treatment all the particular\naspects of the external embodiment, such as composition, pose, motion,\nphysiognomy, and configuration of limbs, so that nothing empty or\ninsignificant should be left, but the entire work should reflect that\nideal significance. All that we have learned from Greek sculpture in\nrecent times of a quality which, in fact, emanates from the school\nof Pheidias, is characterized by nothing so much as this penetrative\nvitality. The Ideal is preserved in all its severity without any lapse\nin the direction of mere grace, softness, elegance, and exuberance,\nyet retains the form in close relation to the ideal significance which\nshould be embodied throughout the whole. This supreme vitality is the\ndistinguishing mark of the great artist.\nWe may call a typical significance of this kind, in contrast to the\nparticularity of the external world, essentially abstract. This is\npre-eminently the case in sculpture and painting, arts which illuminate\nbut a momentary state, without proceeding to such a varied development\nof exposition as we find, for example, in that where Homer is able to\ndepict the character of Achilles as mild and courteous no less than\nsevere and terrible, to say nothing of all his other characteristics.\nNo doubt it is possible to find such a significance expressed in\npurely immediate reality. There are, for instance, few countenances\nwhich cannot reflect the moods of piety, devotion, and cheerfulness;\nbut such faces also express countless other moods which either are\nquite inappropriate to that ideal significance, or are only indirectly\nrelated to it. For this reason it is by virtue of its particular\nrealization that a portrait acquaints us of the fact that it is a\nportrait. In many old German and Flemish pictures we find the patron\nof the picture included in the composition with his entire family of\nsons and daughters. All are necessarily painted as though taken in\nan act of devotion, and this spirit illuminates every countenance;\nbut at the same time we have quite as clearly set before us in the\nmen stalwart warriors, men of vigorous action, disciplined on the\nstrenuous field of life and commerce, and in the women dames of an\nequally doughty life-experience. If we compare with such faces--and\nwe may restrict our comparison wholly to these very pictures, which\nare famous for their close approach to Nature in their delineation of\nphysiognomy--those of the Virgin Mary, and the saints and apostles\nwho surround her, we shall find in these latter one preponderating\nexpression; and all the physical lineaments, whether we look at build\nof bone, structure, or muscle, traits of that express motion or\nrepose, are concentrated upon this one artistic effect. That which is\nfelt to be appropriate to the one class and not to the other exactly\ndifferentiates the distinction between the genuine Ideal and mere\nportraiture.\nSome may imagine it possible for the artist to compose the ideal\ncontent of genuine types by a process of sifting and selection from\nthe facts of immediate Nature, or quite possibly from the various\nphysiognomies and compositions which collections of engravings from\nthe copper-plate or the wood may furnish. But a process such as this\nof mere collection and sifting is not the end of the matter. An artist\nmust maintain the creative impulse alert throughout. He must himself,\nin the strength of his own imagination, already impregnated with the\nknowledge of appropriate form and made vital with profound experience\nand emotion, give such an embodiment to the significance, which is the\ninspiring motive of the work, as will make it appear throughout as\nmetal cast at one time and is one state of fusion.\nB. THE DETERMINACY OF THE IDEAL\nTo comprehend the Ideal in its intrinsic significance, that is to say,\naccording to its fundamental notion, was a comparatively easy task. But\nthe beauty of art, in so far as it is the Idea, is not to be restricted\nto the purely universal standpoint of its notional concept; even as\nso comprehended it must necessarily include within it determination\nand particularity, and is compelled to take definite embodiment as\nexternal reality. The question consequently arises in what way is the\nIdeal able still to assert itself in this process of objectification\nin the medium of external things and their finitude, and despite all\nthat is antagonistic to ideality; and as a corollary to this we have to\ninquire how finite and determinate existence is enabled to attach to\nitself the ideality of the beauty of all art.\nWe propose to regulate this inquiry with the following division of our\nsubject matter.\n_First_, the determination of the Ideal in its simplest terms.\n_Secondly_, the determination of it, in so far as it proceeds by virtue\nof its particularity to a condition of _discordant parts_ within itself\nand to their resolution, a condition we may generally, define as\n_action_[297].\n_Thirdly_, the determination of the Ideal from the point of view of it\nas an _external object._\nI. THE IDEAL DEFINITION AS SUCH\n1. We have already observed that it is the function of art to make the\nDivine the focus or centre of its entire exposition. It is, however,\nonly possible for thought in its pure medium, that is to say, apart\nfrom all the sensuous material of the figurative imagination, to\ncomprehend the Divine in its essential significance of _unity_ and\n_universality._ To attempt to do otherwise, by imagining a picture of\nGod more readily grasped by the perception of the senses, is, as we\nknow, forbidden both Jews and Mahommedans. This cuts away the ground of\nthe figurative arts, which absolutely require form as their medium in\nall its concreteness of actual life; and we have only lyrical poetry\nleft us to celebrate in its exaltation the praise of His power and\nglory.\n2. Considered, however, from the reverse point of view, we must equally\nassert that however much unity and universality are predicable of the\nDivine, He is in His essential substance determined, and, so far as He\nwithdraws Himself from the pure quality, of such predicates in their\nabstraction, is thereby an object for the figurative sense and external\nperception. If the Divine is consequently apprehended and figuratively\nembodied for us through the forms of the imagination, we are at once\nconfronted with a possible variety in such determination; and it is at\nthis point that the actual realm of ideal art finds its commencement.\nFor, in the _first_ place, the one Divine substance disunites and\nbreaks itself up into a multiplicity of self-subsistent gods, such as\nwe find presented by the polytheistic system of Grecian art; and even\nin the religious consciousness of Christianity God is, in opposition to\nHis purely spiritual unity, immediately revealed on Earth and in the\nworld-process as man. And, _secondly_, the Divine, regarded generally\nin its determinate appearance and reality, is both present and realized\nin emotional feeling, will, and the education[298] of mankind. For this\nreason and in this sphere men who are filled with the Spirit of God,\nsaints, martyrs, and, in short, all who share in the religious life,\nare equally the appropriate subject of ideal art. With this principle\nof the individuality of the Divine and its determinate existence\nrealized necessarily in the world-process, we are face to face\nwith--and this is the _third_ point to be considered--the particularity\nof human existence. For the entire world of human emotion, with all\nthat stirs it most profoundly--and what a power is implied in that\nopen sea of feeling and passion, everything of deepest interest to the\nhuman heart--this entire content is nothing less than its exposition\nand expression. If it is true, then, that the Divine in its purest\nessence of reason is only the object of the thinking consciousness,\nit is equally true that Spirit, which takes to itself an actively\nbodily presence, so far, that is to say, and only so far as we find it\nreverberate in the heart of humanity, all this lies within the sphere\nof art. Once admit this, and we must admit the content of particular\ninterests and actions, specific characters, and momentary situations,\nin short, the entire process of development in the external order; and\nit becomes of first importance to indicate under a general principle\nin what the relation between the Ideal and this positive determination\nconsists.\n3. In conformity with what we have already advanced it is clear\nthat here, too, the Ideal will be most purely manifested in the\nrepresentation--whether it be of gods, Christ, apostles, saints, or\nany other type of devout persons--which brings most clearly before\nus the qualities of beatified repose and satisfaction, a peace\nundisturbed with that which is earthly, and subject to the storms of\nlife's manifolded complexities, struggles, and contradictions. We are\ntherefore not surprised to find that both the arts of sculpture and\npainting have been peculiarly fitted to incorporate under ideal form\nnot merely the ancient gods, but Christ as saviour of the world, and\nindividual apostles and saints. That which is the most essential truth\nin actual life is concentrated to a focus on itself in the determinate\nembodiment of art, rather than continually forced from its serenity\nthrough dependence upon finite conditions. This essential concentration\nis not destitute of particularity, but the divergent separation, which\nis a feature of the external and finite state, is purified to one\nsimple definition, so that it appears as though all traces of external\ninfluence and the relation thus created were overcome. This deedless\nand infinite self-repose, this \"taking a rest,\" as we find it, for\nexample, in certain statues of Hercules, is just what constitutes the\nsignificance of the Ideal. If the gods are represented in contact with\nthe process of Nature, they must still carry with them their immortal\nand unapproachable majesty. Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, Mars, and their\nlike are, it is true, definite personalities, but they are at the same\ntime unyielding potentates and powers, which preserve within them\ntheir self-subsistent liberty, even when they are actively related\nto the world. And for this reason it is not merely that a specific\nparticularity must characterize the determinacy of the Ideal, but\nspiritual freedom must be manifested thereby as totality, and in this\nstate of repose suggest the potency of unfettered freedom of action.\nIf we turn now from the gods to the less exalted plane of temporal\nexistence and human life, we shall find the Ideal active in its\nrepresentation of the substantial content of such humanity, and its\ndominant repression of wholly subjective particularity. By this we mean\nthat all that is entirely isolate in feeling and action is wrested from\nthe element of contingency, and particularity is represented in its\nconcreteness, that is to say in its wider bond of relation with what\nmost truly and intimately belongs to its life. When, for instance,\nwe speak of the nobility, excellence, or perfection in particular\nmen, we assert in so many words that the substantial core of what is\nspiritual, ethical, and divine has announced itself as prevailing in\nthe individual, and man has submerged his active life, his volitions,\nhis interests, and passions wholly in this substantive basis, that he\nmay thereby give full satisfaction to the most authentic necessities of\nhis soul.\nAt the same time, however much in the case of the Ideal the\ndetermination of Spirit and its external presence appears to be\nabsorbed in the simple self-relation, the principle of _development_\nis likewise directly associated with the particularity unfolded[299]\nin determinate existence, and along with this in that relation to\nenvironment which necessitates both the opposition and conflict\nof clashing forces. This fact necessitates a closer examination\nof the determination of the Ideal regarded in this very aspect of\ndifferentiation and process, an aspect which we may in a general way\ndefine as _action_.\nII. THE ACTION\nThe gracious innocence of beatific enjoyment, the inactive repose, the\nmajesty of power in self-reliant tranquillity, as also the concentrated\ncompactness generally of that which is most substantial in a given\ncontent--all these are essentially ideal modes of determination. That\nwhich is inward, however, and spiritual is in an equal degree active\nmovement and development. One-sidedness and division are inseparable\nfrom development. Spirit that is wholly itself and a totality will,\nexpanding into all particularity, step forth out of its repose,\nin despite of all satisfaction therein, and involve itself in the\ncontradictions of the broken and confused medley of earthly existence,\nand is by so doing unable in this divided world to withdraw itself from\nthe ill-fortune and ill-health that clings to finite existence.\nEven the immortal gods of Polytheism do not dwell in eternal peace,\nbut take sides in mighty conflicts wherein contending passions and\ninterests are roused, being subject themselves to Destiny; nay,\nmore, even the God of Christians is, not delivered from a passage\nof humiliation endured through suffering and shame of death, is not\nspared the bitterness of soul, which perforce cried aloud: \"My God, my\nGod, why hast thou forsaken me.\" And the mother of Christ experienced\nan agony of the same poignant character, and human life in every\ndirection is a life of struggle, battle, and pain. For greatness and\nforce of character is evolved in the greatness and force of contending\nelements, out of which Spirit concentrates itself again and again\nupon its unity. The intensity and depth of subjectivity is only the\nmore emphasized, the more unbroken and unexampled the resistance\nof circumstances to its unity grows, and the more irreconcilable\nthe contradictions appear under which it has to preserve its own\nself-centred equilibrium. In this development and through this alone\nthe might of the Idea and the Ideal is preserved, for power consists\nprecisely in this self-preservation through a process of self-negation.\nInasmuch as it is the fact, then, that the particularity of the\nIdeal passes into a relation with the external world through such\ndevelopment, and by so doing is made partaker in a world, which, so\nfar from manifesting the ideally free association of the notion and\nits external reality, presents an existence which is just that which\nit ought not to be, in apprehending the true nature of this relation\nwe have to consider how far the determinations which affect the Ideal\neither in themselves contain immediately the principle of Ideality, or\nare to a more or less degree susceptible of it.\nIn this connection we would direct attention to three fundamental\npoints of view.\nIn the _first_ place we have the _actual condition_ of the _world\ngenerally_, which is assumed as involved in individual action and\nits specific character. _Secondly_, we have the _particularity_ of\ncondition, the determination of which introduces difference and tension\nwithin the substantive unity, which is the motive-spring of the action,\nin other words the _situation._\nThirdly, we have to consider the situation from the side of\nsubjectivity, and furthermore the reaction by virtue of which the\nconflict and resolution of the element of difference is expressly\nasserted, in other words, the _action_ in its strict sense.\n1. THE GENERAL WORLD-CONDITION\nThe ideal subjectivity is as such essentially a personal relation,\na relation, that is to say, of self to every aspect of motion or\nactivity, in which the self has to assert or perfect its own\nsubstance. And to effect this a world environment is necessary as the\nuniversal ground of its realization. When in reference to this we speak\nof _condition_ we understand by this the universally prevailing mode,\nunder which, within the sphere of spiritual reality, that which is the\n_substantive_ and essentially coalescing fabric of the same is present.\nIn this sense we refer to a _condition_ of education, the sciences,\nthe religious sense, or even of finance, administration of justice,\nfamily life, and similar examples. All these objects of reference are,\nhowever, merely aspects of one and the same spiritual content, which\nis thus in and through them rendered explicit and real. In further\nconsidering the general condition of the world as the universal mode of\nthe reality of Spirit it will be necessary to pursue our examination\nfrom the point of view of the _Will._ It is through the exercise of\nvolition that Spirit generally unites itself to-determinate existence;\nand the substantial _nexi_ which are immediately present in reality\nbetray themselves in the specific modes in which the determinations of\nWill, ethical and legal conceptions, and, indeed, all that belongs to\nthat which we are accustomed, in a general way, to define as justice,\nactively asserts itself.\nThe question consequently arises how such a universal condition must be\ncharacterized in order that it may appear adequate to the individuality\nof the Ideal.\n(_a_) Pursuant to the foregoing considerations we may, to begin with,\nemphasize the following points:\n(_\u03b1_) The Ideal is essential unity; not a purely formal and external\nunity, but the immanent unity of the content in itself. This\nsubstantive repose on its own resources we have already characterized\nas the self-sufficiency, rest, and beatitude of the Ideal. We will, in\ndirect relation to the plane of discussion we have now reached, develop\nthis characteristic of _self-subsistency_[300], making it a primary\ndemand of our argument that what we have termed the general condition\nof the world appear in such a self-subsistent form as will enable it to\naccept the embodiment of the Ideal.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) Now self-subsistency is an equivocal expression to start with.\nIn ordinary parlance that which is essentially substantial is called\nsimply self-subsistent by virtue of the element of causation being\nimplied within this substantiality; we are wont to use it in this sense\nwhen describing the intrinsically divine and absolute. But as retained\nin this universality of substance merely as such it is not declared\nas itself subjective, and consequently meets with its irresolvable\ncontradiction in the particularity of concrete individuality. In this\nbare antithesis all true self-subsistency disappears.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) On the other hand, it is not uncommon to find such subsistency\nascribed to purely formal individuality, consisting solely in\nits self-reliance upon the fixed determinacy of its subjective\ncharacteristics. This subjectivity, however, in so far as the actual\ncontent of life drops away from it, so that the forces and substances\nwhich lie without it acquire in themselves an independent stability,\nand as such confront the subject and the inward life as a content\nwholly unrelated, lapses through this, too, into unequivocable\ncontradiction with the actual substantiality of determinate existence,\nand forfeits all claim to self-subsistency and freedom of content.\nTrue self-subsistence consists alone in the unity and interpenetration\nof both individuality and universality with each other. The universal\nacquires through the individual a concrete existence; the subjectivity\nof the particular thing discovers for the first time in the universal\nthe unassailable basis and the most genuine form of its realized\ntotality.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) Consequently in making this demand of the universal\nworld-condition we must ask for a form of self-subsistency in the same\nsense, namely, that the substantially universal in such a condition\nmust contain within itself as the vehicle of its self-subsistence\nthe form of subjectivity. The most obvious presentment of this\nidentity is that of thought. For if thought is, in one aspect of it,\nsubjective, in another it possesses universality as the product of its\ninherent activity, and encloses both universality and subjectivity\nin unfettered unity. The universal of thought is, however, not that\nof art, whose object is the beautiful. And, indeed, apart from this\ndistinction, particular individuality as confronted by thought in its\nnatural envisagement, or form, no less than in its active effects and\ncomplete realization, stands in no necessary correspondence with the\nuniversality of thought. There is, for example, a clear distinction\nbetween the subject apprehended in its concrete content of the actual\nworld and that which is simply the thinking subject, or at least it is\nopen to such a distinction. The same kind of cleavage affects the form\nof the universal itself. In other words the moment the universal begins\nto assert itself in distinction from its otherwise related reality by\nthat act it has in _objective_ existence separated itself from all the\nvaried play of its phenomenal particularity, and, in opposition to\nthe same, has already established an independent position assured and\npowerful.\nIn the Ideal, however, it is precisely the particular individuality\nwhich ought to persist in inseparable co-ordination with the\nsubstantive reality, and to the full extent that freedom and the\nself-subsistency of the subjective principle may attach to the Ideal\nthe world-environment of conditions and relations should possess no\nessential objectivity independent of the individual in the subjective\naspect above referred to or already presupposed. For the ideal\nindividual is a self-enclosed totality, which already includes the\nobjective principle, and it must not be permitted to have independent\nmotion and development apart from the individuality of the subject;\notherwise the subject falls back into a purely subordinate position\nin contrast to a world whose independence is already assured.\nConsequently the universal must indeed be actual in the individual as\nthat which is in a unique sense its own, but not so as the property\nof the individual, as a _thinker_, but as that of his _character_ and\n_temperament._ To put the same truth in another way, what is required\nfor this unity of the universal and individual in art as opposed to the\nmediation and differentiation of thought, is the form of _immediacy_;\nand the self-subsistency which we claim here is the form of immediate\nself-subsistency. With that, however, the element of _contingency_ is\nassociated. That is to say, so long as the universal and effective[301]\nconstituents of spiritual life, such as the self-subsistency of\nindividuals exhibits, are only presented to us in the immediate guise\nof subjective feeling, temperament, and disposition of character, and\ndebarred any other category of existence, such are thereby already\ngiven over to the contingency of volition and its realization. All\nwe have left us, then, is what is peculiar to each individual viewed\nas such and his sensuous experience. Such a possession of what is\nnothing more than personal idiosyncracy is unable to assert for itself\nany further potency or necessity; it appears simply as inclusion of\ncontent, fixed achievement and at the same time arbitrary commitment\nof the wholly self-dependent subject to the influence of feeling,\ndisposition, energy, general ability, cunning, and talents, instead\nof carrying out its realization over and over again according to a\nprinciple of universal import and acknowledged stability.\nThis type of contingency, then, is the characteristic quality of the\ncondition which we required for the ground upon which all the varied\nwealth of the Ideal is to appear.\n(_\u03b2_) In order to make more clear the actual character of the reality\nwhich is most adapted to artistic treatment we will contrast it with\nthat aspect of existence which is not so adapted.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) We find this pre-eminently where the ethical notion, that is,\njustice and rational freedom, have already won for themselves and\nmaintain a fixed position in the social _order_ regulated by _law_,\nso that, even in the external world, it appears as a positive and\nnecessary power, which is quite independent of the individuality and\nsubjectivity of specific temperament and characters. This is the\ncase in the life of the _State_, where that life is manifested in a\nform adequate to the true notion of citizenship. For obviously it is\nnot every chance association of human beings, any more than every\npatriarchal community, that will fulfil the requisites of State-life.\nIn the true State laws, customs, and rights, in so far as they\nconstitute the determinations of freedom applicable to all, are of\nparamount force even in this _universal_ and abstract relation, and\nare not conditioned in their applicability by the chance requirements\nof any individual's idiosyncracy. As the consciousness of society has\nissued for itself commands and laws in a mode of statement of general\napplication, in the same way these are externally valid as such\nuniversal fiat, which proceeds in the path of order thereby indicated,\narmed with powers of restraint and compulsion against any individual\nwho may attempt to assert his caprice in an injurious opposition to\nsuch regulations.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) Such a condition at once assumes a dividing line between the\nuniversal ordinances of the regulative understanding and the immediate\nlife, connoting by this latter term the unity in which all that is\nsubstantive and essential in morals and the conduct of justice only\nfinds a form for its existence in the experience of _individuals_,\ntheir ethical feeling and opinion, that is to say, and thereby alone\nis exercised. In the civilized State right and justice, even religion\nand science, or, at any rate, provident interest in religious and\nscientific education, are subject to _public_ control, which directs\nand co-ordinates the same.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) The position, then, that isolated individuals occupy in the\nState is one which contracts them within a fixed and organized order,\nand subordinates them thereto; and they stand in this relation for\nthe reason that the character and disposition of each is not the only\nembodiment of ethical forces; but, if the State to which they belong is\na genuine example, they are on the contrary compelled to regulate all\nthe external detail of their actions, opinions, and feelings with a due\nregard to what is legally permissible, and to bring the same into line\nwith it. This dependence upon the objective rationality of the State\nin its power of self-assertion above all subjective caprice may either\nbe regarded as a mere subjection, inasmuch as laws and institutions\npossess, as the paramount power, a constraining force, or we may see\nin it merely the free recognition and acceptance of the reason that\nunderlies such a necessity of fact, an acknowledgment through which the\nindividual finds himself again in that objective order.\nBut even in the latter case isolated individuals continue to remain\nas merely incidental facts, and apart from the organic reality of the\nState possess no real substantiality in themselves. For substantiality,\nin the sense we here use the term, is by no means only the _particular_\nproperty of this or that individual, but a fully _explicit_\nreality[302], minted, as it were, in all aspects of it, and down to the\nmerest detail in a mode universally applicable and _necessary._ All\nthat mere individuals can effect with _volition_ and _accomplishment_\neven in actions right, moral, and legal in themselves in the interest\nof and attendant upon the progress of the whole, remains and must\nalways remain, in contrast with that whole, insignificant and a mere\nexample. Their actions are always only an entirely partial realization\nof a single case; and, moreover, the realization of the same has no\nuniversal significance in the sense that the particular example of it\nis thereby of objective validity as law, or, as such law, makes its\nappearance. And for the same reason, to put the matter the other way,\nit is wholly unimportant whether the validity of right and justice\nis acknowledged by private individuals judging as individuals. The\nvalidity is a vital fact of State life which holds whether it be\nacknowledged or no. No doubt it is a matter of interest to the general\npublic that every one should fall in with the order established and\ndesire it; but the wishes of isolated individuals have no influence\nupon that interest in the sense that it is only by virtue of the assent\nof this or that person that right and a moral order is preserved. Such\nrequire no such isolated example of assent; and a breach of either is\nfollowed by punishment.\nThe subordinate position of private persons in the civilized State\nis finally emphasized in the fact that, whatever share any one may\nhave in the general civic life, it is of a definite and in every\ncase restricted character. In the real State work must have some\nrelation to the general good[303], just as the active enterprise of\nthe bourgeoisie in the commercial business is subdivided in the most\nvaried way, so that the entire life of the State shall not appear as\nthe concrete achievement of any _single_ person, or in general can be\nentrusted to the arbitrary wishes, enterprise, courage, resources,\nand discretion of such, but on account of the fact that it comprises\nactivities and trades of countless complexity, and must be carried out\nby associations of business men at least as varied. The punishment of\na criminal is no longer an affair of personal heroism or the virtue\nof any _one_ individual, but is throughout the entire process, in the\ninvestigation and discovery of the felonious act, in the pronouncement\nof judicial sentence and its execution, contributed to by different\npersons; nay, every important phase of such a process is in the same\nway subject to some kind of division of labour. To see that the laws\nare properly administered, then, is not within the special province of\nany _one_ man, but results from an organized effort of great variety\nand the rules which direct it. Add to this every man who assists in\nsuch a process is bound to follow certain general principles which are\nlaid down for his guidance, and all that is carried out under their\ndirection is further subject to the criticism and control of yet higher\nofficials.\n(_\u03b3_) In all such civic relations, then, we find that in a truly\nregulated State the public authority is not impressed with the\nimprimatur of any single person, but it is the general Will which\nprevails here in its universality, a condition under which the\nparticular life of the individual has the appearance of vanishing or,\nat least, of becoming of a quite subsidiary importance. In a condition\nof things such as this the self-subsistency we were seeking for is\nout of the question. And for this reason we required for the free\nembodiment of individuality conditions which are precisely the reverse\nof this, in which the validity of the ethical principle derives its\nsupport from individuals, and only from individuals, men who make for\nthemselves a great place in the arena of life through the activity\nof exceptional volitional power and the inherent greatness and\neffectiveness of their character. With such right is simply that which\nthey choose to accept as such; and if that which is essentially moral\nis compromised by their action, there is no all-constraining public\nmight which brings them to judgment and exacts punishment, but only\nthe right of that inner voice of necessity, which accentuates itself\nas vital in particular character and through external circumstance\nand condition and only thus is actually existent. This is what\ndifferentiates _punishment_ from _revenge._ The punishment exacted by\nlaw asserts the validity of the generally applicable and carefully\ndefined right against the violation of that right, and makes use of\nthe public power according to a definite process as its instrument, in\nother words, it employs a tribunal and a judge, an instrument to which\npersonality is attached as something accidental. Even revenge may in a\nsimilar way find a justification; but such as it has is based entirely\non the _subjective conscience_ of those who deal with the criminal act,\nand, in pursuance of their own _private_ convictions, avenge themselves\non the unrighteous act and its perpetrator. The revenge of Orestes\nis, for example, justifiable; but he exacted it under the direction\nof the law which his own virtue prescribed, not as the execution of a\njudgment and a right. In the condition, then, that we claim as the most\nsuitable for artistic treatment, that which is moral and just must be\nthroughout personal, in the sense that its source is exclusively in the\nindividual life, and it only is actual in such dependence. Moreover,\nto proceed with our contrasted conditions, in regulated States the\nexternal environment of man is made secure, and properly is protected,\nand he is only permitted to retain in absolute independence for himself\nhis private views and opinions. But in that condition where the\nessential features of a State are not found the protection of life and\nproperty depends on the isolated energy and courage of each individual\nby himself, who is compelled to look after his own security and that of\neverything which belongs to him. Such a condition we are accustomed to\nidentify with the _heroic age._ It is not, of course, our province here\neither to discuss or decide which of these two contrasted conditions\nof life is the worthier; suffice it to say that, so far as the Ideal\nof art is concerned, it is imperatively necessary that this hard and\nfixed line between the universal as an independent existence and\nindividuality should be removed, however much this distinction may be\nnecessary in other directions for the realization of human existence.\nThe reason of this is that Art and its Ideal is just that universal,\nin so far as it may be presented to the perception of the senses, and\nby such presentment is permitted to enter into the variety and living\nforms of the world of objects.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) What we were looking for, therefore, is supplied us by the\nheroic age, for it is here that virtue, _\u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1f74_ in the full sense of\nthat Greek word, creates the root-basis of actions. In this connection\nit would appear that we must distinguish between _\u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1f74_ and _virtus_\nas understood by the Roman themselves. The Romans had already their\nState, Fatherland, and legal institutions, and as contrasted with\nthe State, as the controlling object of all, they had surrendered\npersonality. To be simply a citizen of Rome, to have one object for\nthe imagination and for every other personal energy to centre itself\nupon, namely, the fatherland and its sovereign majesty, therein lies\nthe earnestness and grit of Roman virtue. Heroes, on the contrary,\nare individuals who undertake and accomplish a complete enterprise\nin consistent reliance upon their personal resources and initiative,\nand with whom it is consequently a purely arbitrary act of their own\nwhen they execute anything in accordance with the moral principle.\nThis immediate unity, however, of what we may call the substantive\nimport and individuality of inclination, impulse, and will is the\ncharacteristic of Greek virtue. According to this view personality is\na law to itself without any further subjection to a law, judgment,\nand tribunal of independent subsistence. The Greek heroes make their\nappearance in an epoch anterior to legal enactment, or they are\nthemselves the founders of States, so that right and social order,\nlaw and ethical custom, emanate from them, and persist as their own\ncreation in an indefeasible relation to them. In this way Hercules was\nregarded so highly by the ancients themselves, and represents an Ideal\nof original and heroic virtue. His free and self-reliant virtue, with\nwhich he championed the right and battled against the monstrosities\nof men and Nature is not a prevailing characteristic of the age, but\nbelongs to him as an exclusive and unique possession. And we may add he\nwas not strictly a moral hero, as his reception of the fifty daughters\nof Thespius in one night[304] clearly shows us; neither would it\nappear from the tale about the Augaean stables is he pre-eminent for\ngentility. He is rather the general type of self-reliant strength and\nresource in its championship of right and justice, to exemplify which\nhe elected summarily and from a free choice to undergo countless toils\nand labours. It is true that some of his deeds were carried out at the\ninstigation of Eurystheus, but this submission is, after all, rather\na formal association than a real one, no connection at least of legal\nvalidity or inevitable necessity through which the strength of his\nself-reliant personality was diverted from its independent course.\nThe Homeric heroes are of a similar type. No doubt they have their\nclan chieftain; but the associating bond is no fixed relation already\ndetermined by law, which enforces their submission; of their own free\nwill it is that they follow Agamemnon, who is no monarch in the modern\nsense of the term. Consequently every hero volunteers his own advice,\nthe enraged Achilles acts independently for himself in his separation,\nand, speaking generally, each and all come and go, act, or take\ntheir leisure as they please. In much the same independent position,\nthat is to say, united in no fixed organization, to which they are\nas individuals entirely subordinate, we find the heroes of Arabian\npoetry portrayed, and even the Shah-Rameh of Ferdusi furnishes us\nwith similar examples. In latter-day Christendom the age of feudalism\nand knighthood supplies a fertile field for the free growth of heroic\nenterprise and the type of individuality which belongs to it. Of such\nare the heroes of the round table, no less than the heroic circle of\nwhich Charles the Great is the focus. Charles is, much like Agamemnon,\nsurrounded with independent chieftains of heroic mould, a union which\nas such is powerless[305]. He is consequently always compelled to\ntake counsel with them, however much each of them may be influenced\nby private passions; he may bluster like a very Olympian Jupiter,\nand none the less find himself and his undertakings suddenly left in\nthe lurch while his confederates are off on some adventures of their\nown. The Cid is perhaps the most complete example of the type. He,\ntoo, is the ally of a confederacy, the dependent of a king, and is\nbound to render duty as vassal; but in opposition to this obligation\nhe is pre-eminently influenced by the principle of honour, the purely\npersonal consideration of his own glory, nobility, and reputation[306].\nAnd so in this case also the king can only determine a fixed line of\naction and make war after consulting and obtaining the consent of his\nvassals. If this is not given they do not fight, and, moreover, a\nmere majority of votes is not sufficient to compel them. Every man is\nindependent of his neighbour, and exercises his will and steers his own\ncourse as such. We find in the accounts given us of Saracen heroes an\nequally brilliant picture of self-reliant and still more inflexible\npersonality. Even the Reinecke Fuchs fable is a fresh example of this\nstate of things. Here, it is true, the lion is master and king, but\nthe wolf and the bear sit in council. Even Reinecke and the rest do\njust what they like; and when there is a general outcry, the sly fellow\neither gets out of the mess with his story-telling, or manages to make\nsome particular interest of king and queen work to his own advantage,\nand in his own cunning way talks over his sovereign somehow.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) Moreover, in much the same way that each individual example of\nthis heroic type of _personality_ persists in immediate unity with\nall that he may will, act, and accomplish, a similar unity is further\nmaintained in all the consequences which flow from such initiative.\nWhen we ourselves, on the contrary, act or estimate a particular\naction, we assume that only full responsibility can attach where the\nindividual under consideration is in complete possession of the true\nnature of his action and its attendant circumstances. If the content of\nthose surrounding conditions is otherwise than that which is present\nto the agent's consciousness in such a case a man nowadays will not\ntake upon himself the burden of all that is implied in his action. He\nwill thrust on one side that part of it which he would not have done\nhad he known completely or not misconceived the circumstances, and he\nonly accepts that which was fully under his cognisance and carried out\nwith deliberate intention in conformity thereto. The heroic character\nmakes no such distinction. He adheres simply to all the consequences\nand makes good his personal responsibility for the whole. \u0152dipus on\nhis way to consult the oracle meets a certain man, quarrels with him\nand strikes him. In those days such an act was not a crime at all.\nHe only returned a blow after being vigorously attacked. But the\nstranger was his father. \u0152dipus further marries a royal lady. His\nwife is his mother. Without knowing it he commits an act of shame.\nOn learning the truth he acknowledges such enormities to their full\nextent, inflicts a punishment on himself as murderer of his father and\na man of incest, and this although he was entirely ignorant of the\ntrue nature of these acts, or had any intention of doing them. The\nself-reliant stubbornness and entirety of the heroic character refuses\nto parcel out responsibility and knows nothing of such distinctions\nas personal intention and the objective act and its consequences. In\nthe evolution and ramification of an action as we moderns regard it\nthese opposed points of view constantly recur, and guilt is thrown into\nthe background as far as possible. No doubt our view of the matter\nis more in accordance with _ethical principle_, in so far as the\ncondition of a personal knowledge of the particular circumstances, or\nthe consciousness of an object good in itself, in short, generally the\nintent of an act, is what materially assists us in our judgment. But in\nthe heroic age, where we find the individual essentially indivisible\nand the objective act proceeding from himself as entirely his own, each\nperson claims absolutely all that he may do, and refuses to surrender\none jot or tittle of responsibility therefor.\nTo an extent equally minute the heroic figure is separated from the\nethical whole, to which he belongs, and his self-consciousness is bound\nup wholly in substantial unity with that whole. According to the views\nin vogue now we draw a line of distinction as private individuals\nbetween objects which are wholly personal and those which affect the\ncommunity. The individual acts in all that he does from his own private\npersonality as distinct from others, and views even his actions rather\nas relative to this than as part of all that is farmed out by the\norganic whole to which he belongs. We consequently make a distinction\nbetween individuals and their families. Such is unknown in the heroic\nage. The guilt of ancestors adheres to their descendants, and an\nentire family will suffer for the original defaulter. Men inherit\nthe fatality of guilt and transgression. A condemnation such as this\nappears to us unjust as an irrational subjection to a blind fate. With\nus the achievements of ancestors reflect no more honour on children and\ndescendants than the punishments and crimes of such contaminate those\nthat follow after them, and least of all is their private character\nthus affected; nay, modern opinion is already close to the view that\nthe confiscation of family property is a punishment which violates the\nprofounder conception of liberty. But in the ancient and more plastic\ntotality the individual is not so isolated, but rather a member\nof his family and race. For this reason the character, action, and\nfortunes of the family continue to be the private affair of each member\nof it; and so far from denying the actions of his parents, each man\nvoluntarily accepts them as his own; they live in him, and he is just\nthat which his fathers were, suffered, or transgressed. This appears to\nus a hardship, but that which we replace it with, this standing alone\non our own possessions[307], and the more subjective self-stability\nthus acquired is also from another point of view only the abstract\nself-sufficiency of each. The individuality of heroic times is none\nthe less of a more ideal type, because it does not declare itself as\nsatisfied with the mere form of freedom and infinity, but remains in\nunalterable and immediate unity with all that is most substantial\nin the relations of spirit which it of itself endows with living\nactuality. In such an individuality the substantial is immediately\nindividual, and the individual thereby himself essentially substantive.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) From considerations such as these we conclude that the ideal\nfigures of art must be sought for in the age of mythos, that is to say,\nspeaking generally, in past times, where we shall find the soil most\ncongenial to their growth. If such material is taken from the age we\nlive in, whose most native form, as we actually find it, is tightly\nshut off from the imagination, it matters not how we regard it, then\nthe modifications which the poet can hardly avoid making in it will not\nreadily escape the appearance of a purely artificial and intentional\ncomposition. The Past entirely belongs to memory, and memory perfects\nthe infolding veil of character, events, and actions in the vesture\nof universality, through which the particular external or contingent\ndetail is unable to penetrate. Many trifling circumstances and\nmediating conditions, many varied and isolated phases of activity, are\ninseparable from the actual existence of an action or a character: in\nthe mirror of memory all these insignificant details are obliterated.\nIn this liberation of his work from what is accidental in the\nexternal fact the artist has a freer hand for his artistic powers of\ncomposition, when dealing with that which is individual and particular\nin it, if the actions, histories, and characters are borrowed from\nancient times. He has, it is true, also historical memories, out of\nwhich he must mould a content conformable to the universal; but the\npicture of the Past possesses, as already observed, an advantage,\ntaken simply as a picture of greater universality, while the manifold\ntexture of mediating condition and circumstance, interwoven as it\nis in the entire framework of finite existence which surrounds it,\noffers him material ample enough to prevent his hand obliterating the\nindividuality, which is essential to his work of art. The more closely\nwe consider it, the clearer will be our conclusion that a heroic age\nhas the advantage over later and more civilized times in that the\nisolated character and personality generally in such an age does not as\nyet find what is substantive either in the sphere of ethical custom, or\nmoral obligation opposed to itself in the necessary embodiment of legal\ninstitution, and thereby presents immediately to the poet all that the\nform of the Ideal requires. Shakespeare has, for example, selected\nmuch material for his tragedies from chronicles and earlier romances,\nframed upon a condition of life which has not as yet received the\nimpression of a fully articulated social order, but in which the energy\nof individuals, as emphasized in personal resolve and achievement, is\nstill the prevailing characteristic. His genuine historical dramas\nhave, on the contrary, a vein of historical substance running through\nthem in the strictest sense, and for this reason lean farther away from\nan ideal exposition, although here, too, both circumstances and actions\nare made to fall in with, or are removed to suit, the unyielding\nself-sufficiency and wilfulness of particular characters. No doubt this\ncharacteristic remains for the most part in their case a purely formal\nself-inclusion, whereas if we contrast it with the self-subsistency of\nheroic characters we find that here the essential _content_ of all such\nhave proposed to accomplish is bound up therewith.\nIt is on account of this contrast that we should find a reason for\nrepeating the general thesis in connection with the Ideal, to the\neffect that the _Idyllic_ is exceptionally adapted for its expression,\ninasmuch as where that is presented the cleavage between what is\ndetermined by legal necessity and the living person is wholly absent.\nTo this we must reply that, however simple and original idyllic\nsituations may be, however far removed they may be from the artificial\nprose-existence of society, such simplicity, if we consider the nature\nof its content, has, in fact, too insignificant an interest to satisfy\nthe most substantial and essential requirements of the Ideal. Material\nof this sort fails entirely to include the most weighty motives of\nheroic character such as Fatherland, moral and family problems, and\ntheir development; it is a kind of treatment which is apt to select\nas the very core of its subject such a fact as the loss of a single\nsheep or the falling in love of a girl. In this way the Idyllic not\nunfrequently becomes merely the resource and recreation of our hearts,\nto which poets such as Gessner, for example, will add their dose of\nsickly sweetness and sentimentalism. The idyllic aspect of the days\nwe live in have, further, this defect, that this _na\u00efvet\u00e9_, this\ndomesticated or rural atmosphere in the emotional aspect of love or the\nenjoyment of a good cup of coffee in the open and things of that sort\nare not likely to awake much interest, when we find in them nothing but\nthe country parson flavour--find them cut off, that is to say, from\nall wider relations with the outside world, and not a trace of the\nprofounder web of purposes with which that world is interwoven. It is\nprecisely here that we have reason to admire the genius of Goethe, when\nhe concentrated his poetic talent on material of this kind in his poem\nof \"Hermann and Dorothea.\" It is true that he selects from the life of\nthe Present a particular theme of very limited extension, but at the\nsame time he unfolds before us as the background and atmosphere of the\npicture in which his characters are portrayed the great interests of\nthe revolution and his own native country, and, in short, associates\nwith a subject-matter necessarily narrow in its range facts of\nworld-history of the widest and most potent significance.\nGenerally speaking, we shall find that the ills of life and its evil,\nwar, battles, and revenge, are not excluded from the subject-matter\nof the Ideal, but are frequently the very source and substance of\nthe heroic age and its myths, whose form grows all the wilder and\nsterner in proportion to the remoteness of such a period from a fully\ndeveloped society of law and moral order. In the chivalrous adventures\nof knight-errantry we find the heroes of such tales themselves\noften enough sharing the savage and dissolute characteristics of the\ntimes, and in much the same way the martyrdom of the heroes of the\nChurch presupposes a condition of ferocious cruelty around them. At\nbottom, however, the Christian ideal, which is based on the depth and\ninwardness of man's spiritual nature, stands in a relation of entire\nindifference to the external world.\nWe have demonstrated that the condition of particular centuries is more\napplicable to the Ideal; in the same way Art selects pre-eminently\na particular class of society for the form under which the Ideal\nshall appear, the order, that is to say, of _princes._ And the\nselection is made not because art is necessarily aristocratic, or has\nany predilection for gentility[308], but simply on account of the\nperfection in which free will and its products may be exemplified\nimaginatively through the highly placed class. We have in the chorus of\nancient tragedy the characteristics and universal background of general\nmaxims, modes of imaginative thought, and emotion, before which the\ndefinite movements of the action proceed. In contrast to this appear\nthe more clearly defined individualities of the personages immediately\nconcerned in the action, men and women of authority, and belonging for\nthe most part to royal families. On the other hand, the main impression\nforced upon us, when seeing representatives of a lower class carrying\non pursuits which are of a narrower range, is one of subjection; and,\nindeed, in an artificial[309] state of society the freedom of action\nof such a class is fettered in every direction, and is necessarily\ninvolved with all its passions and interests in all the medley and\ndespotic forces of external circumstance. It is, in fact, held closely\nbehind the invincible power of the social order, which it is unable to\ncome out of, and is an alien from the authority of the dominant order,\neven when that is asserted in accordance with just principle. In this\nlimitation of outlook through the hard conditions of life all real\nindependence is wrecked. For this reason both the circumstances and\ncharacters which we find in such a sphere of life are more appropriate\nto the treatment of comedy, everybody being permitted in comedy to rate\nthemselves as they please, and to lay claims to a self-sufficiency\nin all that they will and think, which is none the less immediately\nnegatived by the spiritual no less than the external dependence of\ntheir lives. As a rule, such a false and second-hand self-subsistency\nmust inevitably fall to pieces when confronted with the actual\nconditions of life and the distorted view which is formed of them. The\nforce of circumstances is presented to the lower orders of society\non a totally different level from that in which it acts upon rulers\nand princes. In Schiller's \"Braut von Messina\" Don Caesar is able to\nexclaim, and justly: \"there stands no higher judge than myself!\" And\nwhen he has to be punished he must himself give judgment and execute\nit. He is, in fact, subject to no external necessity of right and\nlaw, and even when punishment is the question is wholly dependent on\nhimself. The characters in the Shakespearean drama do not entirely\nbelong to the princely order and only partially are taken from mythical\nsources, but they are placed in the era of civil wars, in which the\nties of social order and legislative enactment are either weakened\nor shattered, and they secure from such a condition the exceptional\nindependence and self-sufficiency we are looking for.\n(_b_) If we transfer our attention now from the characteristic\nconditions of society we have hitherto mainly considered to the actual\nstate of the world around us and its carefully articulated scheme\nof ethical, judicial, and political institutions, we shall not fail\nto observe that the material we have here offered us for figures of\ntruly ideal type is of a very restricted character. The province\nhere in which an entirely open field is presented for the display of\nindependent purpose in its fullest individuality is limited both in\nits range and the measure of opportunity. The qualities that make a\nman thorough in his relations to his own family and his business, the\nideals, in short, of honest citizens and excellent wives, in so far\nas will and activity are concentrated on the field in which it is\nstill possible for a man to exercise his free personality, to carry\nout, in short, all that he has a mind to do, this is the prevailing\nfeature of our modern society. Such ideals inevitably lack the depth\nof a fuller content, and the most significant feature of them is\nthat of the attitude of the individual mind to their realization;\nfor we find here the content is already presented by existing social\ninstitutions, and consequently the essential interest we take in it\ndepends on the particular way in which that content is realized and\nappears in the _personal life_, its moral and inward significance.\nFor this reason it is not possible, as in the case of former times,\nto create ideals from the positions of judgeship and kingship. If a\nman carries out his judicial functions nowadays in accordance with\nduty and the requirements of his office, he merely is acting within\nthe bounds already marked out for him by legislative enactments in\nthe social order as the sphere of his responsibilities. All that may\ncharacterize his tenure of office beyond this, as proceeding from\npersonal qualities, such as suavity of demeanour or acuteness of\njudgment, is not the main point or the substantial content, but rather\nan aspect of it which it is possible to dispense with as something\naccidental. In the same way the monarchs of our own day are no longer,\nas was the case with the heroes of mythical times, in themselves the\nembodying and culminating unity of society itself, but rather a more\nor less unsubstantial _centrum_ around which all legal and social\ninstitutions, however moulded in the course of time, group themselves\nin independent relations. All the most important functions of the\nexecutive have nowadays been separated from the royal prerogative.\nKings do not lay down the law, control finance; the preservation\nof social order is not one of their most characteristic functions.\nPeace and war are determined through the particular circumstances of\ninternational politics, which it is not within their power exclusively\neither to direct or control; and, if it happens that any important\ndecision with regard to either depends in the last resort on their\njudgment, such a decision is not generally so much in the nature of\nits substance the result of any personal preference, as it is the\nformal seal of monarchical authority on what is already determined on\npublic grounds, the mere imposition of that which is strictly official\nrather than personal in its character. In the same way, a general or\nfield-marshal of our times has unquestionably great authority; objects\nand interests of profound importance are under his control and his\ncircumspection; his courage, his determination, and his intelligence\nare involved in the weightiest decisions; nevertheless, whatever may\nbe definitely traced to the essentially personal characteristics of\nthe man has little opportunity for display in such a result. For, in\nthe first place, the objects upon which his decisions turn are not of\nhis own selection, and arise out of circumstances which lie beyond\nthe sphere of his influence rather than are spontaneously fixed by\nhimself; secondly, the means adopted to carry out such objects are not\nthe sole result of his initiative. On the contrary, they are supplied\nhim from sources which are not immediately under his authority or\npersonal influence, but stand rather quite apart from the sphere of his\nindividual powers as a general.\nTo sum up, then, though it is true that under the present condition of\nthe civilized world a man may act independently for himself in many\ndirections, the fact remains that in whatever direction he may turn\nhe is still only a member of a fixed order of society and appears as\nsuch limited in his range rather than the vital representative and\nindividual embodiment of society itself. He acts necessarily under such\na condition of restriction, and our interest in such a personality, no\nless than in the content of his aims and activity, is entirely devoid\nof completeness. In the end we are invariably driven to concentrate\nour attention on the purely personal interest, how far, that is to\nsay, he attained success, what was the nature of the obstacles and\ncomplications which, in either, through untoward chance or necessity,\nconfronted or distracted his progress. And if it is, moreover, true\nthat our modern personality is of infinite significance when we\nestimate the character thus manifested as a spiritual product, in\nits actions, sufferings, moral opinions, and conduct that is to say,\nit is also true that the moral content which is realized in such an\nindividual is of a restricted character, rather than, as is the case\nin the heroic times, the realization of universal right, custom, and\nlegality. The individual is no longer the exclusive vehicle and actual\nembodiment of these powers as in the previous times.\n(_c_) Our interest, however, in and need to have presented us such\na completely realized individuality and living self-dependence will\nalways persist, however strongly we may recognize the worth and\nreasonable nature of the more developed condition of an organized and\ntrained civic society. It is this necessity which makes us regard\nwith astonishment the youthful spirit of Schiller and Goethe when\nthey sought to discover that lost self-sufficiency in the prevailing\nconditions of modern times. How do we find in particular this attempt\nis made by Schiller in his earliest works? Simply by a rebellion\ndirected against the whole organic framework of civil society. Karl\nMoor, suffering injury from the existing order at the hands of those\nwho abuse the power entrusted them, has the courage to break the\nbonds which bind him to law and order altogether, cuts himself adrift\nand creates for himself a heroic situation, in which he appears as\nthe champion of right, and the self-constituted avenger of wrong,\ninjustice, and oppression. None the less, how insignificant and\nisolated must a private revenge of this kind appear, if we estimate\nit from the practical point of view, according to the probability of\nits success; and, in fact, in one aspect of it, it already contains\nthe germ of wrong which can only lead to the criminal act on which\nit will fall to pieces. No doubt, as personal to Karl Moor himself,\nthis is a misfortune, a fatality, however, which, despite the tragical\nelement in it, can only engraft on mere boys the blight of such a\n\"robber-ideal.\" In much the same way the characters depicted in \"Kabale\nund Liebe\" suffer wrong under prevailing conditions of life, absorbed\nin the trivial facts and passions wholly personal to themselves. It is\nnot until we come to the dramas of \"Fiesco\" and \"Don Carlos\" that we\nfind characters of nobler significance and more substantive content,\nheroes, for example, resolved to liberate their country, or assert the\nliberty of religious conviction. With a nobility still more striking\nWallenstein places himself at the head of his army that the crisis in\nthe political situation may come to a focus. He is fully cognisant\nof the nature of the political forces upon which his only means of\ncontrol, his army, is dependent; consequently he hesitates for long\nwhether to follow his private inclination or his duty. He has barely\narrived at a decision when he finds the instrument on which he most\ndepended slip from his grasp; his means of action is gone. For that\nwhich in the last instance unites the leading officers and generals\nis no gratitude for anything that may be due to him on the ground of\npast services rendered; his fame as a general has nothing to do with\nit, but rather the duty they owe to the universally recognized seat\nof government, the oath they have sworn to the head of the State,\nthe emperor of the Austrian monarchy. He finds himself consequently\nin the end isolated, and is not so much fought with and overcome\nby an external foe as he is stripped of all means of executing his\npurpose. He is deserted by his army and from that moment is a lost\nman. The \"G\u00f6tz\"[310] of Goethe starts from a dramatic situation of an\nanalogous though somewhat inverse type. The times of G\u00f6tz and Franz\nvon Sickingen belong to the interesting epoch in which knight-errantry\nand the self-reliant individuality of the class of nobility is being\nsuperseded by the new creation of an external and legally constituted\nsocial order. To have selected precisely this critical time where we\nfind the heroic characteristics of the Middle Ages and the legalized\nfabric of modern society meet and collide for the subject of his first\nartistic production shows much penetration on the part of Goethe.\nFor G\u00f6tz and Sickingen are still heroes in the genuine sense, who\nare resolved to exercise their influence over circumstances, whether\nimmediately affecting them or of wider range, out of the resources of\ntheir own personalities, their courage, and their private sense of\nright. The new order of things involves G\u00f6tz in acts of illegality and\nbrings about the catastrophe of his life. It is only in the Middle\nAges that knight-errantry and the relations of feudalism will supply\na field entirely open to this type of self-reliant manhood. When we\nfind, moreover, the legalized order co-ordinated more completely in\nits prosaic form, the predominant authority in fact, the adventurous\nself-dependence of knighthood is left outside it as an unrelated\nexcrescence; and if an attempt is made to assert it as though it were\nstill a valid means of attacking wrong, and assisting the oppressed, it\nbecomes simply an object of ridicule, such as Cervantes illustrates for\nus in his \"Don Quixote.\"\nIn this allusion to the opposition which exists between two\ndifferently constituted _r\u00e9gimes_ of society and the collision which\nresults from action in defiance of their particular character we have\nalready indicated what we have above defined generally as the closer\ndetermination and differentiation of the universal state of the world,\nthat is to say, the _situation_ as generally expressed.\n2. THE SITUATION\nThe ideal world-condition which it is the function of art to present\nin contrast to prosaic reality we may conclude from our previous\ndiscussion to be merely a general background of society of a specific\nkind; it is merely the _possible_ condition necessary for the\nparticular presentation, not the presentation itself. What we have\nhitherto directed attention to is, in fact, the general background\nupon which the living figures of art may appear. It is undoubtedly\nfructified with individuality and is supported by its self-subsistency;\nbut as a _general_ condition it is not yet the active movement of\nparticular individuals in the very form of life, just as we may say\nthat the temple which Art erects is not as yet the representation of\nthe personal godhead, but only encloses the germ of the same. For this\nreason we must in the first instance regard this world-condition as\na kind of medium in repose, a harmony, so to speak, of forces which\nare operative in it, and to this extent it possesses a substantial\nconsistency of uniform worth, which, however, must not be accepted\nas identical with what has been called \"the age of innocence.\" For\nit is a condition in the fulness and sovereignty of whose ethical\natmosphere the terrors of division only are slumbering because, in\nour contemplation of it, we have before us, for the first time, the\naspect of its substantial unity, and consequently are only presented\nwith individuality in its most universal terms, a mode of viewing it\nwhich makes it fade away as though without definition or any essential\ndisturbance of its unity, instead of giving to it the full value of\ndefinite characteristics. But such characterization is essential to\nindividuality. And if the Ideal is to appear as _definite form_ it is\nnecessary for it to escape from such pure universality, or in other\nwords for it to give the universal a particular expression, and by so\ndoing impart to it both existence and appearance. Art consequently has\nin this connection not only to translate into its medium a _universal_\nworld-condition, but must proceed beyond this quite indefinite\nconception to the composition of pictures of _definite_ character and\naction.\nRegarded from the aspect under which it affects _individual_ character\nthis general condition is the environment of circumstance which,\naccording to its specifically detached form, tends to excite both\ncollisions and development, forcing thereby the individuals thus\naffected to express their _nature_ and exhibit such expression in a\ndefinite form. From the point of view of the world-condition this\nself-revelation of particular individuals appears as the passing of its\nuniversality into the distinct embodiments of living individuality,\nan aggregate over which _universal forces_ still assert the\n_mastery._[311] For the eternal powers operative in the world-process\nconstitute the substantive content of the Ideal as specifically\ndefined in what it essentially is. The mode of existence, however,\nwhich is realized through the bare form of external condition is\nunworthy of this content. For in the first place such a condition is\nassociated with habit, and the habitual is no adequate determination\nof those profounder interests which are active in _self-conscious\nmind._ Furthermore, as we have observed, it was the _contingency_ and\n_caprice_ of individuality, by virtue of whose spontaneous activity\nthese very interests are permitted to appear in life; but this\nunessential contingency and caprice is again quite as little adequate\nto the substantive universality, which constitutes the notion of\nessential actuality. On these grounds respectively we are therefore\ncompelled to seek an art-envisagement more worthy and better defined\nfor the concrete content[312] of the Ideal.\nThis new configuration the universal powers can only retain in\nits _determinate existence_ in virtue of the fact that they are\nmanifested in their essential modes of difference and movement, or,\nto put the matter more specifically, through their assertion of the\ncontradictions which they relatively unfold. Two aspects of the\nprocess of individualization into which the universal thus passes must\nbe here emphasized. In the first place, there is the _substance_ as\nan embracing sphere of universal forces through the differentiation\nindicated, which is broken from its substantive unity into its\ncomponent parts; secondly, there are the _individuals_, which spring\nforth as the active completion of these forces and give to them a\nspecific objectification.\nNow what we have characterized as the difference and opposition in\nwhich the world-condition, hitherto harmonious with the individuals\nconditioned by it, is involved, if we consider it from the point of\nview of universal condition, is the manifestation of the _essential\ncontent_ which it carries in itself. On the other hand we observe that\nthe substantive universal in that condition is articulated through\nparticular units in such a way that this very universal procures\nfor itself determinate existence, albeit it is thus immersed in the\nappearance of chance, disunion, and division, an appearance, which,\nhowever, is rendered nugatory by the fact that it is the universal\nwhich thus appears.\nThe separation of these forces and their objectification[313] in\nindividuals can, however, further take place under definite conditions\nand circumstances, under which and as a constituent aspect of which\nthe entire objective appearance receives a determinate form, or as\nthe stimulative impulse of this very realization. By themselves such\ncircumstances are without interest[314], and it is only through their\nrelation to mankind that they receive such a significance, through\nwhose self-consciousness the content of these spiritual forces is\ncarried actively into objective appearance. The external circumstances\nare consequently only to be regarded of significance in so far as they\nsupply an essential relation to Spirit, in so far, that is to say,\nas they are comprehended by those individual units and afford them\na stimulus to actualize their inward _spiritual_ needs, the aims,\nideas, the determinate substance, in short, of all that requires an\nindividual embodiment. Regarded as a stimulating influence of this\nkind particular circumstances and conditions create what we have called\nthe _situation_, which is specifically presupposed in the actual\nself-expansion and activity of all that still lies undeveloped in the\nuniversal world-condition; it is for this reason we have considered the\nprevious determination of the notion of the situation as necessary to\nany inquiry into the true constituents of _action._\nThe situation expressed in general terms is in one aspect of it the\ncircumstance _particularized_ to the point of _definite character_,\nand under this characterization it is, to put it another way, the\nstimulating impulse to a particular expression of content, which it\nis the function of artistic presentation to transmute into a specific\nform of existence. Looked at from this latter point of view especially\nthe situation offers a wide field for contemplation, inasmuch as it\nhas ever been one of the most essential objects of art to discover\nsituations of real interest, that is to say, of such a kind as will\npresent to us the profound and weighty interest, the truest content of\nspiritual life. The requirements of the several arts in this respect no\ndoubt differ. Sculpture, for example, is pre-eminently limited in its\nreference to the inwardly detailed variety of situations. Painting and\nmusic are already operative in a freer and more comprehensive medium.\nFinally, we are least able among them all to exhaust the possibilities\nof poetry in this respect.\nSince we have not yet arrived at that portion of our subject where we\ndeal directly with the specific arts, it will be sufficient here to\ndraw attention to a few of the most general aspects of that inquiry,\nwhich we may subdivide in the following manner.\n_First_, we would observe that the situation still retains the\nform of _universality_ and thereby of _indeterminacy_, so long as\nit is undeveloped and without definite characterization; we have,\nconsequently, at first present before us a situation which is without\nsituation. For the form of indeterminacy is itself only _one_ form\nas opposed to its contradiction of determinacy, and is shown to be,\nby virtue of this very contrast, a one-sided aspect which as such\npossesses a determinate relation.\n_Secondly_, however, the situation passes in separation away from this\nuniversality, and becomes certainly determinate to that extent, but at\nfirst with a determinacy which produces no destructive consequences,\nthat is to say, it is one which offers no stimulus to _active\nopposition_ and its necessary resolution.\n_Thirdly_, we find the element of _disunion_ in all its vigour creating\nby the definition of its opposed characteristics the essence of the\nsituation, which thereby is carried into a _collision_, which again\nproceeds to reactions, and, as such, forms the point of departure to\nthe conception of artistic action properly so called.\nWe may, in fact, characterize the situation generally as the\n_intermediate plane_ between the universal world-condition still in\na state of equilibrium, and the concrete action unfolded in all its\ntendency to movement and reaction, a position which gives to it the\ncharacteristics of both extremes, and enables us to pass over from the\none to the other.\n_(a) The Absence of Situation_[315]\nWe passed from the notion of the universal world-condition in\npresenting to ourselves the form of it as essentially individual\nself-subsistency. Self-subsistency, however, regarded simply in its\nessential form, presents to us in the first instance merely the\nsecure repose upon its own resources in its bare tranquillity. The\nform as thus defined is carried into no relation with another, but\nremains at one with itself in inclusion with its unity both, within\nand without. This presents us with the situation which is without\nsituation, an illustration of which we may take those ancient types of\ntemple-building dating from the earliest days of art, whose character\nof profound immutable seriousness, of tranquil, nay even of austere\nand grandiose, dignity has been the object of imitation even in more\nrecent times proceeding on lines of a similar type. The Egyptian and\nmost ancient Greek sculptures will further illustrate for us the same\nkind of indeterminate situation. In the plastic art of Christianity,\nespecially if we consider particular examples of early bust-sculpture,\nwe shall find both God the Father and Christ are presented in a similar\nspirit. Indeed, such a mode of delineation is peculiarly adapted to\npresent us with the secure substantiality of the Divine, whether such\nbe apprehended as a definite and particular Godhead, or is grasped as\nessentially absolute personality; and this is so in virtue of the very\ndefect of such a representation, that it gives us portraits of persons\nof middle-age which are without any trace of definite situations,\nin which the character of the individual as such can reveal itself,\nand only the attempt is made to express the entirety of determinate\ncharacter in its quality of stability[316].\n_(b) The Situation defined in its Harmlessness_[317]\nThe second point to emphasize is, inasmuch as the situation generally\nis reached in the _definition_ of form, the passage from this\ntranquillity and blessed repose, or from the unbroken severity\nand force of self-consistency, forms which subsist in unfeatured\nequilibrium, that is to say, immutable both within and without, have to\nbe set in motion and surrender their undressed simplicity. This bare\nprogression to a more specific manifestation in some particular mode of\nexpression is what we may describe certainly as definite situation, but\na situation which has not yet asserted conflicting elements in itself,\nand is fully ripe for collision.\nThis first step in the process of individualized expression is\nconsequently of a kind that carries with it no further result; it is\nset in no antagonistic opposition to something else, in a relation\nwhich evokes both collision and reaction; it is already in its\ncharacter of unconstrainedness finished and complete in itself. With\nsuch a type of situation we may associate those which are mainly to\nbe regarded as a kind of play, in so far as all that proceeds or is\ncarried out in them indicates no real seriousness of purpose. For\nall earnestness in any kind of activity is generally the result of\noppositions and contradictions, which drive on their way to the final\nremoval or victory of one side or the other. For this reason situations\nof this kind cannot themselves be identified with actions, nor are they\nthe stimulative impulse of actions; they are indeed, in a certain\naspect, of determinate character, but they are either circumstances of\nthe most trivial significance, or a form of action which is without an\nessentially serious object, which either is the result of conflicts, or\nis able to carry the action yet further into conflicts.\n(_\u03b1_) The first thing to arrest us in this process is the passage\ngenerally from the repose of the unfeatured situation to a condition of\nemotion and expression: this is asserted partly as purely mechanical\nmotion, in part also as the first impulse and satisfaction of any\ninternal want. The Egyptians, for example, represented the gods in\ntheir sculpture with closely locked limbs. The Greeks, on the contrary,\nreleased both arms and legs, and endowed the bodily form with all\nthat is appropriate to the advance and general variety of movement.\nPermanent repose, a seated attitude, a tranquil gaze, are all of them\nsimple conditions under which the Greeks apprehended their gods; they\nare modes which unquestionably gave to the self-subsistent figure of\nGodhead a certain characterization, but one nevertheless which is\nnot carried forward into other relations and oppositions, but rather\nremains enclosed within itself, and permanently significant as such.\nSituations of this simple kind attach in a particular way to sculpture,\nand the ancients, above all others, were inexhaustible in discovering\nfit subjects for such a condition of unconstrained freedom. In this\nrespect they showed an extraordinary insight; for it is precisely\nthrough contrast with the insignificance of the particular situation\nthat the majesty and self-subsistency of the ideal types of the Greek\nPantheon were made to appear so striking. It was, in fact, through the\nharmlessness and insignificance of what appeared to be done or left\nundone that the blessed peaceful tranquillity and immutability of the\nimmortal gods was brought most clearly to consciousness. The situation\nmerely indicates the particular character of either god or hero in\nquite a general way, such as brings them into no relation with other\ngods, or at least into no relation suggestive of hostility or division.\n(_\u03b2_) It is a further step in the direction of more defined situation,\nwhen we find in such any particular purpose already represented in it,\nan activity which stands in definite relation to something external,\nand the self-subsistent figure itself expressed as within the sphere\nof such purpose or activity. Even objectification such as these,\nhowever, which have no real disturbing influence upon the tranquillity\nand cheerful blessedness of the figures represented, are rather to be\nregarded as particular modes of presentation incidental to this very\nquality of cheerful contentment. The invention of the Greeks was here,\ntoo, exceptionally thoughtful and fruitful. It is essential to the\nunconstrainedness of such situations that the activity here presented\nshould merely indicate an action in its initial stage in such a way\nthat no further developments or oppositions are likely to proceed from\nit, but that all that appears necessary to complete it should be found\nenclosed in the action depicted.\nAs an illustration of this the situation of the Belvedere Apollo is\nseized at the moment when he moves forward in wrathful majesty after\nslaying the Python with his arrow. A situation of this kind has\nnot the grandiose simplicity of the earlier Greek sculpture, which\nasserts for our intelligence the repose and open clarity of the gods\nby means of expressed actions of less significance. Take the case of\nAphrodite peacefully gazing at herself while emerging from her bath\nin full possession of her charms; or of fauns and satyrs at play,\nplay that is wholly absorbed in itself; or of that famous satyr who\ndandled the young Bacchus in his arms, while he looks down upon him\nwith infinite tenderness and grace; to say nothing of the endless\nvariety of unconstrained activities in which Eros is depicted. Such\nare a few examples of this type of situation. If the action is of more\nconcrete character we are confronted with a more involved situation,\nwhich, at least for the artistic presentment of the Greek gods as\nself-substantive powers, is less appropriate. In a case of this kind\nthe pure universality of the individual god is less able to transpierce\nthe accumulated detail of the particular action which he expresses. The\nMercury of Pigalli, which is a present of Louis XV to the exposition\nof statuary in Sanssouci, is fastening on his winged sandals. This\nis a perfectly harmonious action. The Mercury of Thorwaldsen, on the\ncontrary, is depicted under a situation which is almost too complicated\nfor sculpture. He listens attentively to the flute of Marsyas. At\nthe same time he is craftily spying him to see how he may slay him\nwhile his hand grasps maliciously for the dagger he has concealed. In\nopposition to this, if we may add one more illustration from a more\nmodern work of art, is that representation by Rudolf Schadow, of a\nmaiden binding her sandals in much the same simple manner as we find in\nthe case of Mercury. In this example the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the situation does\nnot contain the interest we experience when it is a god who exhibits\nsuch unconstrained action. When it is only a maiden who fastens her\nsandals or spins, there is little else to engage our attention but the\nsimple action, which is by itself of little significance or importance.\n(_\u03b3_) We shall find further, if we follow up the above train of\nthought, that the more closely defined situation can be treated more\ngenerally, as merely a more or less definite stimulus presenting the\n_opportunity_ for further development of expressed action of wider\nrange related to the primary subject with varying degrees of affinity.\nMany lyrical poems have what we may call an occasional situation\nof this kind. A particular mood or a certain atmosphere of emotion\nis a situation which can be arrested poetically for consciousness,\nand, furthermore, in particular relation to external circumstances,\nfestivals, or public victories, is able to carry us forward to this or\nthat artistic expression, either of more comprehensive or restricted\nrange, and in every kind of embodiment of feeling and idea. Pindar's\nodes of victory are supreme examples of this type of occasional\npoetry. Goethe, too, has selected as the subject-matter of his muse\nmany lyrical situations of a similar character; and, in fact, if we\nlook closely into the matter, we shall hardly be wrong in calling his\n\"Werther\" a poem of occasion. It is through the medium of \"Werther\"\nthat Goethe has elaborated the convulsions and anguish of his own\nheart, incorporated, in short, the facts of his own experience in a\nwork of art. This, after all, is true of every lyrical poet; he gives\npoetical expression to that which nearly affects him, and thereby\nthrows the windows of his heart open to the fresh air. That which has\nhitherto been sealed up within is released in the external object,\nfrom which our humanity has freed itself, just as we are the lighter\nfor the rain of tears, in which the sorrow is wept away. So Goethe,\nas in fact he has told us himself, by his composition of Werther,\nliberated himself from the mastery and pressure of his heart troubles.\nAt the same time we must point out that this last-mentioned situation\nis not really appropriate to the type with which we are now dealing;\nit obviously presents the profoundest contradiction in itself which\ncalls for resolution. No doubt in the kind of lyrical situation we have\nidentified with \"the occasional\" we may have declared a circumstance\nobjectively determined, in other words, an activity in close relation\nto the external world; but, on the other hand, we find the poetic\ntemperament equally able to withdraw itself within the atmosphere it\ncreates wholly free from its external environment, and to make that\ninward world which is the combined product of circumstance and emotion\nits true point of departure.\n_(c) The Collision_\nAll the situations to which we have hitherto directed attention are,\nas already observed, neither true actions in themselves nor indeed the\nstimulative source of such action. Their determination was to a greater\nor less degree the purely occasional circumstance or condition, or an\naction in itself of no significance, in which a substantive content was\nexpressed in such a way that its specific character appeared as a mere\nharmless play, in which nothing of a truly serious nature was implied.\nThe full seriousness and weighty import of a situation can only begin\nwhen we find in it the element of disruption, where the determination\nitself exposes an essential aspect of difference, and by its opposition\nto something else becomes the source of a collision.\nThe _collision_ arises, as we are now considering it, in an act of\n_violation_, which is unable to retain its character as such, but is\ncompelled to find a new principle of unity; it is a change in the\npreviously existent condition of harmony, a change which is still in\nprocess. The collision is, however, not an _action_, and is to be taken\nsimply as stimulus to action to all that characterizes the situation.\nAnd this is true, although the contradiction in which the collision\nis enclosed may be the result of previous action. As an example of\nthis we may cite the trilogies of the ancients, which carry forward\nthe main theme by presenting at the close of one drama the collision\nwhich forms the stimulative impulse of the next, which, in its return,\nrenders necessary the resolution which is carried out by the third.\nAnd, moreover, for this very reason that the collision always requires\nsome resolution attendant on this conflict of opposing elements, the\nmore a situation is full of it the more it is peculiarly adapted to the\nsubject-matter of dramatic art, it being the especial claim of that\nart to present beauty in its completest and profoundest development.\nSculpture, on the contrary, is not wholly suited to give embodiment to\nany action, through which the great spiritual forces are manifested\neither in their division or reconciliation, and indeed the art of\npainting, despite its more extended spatial significance, is only able\nto objectify a single moment of action.\nThese situations of tragic significance introduce a peculiar difficulty\nin dealing with them which is inherent in their very conception. For\ninasmuch as they obviously arise from violations of the world-condition\nthey offer to our consideration circumstances which are unable to\ncontinue as they are, which render necessary something of a remedial\nnature to reclothe them. But the beauty of the Ideal consists precisely\nin its undisturbed unity, repose, and consummation with itself. The\ncollision, on the other hand, disturbs this harmony of what is truly\nreal and ethical, and drives this unity of the Ideal into discord\nand opposition. Through the representation of such disruption the\nIdeal itself suffers violation. The function of art will undoubtedly\nconsist partly in preventing the entire destruction of free beauty\nin this difference, and partly in only carrying this breach of unity\nand the conflict it occasions to a point in which harmony may again\nbe recovered as the result of such a conflict and its resolution,\nand in this way become manifest for the first time in its essential\nperfection. It is, however, impossible to determine on a general\nprinciple the precise limit to which such discordance may be carried\ninasmuch as the several arts in this respect preserve their independent\ncharacter. The medium of the subjective idea can support a far intenser\ndisruption than that of the plastic arts[318]. In other words,\npoetry is quite within its right when it breaks up the unity of the\nworld of the imagination even to the point of the extremest form of\ndesperation, and in its delineation of external objects to that of\nabsolute ugliness. In the case of the plastic arts, on the contrary, in\npainting, that is to say, and even more so in sculpture, the external\nform remains in unalterable fixity; it can neither be removed nor\nlightly passed over in such a way that it again disappears. Under such\nconditions it would be a serious defect to represent once and for all\nan ugliness, which could not possibly be transmuted. Consequently all\nthat would be quite compatible in dramatic poetry, which is able to\nrepresent a momentary appearance that again vanishes, is not within the\nprovince of the plastic arts.\nIn discussing the more obvious types of collision we can only in this\nportion of our inquiry indicate the most general points of view. We\nwould particularly draw attention to three fundamental aspects under\nwhich they may be co-ordinated.\n_First_, there are those collisions which proceed from purely\n_natural_, that is to say, physical conditions, in so far as these\nare characterized with qualities which are negative or evil and\nconsequently discordant.\n_Secondly_, we have collisions which are of a _spiritual_ nature,\nbut which depend on _natural_ conditions, conditions which may in\nthemselves have a positive[319] character yet for the spirit contain\nwithin themselves the seeds of difference and contradiction.\n_Thirdly_, there are divisions which are caused entirely by disruption\nin the Spirit alone; to these alone we are justified in attaching the\npeculiar interest of contradiction which is bound up with genuine\n_human activity_.\n(_\u03b1_) Now with reference to the first type of conflicting forces--for\nthe reason that here it is only external Nature, through the\nmaladies and other evils and infirmities which are incidental to\nher creating, conditions which destroy the pre-existent harmony of\nlife, replacing such with a state of antagonism--such can at most\nmerely serve as a stimulus for something outside them. Regarded\nwholly by themselves such collisions are of no interest; they are the\nsubject-matter of art simply for the sake of the disruption which may\nfollow as a _consequence_ of some natural misfortune. The \"Alcestis\"\nof Euripides, we may add, too, that of Gluck, the subject of whose\nopera is practically the same, are examples of this; in both the\nsickness of Admetus is necessarily presupposed. That sickness merely\nby itself could not fitly supply a subject for artistic treatment.\nIt only becomes, even in the handling of Euripides, associated with\nit by virtue of the individual characters, who, on account of such\nmisfortune, are compelled to face a further collision. It is the word\nof the oracle that Admetus must die unless another will pass to the\nunderworld for his sake. Alcestis, out of love for her husband, devotes\nherself to such a sacrifice, resolves to die, in order to restrain\nDeath from touching her beloved, the father of her children, the king.\nIn the Philoctetes of Sophocles a physical malady is also the cause of\nthe collision. Here the Greeks during their voyage to Troy place the\nman who is suffering from a wounded foot, caused by the serpent's bite\nin Chrysas, on the island of Lemnos. In this case, too, the physical\nmishap is merely the extreme meeting point and incentive of a further\ncollision. For, according to the prophecy, Troy can only fall when the\narrows of Hercules are in the hands of the storming army. Philoctetes\nrefuses to give them up because he has been compelled for nine years\nto suffer the martyrdom of his banishment. This refusal, no less than\nthe fact of his unrighteous desertion from which it springs, could have\nbeen followed by every variety of result other than that which took\nplace; the real interest accordingly does not centre in the malady and\nits physical necessity, but in the opposition which arises from the\nrefusal of Philoctetes to surrender the arrows. The case of the plague\nin the Greek camp before Troy is very similar; although this is already\nrepresented entirely as the consequence of former transgression, as a\npunishment, in short, a mode of statement more adapted to epic than\ndramatic poetry, nevertheless it is closely associated with evils\nincidental to natural misfortune such as storm, shipwreck, and drought.\nAs a rule, however, art will not represent such mischance as mere\naccident, but rather as an obstruction and misfortune whose necessity\nsimply consists in assuming precisely this particular form rather than\nanother.\n(_\u03b2_) But, to turn now to our second type of the collision, inasmuch\nas the external powers of Nature are not that which is most essential\nto the interests and contradictions of human life, in cases where they\nare found closely associated with such spiritual relations, they will\npresent themselves merely as the ground from which the collision breaks\nforth in its true character. This is the point of view from which we\nmust regard all situations, where we trace the original source of\nconflict in the facts of natural _birth._ We will shortly distinguish\nbetween three particular cases of this.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) In the first place we have the right that is bound up with\nnatural condition, that which constitutes relationship and inheritance\nfor example, which for the very reason that it stands in close\nconnection with Nature carries with it a number of relations that are\nbound up with her, and this though the right, the fact is one and only\none. The most important example of this is the right of succession to\nthe throne. It is important to observe that this right must not as\nyet, in relation to the collisions which spring from it, be absolutely\nfixed by rule, otherwise the resultant conflict will be of quite\nanother character. If, that is to say, the right of succession is\nnot as yet entirely controlled by legislation and the social order\nwhich it implies, no wrong will necessarily attach to any one of the\nalternatives, namely, whether it be an older or younger brother, or any\nother relative of the royal household who obtains the sovereignty. But\ninasmuch as sovereignty is a qualitative rather than a quantitative\npossession, which cannot like gold and other material goods be divided\nup according to a just principle, dispute and contention is inevitably\nthe result of such a form of succession. When \u0152dipus, for example,\nleaves the throne of Thebes without a ruler, he leaves his two sons\nconfronting each other with a right and claim of equal strength. The\nbrothers arrange to occupy the throne alternately from year to year.\nEteocles, however, breaks the compact and Polynices brings an army\nagainst Thebes to enforce his right. The antagonism of brothers has\nalways been in the history of art a fruitful source of collision; it\ncommences indeed with the story of Cain who slew his brother Abel. In\nthe tale of Shah-Rameh, the earliest example we have of a Persian book\nof heroic legend, it is a contention of throne succession which is the\nsource of the most varied conflicts. In this Feridu divided the Earth\namong his three brothers. Selm receives as his portion Rum and Chawer;\nTuran and Osin are given to Thur, and Fredysh becomes lord of the Earth\nfrom Iran. All three, however, claim the land which belongs to his\nbrothers, and endless quarrels and wars are the result. In the Middle\nAges we find just the same countless examples of family and dynastic\nbroils. Such dissensions, however, appear in themselves to be due to\naccidental circumstance. It is not necessary that brothers should be\nat enmity; particular circumstances and more important causes must be\nattached, such as the in itself tragic birth of the sons of \u0152dipus, or,\nas we find in \"the Bride of Messina,\" the author is at pains to shift\nthe quarrel of the brothers on to still more fateful circumstances.\nIn Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" a similar collision is the foundation of\nthe tragic d\u00e9nouement. Duncan is king and Macbeth, as his nearest\nand oldest relation, is consequently heir to the throne with a right\nprecedent even to Duncan's sons. The primary incentive of Macbeth's\ncrime is the wrong which the king has done him in naming his own son as\nheir to the throne. This justification of Macbeth, which is supported\nby the chronicles of the time, Shakespeare has entirely passed over,\nbecause, it was solely his object to bring into startling relief the\nrepulsive aspect of Macbeth's ambitious passion, in order thereby\nto make his work agreeable to King James, who would be naturally\ninterested in finding the crime of Macbeth depicted without extenuating\ncircumstances. As a consequence we can find no sufficient reason why,\nunder Shakespeare's handling of the subject, Macbeth fails to murder\nthe sons of Duncan no less than their father, lets them escape in\nfact; nor can we understand why they are wholly overlooked by the\nnobles. However, the entire collision upon which, the drama of Macbeth\nturns carries us beyond the particular type which we are now mainly\nconsidering.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) In the _second_ of our examples in the type of collision[320]\nwe are now discussing we find the reverse situation to that just\ndiscussed, and it consists in this that difference of birth, which\ncarries within itself a _wrongs_ is moreover, through ethical _custom_\nor _law_, held within the chains of an insuperable _barrier_, so that\nit receives at the same time the appearance of an innate wrong, and\nconsequently is the cause of collisions. Slavery, serfdom, differences\nof caste, the position of Jews in many states and, with certain\nqualifications, even the contrast between an aristocratical and citizen\nclass are all of them cases for consideration under this head. The\nconflict here consists in this, that on the one hand humanity has\nrights, relations, desires, aims and requirements which belong to it\nessentially in virtue of its fundamental idea, which nevertheless\nin each one of the above mentioned examples meet with dangerous\nrestriction and obstruction owing to the compulsive necessity of\nnatural birth. On this type of collision we have the following remarks\nto offer.\nThe differences which obtain between classes, such as the ruled and\nthe rulers, are, no doubt, essential to the notion of state-life,\nand are founded on reason, for they are caused by the inevitable\narticulation of the organic community, and assert themselves as such\nthrough the specific forms of occupation, disposition, modes of life,\nand general levels of education in all their branches. It is another\nmatter, however, when these differences as they affect individuals are\ndetermined absolutely by the accident of birth, so that the individual\nman from the very start is not on account of any quality in himself,\nbut solely through the accident of Nature, irrevocably relegated\nto a particular class or caste. In such a case it is obvious these\ndifferences appear as innate and are, moreover, though purely external,\ngirt with force in its highest and most aggressive mode. We are not\nbound to ask ourselves how this fixity and compulsive restraint came\noriginally into existence. For the nation may originally have been\nunited, and the natural distinction between freeman and serf been only\nevolved at a later time, or the difference between castes, classes,\nand privileged persons may have grown out of earlier distinctions of\nnations and races, as many are inclined to think is the explanation of\nthe caste distinctions of India. All this is a matter of no moment to\nus here. The main point simply consists in this, that vital relations\nof this kind, which regulate the entire course of human existence,\nhave their source in natural conditions. On general principles, no\ndoubt, distinctions of class can be justified, but at the same time no\nindividual should be wholly robbed of his right to determine as his\nchoice may direct to which particular class he shall belong. Natural\ncapacity, talents, adaptability, and education are the only right\nmeans to direct the way and decide in this respect. When, however,\nthe right of choice is debarred from birth onwards and a man is made\nthereby dependent on Nature and its contingency, there is always the\npossibility of conflict within the sphere of this necessity between\nthe states thus enforced on the individual by natural conditions and\nthe measure of spiritual education which he may acquire and the higher\ndemand which it may justly make. This is a pathetic and unfortunate\ntype of collision which has its source in an essential _wrong_ which\nthe freedom of art is quite unable to respect. In the social condition\nof our own days distinctions of class, with a few exceptions, are\nnot determined by birth. The ruling dynasty and the peerage are the\nonly exceptions, and these depend on a higher conception of the State\naltogether. For the rest, the mere fact of birth creates no essential\ndistinction that can ultimately determine the class to which a man\nmay belong if he is otherwise competent to join it. For this reason,\nhowever, we must condition the demand for entire liberty of choice\nwith the requirement that in education, knowledge, ability, and\ngeneral tastes the individual is equal to the particular society with\nwhich he may desire to associate. If, on the contrary, the fact of a\nman's birth presents an insuperable obstacle to such claims, which he\nwould otherwise be quite competent to satisfy by virtue of his own\nvigorous activity, then such a situation must appear to us not merely\na misfortune, but essentially a wrong under which he is compelled to\nsuffer injury. He is thus separated by a purely natural partition\nwall which is essentially unjust, that is to say, one beyond which\nhis talents, sentiments, and general education have already raised\nhim, from that which he was competent to reach, and a purely natural\ncondition whose legalized fixity has been determined wholly by caprice\npresumes to oppose insuperable barriers to the freedom rightly demanded\nby all spiritual life.\nTo examine more closely the nature of this type of collision we shall\ndo well to look at it from three different points of view, each of\nwhich are of essential importance.\nIn the _first_ place, it is necessary that the individual should, in\nthe strength of his own spiritual resources, already really have passed\nbeyond the natural barriers whose opposition is to give way before\nhis aims and desires, otherwise the demand is simply an act of folly.\nIf, for example, a domestic servant, whose education and ability is\nmerely that of a menial, falls in love with a princess or a lady of\nhigh society, or, inversely, either of these with him, such a love\naffair is both absurd and devoid of all taste, and this is so even if\nthe artistic representation of this passion display all the depth and\ninterest of which an ardent heart is capable. In such a case it is\nnot so much the difference of birth which creates the obstacle; this\nis rather to be found in the entire content of interests, education,\naims of life, requirements, and mode of sentiment which distinguish in\nstatus, material resources, and social qualifications a lady in high\nposition from a domestic servant. If love is, as in the case assumed,\nthe one and only bond of a union, and is associated with nothing else\nthroughout the entire sphere of all that men and women have to live\nthrough in just accordance with that which a particular status requires\nfrom their intelligence and experience, it must necessarily remain\ndevoid of content and is simply a union of the senses. Love, to be\nwholly complete, is nothing less than a real harmony of the entire\nconscious life, in which the full nobility of sentiment can be shared\nand appreciated.\nThe _second_ case we wish to examine is that in which the dependence of\nbirth surrounds an essentially free human life and the objects it may\nrightly set before itself with legalized fetters of obstruction. This\ncollision also presents an element unadapted for artistic treatment,\nopposed, that is to say, to the notion of the Ideal, despite its love\nto make use of it and the facility with which it may attempt to do\nso. If distinctions of birth through positive laws and the powers\nwhich support them create a persistent wrong, as doubtless may be the\ncase where a man is born an outcast or a Jew, he obviously, from one\npoint of view, is entirely right in holding with all the strength of\nhis inward life, which rebels before such a barrier, that the same is\ndissolvable, that he, in fact, recognizes his individuality as apart\nfrom it. To oppose such restraint appears to be wholly justifiable.\nBut in so far as it becomes impossible through the force of existing\ncircumstances to overcome such a barrier, which is consequently\nconverted into an irrevocable necessity, a situation of this kind can\nonly be regarded as a misfortune which itself is not without an element\nof falsity. For the rational man is inevitably forced, in so far as\nhe is unable to subjugate the opposing necessity, to submit to the\nsame: it is not in reason to continue to fight against the inevitable,\nbut rather quietly to let it pass over him. He must, in fact, abandon\nthe sense of interest in and need of that which is, by virtue of this\nbarrier, swept from his reach, and suffer what he fails to overcome\nwith the quiet courage of passive endurance. Where a struggle is of\nno avail it is the part of wisdom to be quit of it in order at the\nleast to retire into the _formal_ independence of personal liberty.\nBy doing so the forces of wrong have no longer power over him; if, on\nthe contrary, he battles against them he must necessarily experience\nhis dependence in its fullest extent. At the same time it remains\nunquestionable that neither this abstraction of formal independence any\nmore than that content which can lead to no result are truly beautiful\nwhen artistically considered.\nThere is a _third_ type of collision which, while being immediately\nconnected with that we have just considered, is equally removed from\nthe genuine Ideal. It is to be found affecting that class of persons\nwho attempt to assert some privilege which the mere fact of birth\nconcedes them and supports with the full weight of a religious title,\npositive enactments, and the prevailing conditions of society. In such\na case, it is true, we have an independent position in harmonious\nrelation with what is externally realized in positive institutions,\nbut when considered as the mere consistency of that which is in itself\nunjust and irrational it is quite as much as in our former example a\npurely formal independence, and the notion of the Ideal disappears.\nWe may, no doubt, very possibly persuade ourselves that the Ideal is\nretained because we have here an appearance as though the personal life\nis in full union with the universal and its legalized constitution,\nremaining consistently in such unity; but it will be observed that here\nthe universal does not assert its dominating power in the _particular\nperson_, as we found the heroic Ideal demanded, but only in and through\nthe public authority of positive laws and their administration;\nmoreover, what the individual here asserts is assumed to be essentially\nwrong, and he loses in consequence the substantive significance which\nwe have seen to be also essential to the Ideal. An affair in which the\nideal subject of art is concerned must itself be at bottom true and\njustifiable. To this type belong the legalized lordship exercised over\nslaves or serfs, the right to rob a foreigner of his liberty, or to\nsacrifice the same to the gods. No doubt it is quite possible that such\na right may be sustained by individuals with unquestioning belief that\nthey are justified in so doing, as in India, for example, the higher\ncastes make use of their privileges, or as Thoas ordered the sacrifice\nof Orestes, or in Russia the lords are wont to flout their serfs.\nIn fact, those who are in authority are very likely to execute such\nrights as legalized rights on account of the interest they may have in\npreserving them. But in a case of this kind their right will be merely\nthe unrighteous right of the barbarian, and they must themselves appear\nto us in the category of barbarians, at least, who resolve to carry\nout and perfect what is essentially injustice. The legalized form,\nunder which the individual shelters himself, is, for the time to which\nit belongs, and its spirit and the educational standard adapted to\nit, no doubt to be respected and justified. But if we reflect upon it\nrationally and apart from that, it is wholly positive[321], containing\nno intrinsic claims or authority. Moreover, if the individual makes use\nof his privileges for purely personal objects, under the mastery of\nparticular passions and the aims of mere selfishness, in addition to\nour barbarian we get a bad character to boot.\nPoets have frequently sought to arouse our pity, and it may be our fear\nas well, through the presentation of conflicts of this kind, following\nthe rule of Aristotle, who lays it down that fear and compassion are\nobjects of tragedy. Strictly speaking we experience neither fear nor\nreverence when confronted with rights which only exist among barbarians\nand are the misfortune of uncivilized times. Any compassion which such\nsituations are likely to arouse is almost immediately converted into a\nspirit of indignant hostility. The only true artistic _d\u00e9nouement_ of\nsuch a conflict is one where we find such illegitimate rights are not\ncarried into execution, as, for example, neither Iphigenia nor Orestes\nare respectively sacrificed in Aulis and Tauris.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) The _third_ and last class of that type of collision which is\nbased on purely natural condition is that which is duetto personal\npassion caused by natural peculiarities of temperament and character.\nThe jealousy of Othello is a supreme example of this. Ambition,\navarice, nay, even love itself in certain aspects, will furnish other\nillustrations. Collision of this kind is only properly referred to such\npassions in so far as individuals, seized and dominated exclusively by\nthe power of such emotions, are thereby forced into antagonism with\nthe truly ethical constitution and inherently justifiable course of\nhuman existence, and consequently are plunged into a still more serious\nconflict.\nThis carries our inquiry into the consideration of that third\nsubdivision of our original classification of general types of\ncollision, the type of which is based exclusively upon the conflict of\nspiritual forces, in so far as such opposition is the result of human\nactivity.\n(_\u03b3_) We have already observed when dealing with purely natural\ncollisions that they only form the starting-point as it were for\nfurther states of contradiction. And the same is more or less true\nof the second type of conflict already adverted to. All these, in\nartistic compositions of really profound significance, are unable to\nremain in such forms of opposition as we have hitherto discussed. Such\ndisturbances and conflicting elements merely substantiate the opportune\nmoment, out of which the true and essential forces of spiritual life\nwill clash together in opposition and contend for the mastery. That\nwhich is spiritual can only be set in activity by virtue of spirit.\nConsequently the oppositions of Spirit can only win reality in actual\nhuman deed, can only thus manifest themselves in their true character.\nThe position we have arrived at, then, is this. We have on one hand a\ndifficulty, an obstacle, a violation effected through something human\nlife has carried out in action. We have on the other a violation of\ninterests and forces intrinsically just and right. By treating these\ntwo forms of determination in close juxtaposition we, for the first\ntime, are able to gauge the full depth of this last type of collision.\nWe may distinguish between the prominent examples which fall within the\nconsideration of this class of cases as follows:\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) In passing from the sphere of that type of conflict which we\nhave pointed out rests for its primary basis on what is entirely due\nto Nature we observe that the first class of cases which confronts us\non crossing the boundary to the consideration of a new type is closely\nrelated to that we have just left behind us. If, then, human action\nis assumed to be responsible for the collision, it will follow that\nwhat is carried out as natural through human action, that is to say,\nin so far as humanity is not entirely _spiritual_, will consist in\nthis that a particular action is performed _unconsciously_ and without\npurpose, which will be found afterwards to be a positive infraction of\nthe forces of self-respecting and civilized society. The consciousness\nwhich any man latterly acquires of the injurious nature of an action,\nof which he was previously unaware, will drive him who still accepts\nthe responsibility of such an action into division and conflict. The\nground of such a conflict, in fact, consists in the opposition with\nwhich the mind is confronted between that which was actually before\nit _when the action took place_, and the subsequent discovery of all\nthat was really _implied_ in the act itself. The cases of \u0152dipus and\nAjax will at once suggest themselves as examples. The action of \u0152dipus,\nif viewed simply with reference to his will and knowledge, amounted\nmerely to the fact that he killed a perfect stranger in a quarrel.\nThe unconscious act was the reality in its full significance, that\nis to say, the murder of his own father. Ajax, in a fit of frenzy,\nslaughtered the cattle of the Greeks believing them to be the Greek\nchieftains. On regaining his senses and discovering what he really did\nhe is seized with a sense of shame which drives him into collision with\nhimself. We must, however, observe that what has been unconsciously\nviolated by a man in the type of collision we are now examining ought\nto be something which he himself, when fully in a position to judge,\nwould both honour and revere. If such a reverential attitude has its\nroots merely in personal idiosyncrasy or superstition, such a collision\ncan arouse, to say the least, no really profound interest.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) Further, inasmuch as in the cases we are now discussing the\nconflict arises from a _spiritual_ violation of spiritual forces\nthrough human action, the collision more generally appropriate to\nthe type will consist in a violation which is perpetrated with full\nconsciousness _proceeding out of such_ and the intention it implies.\nThe point of departure here may centre again in passion, violence,\nfolly, and other similar qualities. The Trojan war, for example,\noriginates in the rape of Helen. Agamemnon afterwards sacrifices\nIphigenia, and so violates the feelings of her mother, slaying thus the\ndarling of her womb. Clytemnestra, in consequence, murders her spouse.\nOrestes avenges the murder of his father and king by assassinating his\nmother. In a similar way in \"Hamlet\" the father is sent to his grave by\na stratagem, and the mother of Hamlet insults the _manes_ of the dead\nman by a precipitate marriage with his murderer.\nIn the case of these collisions as in those already considered, the\nmain point is this, that humanity is engaged in a self-imposed conflict\nwith what is intrinsically moral, true, and worthy of reverence. If\nthis is not so, then, for all who are really conscious of what is moral\nand right, such a conflict can only appear without worth or material\nsignificance, as is the case, for example, in the famous episode of the\nMah\u00e2-Bh\u00e2rata, with reference to Nalas and Damayanti. King Nalas marries\nthe princess Damayanti, who is allowed the privilege of making a free\nchoice among her sisters. All the other suitors are genii floating in\nthe air; Nalas stands on the Earth alone as a man, and she has the good\nsense to select him. The genii are consequently much enraged, and watch\nfor the moment when they may find King Nalas tripping. For many years\nthey can bring to his charge no offence, as he is capable of none.\nAt last, however, they obtain power over him, for he commits a great\ncrime; the crime is this, namely, that after making water, he treads\nwith his foot upon the earth thus watered. According to Indian ideas\nthis is a severe offence which cannot escape punishment. From that\nmoment the genii have him in their power; one renders all his amatory\ndesires abortive, another excites his brother against him, and finally\npoor Nalas, after forfeiting his throne and being reduced to beggary,\nis driven forth a wanderer in wretchedness with Damayanti. At length\nhe is even compelled to part with her, until, as the tale will have\nit, after many adventures, he is once more set on the throne of his\noriginal happiness. The real conflict upon which for the Indians of old\ndays the whole of this story was supported was an essential desecration\nof a sacred thing: according to our notions the tale is absurd from\nbeginning to end.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) Thirdly, it is not necessary that the disruption should be\ndirect, or, in other words, that the action taken solely by itself\nshould be an act of collision; the fact of collision may well appear\nout of relations and circumstances of opposition and antagonism which\nare forced upon the mind during the process of that action's execution.\nJuliet and Romeo are in love with one another. In the mere fact of\ntheir love there is nothing to suggest disunion. But they are aware\nthat their families are living in mutual hate and hostility, that their\nparents will never consent to the marriage, and they are carried into\ncollision by virtue of this preassumed situation of antagonistic forces.\nWe must content ourselves here with these very general remarks upon the\nrelation which the determinate situation occupies in its opposition\nto the universal world-condition. Were we to extend our inquiry into\nall the divergent aspects, modifications, and nuances of the subject,\nattempting thereby to express an opinion upon every possible form of\nsituation, this chapter would alone present us with sufficient matter\nfor discussions of endless prolixity and diffuseness. The discovery of\ndifferent situations implies a content of exhaustless possibilities;\nand in every particular example the essential question involved is\nhow such may be adapted to the treatment of any specific art, in true\nsubordination to the principles and character of such an art. To the\nfairy story much is permitted which is forbidden to a more stringent\nmode of artistic representation. And we may say that generally the\ndiscovery[322] of the situation is a critical point in the process of\nart-production which often presents great difficulty to artists. In our\nown days the difficulty of obtaining a suitable subject-matter as a\nsource for the circumstances and situations which the artist requires\nis a common complaint. At first sight it may appear to us more in\nkeeping with our notion of poet if he borrow from his own resources,\nand invent situations himself; but such independence does little to\nincrease his claims as a creative artist. For the situation does not\ndirectly constitute the spirituality of his work nor indeed give us\nits true artistic form: all that it does is to supply the external\nmaterial in which as its appropriate medium a character or temperament\nis unfolded before us. It is only after working into this external\nmaterial in which actions and characters find their starting-point\nthat the true genius of the artist is actively displayed. The poet\nconsequently has little or no claim to our thanks for merely having\nhimself invented this least of all poetical aspects of his production.\nHe is, in fact, fully entitled to draw as much and as frequently as he\npleases from anything that comes to his hand, whether it be history,\nsaga, mythos, or chronicle, nay, even from material and situations\nwhich have already been artistically treated. Just as we find in the\nart of painting the external matter of the situation is borrowed from\nlegends of saints, and the process has been repeated on similar lines\nover and over again. To discover the real artistic significance of\nsuch artistic work we must penetrate far beyond the mere invention of\nparticular situations. The same remarks will apply in full force to\nthe entire wealth of the circumstances and developments artistically\nhandled. In reference to this it is frequently claimed as a virtue of\nmodern art in contrast with that of the ancients that we find in it\nan infinitely more exuberant imagination. As a matter of fact, we do\nfind in the artistic creations of the Middle Ages and our modern world\nthe most extraordinary variety and interfusion of situations, events,\nand occurrences, whether tragic or otherwise. This fulness of detail,\nhowever, does not take us far. In spite of it all we have very few\ndramas or epics of the first excellence. For the main point is not the\nexternal course and interchange of a variety of events, when we find\nsuch events and histories merely complete the entire content of our\nwork of art; rather it is the ethical and spiritual form which embodies\nthem, and the masterful movements of temperament and character which\nare exposed and unveiled during the entire process of this artistic\nembodiment.\nGlancing now at the main position we have arrived at, and from which\nour inquiry will proceed, we have found that circumstances, conditions,\nand relations, whether determined with a reference to the external\nworld or the subjective consciousness, only create the situation by\nvirtue of the _temperament_ or passion which experiences them and\nderives its nutriment through them. We have further seen that the\nsituation breaks up this determinate form in opposition, obstruction,\ndevelopment, and disruption, so that the _emotional_ life feels itself\ncompelled by the force of the affecting circumstances to _react with\nenergy against_ this disturbing and restraining influence, which stands\nin the way of its objects and passions. It is here, in truth, that\nthe action, strictly speaking, commences, when, that is to say, the\ncontradiction has fully asserted itself, which was already implied in\nthe fully defined situation. Inasmuch as, however, the action which is\nbased on this collision disturbs the unity of that which is opposed\nto it, it calls into being by its antagonism the opposing force of\nthat which it confronts, and consequently the _action_ is immediately\nassociated with the _reaction._ With this analysis of the forces\nrendered necessary by dramatic action, we have at length arrived at\nthe notion of the Ideal as a fully defined process. For we are here\npresented with two distinct spheres of interest, both of which have\nbeen rent, as it were, from the harmony they originally possessed, and\nconfront each other in conflict. Such, by the contradiction which is\ninvolved in them, make a _resolution_ of the discord necessary. This\nmovement, regarded as a homogeneous whole, belongs no more to the\nprovince of the mere situation and its conflicts; we are carried now\ninto that portion of our inquiry to which we have already given the\nname of the genuine action.\n3. THE ACTION\nIn the development of the subject under consideration, the _action_\nimmediately follows after the universal _world-condition_ and the\nparticular _situation._ In considering the action in its external\nrelation to that portion of our inquiry we have just concluded it will\nbe well to bear in mind the result we arrived at, that it presupposes\ncircumstances which necessitate collisions, action, and reaction. It\nis impossible to determine at what point in the circumstances thus\npresupposed the action will _begin._ For that which in one aspect will\nappear as commencement will very possibly present itself in another as\nthe result of earlier developments, and to that extent will postpone\nthe real starting-point. And in like manner this, too, we may regard\nas a fact resulting from former collisions. To take an example; in\nthe house of Agamemnon Iphigenia in Tauris expiates the guilt and\nmisfortune of her family. The commencement here of this deliverance on\nthe part of Iphigenia is the fact that Diana carries her to Tauris.\nThis circumstance is, however, merely the result of earlier stages of\nthe story, such as the sacrifice in Aulis, which is again conditioned\nby the injury done to Menelaus in the rape of Helen by Paris, and so\non, ever backward, until we come to the famous egg of Leda. In the same\nway the events which are the subject-matter of the Iphigenia in Tauris\npresuppose the murder of Agamemnon, and all the crimes associated\nwith the house of Tantalus. An analysis of much the same character\nmight be applied to the Theban circle of mythos. If an action is to\nbe represented with all the facts that condition it, poetry is the\nonly real art that can attempt this. Such a complete exposition of\nhistorical fact has already become, as a certain proverb reminds us,\nrather a wearisome business; it is, in fact, more within the province\nof simple prose, and, in contrast with such completeness, poetry will\nrather consider its true function to be that of taking its audience at\nonce into the heart of the matter. There is a further important reason\nwhy it should not be to the interest of art to make its commencement\nfrom that point where we find the action under consideration is in the\nfirst instance externally conditioned, and it is this: such a point\nof departure is, after all, only related to the process regarded\nas natural or historical fact[323]. The association of the action\nwith this commencement merely concerns the empirical unity of its\nappearance; it may, however, in itself be of no significance at all\nto the real content of the action. This external unity of historical\nsequence remains just as it was, however it may chance that one\nparticular person is affected by the involved threads of a varying\nseries of fact. No doubt the entirety of the facts of life, its actions\nand fatalities, tends to make the individual what he is; but for all\nthat his true nature, the real core of his thoughts and capacities, is\nmanifested in _one_ great situation and action independently of them.\nIt is the progress of these which reveals to us really what a character\nis made of, a character which previously to their occurrence had been\nknown merely in a nominal way, that is the name of one more fact among\nthe external facts of experience.\nWe must therefore not look for the commencement of the action in that\n_empirical_ source of it; we must rather centre the attention upon\nthose circumstances which have taken a hold upon the particular nature\nwith which we are dealing, and created or satisfied its needs; we\nmust, in fact, reveal the particular collision in whose conflict and\nresolution the action in question consists. Homer, for example, in the\n\"Iliad,\" makes a start at once with the particular fact on which his\nentire epic is founded, that is to say, with the wrath of Achilles.\nHe tells us nothing of earlier history of the life of Achilles, but\nemphasizes at once the critical collision, and, moreover, does it in a\nway which unfolds a background of the greatest interest to his picture.\nThe representation, then, of the action as a process complete in\nitself, in which action, reaction, and resolution are constituent\nelements, is, above all, the function of the poetic art; all the other\narts can at most only seize upon and secure in their presentation\none moment of this process. It is quite true that if we direct our\nattention to that aspect of the medium they employ which is richest,\nthey may appear to have an advantage over poetry; in painting\nespecially[324] we find a control asserted not merely over the entire\nexternal form, but also over the expression of external demeanour and\nthe play of such relatively to other objects grouped around it. Such a\nmeans of expression, however, cannot compare as an interpreter of truth\nwith human speech. The action itself is the clearest means of unfolding\nto us individual character, whether we view it relatively to the entire\nemotional life[325] or the objects of mind. All that a man is at the\nvery root of his nature is first revealed to us through his acts; and\naction, for the reason that it is an expression of spirit, finds its\nultimate expression as such most clearly and concisely in speech alone.\nWhen we speak in general terms of human action we are apt to figure to\nourselves an incalculable variety of mode. For Art, however, the sphere\nof action suitable to artistic representation is, generally speaking,\nlimited. Her province is wholly restricted to the type of action which\nis conformable to the necessary configuration of the Idea.\nThere are three points of essential importance necessary to grasp in\nconnection with such action as is capable of artistic representation,\nand which we may emphasize as follows. The situation and the resulting\nconflict is that which generally stimulates it; the active movement,\nhowever, taken by itself, the element of difference, that is to say,\nof the Ideal in its activity, is made apparent first by virtue of the\nreaction. This movement may be resolved into the following component\nfeatures:\n_First_, we have the _universal_[326] _forces_, which constitute the\nessential content and object, for the sake of which the action takes\nplace.\n_Secondly_, we have the _realization_[327] of these forces in the\n_individuals_ who act.\n_Thirdly_, the two aspects above mentioned have to unite themselves in\nthat which, in default of any better generic term, we will here call\n_character._\n_(a) The Universal Forces of Action_\n(_a_) However much we have finally arrived in our consideration of\nthe action at a point where the definition and differentiation of the\nIdeal is of the first importance, nevertheless the very notion of art\nrenders it necessary that in the sphere of true beauty, be the aspect\nof it whatsoever it may, it must still have upon it the stamp of the\nIdeal; it cannot, that is to say, maintain itself without rationality\nand the justification it implies. Interests of an ideal character must\ninevitably be in conflict with another, so that might is opposed to\nmight. These interests are, in fact, the eternal and universal forces\nof spiritual existence, the essential cravings of the human heart,\nthe spontaneous and inevitable objects of human action, justifiable\nand rational in virtue of their own character, and consequently the\nvery universal powers to which we have referred. They are indeed not\nthe absolute Divine itself, but rather the sons of the one absolute\nIdea[328], and consequently dominant and valid. They are the children\nof the one universal truth, albeit only determinate, particular\nmoments of the same. Through their very distinction, it is true, they\ncan fall into contradiction or disunion, yet despite all the element\nof difference contained, they must possess the original essentiality\nwithin them in order to appear as the determinate Ideal. Such are the\nsupreme motive forces of art. They are the eternal[329] religious and\nethical modes of relationship, status, personal character[330], and in\nthe world of romance, before everything else, honour and love. In the\nparticular grade of their significance these powers differ, but all are\nessentially the product of reason. At the same time it is these powers\nin the human heart and mind, which man, by virtue of his humanity,\nis bound to recognize, to give free play to, and to actualize. At\nthe same time they ought not directly to appear as rights in positive\nlegislation. For, to take one reason, the form of positive legislation,\nas we have seen, is already in partial conflict with the notion and\ncontent of the Ideal; furthermore, it is quite possible that the\ncontent of positive rights may contribute to that which is essentially\nunjust, albeit entirely clothed in the attributes of law. The relations\nwe have above referred to, however, are not merely the supreme stable\nembodiment of the external world[331], but the essentially substantive\npowers, which for the very reason that they contain in themselves the\nactual content of human existence, continue to be the stimulating\nsource of its activity, and ultimately all that ever carried it forward\nto perfection.\nOf this kind are the interests and objects which contend against each\nother in the \"Antigone\" of Sophocles. Creon, the king, as ruler of the\nstate, by a decree couched in the severest terms, forbade the right\nof burial to the son of \u0152dipus, who had proved himself an enemy of\nhis country by bringing an army against Thebes. This proclamation was\nso far justifiable that it expressed care for the weal of the entire\ncity. Antigone, however, is animated by an ethical principle of equal\nauthority, in other words by her love for her brother, whom she finds\nit impossible to leave unburied, the prey of carrion birds. To leave\nsuch a duty unfulfilled would be in direct opposition to the sacred\ninstincts of her personal relationship. She consequently violates the\ndecree of Creon.\n(_\u03b2_) Collisions of the type with which we are now dealing may be\nintroduced in every possible way; the necessity of the reaction,\nhowever, must not be occasioned by means of anything out of place or\nat cross purposes[332] with the main action, but through that which is\nin itself reasonable and justifiable. For example, in the well-known\nGerman poem of Hartmann von der Aue, \"The Poor Henry,\" the collision\nis repulsive. The hero in this poem is visited by a fatality, that is\nto say, an incurable disease. He turns for assistance to the monks of\nSalermo. They state as the condition of his cure that a human being\nmust willingly surrender his or her life, on the ground that the\nnecessary salve can alone be forthcoming from a human heart. A poor\nmaiden who is in love with the knight offers freely her own life and\naccompanies him into Italy. This is pure barbarism, and the silent\nlove and pathetic devotion of the maiden are unable, consequently,\nto produce their full effect. It is true that we find the injustice\nof human sacrifice presented us by the ancients as the ground of the\ncollision. The famous example is that of the story of Iphigenia, who is\nfirst offered as such a sacrifice, and afterwards is on the point of\noffering up her brother. But, in the first place, it is to be observed\nthat in these examples the conflict is in close connection with other\nrelations which are in themselves justifiable; secondly, the artistic\nprinciple is really satisfied, as we have already observed, by the fact\nthat both Iphigenia and Orestes are finally delivered, and the power of\na collision which is opposed to our notion of right is thus destroyed.\nAnd, indeed, this is also the case in the above mentioned poem of\nHartmann, in so far as we may acknowledge the _d\u00e9nouement_ offered us\nin which, on Henry refusing to accept the sacrifice, God releases him\nfrom his malady, and the maiden is rewarded for her true love[333].\nIn apparent association with the positive powers we have enumerated\nmust be added others set over against them, that is to say, the forces\nof that which is negative and bad, evil in short. That which is purely\nnegative, however, ought not to be taken in the ideal representation of\nan action as the essential ground-motive for the necessary reaction.\nThe reality of the purely negative case, it is true, corresponds to the\nnegative and its appropriate character, but, if the implied[334] notion\nand object is already in itself rendered nugatory, it is even less\npossible that the ugliness which is exposed in the inward life should\nmanifest any genuine beauty upon its external reality. The sophistry of\npassion can, indeed, by means of the capacity, strength, and energy of\na character, make the attempt to graft positive characteristics upon\nthe negative, but we only obtain thereby the vision of a whitewashed\ngrave. For that which is purely negative is generally flat and stale\nand leaves us consequently either void or drives us back, whether\nit be used as the motive force of an action or merely as a means to\npromote a reaction in another. The horrible, unfortunate, the harshness\nof dominion, and the obduracy of superior power may form part of the\ncontent and burden of the imagination when such characteristics are\nexalted and carried by the abundant greatness of a particular character\nor object. Evil, however, taken simply for what it is, envy, cowardice,\nand meanness, is merely repulsive. The devil, if we take him for what\nhe really ought to be, is consequently a bad subject, or rather a\nfigure for which Art has no uses at all. He is just a falsehood and\nnothing more, and consequently an extremely prosaic personality. In\nthe same way it is perfectly true that the Furies of hate and many\nother allegorical figures of later times are potencies of a kind,\nbut they are without affirmative subsistency and holdfastness[335],\nunfavourable to ideal representation, although in this respect a wide\nmargin of difference is permissible in the several arts respectively,\nand in the particular mode in which they may immediately visualize such\nobjects. Evil is, to express it in most general terms, essentially\ncold and devoid of content, because as such it is merely the source of\nnegation, discord, and misfortune. All art, however, which is true to\nits essential notion, should reflect on us the vision of a harmony.\nMeanness, above all, is despicable, for it is a quality which arises\nfrom the envy and hatred of all that is noble, and does not shrink\nfrom distorting even a power that is essentially based upon the good\ninto a means conformable to its own perverse and shameless passion.\nThe great poets and artists of the classical world have in consequence\nnever presented us with the vision of absolute evil and depravity.\nShakespeare, on the contrary, in his tragedy of \"King Lear,\" unfolds\nbefore us the spectacle of wickedness in all its horrors. The old\nLear divides his kingdom among his daughters, and, while doing so, is\nfoolish enough to believe in their false and flattering speeches, and\nto misinterpret the silent and faithful Cordelia. There is already\nfolly and madness in this, and it is followed by the most outrageous\ningratitude and worthlessness of the elder daughters and their husbands\nto the point of absolute craze. As an antithesis of this the heroes\nof the French school of tragedy are stretched and puffed out with\nevery sort of grandiose and sublime motive, and make a great parade of\ntheir honour and nobility, and yet despite of it all destroy the very\nmeaning of such motives by the mere fact of what they really are and\naccomplish. But it is in modern times more especially that we find this\nunstable dissolution of everything spiritual[336], which forces its way\nthrough every dissonance, however repulsive, become quite _\u00e0 la mode_;\nmoreover, it has even given us what we may describe as the humour of\nthe abominable thing, a kind of burlesque simulation of irony, an\natmosphere in which a Theodor Hoffmann, for example, has found himself\nso much at home.\n(_\u03b3_) We may conclude, then, that it is the essentially positive\nand substantive powers in the spiritual world which supply the real\ncontent of the ideal action. These sources of energy, however, in their\nartistic embodiment, must not appear in their inherent universality,\nalbeit within the reality of the action they are essential phases of\nthe Idea. Rather they must receive the form of independent individuals.\nIf this were not so they would remain as merely the universals of\nthought or abstract conceptions which do not properly fall within the\nprovince of art. Though in their origin they should be held as intact\nas it is possible to hold them from mere caprices of the fancy, it\nis equally necessary that in their development they should acquire\ndeterminacy no less than self-consistency[337], and in this way\nappear as essentially particularized. Such definition as they possess\nought not to be carried to the point of the particularity of external\nobjects, nor should their concentration be carried to that of the\nsubjective self-consciousness[338]. Otherwise the individuality of\nthose universal powers is necessarily involved in all the developments\nof finite existence. In this respect we may say, then, that the\ndeterminacy of their individuality is not to be taken too seriously.\nThe gods of the Greek Pantheon are the most conspicuous example of this\nmanifestation and sway of the universal forces we have just discussed\nin their self-subsistent form. However they may be brought before\nus, their blessedness and cheerfulness remains unaffected. Regarded\nseparately as particular gods no doubt they engage in conflict, but\nin all their battles we shall ultimately find they are not really\nserious in the sense that they concentrate themselves on any definite\nobject with the entire consequential energy of their character and\npassion, fully prepared to stake their existence upon the result. They\nengage in this affair or that wherever it may take place, identify\nparticular interests in concrete examples with their own; they are,\nhowever, equally ready to leave the matter at any point and wing their\nway back happily to Olympus. Such is the view we get of the gods when\nthey engage in warfare on the pages of Homer. The determinacy of their\ncharacterization is capable of conflict, but they remain for all\nthat the purely universal determinations which at bottom they are.\nA battle begins to rage; heroes advance singly one against another;\nthen we lose sight of individuals altogether in the universal storm\nand crush; it is no longer the specific qualities of individuals\nwhich are now set in relief against each other--it is the universal\nrush of the fight, the daemon of war loosed and roaring, and now it\nis that the universal powers, the gods themselves, step forth on the\nscene of battle. From such a temporary display of the contrasts of\ntheir characterization they ever withdraw themselves into the solitude\nof their self-subsistency and repose. For though the individuality\nof their form carries them perforce into the region of time and\ncontingency, nevertheless inasmuch as the universal they claim as gods\nis that which ultimately must prevail, the individual characteristic\nshrinks away into the determination of external form only; they are\nunable in their personality to penetrate the true arcana of conscious\nspirit[339].\nTheir physical definition is, in fact, either more or less only the\naccommodating form of their divinity. But this self-subsistency and\ncareless repose is precisely that which gives to them their plastic\nindividuality, and relieves them of any anxiety and constraint[340] in\nrelation to earthly objects and events[341]. For this reason we find\nin the gods of Homer no final result when actively occupied with the\nconcrete facts of human life, although such activity is displayed for\nus in many and diverse directions. The material and interest of human\nevents which happen in time is that which gives them something to do\nand nothing more. And in like manner we may remark other peculiar\ncharacteristics attached to the Greek gods, which we can only regard as\nessentially unrelated to the general notion of divinity which each god\nrespectively connotes. Mercury is, for example, the slayer of Argus;\nApollo that of the hydra; of the love affairs of Zeus we have countless\ntales, and, among other things, he hangs his wife on an anvil. These\nand many other stories like them are merely supplementary additions,\nwhich attach to the gods in their aspect of natural forces by virtue\nof symbol and allegory, the origin of which we propose to discuss\nmore fully later on. In modern art we shall, it is true, find certain\nindications which point to a conception of definite and at the same\ntime universal powers. These are, however, for the most part simply\ncold and frost-like allegories of hate, envy, hope, love, faithfulness,\nthat is to say, generally of virtues and vices in the actual truth of\nwhich we can retain no belief. For with us moderns it is the concrete\nsubjectivity alone, for which we, in the representations of art, feel\nthat profounder interest, wherein abstractions such as these do not\nappear in their isolation, but are made to appear merely as phases or\naspects of human character, whether we regard it in its particularity\nor as a concrete whole. In much the same way the angels possess no\nessential universality and self-subsistency such as characterize Mars,\nVenus, and Apollo, or even Oceanus and Helios. They are, it is true,\nobjects of imaginative conception, but their specific character is that\nof vassals of the one Divine and essential substance, which is not in\nthis case broken up into self-subsistent individualities, as we find\nit in the Greek Pantheon. For this reason we have here no imaginative\nvision of many objective powers dwelling in a state of tranquillity,\nwhich may be represented as essentially Divine personalities. We find,\non the contrary, the essential content of such either as subsisting\nin the Godhead, or realized in a mode which is both particular and\nsubjective in wholly human characters and actions. Nevertheless\nit was precisely in the conception[342] of self-subsistency and\nindividualization that the ideal representation of the gods originated.\n_(b) The Individuals in the Action_\nIn the cases we have just discussed of the ideal gods it is not a\ndifficult matter for art to secure the ideality she requires. But in\napproaching the concrete action, ideal representation is confronted\nwith a real difficulty. For though it is here that the gods and, in\ngeneral terms, the universal powers may be identified with a principle\nwhich stimulates and compels activity, we are not therefore on the\nplane of reality entitled to find in them the source of genuine\nindividual action. Action is rather essentially the manifestation of\nhuman life. Consequently there are in this connection two distinct\naspects of the problem to be considered. On the one hand we have these\nuniversal forces in their self-subsistent repose and for that reason\nmore abstract substantiality; on the other there is the individuality\nof men, in which we must seek the final spring and determinating\nimpulse to action no less than its actual accomplishment. It is, of\ncourse, only the simple truth that these eternally dominant powers\nare immanent in the identical nature of mankind, constituting, in\nfact, the substantive core of its character; but in so far as they are\ncomprehended in their Divine nature themselves as individuals[343],\nand thereby in an exclusive way, their relation to the subject of human\nconsciousness must remain an external one. And this fact enables us to\nsee the essential difficulty we noticed above. There is, in truth, a\ncontradiction immediately involved in this relation between the gods\nand men. It is quite true that the content of the gods is that which\nbelongs to humanity, and announces itself as his passion, resolve,\nand will. It is, however, equally true that the gods must not only be\nassumed to be and comprehended as independent from man individually\nconsidered in their actual existence, but, furthermore, as the forces\nat the root of all his activity and determination. And this, too, in\nsuch a way that we are forced to consider the same determinations at\none time as personified in the self-subsistent and Divine personality,\nand at another that which appears most essentially to belong to the\nhuman heart. And it is for this reason that the free self-subsistency\nof the gods no less than the freedom of human individuals in their\nactivity is seriously compromised if, to the detriment of human\nindependence, which we have already stated to be of most essential\nimportance to the Ideal of Art, we ascribe an exclusive power of\ncommand to the gods. And we may observe this is precisely the same\nkind of difficulty which confronts us in the form of the religious\nconceptions of Christianity. It is stated in terms that the spirit of\nGod leads up to God. Taken strictly such a phrase can only imply that\nthe inward life of man is regarded as a purely passive ground, upon\nwhich the spirit of God labours. In such a conception the human will\ndisappears as a free will, and at the same time the Divine purpose\nwhich motives the \"in working\" above mentioned can only appear to\nman as a kind of Fate, under which he fails to come by his own true\npersonality[344].\n(_\u03b1_) If, however, this question of mutual relation[345] is so\nunderstood that man in his action is conceived as standing in a purely\nexternal opposition to God, here posited as eternal substance, the\nrelation of both is one of pure matter of fact[346]. God gives a\ncommand, and man is obliged to hearken. Even great poets have found\nthemselves unable to dispense with this conception of external\nopposition between gods and men. In the \"Philoctetes\" of Sophocles,\nfor example, we find that Philoctetes, after he has confounded the\ndeceit of Odysseus, persists in his determination not to return to the\nGrecian camp until Heracles appears at length as _Deus ex machina_,\nand orders him to yield to the entreaty of Neoptolimus. The content of\nthis apparition is, no doubt, sufficiently motived, and answers to our\nown expectation; the catastrophe itself, however, is for all that not\nrightly homogeneous, but rather outside the action; and in his noblest\ntragedies Sophocles makes no such use of this kind of representation,\naccording to which, if we but carry it one step further, the gods\nare reduced to lifeless machines, and individual men simply to the\ninstruments of a foreign caprice. In a similar way we constantly in\nepic poetry meet with the active intervention of the gods represented\nin a mode which is external to human freedom. Hermes, for example,\nconducts Priam to Achilles; Apollo gives Patroclus the blow between the\nshoulders which ends his life. We also frequently find mythological\ntraits treated in such a way that they appear as wholly external to the\nactual lives of the individuals thus affected. Achilles, for example,\nis dipped by his mother in the Styx and thereby rendered invulnerable\nand invincible to the one point of his heels. If we reflect on this\nrationally it is obvious that all real bravery disappears, and all\nthat is heroic in the character of Achilles is converted from a real\ntrait of his essential manhood to a purely physical advantage. Such a\nmode of representation is, however, far more permissible to the epic\nthan it is to the dramatic type of poetry, for the good reason that\nin the epic that aspect of spiritual life which is directly concerned\nwith the intention implied in the execution of objects falls into the\nbackground and a larger field is, in general, offered for the play of\nexternal characteristics. Such a criticism of the prosaic understanding\nas the one above, which charges a poet with the absurdity that his\nheroes are no heroes at all, should only be advanced with the greatest\ncaution, for it is partly in such traits as will appear shortly, that\nthe poetical relation between gods and men is preserved. It is another\nmatter, and we have nothing left us but prose, when in addition the\npowers, which are posited as substantive individuals, are mere empty\nshadows, the creations of the caprice of fancy and the arbitrariness of\na false originality. They are then for the most part only the adjuncts\nof superstition or imbecility.\n(_\u03b2_) The truly poetic relation of ideality consists, then, in the\nidentity of gods and men; and this must assert itself even though\nthe universal powers are presented as independent and free from\nthe particularity of human beings and passions. In other words,\nall that we attribute to the gods must at the same time establish\nitself as that which is essentially cognate with the spiritual life\nof particular men in this sense, that while the dominating powers\nappear as essentially personified, yet at the same time all that is\nthus posited in an external relation to man is none the less clearly\nthat which is immanent in his own spirit and character. The true\nfunction of the artist is, therefore, to introduce a mediating link\nbetween the difference involved in these two aspects, to bind them, in\nshort, by a finely conceived thread of relation which, while clearly\nemphasizing their springs in the spiritual life of man, shall make\nno less visible the universal and essential element which is therein\nimplied and present such to the imagination in individual form. The\nemotional life of man must reveal itself in the gods, who, in fact,\nare the self-subsistent and universal embodiments of that which is\nactive and dominant in his own spiritual experience. Then alone are the\ngods at the same time gods in cognate relation with his own heart and\nemotions. When, for example, we are told by the ancients that Venus or\nAmor has put a constraint upon the heart, no doubt in the first place\nthese divinities are apprehended as external powers; but human love is\nequally a stimulus and a passion, which is implanted in the heart and\nis part of that it independently contains.\nIn much the same sense is the frequent reference to the Eumenides. We\nhave to picture in the first instance no doubt these avenging maidens\nas Furies, who pursue the transgressor in an external form. But this\npursuit is but another aspect of the Fury which drives through the soul\nof the perpetrator of crime; and Sophocles in the \u0152dipus Colonus (I.\n1434) actually refers to them in this sense of inward spiritual forces,\nas the Eumenides of \u0152dipus himself, that is to say, who signify the\nfather's curse as the result of the stress of emotion caused by the\nconduct of his sons. We have, then, and equally have not reason on our\nside whether we identify the gods with powers external to man, or find\nin them that which belongs exclusively to his spiritual life. They are\nin fact both. In Homer, for example, the activity of gods and men is a\nconstantly involved skein[347]. The gods appear to accomplish what is\nforeign to human activity, and yet for all that execute only that which\nis in vital co-ordination with his own emotional life. In the \"Iliad,\"\nfor example, when Achilles, in the stress of controversy, is about to\nraise his sword against Agamemnon, Athene steps forth behind him and\ntakes hold of his head of flaxen hair, visible only to himself. Hero,\nwho is equally anxious over Achilles and Agamemnon, sends for them from\nOlympus, and their admission there appears to be wholly independent\nof the desire of Achilles. On the other hand we have no difficulty in\nseeing that the sudden appearance of Athene, the wisdom which puts\nconstraint upon the hero's wrath, is simply a reflection of internal\nconflict, that the entire description but states in imaginative form\nwhat was experienced in the heart of our hero. In fact Homer himself\npoints this out a few verses previously (\"Iliad,\" I, v, 190), when he\nrelates about the debate that took place in his heart in the following\nterms:\n\u1f22 \u1f45\u03b3\u03b5 \u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f40\u03be\u1f7a \u1f10\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\n\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03bd, \u1f43 \u03b4\u1fbd \u1f08\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03be\u03bf\u03b9,\n\u1f21\u1f72 \u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03ac\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u1f40\u03bd.[348]\nThis inward breaking up of anger into a divided self, this constraint,\nfor it is in opposition to the anger, and Achilles appears at first\nto be wholly filled with wrath, the epic poet has a perfect right\nto represent at the same time as an external event. In a similar\ncase in the \"Odyssey\" we find Minerva acting the part of escort for\nTelemachus. This attendance is rather more difficult to grasp as a\npersonal experience of the emotional life of Telemachus, although we\ncan readily fix on certain points of contact between the external\nimage and the emotion experienced. And this it is we may generally\nsay which constitutes the cheerful buoyancy of the Homeric gods, and\nthe irony implied in the honour paid to them. Their self-consistency\nand seriousness are characteristics which tend to dissolve like a\ncloud, precisely to the extent that they unfold themselves as the very\npowers which are native to man's emotional life, and thereby, in their\nmanifestation, leave humanity alone with its own possessions.\nHowever, it is not necessary to look so far abroad for a complete\nexample of the conversion of a purely mechanical conception of Divine\nactivity into the atmosphere of the subjective consciousness, the\nsphere, that is, of freedom and ethical beauty. In his Iphigenia in\nTauris Goethe has in this connection carried the process through with\na beauty that we cannot sufficiently admire. In the drama of Euripides\nOrestes in complicity with Iphigenia carries off the statue of Diana.\nThis is simply an act of stealing. Then Thoas comes on the scene, and\norders their pursuit, and the recovery of the bust of the goddess.\nFinally, in very prosaic fashion, Athene appears and orders Thoas\nto stay his hand on the ground that she has independently commended\nOrestes to the charge of Poseidon, and he, in deference to her wishes,\nhas already carried Orestes far over seas. Thoas submits to her advice\nand replies to it in the following terms (v, 1442, 43): \"Lady Athene,\nwhoever, on hearing the words of the gods, does not obey them is but\na fool. For how could it be right and fit to contend with the mighty\ngods.\"\nIn this relation we can only see the bare external command of Athene\non the one side, and an equally futile submission of Thoas on the\nother. In Goethe's treatment of the subject, on the contrary, Iphigenia\nbecomes herself exalted to the rank of a goddess, in reliance upon the\ntruth she feels within herself, the truth of a human heart. In this\nsense she turns to Thoas and exclaims:\nIs it then man alone who has the right\nTo accomplish things none ever heard before!\nShall he alone impress upon the strength\nOf hearts heroic the impossible?\nThat which in the drama of Euripides the command of Athene effects, the\nchange in the attitude of Thoas, Goethe's Iphigenia endeavours to bring\nabout, and in fact does bring about, through the depth of the feelings\nand ideas with which she confronts him.\nWith motions strange\nAn enterprise audacious soars within me;\nA vast reproach and ills yet graver still\nWill break on me if the event miscarry;\nBut, see, I place it on your knees! Be true,\nBe only true and worthy of your fame,\nSo your assistance shall declare it truth,\nTruth glorified through me.\nAnd to this reply of Thoas:\nWhat! you believe\nThe Scythian wild and the barbarian\nHear the wise voice of Truth and hearts humane\nWhen Atreus of Greece still failed to hear.\nshe answers with the gentlest, purest trust:\nNay, all thus hear\nBeneath whatever sky their birth was laid;\nAll needs must hear for whom the springs of life\nFlow without let and purely through the soul.\nThen it is she makes the final call upon her greatness of soul, and the\ntenderness of her faith at its highest point of effort; her entreaty\ntouches, then masters and wrings from him, in a way that must appeal\nto every heart, the permission to return to her own. This alone is\nnecessary. She has no need of the statue of the goddess; she can depart\non her journey without deceit or betrayal of trust. And it is with the\nfinest sense of beauty that Goethe refers here to the oracular word of\nthe god:\nBring but to Greece again the sister who\nAll loth at heart in holy temple bides\nOn shores of Tauris, and the curse is gone.\nThe very human reconciliation disclosed in these words is clearly\nthat the pure and holy Iphigenia, the sister, is in fact the divine\npersonification and the protectress of the house.\nNoble and beautiful I wot in sooth\nAll that the goddess counselled seemed to me,\nexclaims Orestes to Thoas and Iphigenia:\nLike to a holy picture\nThe fate unalterable which walled our town\nBy one mysterious word, one word Divine,\nIs banished, now that city takes thee back,\nWho art the true protectress of our home;\nReserve thyself in holy quietness,\nA blessing to thy brother and thine own;\nIt seemed that all deliverance on Earth\nHad passed away, and all comes back with thee.\nIn the spirit of these healing words of reconciliation Iphigenia has\nalready revealed herself to Orestes by virtue of the purity and ethical\nbeauty of her inner life. It is true that her discernment drives him\nhalf mad, who in the convulsion of his spirit has lost all faith in\npeace; but the pure love of the sister does not fail to heal him from\nevery pang with which he is tortured by the Furies of his soul:\nWithin thine arms\nThe evil clawed me with its direst clutch\nFor the last time, and to the very marrow\nI shuddered horribly: and then it vanished,\nE'en as a serpent to its lair. Anew,\nAnd all through thee, the day's breadth I enjoy.\nHere, as elsewhere throughout it, we can hardly emphasize sufficiently\nour admiration for the profound beauty of this poem.\nThe material which has the impress of Christianity upon it is more\nopen to criticism than that which was the subject-matter of antique\nart. In the sacred legends, and generally speaking where the religious\nconceptions of Christendom prevail, no doubt we may find the appearance\nof Christ, the Virgin Mary and other saints the subject of universal\nbelief; but along with them the imagination has clothed itself with\nfanciful aberrations in every direction, so that witches, ghosts, and\nevery sort of spectral apparition are yet more conspicuous objects. In\nthe face of such conceptions, so far at least as they appear foreign\npowers to our human nature, and man submits himself unreservedly to\nthe charm, seduction, and influence of their illusions, artistic\nrepresentation is wholly given up to every kind of folly and caprice of\nmere contingency. It is of unique importance that in the treatment of\nsuch material the artist take care that the freedom and independence\nof judgment are in no way impaired. Shakespeare has shown us how to\ndo this in most noble fashion. The witches in Macbeth, for example,\nappear as external powers, who foretell for Macbeth his future destiny.\nWhat they _do_ foretell, however, is precisely that which is his own\nmost secret wish, which is reflected back on him and declared in this,\nmerely in appearance, external form[349]. With a still closer regard to\nbeauty, yet profounder insight, is the ghost in Hamlet treated as the\npurely objective embodiment of Hamlet's own intuitions. We find Hamlet\nin the first instance overpowered with a vague feeling that something\nhorrible has taken place. His father's ghost then appears and gives\ndefinite form to these awful premonitions. We naturally expect that\nHamlet, after receiving the facts set forth in his father's warning,\nwill at once proceed with energy and bring the murderer to book, a\nrevenge which appears to have ample excuse. But he delays and delays.\nCritics have made this inactivity a matter of reproach to Shakespeare,\nblamed him, in fact, as though for this reason the play to some\nextent never gets properly off. But we must remember Hamlet is not a\nstrongly practical nature, rather a finely strung one, with emotions\nheld in persistent reserve; a nature which finds it difficult to tear\nitself from its internal harmony; melancholy too, prone to subtleties,\nhypochondriacal, with emotions deeply rooted. For this reason it is\nobvious that he is _prima facie_ indisposed to prompt action. And this\nis fundamentally Goethe's conception of him when he tells us that what\nShakespeare sought to represent \"was the imposition of some supreme\naction on a soul whose growth was unadapted to its execution.\" He\nin fact interprets the entire drama relatively to this conception\nof Hamlet. \"We have here,\" he maintains, \"an oak tree planted in an\nexquisite vase, which ought really only to contain and shelter the\nfair flowers; the roots spread, the vase is shattered.\" But it should\nbe noticed that Shakespeare, when referring to the apparition of the\nghost, contributes a far profounder trait of character in explanation\nof this debated point. Hamlet delays, because he does not right off\nwholly believe in the ghost.\nThe spirit that I have seen\nMay be a devil: and the devil hath power\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea and perhaps,\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\nAbuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\nMore relative than this: the play's the thing,\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\nIn this passage it is obvious that the apparition as such does\nnot leave Hamlet merely devoid of all stability[350], but that he\nentertains a reasonable doubt, and is determined to make his conviction\na certainty by his own experiments before he proceeds to act upon it.\n(_\u03b3_) As a summary description of these universal powers, which appear\nnot merely in their external independence, but are the vital and\nmoving forces in the human heart and all that is implied in its most\nintimate life, we may borrow an expression in use among the ancients,\nthat is to say Pathos (_\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2._) To translate this word adequately is\nnot easy. Passion almost always implies as its concomitant an element\nof meanness or baseness. We contend in ordinary parlance that a man\nshould not surrender himself to his passions. It must therefore be\nunderstood that we use the expression pathos in a nobler and more\nuniversal sense than this without the slightest implication of anything\nblameworthy or egotistic. The devoted love of the sister Antigone is\nan excellent example of a pathos in the full significance of the Greek\nuse of the term. Pathos in this sense is a power of the emotional life\nwhich completely justifies itself, an essential part of the content\nof rationality and the free will. Orestes, for example, kills his\nmother not so much on account of any force of his emotional life which\nwe strictly can call passion; rather it is a pathos in itself fully\nconsidered upon and essentially sane which carries him on to the awful\ndeed. Thus understood we may add that it is impossible to say that the\ngods possess pathos. They are merely the universal content of that\nwhich is the stimulating energy in the resolves and actions of human\nindividuality. The gods as such continue in their repose and freedom\nfrom passion, and however much they may quarrel or contend among\nthemselves, there is nothing really serious in it all, or their strife\npossessed merely a symbolical significance in the view we may take of\nit as a universal war of the gods. We must therefore strictly limit\npathos to the actions of mankind, and conceive thereunder the essential\nor rational content, which is present in the human consciousness\nidentical with itself and throughout suffuses the emotional life.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) We may say, then, that pathos constitutes the true mediating\nlink[351], the veritable domain of art. The representation of it is the\nmost truly effective part of a work of art, as it is its influence upon\nthose who look at it. Pathos sets a string in motion, which vibrates\nthrough every human heart. Every one must know the type of worth and\nreason, which underlies the content of a genuine example of pathos,\nmust recognize it at once when he sees it. And the cause of this is\nthat pathos moves us because it is that which is essentially the vital\nforce of our human existence. And it equally follows that that which\nis wholly external, the natural environment and particular scene, in\nits active support of the effect of pathos, need only be treated quite\nsubordinately. Nature must in consequence be drawn upon as a fact\nessentially symbolical and suffer the pathos to re-echo from her walls,\nwhich is the most real subject-matter of artistic representation.\nLandscape is, for example, a type or genre of painting of less\nimportance than historical painting; but even there we find that the\nschool of landscape most independent should not be without a general\nharmonic relation to human feeling, and, in fact, possesses a certain\ntype of pathos. In this sense we are told art generally ought to touch\nthe emotions. Before accepting this principle, however, we ought first\nto inquire through what means this peculiar effect of art must be\nbrought about. \"To touch the emotions\" is in general the activity of\nsomething in union with feeling, and mankind, more particularly the\nmankind of to-day, are, or a more considerable portion of them are,\nonly too readily open to such experiments. The man who showers tears\non us, starts the seeds of tears, which grow up fast enough. In art,\nhowever, only that ought to move us which contains in itself the real\nimport of pathos.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) For such reasons we may affirm that neither in comedy nor\nin tragedy ought pathos to be that which is only folly or personal\nidiosyncracy. Shakespeare's Timon, for example, is on purely material\ngrounds a misanthrope; his friends have eaten him up, consumed his\nsubstance, and when he himself requires their gold desert him. He\nconsequently becomes a passionate enemy of mankind. The situation is\nboth conceivable and consistent with nature, but it contains no pathos\nthat can be justified on principle. Even to a more striking extent\nis the hate we find in \"The Misanthrope,\" that play of Schiller's\napprenticeship, purely a vagary of modern ideas. For in this latter\ncase the misanthrope is in addition a thoughtful, perspicacious, and\nentirely noble man, great-hearted towards his peasants, whom he has\nfreed from their villeinage, and devoted to his daughter, who is, apart\nfrom her beauty, in all respects worthy of his love. In much the same\nway, in that novel of August Lafontaine, Quintius Heimeran von Flaming\nis worried with the follies of mankind. It is, however, our most\nlatter-day poetry which, above all, loves to wind itself into every\nconceivable knot of fantastical falsehood[352], attempting thereby to\nsecure an effect through mere oddity, but failing to find the slightest\nresponse in any sane person for the reason that every vestige of what\nis really present in human life has vanished from such refinements of\nmental athletics.\nIn another direction we may remark that everything which depends\nsolely, that is to say, in so far as scientific apprehension is\nthe main requirement, upon instruction, testimony to the truth, and\ninsight of what is offered as such, is no fit subject-matter for\nthe representation of a genuine pathos. The facts of _scientific\nknowledge_ are a part of this material. And the reason of this is that\nscience demands a particular form of education, an effort towards\nand a knowledge of the specific forms of science and their relative\nimportance of exceptional variety and extension; an interest in this\ntype of study is by no means a universally moving influence in the\nhearts of men, but is limited and must ever remain limited to a narrow\ncircle of votaries. The treatment of purely _religious_ instruction\npresents similar difficulty, if we mean by that the development of\nthe same in its profoundest import. No doubt the universal content\nof religion, such as the belief in God and similar theses, is of the\ndeepest interest to anyone worthy of it. Art is, however, not directly\nconcerned either in the exposition of religious dogmas, nor, indeed,\nin any exceptional insight into their truth; it is consequently of\nimportance that she should be held aloof front such disquisitions. It\nis all the more necessary that we should through art entrust every type\nof pathos to the human heart, every motive of ethical significance,\nwhich are of practical and vital interest. The influence of religious\nideas is rather upon the subjective world of emotion, the heaven\nof the heart, the ever-repeated consolation and uplifting of the\nindividual life, than upon direct action in the strict sense. For that\nwhich is Divine in religion on its practical side is morality and the\npowers which are potent in the ethical life. These powers, however,\nin contrast with the heaven of religion in its purest form, are in\ndefinite relation to the world and that which is entirely human. Among\nthe ancients this worldly content was fundamentally included in their\nconception of Deity, and consequently their gods could be related\ndirectly to human action and its artistic presentation.\nFrom all this it will readily appear that the significant moments\nof volitional activity which present to us the pathos we have just\nendeavoured to define are numerically small and the range of them\nrestricted. In the opera especially it is inevitable that the sphere\nfrom which such may be selected is a narrow one; we consequently have\nfor ever dinned in our ears the plaints and delights, the misfortunes\nand happiness of love, fame, honour, friendship, maternal and marital\ndevotion.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) Now a pathos of this kind requires for its display not merely\nthe power of exposition, but also that of perfected _elaboration_[353].\nAnd what is more, the soul which entrusts to its pathos the spiritual\nwealth it possesses must be one with real wealth to dispose of,\nand not one that can rest in a condition of purely intensive\nself-concentration. It must, in short, be ready to give an outward\nsemblance to its self-expression and rise to the finished perfection of\nthat. The distinction between this power of self-concentration and that\nof self-revelation is of great importance; and we shall find that in\nthis respect the types of individuality such as generically represent\ndifferent races offer essential points of contrast. Nations whose\nreflective consciousness has been highly trained are more eloquent\nin the expression of their passions than others who are not so. The\nancients, for example, were accustomed to unfold the pathos, which\nis the animating principle of human personality, in its profoundest\nsignificance, without running off into cold generalities or empty\ntattle. The French also in this respect are naturally gifted, and\ntheir eloquence in the expression of passion is not by any means\nalways merely a piling up of words, as we Germans, following the bent\nof our national reserve, to which the repeated expression of emotion\nappears to be a kind of wrong inflicted upon it, are only too ready\nto think it is. In fact, we have gone so far in this direction that\nwe could mention a distinct phase in our poetical history, when the\nyounger spirits, at any rate, sick to death of that which they dubbed\n\"the flush of French rhetorical water-drops,\" yearned to such an\nextent after the simplicity of Nature that their artistic energy could\nonly express itself for the most part in interjections. It is hardly\nnecessary to observe, however, that we shall arrive at no \"open sesame\"\nwith Ahs and Ohs, a damn here and there thrown in, or any other random\nnote of storm and bluster. The inspiration of mere interjections is a\nfeeble one, or rather is simply the way in which the still unrefined\nnature expresses itself. The spirit which is to reveal to us pathos\nmust be a spirit which is full to running over, which is able to spread\nitself abroad and give expression to its virtue.\nWe may add, too, that in this respect Goethe and Schiller present a\nmost marked contrast. Goethe is less pathetic than Schiller, makes\nuse of a mode of artistic expression which is more intensive; more\nespecially in his lyrics we are struck by this characteristic of\nself-reserve. His songs, and this is the true quality of the pure\nlyric, go naturally on their way, without entirely giving us all\nthat they contain. Schiller, on the contrary, is clearly anxious to\nunfold the pathos of his subject to its furthest limit, and with all\nthe clearness and force of expression he can muster. Claudius in\n\"Wands-becker Boten\"[354] has contrasted Voltaire and Shakespeare in\nmuch the same fashion, maintaining that the one _is_ what the other\nonly _appears_ to be. \"Master Arouet tells us: 'I weep'; Shakespeare\nreally weeps!\" To this we can only reply that it is precisely with such\ntelling and appearance that art is concerned and not with the mere\npositive fact. If Shakespeare merely wept while Voltaire made others\nthink he wept, so much the worse for the poet Shakespeare.\nTo conclude, then, it is necessary that pathos, in order to be in\nitself concrete, as it should be in ideal art, be presented in its\nartistic manifestation as the pathos issuing from a spiritual nature,\nrich and comprehensive. And this result carries us forward to that\nthird aspect of our consideration of \"the action\" already adverted to,\nthat is to say, an inquiry into what is implied by _character_ in this\nconnection.\n_(c) Character_\nWe will summarize the proceeding argument. Our point of departure was\nthe _universal_ and substantive powers which are the original stimulus\nto action. Such require as the medium of their active realization human\n_individuality_, in which they then appear as _affecting_ pathos[355].\nBut, furthermore, the universal inherent in these powers must in\nparticular individuals acquire the concentrated unity and concreteness\nof a _whole_, and a _single whole._ This totality is man apprehended in\nhis fulfilled spiritual content and the subjectivity therein comprised,\nin one word the entire self-contained human individuality which we\ndesignate as character. The gods are born into the pathos of men, and\npathos in its more concrete form of activity is human character.\nIn character, then, we find the real focus[356] of the ideal exposition\nof art, that is to say in so far as the embodiment unites in itself the\nseparate aspects of it already developed as consistent phases, in the\nconstruction of its own totality. For the Idea as _Ideal_, by which\nwe mean as clothed in a form within the grasp of sensuous imagination\nand perception, and in its activity as action and accomplishment, is,\nif we define it strictly, just this self-relation of the _subjective\nindividuality._ The individuality, however, which is truly _free_,\nand nothing short of this will satisfy the Ideal, has not merely to\ndeclare itself as universality, but at the same time, to assert its\nnature as concrete singularity, as the mediating bond which unites and\ntranspierces both sides thus related, which in their _self-related_\nactuality subsist as unity. And this is precisely what we understand\nby character, the ideal form of which consists in the wealth of energy\nwith which all the constituent aspects of the subjective life are\nwelded in one whole.\nWe will now inquire rather more closely into the nature of this\nconception of character viewed under three distinct aspects.\n_First_, as co-extensive[357] individuality, that is to say, with, our\nattention directed to the wealth of substance contained in it.\n_Secondly_, with direct reference to its particularity, the form in\nwhich it is bound to appear, albeit still a totality, as one that is\nmore _defined_ or specific.\n_Thirdly_, in our final apprehension of it as a unity which is fully\nidentified with its own determinate form, that is, which is throughout\nfused with the same by virtue of its own principle of subjective\nself-identity, and thereby attaches to the whole the significance of an\nessentially _assured_ character.\nWe will now develop and elucidate more fully what we conceive to be\nimplied in the above general propositions.\n(_\u03b1_) And first we would draw attention to the fact that this\npathos, though an essential feature in the development of completed\nindividuality, is not, in the specific form of its appearance, the\n_sole_ or exclusive interest of the individuality portrayed. It is,\nin fact, merely one aspect of the efficient[358] character, if one\nof paramount importance. To put it in rather a strong way, the human\nsoul does not merely carry within it _one_ god as the original of\nits pathos; on the contrary, the spiritual scope of humanity has\nwider borders, and we may affirm that many gods make their dwelling\nin one true man, or, rather, all the powers which are scattered\nthroughout the heaven of the gods are enclosed within that one breast.\nIt is co-extensive with the entire field of Olympus. In this sense\none of old has said: \"Out of thine own passions, O man, hast thou\ncreated the gods.\" And, as a matter of fact, in proportion as the\nintelligence of the Hellenic folk quickened, the number of their gods\nincreased; and, furthermore, the gods of their earliest days were less\nintelligent, that is to say, they were god-like figures deficient both\nin individuality and determinate character.\nIn this wealth of content, accordingly, it is necessary that the\ncharacter adequate to ideal art should display itself. And this is just\nthat which creates the interest we feel in a character, namely, that\na totality such as that we have above described emerges from it, and\nthe character, while reposing on its abundance, nevertheless persists\nin perfect equality with itself, as one secure and self-excluding\nsubject. If the character, however, be not conceived and depicted as\nthis rounded and subjective unity, is abstract in the sense that\nit is entirely the sport of one passion, such must then appear as\nself-destructive[359], or at least cracked, weak, and without real\nfibre. For the weakness and inertness of individuals is just this very\nthing, that the eternal forces of which we have spoken never assert\nthemselves in them as a real part of their most essential substance,\nas, to put it logically, predicates which adhere to them as the\nsubjects of such.\nIn Homer[360], for example, every hero is the living focus of a whole\ncongeries of qualities and traits. Achilles is the most youthful hero\nin the host, but his youthful exuberance is represented as quite\ncompatible with all other entirely human qualities, and Homer unfolds\nbefore us this variety through situations which offer the finest\ncontrast. He loves his mother, Thetis, he weeps for Briseis, when she\nis snatched from him, and his violated sense of honour drives him\ninto the conflict with Agamemnon, which is the original fount of all\nthe events that follow after it in the \"Iliad.\" Add to this he is the\ntruest friend of Patroclus and Antilochus; moreover, he is the most\nblooming, fiery youth, swift of foot, brave, yet full of reverence\nfor gray hairs; the faithful Phoenix and trusty servant are at his\nfeet, and at the funeral of Patroclus the hoary Nestor is treated\nwith the highest deference and honour. And, in contrast to all this,\nAchilles is represented as inflammable to a degree, effervescent,\nrevengeful, and full of the most brutal austerity when face to face\nwith the foe. He binds the slain Hector to his chariot, trails the\ncorpse in fell hunter's fashion three times round the walls of Troy;\nyet stays his anger when the old Priam comes to his tent, and, as he\nthinks within his heart of his own old father, reaches to the weeping\nking the hand which has done to death his son. Of Achilles we may\nwell exclaim: \"here is a man indeed, and human nature, ay, noble\nhuman too, in all the length and breadth of its riches, is unveiled\nbefore us in this one man!\" It is just the same with all the other\nHomeric characters\u2014-Odysseus, Diomedes, Ajax, Agamemnon, Hector,\nAndromache--every one of them is a whole, a world in itself, a complete\nand living member of humanity, something very different at least from\nyour allegorical abstract of some one particular trait. What frosty,\nfaded personalities, despite all their vigour and rigour, are the\nhorned Siegfried, Hagen of Troy, nay, even Volker, the musician, in\ncomparison.\nIt is this variety of characterization, and this alone, which can give\nto a character the interest of life. At the same time this fulness of\ndetail must really appear as included in the personality itself, that\nis, it must not strike us as the mere diversion, passing freak, or\nsuggestion of an excited fancy, such as we see in the case of children\nwho will take up everything in turn, and even make something out of it,\nyet, for all that, are without essential character. Character in this\nlatter sense will penetrate and make itself a home in the most diverse\nphases of the emotional life of man, will steep itself to overflowing\nwith that abundance, and, at the same time, not remain thus immersed,\nbut throughout all the congeries of interest, objects, qualities, all\nthe traits that distinguish or arrest it, maintain the form of its\nself-exclusive and alert subjectivity intact.\nFor the representation of such exhaustive types of character epic\npoetry is, above all others, adapted, dramatic and lyrical poetry are\nless so.\n(_\u03b2_) Art, however, will not be content to remain at the point which\nthe course of our inquiry has reached, namely, the notion of character\nas a mere congeries of traits. For the object we have before us now is\nthe Ideal in its specific determination, and singularity, or, rather,\nconcrete _individuality_, are both of them prominent and necessary\nfeatures. Action, more than anything else, in its conflict and reaction\nis impossible without some restriction and clear definition of form.\nFor this reason the heroes of dramatic poetry are for the most part of\nsimpler definition than those of epic poetry. And the way we get at a\nclear definition is through some pathos out of the ordinary which is\nso portrayed as to make some essential trait of character stand out\nin bold relief, and itself to be the stimulus to particular objects,\nresolves, and actions. If, however, this simplification is carried so\nfar that any character appears as though it were pared down to a mere\nshadow-like semblance of any form of pathos, such as love or honour,\nall real vitality and spiritual depth must necessarily vanish, and the\nrepresentation, as is not unfrequently the case in the French school\nof drama for this very reason, can only offer us a cold and jejune\nresult. We may therefore conclude that in this aspect of particularity\nthe prominent feature which asserts itself pre-eminently will be this,\nthat within the borders of this very limitation the fulness of life\nis completely preserved, so that the personality in question has free\nscope allowed it for further expansion in many directions, a power to\nadapt itself to every variety of situation, and, in short, is able to\nunfold and express in every possible way the wealth of a truly complete\nspiritual life[361]. Despite the supreme simplicity of their pathos the\ncharacters in the Sophoclean drama possess this intrinsic vitality. We\nmay indeed compare them in their plastic self-seclusion to the figures\nof sculpture. For it is also quite possible that sculpture express\nvery various delineations of character despite all the tenacity of its\ndefinition. In contrast to the bluster of overpowering passion, which\nconcentrates all its forces upon one single point, it exhibits out of\nits tranquillity and speechlessness that predominant neutrality, which\npeacefully envelops all powers within itself; but this unperturbed\nunity does not, however, persist in any indissoluble union with mere\nformal definition, but, rather, in virtue of its beauty, suffers at\nthe same time the birth-throes of all that pertains to it to disrobe\nitself as through a cloud of immediate possibility into fresh relations\nof every variety. In the finest figures of sculpture we behold a\ntranquil depth, which unfolds, as it were, the pregnant womb, from\nwhich all other potencies may be born. In contrast with sculpture it\nis yet of more vital importance to the arts of painting, music, and\npoetry, that they should display the inmost complexity of character,\nand real artists of every age have recognized this. In Shakespeare's\n\"Romeo and Juliet,\" for example, the most pathetic characteristic of\nRomeo is his love: but he is also placed before us under relations of\nthe greatest contrast, whether it be in reference to his parents, his\nfriends, his love troubles, or his affair of honour in which he fights\nwith Tybalt, his attitude of deference and trust to the monk, nay, even\non the verge of the grave his conversation with the apothecary, from\nwhom he purchases the poison. Throughout he is the same worthy and\nnoble man of deep emotions. In the same way the character of Juliet\nis unfolded throughout the range of her relations to father, mother,\nnurse, the Count Paris, and father Lawrence. And, despite of this, she\nis as deeply immersed[362] in her one preoccupation as she is in every\none of these situations, and her entire character is transpierced with\nand carried away by the one single emotion, her passionate love for her\nlover, which is as deep and broad as the unbounded sea, so that it is\nbut the simple truth when she exclaims, \"The more I give, the more I\npossess, both are infinite.\"\nFrom all this it appears that even when there is but one pathos\nvisible, it must unfold itself as the wealth of all it possesses. And\nthis is what really happens even in lyrical poetry, where we find the\npathos is not attached to actions determined by positive circumstances\nand conditions. For in this latter case the pathos can only assert\nitself as the spiritual state of an emotional nature otherwise complete\nin itself, which is, that is to say, free to express itself in any\nother conceivable circumstance and situation which may confront it.\nThe use of words of vital significance, an imagination which can\nassociate itself with all the world, can restore the Past to the\nPresent, can transform the entire external environment of man's life\nto a symbolical expression of his spirit, can bravely adventure into\nthe depths of comprehensive thought, and, while doing so, reveal an\nexuberant, capacious, clear, exalted, and noble nature--a wealth of\ncharacter such as this, freely expressing such a world, is a prize\nindeed for the Lyric Muse. No doubt a purely logical reflection may\nfind it impossible that such, variety of character should co-exist\nwith a masterful clearness of type. We may be asked, for instance,\nin reference to the heroic character of Achilles, whose strength of\nyouth is the pre-eminent, trait of his beauty, how it is possible to\nreconcile the tender heart so manifest in his relations to his father\nand his friend with the cruel act of revenge wherewith he drags Hector\nround the walls. Precisely the same kind of inconsequence is to be met\nwith in Shakespeare's clowns. They are, with scarcely an exception,\nbubbling over with wit and the humour of genius. And, no doubt, there\nwill always be fools enough to ask us how men thus spiritually gifted\ncould ever betake themselves to such tomfooleries. The truth is that\nthe reflection of the formal logic is sure to emphasize one aspect\nof a character, and conclude that the entire man is minted under its\nimpression to the exclusion of all others. To such everything that\nasserts itself as alien to the hallmark of its beggarly mintage can\nonly appear as an inconsequence. In the truely rational contemplation\nof the whole as distinct from the parts, and thereby of the living\nthing, that which appears as inconsequent will be precisely that which\nbrings all into fit co-ordination. For our humanity is just this\nvery paradox. We have not merely to carry[363] the contradictions of\nour complex nature, but to suffer the load[363] with patience, and\nthroughout prove staunch to our burden.\n(_\u03b3_) We may conclude, then, that character must fuse together\nits particularity in the element of its spiritual substance; it\nshould possess a definite type, and at the same time retain in this\ndistinction the force and stability of a _single_ fully self-consistent\npathos. Where we find our humanity represented without such a centre\nof unity, the different aspects of such variety it may possess\nwill lose all relative meaning or significance and fall away from\neach other. In art we shall find that what we distinguish in our\nconception of personality as infinite or the Divine is just this\nself-consistency in unity. If this view be a just one it is obvious\nthat such characterizations as stability and determination are of\ngreat importance in the ideal representation of character. And we\nshall only obtain such a result, as already observed, in so far as the\nuniversality of the powers inherent in our humanity are permitted to\ntranspierce the mere particularity of the individual character and, by\nvirtue of the unity thus set up, create a subjective and at the same\ntime individual life which supplies its own principle of unity and\nself-identity.\nSuch a condition is all important, and we must now advert to a number\nof artistic compositions, more particularly of later times, in express\nrelation to it.\nIn the \"Cid\" of Corneille, for example, the collision between the\nopposing principles of love and honour is a match, no doubt, of\nbrilliant effects. A pathos of this kind, involved as it is in the\nopposition of distinct forces may, no doubt, be the operative ground of\nconflicts; but when we find such portrayed as the spiritual struggle\nof one and the same character, though such antagonism may very readily\nsupply us with the material for brilliant rhetoric and effective\nmonologue, the cataclysm which is here presented in the emotional life\nof one person driven thus by turns from its abstract subjection to\nhonour into the equally abstract one of love, and forthwith hounded\nback again, is not favourable to the portrayal of a character of\ngenuine stability and homogeneousness.\nIt is equally inconsistent with the delineation of resolute personality\nwhen a leading character, already under the predominant influence\nof some specific pathos, is portrayed as one overmastered by the\ndirection or persuasion of a subordinate character, such is thus\nenabled to shift the responsibility upon other shoulders. This is\nwhat actually takes place in the \"Phedra\" of Racine when the mind\nof Phedra is depicted as entirely motived by the words of Oenone. A\ncharacter of real distinction acts out of its own initiative, and will\nnot suffer the views of a mere stranger to be that which determines\nits own resolution. Only when action is the direct result of its own\nreflections do we get that clear relation between personal initiative\nand the consequent result which carries with it the full weight of\nguilt or responsibility.\nWe find yet another type of this instability of character as quite a\npeculiar possession of the more recent literary output of Germany. It\nis a type of character in which a kind of flatulence in emotion is\nthe rule no less than the source. The classic example is the Werther\nof Goethe's romance, a thoroughly morbid type of character, without\nany vestige of real manliness such as might carry him beyond the\negotism of his love-passion. What makes him interesting is the passion\nand beauty of his emotional life, the intimate fellowship between\nhimself and Nature which the course of his spiritual experience and\nthe pliability of his temperament accentuate. This effeminacy has yet\nmore recently embodied itself in many other forms of expression which\ndescend with increasing rapidity to the lowest circle of jejune and\ntasteless egotism. We must not even omit, for instance, to include\nin our list that illustration of the lovely soul which we find in\nJacobi's \"Woldemar.\" In this romance we are made a present of the\nglory of emotional volubility in all its pretensions. It would be\ndifficult, indeed, to cite a better example of the self-deceptive\nillusion of personal virtue and excellence. Here we have all that\nsublimity and divinity of soul, which relates itself crookedly to every\npossible aspect of the actual world; that type of feebleness which is\nwholly unable to share in or tolerate any portion of the labours or\ninterests of practical life as it really is. So rooted is it in its\nown consciousness of superiority it passes everything as unworthy of\nit on the other side. It is, in fact, a peculiar feature of this type\nof \"lovely soul\" that, even when face to face with the truly ethical\ninterests and wholly sane objects of life, instead of meeting them\nfrankly, it retires into the seclusion of itself, where it weaves its\nown threads of finery and passes its time in hatching out its exquisite\nbrood of religious and moral reflections. And connected closely with\nthis personal enthusiasm for our superabundant excellence, which we set\nforth in front of ourselves with such a brave show, there will always\nbe an intense sensitiveness for all other beings who may appear at any\nmoment to sympathize with, comprehend, and appreciate this beauty of\nthe solitary life. If such fellow-feeling is not forthcoming we find\nthe very heart of us troubled to its depths and infinitely bruised.\nWe have lost at one stroke all humanity, friendship, and love. We are\nunable to put away with whatever act of pedantry or rudeness may be in\nquestion, some trivial circumstance or stupidity over which the vision\nof any character of breadth or strength would pass without a tremor. It\nwhirls away the thought of everything else, and that which is by itself\nof least significance proves to be that which finally most reduces us\nto despair. Such is the source of all that endless train of melancholy,\ntrouble, heartache, peevishness, sickness, dejection, and poverty\nof spirit which follows, such the spring of all those self-torturing\nreflections one on the top of another, that cramp and obstinacy, nay,\nfinally, that cruelty of soul, through which the wretchedness and\nweakness of the spiritual content of such a type, of \"loveliness\"\nconsummates and declares itself. No heart that is truly sound can\nwish to unite itself with such an emotional hermitage. For it is a\nfundamental characteristic of all genuine character that it carries\nwithin itself both the courage and the strength to do and to will some\nactual thing. The interest, therefore, that such natures which are for\never revolving round themselves may arouse in us is after all an empty\ninterest, and necessarily so despite all the conviction with which such\nnatures may assure us that they belong to a higher and purer sphere\nthan our own, a sphere which has revealed to our vision that peculiar\ntype of the Divine they have uncovered from their secret parts and\nfinally present to us, to borrow an apt figure, _en neglig\u00e9e._\nThis want of genuine solidity of character appears in yet another form\nwhere we find the particular manifestations of this world of \"fine\nfeelings\" turned as it were upside down and hypostatized as independent\nforces. Much that passes for magic, magnetism, spiritualism, the\napparitions of _clairvoyance_, the morbid condition of sleep-walking,\nis attributable to this source. The living person in question is\nplaced in a relation to these abstruse powers, which from one point\nof view identifies him with them, and in another makes them appear as\nsomething foreign to his spiritual life, which determines and controls\nit. It is assumed that underlying these undefined forces there is some\ninexplicable truth which borders on the marvellous, or at any rate\npasses comprehension. From the world of art, however, all such powers\nof darkness should be banished. In art there is no darkness at all, but\nall is lucid and transparent, and in adventuring after such types of\nmyopy speech merely flounders into spiritual disease, or plays loose as\npoetry with the nebulous, empty, and trivial, a good example of which\nis the verse of Hoffmann, and that piece by Henry von Klust entitled\nthe \"Prince of Homburg.\" The truly ideal character has nothing in his\ncomposition, or the pathos which expresses it, of another world and its\nghosts, but only actual interests, in which he finds himself at home.\nMore particularly is this feature of _clairvoyance_ become a trivial\nand vulgar recipe of our more modern poets. In Schiller's \"Tell,\" on\nthe contrary, when the old Attinghausen on the brink of the grave\nforetells the destiny of his country, the prophetic instinct is quite\nin its right place. It is always, however, a misfortune for an artist\nto find himself forced to exchange the sanity of a character with some\nmalady of the soul whether it be to motive the collision or excite\ninterest. For this reason he should only avail himself of the condition\nof insanity in quite exceptional cases.\nIn conclusion we may connect with these distortions of a sane\nvision, which are so much opposed to all real unity and consistency\nof character, the principle of our latter-day irony. This false\ntheory has betrayed the poet into grafting upon his characters\nqualities so essentially diverse that they are incapable of all\nhomogeneous relation; the essential unity of every character is thus\nconfounded. According to this theory a character is first presented\nas characterized in a certain way, and immediately after we have that\nvery determination converted into its opposite, and the character\nitself is propounded to us as nothing more than the negation of what\nit was and is. Moreover this very futility is accepted by this irony\nas the supreme discovery of art. An audience should not, in short,\nbe carried away by an essentially positive interest, but should be\npulled up at the critical moment, much as the irony itself is no\nsooner launched upon anything than it is off again. They would even\nexplain the characters of Shakespeare according to such a principle.\nWe are informed that Lady Macbeth was an irreproachable wife of the\ntenderest feeling, despite the fact that she not only falls in with\nthe suggestion of the murder, but actually eggs her husband on to\nits execution. But if the signet mark of Shakespeare is conspicuous\non any one quality it is on the firm and decisive delineation of his\ncharacters, even when it is only the formal greatness and consistency\nof evil that is in question. Hamlet, it is true, is a case of mental\nindecision, but even he is only in doubt as to the way he shall carry\nout his purpose, not at all as to what has to be done. Yet nowadays\nthey would assimilate even Shakespeare's characters to a world of\nghosts, and appear to think that this futility and indecision of ups\nand downs, this general squeamishness[364] in short can by itself\ncontribute to our interest. The Ideal, however, is centred in this,\nthat Idea is made _actual_, and our humanity is associated with such\nactuality as subject and consequently as a unity which is essentially\nfirm-rooted.\nWe may here, so far at least as this portion of our inquiry is\nconcerned, bring our observations upon the individuality which is\nconsistent with real character to a close. That which we have mainly\nsought to emphasize is a pathos which is at once self-determined and\nessential, the possession of a rich and complete nature, the spiritual\nworld of which such a pathos transfuses under such a form that this\nprocess of transfusion no less than the pathos itself receives its\nartistic presentment. At the same time this pathos must not be allowed\nto come into conflict with itself in the hearts of men so as to\nstultify its very nature and consistency as pathos.\nIII. THE EXTERNAL DETERMINATION OF THE IDEAL\nOur consideration of the determination of the Ideal was in the _first_\ninstance occupied with the general inquiry why it was and how it came\nabout that the Ideal ever received at all the definite embodiment of\na particular form. Following after this we arrived at the conclusion\nthat inherent process was essential to our notion of it, that in fact\nthe element of difference was only by this means asserted within it,\nand that this process viewed as a whole is presented us in the action.\nWe discovered, however, that in virtue of the action the Ideal passes\nover into actual relations with the external world; we have therefore,\nand this is the _third_ important step, to solve the further question\nwhat kind of form this its final aspect, as associated with external\nreality, the Ideal will receive under adequate artistic representation.\nWe would recall the fact that the Ideal is the Idea under a form which\nis in union with its own _actuality._ Up to the present point of our\ninquiry our attention has been exclusively occupied with that aspect\nor phase of this actuality which we may call in general terms human\nindividuality and its character. Man is, however, also in possession of\na concrete and _external existence._ In separation from this it is true\nhe concentrates his spiritual life to a point in self-consciousness,\nbut he remains for all that, even in this subjective unity, immediately\nrelated to the external world. To the actual existence of mankind the\nsurrounding sphere of a world is as indispensable as the protection of\na temple is to the statues of the god it contains. And for this very\nreason we must now advert to all or some of those many diverse threads,\nwhereby the Ideal is woven in with this external environment and is\nshown in relief against it[365].\nThis opens to our view a practically immeasurable expanse of relations\nand modes under which the process of the external and relative world\nis determined. For in the first place we are confronted at once\nwith the bare facts of external Nature such as particular locality,\nsituation, whether habitable or not, temporal condition, the nature of\nthe prevailing climate, whether in our earth's northern or southern\nhemispheres, and in fact in whatever direction we advance we have a\nfresh picture before us. Moreover, external Nature is made use of by\nman to satisfy his own needs and purposes; and all the ways under\nwhich he converts her to that use, that is to say the adroitness with\nwhich he discovers and then equips himself with tools and a home to\nlive in, with weapons, with seats to recline upon, carriages to ride\nin, nay, all that the art of cooking may bring with it for his food,\nthe entire apparatus of his luxury no less than his comfort, all this\nand much more fall within the limits of our inquiry. Add to this the\nfurther and yet more important consideration that every man lives\nwithin a comprehensive and equally real world of spiritual relations,\nwhich itself, too, presents to his view all the different modes under\nwhich command and submission is maintained, that is to say the family,\nblood-relationship, property, country and town life, the _cultus_ of\nreligion, the organization of defence and offence, civic and political\nassociations, private society, in short every conceivable form under\nwhich ethical customs and usages are organized in the institutions and\npermanent activities which contribute to the actual environment of\nhuman existence.\nIn all the directions enumerated above the Ideal is in immediate\ncontact with the reality of the practical world in its everyday dress,\nor in other words, with the commonplace prose of life. And impressed by\nthis fact we may easily be led to the conclusion, if we have already\naccepted the nebulous conception of idealism elaborated recently,\nthat art can have no alternative but to dissever herself absolutely\nfrom all connection with this world of relative appearances. Such at\nleast can only be logically inferred from a theory which assumes that\nthis relation of externality is one of pure indifference, or rather,\nin contrast to the subjective world of spirit, is of no substantive\nsignificance or worth. Agreeably to this view art is a spiritual\ndominion, whose sole object is to exalt us above the sphere of material\nwants, necessities, and dependence, and to liberate us from the\nlogic, and we may add the comedy, of facts, which in this field claim\nthe exclusive attention of our humanity. For, apart from any other\nconsideration, all that meets us upon this _terra firma_ of life's\nprose is for the most part of a purely conventional character, and,\nconditioned as it is by time, space, and custom, simply a congeries\nof contingent facts, which it is derogatory to the nature of art to\naccept. This view of ideality, which is really an illusive one, is\nin part due to one of those highly flavoured abstractions of our\nlatter-day thinking, in which we merely find that the thinker's courage\nhas failed him to come to terms with the external world in question;\nin part also it is due to that type of prepossession which drives a\nman to assert summarily his independence of practical necessities\nwhen the advantages of birth, status, and social position have not\nalready effected this for him. For such a man the only relief available\nis a complete withdrawal into the secret world of the emotions, a\nprison-house of unreality he steps out of never. Here he remains\nin what he conceives to be the temple of wisdom gazing ecstatic at\nwhat he takes to be the stars, and naturally values at the price of\na nutshell all that is found on the Earth. The real Ideal, however,\nis not confined to the shadow-like world of the emotions, but in its\nperfected whole must freely borrow from the definite structure of\nexternal objects of sight in every direction. And the reason of this\nis that man himself, whose nature is the central source that gives\nto that Ideal all its significance, is alive, and his life is only\nactual in a particular place and time, as one with the Present, as the\nindividualized type of infinity[366]; and in short the opposition of\nan external garland of Nature is a fundamental characteristic of his\nlife and its association with him and his activity is imperative. It\nfollows that if this activity is to be apprehended by art, not merely\nas belonging to man alone, but in the specific form it may take in\nthat world of appearance, the mode of its existence there will assert\nitself, as the mobility, reaction, and animating force of life itself\nin contact and transfusion with the material complex which surrounds it.\nMan is, however, in virtue of his self-consciousness a world in\nhimself[367], and as such is differentiated from the external world of\nNature which confronts him; and this external world is equally with\nhimself a rounded whole whose unity asserts itself in the principle of\ncausality. This self-exclusion of these two worlds is, however, only\napparent; they are in their separation essentially related, and it is\nprecisely this association which constitutes concrete reality, whose\nartistic embodiment is the content of the Ideal. And this brings us\nonce more to the question already mooted, namely, in what semblance or\nform the external material which we find in this mutually related world\nwe have referred to as concrete reality[368] can be presented to us by\nart in a manner consistent with the Ideal of art.\nWe will once more accept the triple division of our subject-matter,\nand examine a work of art from three distinct points of view. _First_,\nthere is the material of externality accepted in the bare abstractness\nof its forms, such as space, figure, time, colour, which we must\nconsider relatively to the artistic form most adapted to it.\n_Secondly_, we must consider externality in its full and actualized\nconcreteness, as above explained, a mode of reality which imperatively\nrequires in a work of art that it should be in close affiliation with\nthe subjective content of the spiritual life of man immediately related\nto it.\n_Thirdly_, our consideration will be directed to the important fact\nthat a work of art is created for the delight of human perceptions, for\na public in short, which justly claims that the objects of art should\nbring home to it the interests of its spiritual life, its real beliefs,\nemotions, and ideas, so that it may enter with a genuine response into\ntheir artistic presentation.\n1. THE CONDITION OF EXTERNALITY IN ITS SIMPLE ABSTRACTNESS\nThe Ideal in passing out of the bare image of its essential form into\nexternal or determinate existence secures for itself a reality which\npresents two distinct aspects. From one point of view we see that a\nwork of art discloses necessarily in the content of the Ideal the\nconcrete semblance of reality, that is to say it presents that content\nas a definite situation or particular circumstance, action, event or\ncharacter, and presents it moreover in the mode of external existence.\nFrom another it is equally obvious that art makes some specific and\nsensuous material the vehicle of the particular content in its entirety\nof all that we have above summarized; it creates in short a new world\nsensible to eye and ear, the world of art. Under both these aspects\nwe may further observe that art penetrates to the remotest limits of\nexternality which are compatible with its form as the self-including\nunity of the Ideal and conformable to its appearance as a concrete\nwhole permeated with the energy of spirit[369]. A work of art moreover\nitself may, as an object qualified by externality, be viewed in two\ndistinct ways. We may regard it simply as an external thing, and as\nsuch only conformable to a unity that is external in the sense external\nobjects are such. In considering it from this latter point of view\nwe have once more to consider that relation of externality which\nwe found it necessary to discuss in our examination of the beauty\nof Nature. And for this reason we shall again have to make use of\nthose specific determinants which we previously discussed, and even\nthen primarily in their connection with art. The modes under which\nexternal form was in the previous section exhaustively considered were\nthen treated in a twofold way. First we analysed such conceptions as\nuniformity, symmetry, and conformity to rule; we then examined unity\nitself regarded as the simplicity and purity of the sensuous material,\nwhich art makes use of as the external medium for the existence of her\nexpositions.\n(_a_) We will start our inquiry by examining the position in which we\nnow find ourselves relatively to such conceptions as uniformity and\nsymmetry. It is obvious that these, expressing as they do the entirely\nlifeless unity of the geometrical logic, can by no means exhaust the\nnature of a work of art even when entirely regarded as an external\nobject. Such determinations are only exhaustive in their relation\nto what is in itself lifeless, such as time and the configuration\nof space. Confined in this way though they be to the barest forms\nof externality, they are then true witnesses both to the power and\nsubstance of reason. And consequently we find they assert themselves in\na twofold manner even in art. In the first of these, it is this very\nquality of their abstractness which operates by way of contrast to\nthe living pulse of art, which is forced even in the confines of its\nsensuous material to raise itself over and beyond mere symmetry into\nthe freedom of the Ideal. In this process of liberation which may be\nexemplified in the melodies of the art of music we do not, however,\nfind that the conformity to rule disappears altogether, it is merely\nmade subservient as a foundation. In the second, this principle of\nmeasure and rule in its application to the indefinite and unlimited is\nthe one and only qualifying principle which certain arts can accept\nowing to the nature of the media which those arts make use of. In such\ncases uniformity is itself and alone raised to the ideal significance\nof the art. The principal example of an art of this type is that of\narchitecture; and the reason of this is that a work of art which is\nwholly architectonic is directed to the one object of reconstituting,\nby means of an artistic form, that which is essentially the external\nand inorganic environment of spirit. In this art, consequently, all\nthat is rectilinear, right-angled, circular, or presents uniformity of\npillars, windows, arches, piers, vaults, and so forth is the dominant\nprinciple of unity.\nThe artistic structure of architecture is not erected entirely as an\nobject in itself, but rather as an external frame, embellishment and\nlocal habitation for something else which it subserves. A building\nis not complete until it has received the statue of the god or the\nsociety of human beings who make their dwelling therein. An artistic\nwork of this kind should not therefore receive all or indeed the main\nattention. Holding this in our minds, it will appear obviously to the\npurpose that uniformity and symmetry should be here the prevailing\ncharacteristic of the structure; the mind passes over very readily one\nthat is throughout uniform, and will not trouble itself about it for\nany length of time. Of course, we cannot here discuss the symbolical\nsignificance, which, in addition to that above examined, may attach to\narchitectural form in its immediate relation to the spiritual content\nit envelops and emphasizes with a positive localization. The same\nprinciple applies to the art of making gardens, which we may define\nas a specific mode of architecture, in so far at least as an artistic\nconformation is imposed on external Nature[370]. In the garden no less\nthan in the building man himself is the main object. There are two\ndistinct types in this art of garden-construction. The one adopts as\nits main principle uniformity and symmetry; the other those of variety\nand irregularity. As an artistic product the former is to be preferred.\nLabyrinths, however numerous and intricate, garden-beds in endless\nalternation of spiral lines, bridges over water usually stagnant,\nwith every conceivable surprise that gothic church, temples, Chinese\npagodas, hermitages, urns, summer-houses, mounds, statues may claim to\nafford us--one glance and only one glance at such things is sufficient,\nthe vulgar and artificial pretensions of it all is too patent, and we\ndo not seek for another. It is quite another matter when we cross any\nactual situation of real natural beauty, which has not at least been\nexploited expressly for our enjoyment[371], and by its own exceptional\nmerit makes an irresistible appeal to our love of Nature and our\nsense of her beauty. A garden laid out with strict reference to the\nother extreme of regularity, makes no such attempts at surprises, but\npermits human beings to appear as the principal object in the external\nframework of natural beauty[372]. And this is really what a garden\nshould be. Again in the art of painting the principle of uniformity\nand symmetry is clearly visible in the co-ordination of the whole, the\ngrouping of the figures, their place and pose in the composition. But\ninasmuch as in painting the animation of life can assert itself through\nobjects in a far profounder degree than is possible in architecture\nwe find that it presents much less scope for the purely formal unity\nof the symmetrical, and the rule of uniformity in all its severity is\nfor the most part to be traced only as the fundamental principle of\ncomposition in the earliest phases of art, making way in its more\nadvanced forms to the freer line, which is associated in our minds\nwith organic form rather than such we meet with in the pyramid and\nsimilar geometrical shapes. Conformity to rule and symmetry are further\nimportant factors in the composition of music and poetry. Owing to\nthe incident of duration in the length of tones we find in these arts\nan aspect of what is intrinsically a purely external relation, which\nis incompatible with any other more concrete mode of presentation.\nIf we take the spatial condition it is obvious that here everything\nwhich lies in juxtaposition can be seen at a glance. It is otherwise\nwith that which occurs in Time. Here we have merely a succession\nof moments, every one of which takes the place of another, and in\nthis vanishing procession they flow on for ever. And it is precisely\nthis indeterminacy which it is the function of musical time or beat\nto inform by adding thereto a real definition capable of uniform\nrepetition. In this way the indefinite progression is subordinated to\na rational principle. In musical time we have a power which exerts\nsuch a fascination upon us, that, so far from being able to treat it\nwith indifference, we not unfrequently find ourselves beating time\nquite unconsciously with it while listening. This constant recurrence\nof equal lengths of time according to a definite measure has nothing\nto do with tones and their duration as we find them in Nature. Tone\nsimply as musical sound and time abstractly regarded, are both of them\nequally indifferent to such uniform divisions and repetitions. Musical\ntime is consequently something wholly created by the human mind; and\nindeed there is more than a suggestion of this in the fact that in\nlistening to musical time we are at once impressed with the conviction,\nthat we have, in this control of time according to fixed rule, nothing\nless than a real reflection of our spiritual nature, or rather that\nof the fundamental truth of self-identity, an illustration absolutely\nprecise of the way in which the subject of consciousness applies this\nvery principle of uniformity, unity with itself, that is to say, in\nconstant recurrence, throughout all the variety and most intricate\nmultiplicity of experience. And it is for this reason that the beat of\nmusical time meets with such a startling response in the very depths of\nour being, gripping hold, as it does, of that self-identity, which is\nthe fundamental abstract principle of our inmost life. Considered in\nthis relation it is not; the spiritual content, not the concrete soul\nof our emotions, any more than it is the musical tone as tone, which\nappeals to us so intimately; it is simply the formal unity which the\nunity of consciousness transfers to the temporal process, and which is\nthus re-echoed back to our conscious life. And the same remarks apply\nto the measure and rhyme of poetry. The sensuous medium is here, too,\nin the same way carried out of the sphere of that which is external to\nourselves, and at once asserts there the presence of something over and\nabove that which is expressed by our ordinary consciousness, which in\nits general use treats the time-divisions of tones with indifference or\ncaprice.\nA uniformity of similar character, if not so consistently defined,\nmay be traced still further, and is involved in the living content of\npoetry itself, although the relation here is quite an external one.\nBy this we mean that in an epic poem or a drama, both of which have\ntheir particular subdivisions, cantos, or acts, whatever may be the\nspecific term applicable, there is an approximate principle of equality\napparent in the division of subject-matter. And the same characteristic\nis generally true in the grouping of the subject in pictures, although\nsuch should not appear to be a necessary result of the nature of the\nsubject-matter itself, nor create the impression that this uniform\ndistribution is due to any controlling principle of first importance.\nConformity to rule and symmetry, which are the abstract unity and\ndefinition of all that is essentially spatial and its configuration no\nless than of all which is external under temporal condition, are mainly\nthe co-ordinating principles of quantity and size, as we have already\nnoticed in our consideration of the beauty of Nature. All that which\ndoes not, in virtue of its own specific medium[373], strictly form part\nof external extension, is consequently freed from the range of those\nprinciples which assert themselves exclusively in the relations of\nquantity, and are determined through relations of deeper significance,\nand the unity which co-ordinates them. It follows from this that\nthe further art embraces subject-matter which is independent of the\nexternal condition, so much the less significant the principle of\nuniformity becomes, in the co-ordination of that art's subject-matter\nand the more completely is it restricted to a subordinate position.\nIt will be, perhaps, advisable here to close the above discussion\nof symmetry with a few general observations upon _harmony_. The\nrelation of harmony is no longer one to mere quantity, but rather one\nto essential distinctions of _quality_, differences of tone, that\nis to say, which do not persist against each other in their native\nopposition, but as harmony or music have to be brought into concord.\nIn music we find that the relation of the tonic to the mediant and\ndominant notes of the scale is no relation of bare quantity[374],\nbut implies the presence of tones whose difference is _essentially_\na qualitative difference; which, that is to say, combine naturally\nin a unity, rather than continue to assert their distinguishing\n_timbre_ in all its glaring antithesis and contradiction. The true\ndiscord, on the contrary, requires its harmonic resolution. The same\nqualitative consistency is to be found in the harmony of colour, in\nreference to which it is likewise one of the requirements of art\nthat it should neither manifest itself in a picture as a motley and\nhaphazard juxtaposition of pigments, nor as a neutral surface whereon\nall fundamental distinction is dissolved[375], but as the artistic\nexpression of a whole in which essential contrast is mediated through\nsome principle of harmonious unity. Furthermore, we observe that\nharmony contains in itself a definite number of contrasted differences,\nwhich have naturally a particular significance of their own. Thus we\nfind under the differentiation of colour a definite number known as\nthe cardinal colours, which are primary derivatives of the fundamental\nnotion of colour, and are not due to accidental composition. Harmony\nconsists in bringing together a number of positive colours such as this\nclassification implies, and uniting them in concordant unity. We must,\nthat is to say, have in a picture not merely all the primary colours,\nyellow, blue, green, and red present, but also a harmonious scheme\nunder which they are related; and the old masters have, without direct\nconsciousness of the principle involved, paid express attention to this\ncompleteness of effect and arrived at artistic results which flowed out\nof it. And furthermore, for the very reason that we find in harmony\nthe beginnings of a release from the bare condition of externality it\nis duly qualified to absorb and express a spiritual content of wider\nsignificance. We may mark an illustration of this in the way the old\nmasters distinguished between the drapery of their principal figures\nand of those of less importance, painting that of the former in\nelementary colours of absolute purity, but only conceding to that of\nthe rest compound varieties. The mantle of the Virgin Mary is almost\nalways blue; blue in its assuaging sense of tranquillity is accepted as\nthe counterfeit of the repose and tenderness of the heart. It is only\nrarely that we find her in a drapery of emphatic red.\n(_b_) The second aspect of externality is the relation it occupies\ndirectly in the various material which art employs in the various media\nof its presentations. The unity here consists in the clear definition\nand homogeneousness of the material, which ought not to deviate\nin the direction of a vague characterization and mere confusion,\nor, speaking generally, give us the impression of dirtiness. This\ndeterminacy is also entirely dependent upon the spatial condition,\nthat is to say, upon the purity of its delineation, the distinctness\nof its rectilinear and circular lines, and so on, no less than upon a\nconsistent definition of Time such as we find in the accurate measure\nof the musical beat. It depends furthermore on the translucency both\nof specific tones and colours. In a good picture we shall find that\nthere is nothing unclean or \"dirty\"[376] in the colours employed,\nbut everything is clear and asserts itself openly for what it is.\nThe directness of its purity is, in fact, that which constitutes the\nlovely impression of colour upon our sense; and those colours which\nare most direct in their simplicity, such as a yellow which has no dash\nof green in it, or a red that is wholly independent of blue or yellow,\nproduce the most emphatic effect. On the other hand, it is obviously\nmore difficult to maintain a harmony of the whole when colours are thus\ncontrasted in all their pristine simplicity. Yet in despite of this\nthese essentially simple colours form the foundation of every true\ncolour scheme, and although it may be impossible to dispense with a\nconsiderable use of their compounds, even these should not be allowed\nto appear in one dead and dull interfusion, but with their simple and\nluminous derivations shining through them[377]; otherwise instead of\nthe clear lambency of colour we shall get nothing but a muddy residuum.\nWe shall find that the same thing is necessary in the _timbre_ of\nmusical tone. In the case of strings whether of metal or catgut it is\nthe vibration of the material, and, moreover, of a material of definite\ntension and length, which educes the musical note. If the tension is\ninsufficient, or the length of the string which is struck is not the\nright one, the tone inevitably loses its clearness of definition,\nrings false, as we say, owing to the interfusion with it of other\ntones[378]. We have the same kind of result when a purely mechanical\nfretting or scraping is suffered to interfere with the purity of the\nvibratory motion, and so to render the emitted sound confused and\nharsh. In the same way, it is of the first importance to the art of\nsinging that the human voice should be produced from throat and chest\nfreely and with purest intonation; the voice should be heard without\nthe least indication of its organic instrument, or, as in the case\nof hoarseness, with an obstructive accompaniment the singer fails to\nrepress. We may conclude, then, that this translucency and purity,\nfree from all admixture with anything foreign to it, and consistent\nthroughout in its clearness, is that which creates the beauty of tone\nas immediately apprehended by our senses, and which distinguishes\nit from every kind of mere noise. And we may add further it is this\nwhich in human speech conspicuously applies to the articulation of the\nvowels. A language which enunciates the five vowels with distinction\nand purity, as is strongly the case in the Italian, is essentially\nmusical and adapted to song. The diphthongs, on the contrary, always\nproduce a confused tone. In literature little attention is paid to\nthe direct reproduction of folk-dialects; we find them rather reduced\nto the simplest form of expression. In actual speech, however, this\nclearness of intonation only too often entirely disappears, so that we\nfind, and markedly so in the case of dialects such as the South German,\nSwabian, and Swiss, men actually speak with an articulation of sound\nit is quite impossible to write down. We do not regard this, however,\nto be necessarily a defect in human speech, but rather a reflection of\nthe rawness of the common folk. And here we must close our observations\nupon that external aspect of art, which, from the fact that it is\nexternal, and nothing more, is only capable of receiving an external\nand abstract unity.\nNow according to its more comprehensive definition it is the _concrete\nindividuality_ of the Ideal impregnated with reason, which takes to\nitself externality as the form of its embodiment, and, moreover, in\nsuch a way that the external semblance, which is thus the medium of\nits expression, is throughout suffused with the mind inherent in this\nconcrete individual form. In consequence of this such modes of relation\nas uniformity, symmetry, and harmony, or, in other words, the more\nsimple determinations of the sensuous material are no longer adequate.\nThis defect naturally extends our inquiry to that second aspect of the\nexternal determination of the Ideal already stated.\n2. THE COALESCENCE OF THE CONCRETE IDEAL WITH ITS EXTERNAL REALITY\nThe fundamental truth which we shall endeavour to substantiate before\neverything in the matter which now immediately engages our attention is\nthis, that man is under an obligation to make himself at peace and at\nhome in the environment of the world; or, to put it rather differently,\nhis individuality must live itself into Nature and all the conditions\nof that external world, and by doing so assert its freedom visibly.\nAnd, moreover, this must take place in such a way that these two\nrelated factors, that is, on the one side, the entirety of his inward\nlife and the character it possesses or displays in all conditions or\nactions whatsoever, and, on the other, that objective entirety of\nexternal existence which confronts him, must wholly lose the appearance\nof two worlds which are either indifferent to or not homogeneous\nwith[379] each other, and forthwith proclaim themselves as harmoniously\nrelated and identical in substance. This externally objective world\nmust, in so far as it is the reality of the Ideal, surrender the\nsemblance of its own objective self-subsistency and stubbornness, in\norder that its fundamental unity with that to which it supplies the\nexternal and particular embodiment may be exhibited in truth.\nTo establish this unity with more conclusiveness we propose now to\nexamine our subject under three different heads of discussion.\n_First_, we may investigate the same from the point of view that this\nunity which binds the two factors already defined is merely a bond\nwhich possesses _no positive reality_[380], but is merely a mysterious\nand secret connection both in its origin and appearance, by virtue of\nwhich our humanity is looped together with its environment.\n_Secondly_, however, as a deduction from the fact that it is the\nconcrete _spiritual_ life of man and the individuality which pertains\nto it which constitutes the point of departure, or rather the essential\ncontent of the Ideal, we shall further examine this association, as in\ntruth the creation of _human_ activity itself and only possible as such\na creation.\n_Finally_, we shall prove that this unified world created by the human\nSpirit is itself a complete entirety, which, in the determinate form\nof its existence, is objectively valid, and in essential relation with\nwhich every unit of our common humanity who is actively engaged with\nthe vital concerns of art must infallibly remain.\nIn opening our discussion of the position we proposed first we would\nat once point out an important conclusion involved in it. We have here\nposited that the environment of the Ideal is not directly due to human\nactivity, it can therefore only be regarded in this first step of our\ninquiry as something external to man, that is to say Nature. How, then,\nis this something outside man to be exhibited in the ideal work of art?\nWe will discuss this at least in its more general terms, and here, too,\ndraw attention to three aspects of importance.\n(_\u03b1_) In the first place external Nature, so far as the reproduction of\nits external form is concerned, is in every respect a reality which is\nembodied in some _definite_ shape. If our representation is in every\nrespect to satisfy really all that is implied in this condition it\nmust be the exact counterpart of the phenomenal truth of Nature. We\nhave, however, already drawn attention to material points of difference\nbetween the truth of Nature and its reproduction by art which cannot be\ndisregarded. We may, however, observe that it is an almost universal\ncharacteristic of the great masters that they are conspicuously true\nin their delineation and elaboration of the broad facts of Nature. And\nthis is not so much due to a love of imitation as it is due to the fact\nthat Nature is not merely in a general way the objective facts of a\nheaven and an Earth with humanity suspended, as it were, in a _vacuo_\nbetween them; but rather that the emotional life and activity of man\ncan only be rightly conceived as alive and operative in a given place\nwith all its associations of streams, rivers, hills, mountains, plains,\ndales, and forests. Take the case, for example, of Homer, who is not at\nall a poet of the picturesque in natural scenery as we now understand\nit; we shall, nevertheless, find even in him the descriptions and\nindications he gives us of actual places or natural features such\nas the rivers Scamander or Simois, the coast and bays of the sea\nand so forth correspond with such truth to Nature that geographical\ninvestigators only quite recently have been able to map out the\nlocality to which he refers in entire accordance with his descriptions.\nThe ballad-singers of the Middle Ages present a sordid[381] contrast\nto him in this respect, no less than in their power of depicting\ncharacter; the effect of their productions either way is bald, jejune\nand nebulous. Even in the case of the Meistersingers, though they\nversify old biblical stories which they locate in Jerusalem and\nelsewhere, it is little more than the bare names which we get. In the\nBook of heroes[382] the effect is precisely similar. Otnith rides\nthrough the pine-forest, fights with the dragon, but it is no world\nof men or distinct locality we can recognize, and our imagination is\nconsequently in this respect left without any support. Even in the\nNibelungenlied there is no real increase of local interest. It is\ntrue the names of Worms, the Rhine, and the Danube are mentioned;\nbut practically all further detail is omitted and the result is as\nbarren as before. And yet it is clearly through this very clearness of\ndefinition that our narration becomes individual and real; without this\nit is a mere abstraction which directly gives the lie to the concrete\nreality it proposes to present.\n(_\u03b2_) In addition to these fundamental requirements of clear definition\nand correspondence with the natural facts a certain elaboration of\ndetail will frequently much assist us in presenting the external\naspects of a picture which our perception or imagination can readily\nseize. Unquestionably, owing to the nature of the particular medium\nin which the several arts express themselves, there will be a marked\ndifference of range to which, in any particular case, this process\nmay be carried. If we take the art of sculpture, for example, we\nshall find that the repose and universality, which are the fundamental\nfeatures of its characterization, are less consistent with this\nelaboration of external detail than is the case in some other arts.\nExternality is here neither defined as a particular place nor a\nparticular environment, but is entirely concentrated upon such details\nas drapery, arrangement of hair, dress, weapons of war, mode of seat\nand the like. Nay more, the actual definition of many figures in\nantique sculpture is only obtained through an entirely conventional\narrangement of drapery or hair, or other distinguishing accessories.\nThis is not, however, the place to discuss further the significance of\nthe conventional. It is obviously outside the sphere of natural fact\nand rather related to the contingent; or, to put the matter in this\nparticular case more fully, it is the means through which we arrive\nat that which is more universal and persistent in our final artistic\neffect.\nAs a reverse case to that of sculpture the subject-matter of lyrical\npoetry is pre-eminently man's emotional life; for this reason it is\nnot so necessary in this type of poetry to lay stress on the detail of\nactual facts even when reference is made to the external world. It is,\non the other hand, part of the function of epic poetry to state events\nas actual facts, to be precise as to the place where actions occurred\nand in what manner they were performed; and, in short, of all types\nof poetry it is the one to which the widest latitude and the closest\naccuracy of local detail is most essential. And, furthermore, if we\ncontrast all the arts together in this respect we shall find that not\none of them is, by virtue of its medium[383], so exclusively occupied\nwith the detail of external Nature as that of painting. At the same\ntime we must add a word that applies equally to all of them. Whatever\nthe definition of Nature may be, it never ought to give the erroneous\nimpression of Nature's prose reality, that is to say, as the immediate\nimitation of such; nor should that fulness of detail, which is devoted\nto the spiritual aspect of individual life and its events, be carried\nby enthusiasm out of the due relation of its importance to the whole.\nAnd generally we may affirm of both that such exclusive definition\nought not to be all that is anywhere presented, inasmuch as everywhere\nin a work of art that which is a natural fact should only receive its\nartistic embodiment in close relation to man's spiritual life.\n(_\u03b3_) We have here struck the very note we wish particularly to\nemphasize. We have already remarked that there are two essential\nconditions to any effective presentation of a real personality; we\nmust have before us both the reflection of the man's inner life and\nthe natural environment which surrounds him. And in order that this\nexternal surrounding appear as one that is truly his own an essential\nbond of relation must be established between him and it, one which\nto a greater or less degree is part of his own spiritual substance,\nwhere we may, doubtless, cross many traces of contingent matter and\nyet find the spiritual bed of this nexus still maintained. Throughout\nthe entire spiritual _apparatus_ of the heroes of Epic poetry, for\nexample, their mode of life, that is, opinions, emotions, and all that\nthey do we ought to be able to recognize a subtle homogeneousness, a\nharmonious _en rapport_, which fuses the two aspects of such a life\ninto one concordant whole. The Arab is thus united with Nature, and,\nindeed, apart from his sky, his stars, his torrid deserts, his tents,\nhis camels, and his horses is unintelligible. He is only truly himself\nand at home under such conditions. In the same way the heroes of Ossian\npossess in the highest degree an intense inward life; but in their\nvery gloominess and melancholy they appear as the genuine growth of\ntheir hills of heather, whose thistles are swept by the wind, of their\nrain-clouds, mists, mountains, and dark caves. The physiognomy of the\nconditions under which they live reveals to us as nothing else can\nthe secret of that inner life of emotion which is lived through with\nall its sadness, mourning, its pains, its battles, and its mist-like\napparitions in such a natural setting; they are, in short, entirely at\nhome in it and in it alone.\nSuch considerations supply us with ample ground for the statement we\nlet fall previously unsupported that the subject-matter of history\noffers unrivalled opportunities for perfecting this intimate relation\nbetween the two aspects of human life we have been discussing, and\nenabling, us to carry the same directly into the minutest particulars.\nVery rarely, indeed, are we likely to find that the imagination can\nsimply through its own initiative create such a harmony, although\nwe ought to feel its presence throughout, however little it may, in\nfact, have produced of the raw material it combines into artistic\ncompleteness. No doubt there is a common tendency to rate what we\nfancy is the free creation of imaginative genius above the effort of\nassimilating in artistic form a material which is borrowed; but it is\nfor all that quite impossible that the imagination should alone create\nthat harmonious _entente_, the unity of the Ideal requires in the\nconsistent and defined form which lies before us in actual existence,\nwhere national traits, to cite the examples above, are the veritable\ngrowth of such a harmony.\nAnd here we close our consideration of the principle accordant with\nwhich we have rendered more clear that aspect of the unity of the\ninner life with its natural environment which we posited as secret or\npotential, not at any rate directly due to human activity.\n(_b_) The second phase of this harmonious relation may be explained\nmore positively, being expressly due to man's own activity and his\nadaptation of means to ends. For man adapts external objects to his\nown uses and, by means of the satisfaction which his work supplies,\nplaces himself in a harmonious relation to them. In contrast therefore\nto our first indefinite[384], and, in fact, entirely general type of\nharmonious association the present one is directly concerned with what\nis particular, as exemplified in the particular needs of man and their\nsatisfaction by his converting to his use such natural objects as he\nmay require. The range of his wants and the consequent impulse of their\nsatisfaction is of a practically unlimited variety; yet it is nothing\nin comparison with the variety of Nature herself. Simplification is\ntherefore inseparable from the task whereby, our humanity imposes on\nthe facts of Nature its own vital purposes, and interpenetrates the\nexternal world with its own volitions. In this way man's environment is\nhumanized; he proves by his own acts that it is capable of satisfying\nhis nature and is unable to preserve any predominant independence over\nagainst him. Here at last, by virtue, that is, of his own productive\nexertions, we find him no longer in a merely general sense of the term,\nbut actually in every detail of his particular surroundings a real\ncentre of his own substance and at home.\nThe fundamental conception which it is most important to emphasize as\nthat which affects art throughout in its relation to all we have above\nconsidered may be thus stated. If we look closely at the relative\nposition man occupies in all the infinite variety of his material\nwants, desires, and aims, we shall find that it is not one merely of\n_general_ significance, but one of actual _dependence_. The absence\nof freedom implied in this relative position is antagonistic to the\nIdeal; and in order that man may become a suitable object for art, he\nmust have already released himself from the travail of this enforced\ncondition, and thrown off the chains of his dependence. Moreover, this\nact of mutual accommodation, when we trace it to its origin, may strike\nus in one of two different ways. Either he may conclude that Nature\nin all friendliness on her own part supplies man with what he needs,\nand so far from throwing obstacles in the path of his interests and\nobjects, rather freely gives them him as one who meets him half way\nwherever he goes. Or, on the contrary, we shall not fail to observe\nthat our humanity has wants and desires, whose immediate satisfaction\nNature is quite unable to secure. In cases that fall under the second\ntype it is obvious that man can only work out the self-satisfaction\nvital to him through his own energies; he must take possession of that\nwhich Nature possesses, set to rights the defects which appear, modify\ntheir form, removing all that stands in his way with adroitness; and,\nin short, convert Nature's raw material into means through which he\nwill be able to attain all that he proposes. The relation in which the\nunity between man and his environment will be most conspicuous must be\nsought for in an example, where there is already a real contact between\nthem, where, that is to say, human ability is on such good terms with\nthe amenability of Nature that all the severity of a conflict between\nthem as unreconciled forces disappears, and we have forthwith the\ncompleted symphony under our eyes.\nFor the reasons, then, already advanced the ideal province of art must\nbe held secure from the bare necessities of life. Property and the\nfavour of circumstances, in so far as they supply a condition, under\nwhich poverty and labour vanish not merely for this or that hour, but\nfor the most part altogether, are for this reason, we will not say\nincompatible with art, but rather in full concurrence with the Ideal.\nYet it would only betray a real lack of comprehension[385], if in cases\nwhere the conditions of our art compelled us to consider the facts\nof life in all their multifold variety, we nevertheless omitted from\nour composition all reference to the relation in which human life is\nplaced to these very natural constraints. It is true enough that such\nare purely finite conditions; but art is not therefore able to dispense\nwith them. They must not, in fact, even be treated by her as something\nmerely bad. It is rather her function to reconcile them with the Real\nin her embracing unity. And indeed the finest actions and opinions\nwhich she reflects on her mirror, if we consider the particular form\nof the determination and content alone[386], are necessarily limited\nand consequently finite. That I find it necessary to provide myself\nwith nourishment, food and drink, a house to live in, and clothing to\nwear, seats to sit upon, and everything else incidental to domestic\nlife is no doubt an inevitable concomitant of the fact that I live\nin the world; but the life that only I myself experience within me\npermeates, this external aspect of my life so completely, that men\nare fain to clothe and arm the very gods themselves, and to picture\nthem under conditions inseparable from a variety of things they seek\nto possess, and find their satisfaction in obtaining. In short, for\nart to be possible, this satisfaction of the necessities of life must\nbe assured to us. Or to take an example where this is not so, there\nis that of adventurous knights who only secure their immunity from\nexternal hardship through the continued success of their enterprise,\nwhich is therefore itself but a contingency, in much the same way as\nthe prosperity of savages is contingent upon the amenities of Nature.\nThe conditions in both cases are not favourable to Art. Her true Ideal\nis not merely to be found where our humanity is barely lifted above\nthe most rigorous condition of dependence upon the smiles or frowns of\nNature, but is most of all at home in that superfluity which suffers it\nin conjunction with Nature's bounty to expatiate with freedom no less\nthan delight.\nThe above remarks are obviously of very general application. Two\nconsiderations, however, of a somewhat more restricted interest may be\ndeduced from them.\n(_\u03b1_) The first of these relates to the kind of use to which mankind\nput the objects of Nature in seeking for a satisfaction which is wholly\n_aesthetic_, or due to some habit of the mind. Everything in the nature\nof ornament and finery, or, in general terms, everything that men\nconvert to their use for the sake of mere show comes under this head.\nAnd the point to which we draw attention is this, that when we find men\nthus decorating themselves no less than their immediate surroundings,\nwe ought not so much to conclude that all that they thus collect\ntogether from Nature's most costly and beautiful storehouse, whatever\nmay most attract their eyes in the same--whether it be gold, precious\nstones, pearls, ivory, or precious raiment--that all this unrivalled\nrarity and brilliancy, in short, is that which for its own sake, and\nprimarily as a product of Nature, interests them: rather their interest\nin it all is essentially personal as a thing suitable for the houses\nthey live in, or for that which they most love and honour, whether it\nbe their rulers, their temples, or their gods. A man selects in this\nway that which already appears to him as externally beautiful, pure\ntranslucent colour, glitter of metals, fragrant woods, marble, and all\nthe rest. Poetry, and particularly Oriental poetry, makes a willing\nuse of such wealth, a fact we may even illustrate from such a poem as\nthe Nibelungenlied: and generally it is true enough that Art in such\nmatters is not merely content with a general description of the beauty\nor value of such fine things; but, where the artistic form and the\noccasion allows, will describe such works in all the detail of their\nworkmanship with as royal a bounty as the works themselves. There was\nno stint of either gold or ivory on the statue of Pallas at Athens,\nor that of Zeus at Olympia; and the temples of the ancient gods, the\nchurches of Christendom, the pictures of saints, and the palaces of\nkings, are notable illustrations among all nations that possess any\nof them, to what kind of service splendour and brilliant show may be\ndevoted; thus have nations in every age delighted in seeing upon their\ngods the visible presence of their own wealth, precisely as they have\nfound delight in the splendour of their princes as a glory they still\npossessed, though ravished from themselves.\nWe all know, of course, that type of moralist who is only too ready\nto disturb the vision of such an enjoyment. We shall, no doubt, be\nreminded how many poor Athenians the aegis of Pallas could have\nsupplied with a hearty meal, or how many slaves could have thus been\nliberated; and, doubtless, we must admit that in the case of the\nancient world, no less than in days more near to our own wealth, all\nthat has been lavished on temple, cloister, or cathedral, or other\nobjects of public utility, has been expended under social conditions of\nthe direst need to many. Nay, we may carry such melancholy reflections\nyet further, and find in them a condemnation not merely of particular\nworks of art, but of Art herself and all that she gives us. What sums\nof money are involved in the building by the State of an Academy of\nArts, or the purchase of ancient and modern works of art, and the\nappropriate embellishment of public galleries, theatres, and museums!\nBut whatever the effect of such reflections may be upon us, whether\nethical or otherwise, such is, after all, only due to the fact that\nwe are once more reminded of those very constraints and hardships\nwhose removal is a vital condition of the appearance of Fine Art. The\nappropriation of a unique sphere in its life for the exposition of its\nartistic treasures, which stands safe above the stress of that reality\nto which it contributes so largely, can therefore only redound to the\nglory and supreme honour of any people.\n(_\u03b2_) But, further, mankind is not merely interested in the adornment\nof individuals and the environment of their life, but is actively\nemployed in adapting the objects of Nature to its practical needs and\npurposes. It is on this plane that we come into contact for the first\ntime with all the labour and struggle which the dependence of our\nhumanity upon the prose of its finite life implies. And the question\ninevitably arises, how far all that is involved in this practical\neffort is suitable to artistic presentation.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) In attempting some answer to this problem, we would draw\nattention to the historical fact that the earliest way in which Art\nattempted to banish all the prose reality of human life was the\nconception of the well-known golden age or, if we care to call it so,\nthe idyllic state. In this we have Nature depicted as satisfying man's\nevery want with no trouble to himself: while he, for his part, enjoys\nin a state of innocence all that mead, wood, flocks, garden, shelter,\nand so forth, can supply him with nourishment, dwelling, and all other\ncomforts incidental to such a life. Of the passions of ambition or\navarice, indeed of every impulse that may appear to run counter to the\nnobility of man's spiritual nature, we hear no word at all. At first\nblush, no doubt, a state of this description may strike us more or less\nas ideal, and certain types of art, limited in their range, may find\ndefinite satisfaction in presenting us with a picture of it. But we\nhave only to penetrate further below the surface and we shall quickly\nhave enough of such a vision. The writings of Gessner are little read\nnowadays, and when we do read them we find in such little satisfaction.\nThe truth is that a restricted state of life, such as the above\ndescribed, presupposes a very elementary stage in human development.\nManhood which has attained to any real fulness of spiritual stature is\nmoved by impulses of loftier range, and is not likely to be satisfied\nwith the life which clings closest to Nature and its immediate\nproducts. In such idyllic poverty of soul no man ought to live, but\nrather to accept his birthright of toil: that which his spiritual\nimpulse urges him forward to, that he must secure through his own\nactivity. Once regard the matter in this way and these very physical\nwants of man will be found to bring into being a wide and diverse range\nof activities, implanting in him the conscious sense of his own powers,\nfrom the heart of which the profounder interests and forces of his life\ncan slowly unravel themselves. But, at the same time, it is necessary\nthat here, too, the harmonious relation between the outward and inner\nlife should be maintained as the fundamental principle of artistic\npresentation. Few things are more offensive to our aesthetic taste\nthan to find in a work of art the severity of some physical disaster\nportrayed through every detail of horror. Dante flashes on us the\nstarvation of Ugolino in a few trenchant strokes. When a Gerstenberg,\nin his tragedy of Ugolino, wrings out every detail of the catastrophe\nto the last drop, telling us precisely how first Ugolino's two sons,\nand after them their father, were done to death by starvation, we feel\nat once that the subject, as thus handled, is entirely at variance with\nthe principles of fine art.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) We shall, however, find that the condition of life which offers\nthe strongest contrast to that we have described as the idyllic state,\nwe will call it the generally civilized life[387], presents, though on\nother grounds, difficulties to an ideal exposition which are equally\nserious. In a Culture-State the complexus of social wants and labour,\nof interests and all that may go to satisfying the same, is throughout\nand in all its comprehensiveness completely evolved. Every individual\nhere is immersed in an infinite network of relations with other units\nof the whole, and with so much loss to his complete independence. What\nhe himself requires for himself is either nothing at all, or only, in\na quite insignificant fraction of it, the result of his own labour:\nadd to this the tendency of all a man's normal activities is to become\nmore and more mechanical. We find, too, at the heart of this industrial\ndevelopment and the interchange of employment and rejection of human\nlabour which it implies, on the one hand the most ruthless conditions\nof poverty, and on the other a class which, raised as it is above\nthe bare necessities of existence, stands out in relief as wealthy,\nentirely released from all toil for the sake of a subsistence, able\nat any rate to devote individual attention to the finer interests of\nlife and its pathetic contrasts. No doubt the possession of such a\nsuperfluity may create an impression as though for the favoured few the\nconstant recurrence of a position of dependence had passed away, and\na man is just so much the more released from the accidents incidental\nto property because his hands are at length free from the grime which\nsoils them in securing it. But such a consolatory reflection will never\nmake a man thoroughly at home in all that immediately surrounds him in\nthe real sense that such is the garland of his own labour. For he is\nthe centre of that to the upraising of which he has not himself been\ninstrumental; it has come there out of that provision store which was\nalready full without him, which quite other persons and for the most\npart in a quite mechanical and, therefore, formal way have provided,\nand to which he is only introduced after a long series of effort and\nstruggle wholly strange to himself.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) We are consequently led to the conclusion that it is rather a\n_third_ type of human society, a society which we may place halfway\nbetween the idyllic golden age and the burgher State in its fully\ndeveloped industrial form, which is most fitted to be the subject\nmatter of ideal art. We have already analysed this state of society\nin another connection under the description of the _heroic_ and\npre-eminently ideal world-condition. The heroic age is no longer\nrestricted to that idyllic garden of spiritual attenuation, but\nincludes within its borders passions and aims of deeper moment; and yet\nwithal that which in the circle of the individual life touches closest\nthe satisfaction of each man's immediate wants is still the entire\nproduct of his own activity.\nMoreover, the means of nourishment such as honey, milk, and wine are\nless complex and consequently lend themselves more readily to ideal\ntreatment[388]. A diet which includes coffee, brandy, and such like\nluxuries is associated in our minds with countless industries which\nare necessary to their preparation. Our heroes, on the contrary, kill\nand roast their own food, break in their own chargers, are the makers\nto a considerable extent of all their household gods; ploughs, armour\nfor defence, shields, coats of mail, swords, spears, all are either the\nwork of the possessor, or are made directly under his supervision. In\na condition of life of this kind a man necessarily feels that in all\nthe things he makes use of, and in all that encircles him, he is in\ntouch with something produced by himself; that in contact with external\nobjects he is in contact with his own substance rather than with\nobjects which emanate from a world strange to himself and outside that\nin which he is himself master. It is, of course, assumed that all the\nenergy he expends upon working up the material into forms adapted for\nhis use is not so much troublesome labour, but a work which, through\nthe satisfaction it brings him, falls easy from his shoulders, a work,\nin short, which he can carry over every obstacle to success.\nWe find a society of this type in Homer. Agamemnon's sceptre is a\nfamily staff which his ancestor himself shaped from the block and left\nas an heirloom to his descendants. Odysseus put together with his\nown hands the mighty bed he shared with Penelope; and if the famous\nweapons of Achilles are no work of his own we only find the various and\ninterfused array of his own activities abated that a god, Hephaestus\nhimself, may provide them at the request of his mother Thetis. In a\nword, we meet everywhere the youthful delight in novel discovery, the\nfreshness of personal possession, the victorious sense of enjoyment.\nEverything is in its place and at home, in everything a man discovers\nthe energy of his own sinew, the adroitness of his own hand, the\ncunning of his own spirit, or somewhat that follows from his own\ncourage and bravery. In this way, and by this alone, the instruments\nwhich satisfy our human sense are not as yet relegated to a merely\nexternal relation, but men have before them the living process of the\ninstruments themselves, the vital consciousness of the human worth they\nattach to them; and they find it there inasmuch as for them they are\nnot mere lifeless things or things which habit has made lifeless, but\ncreations impregnated with their own energies. And for the same reason\nwe find here an idyllic condition of things, it is true, but not in\nthat restricted sense of the term that the Earth and her streams, seas,\nforests, and cattle supply to mankind their sustaining substance, while\nman himself is only visible to us as a passive creature limited by the\nactive powers which support him and their enjoyment. Rather we already\nsee within this morning-time of human life deep interests at work, in\nrelation to which the great world itself is but a subordinate realm,\nthe ground and the instrument for bringing into being the higher aims\nwhich are present, as a ground and environment, however, over which\nthat harmonious concord, yet withal independence, of both sides of our\nhuman world prevails; and which does prevail in the sight of all for\nthis reason that everything there exists as the product and for the use\nof human life, is at the same time the creation and enjoyment of the\nman who creates and enjoys its use[389].\nTo apply such a mode of artistic presentation to material borrowed\nfrom more recent times, whose completed culture offers the strongest\ncontrast to the heroic age above-mentioned, is always beset with\nextreme difficulty and liable to failure. Yet for all that Goethe in\nhis \"Hermann and Dorothea\" has furnished us in this respect with an\nadmirable masterpiece. Here an attempt will only be made to elucidate\na few significant points by contrasting the same with a composition\nof similar type. Voss, in his famous romance \"Louise,\" had depicted\non much the same idyllic lines our human life and activity in a quiet\ncircle of narrow range, if also marked with independent characteristics\nof its own. The country parson, the tobacco-pipe, the dressing-gown,\nthe garden-bench, and finally our coffee-pot, have all of them here\nimportant parts to play. Coffee and sugar are, however, products, which\nare really here out of place; they belong to an entirely different\nworld[390] throughout associated with all the varied ramifications\nof commercial and textile industries. This circle of country life\nis consequently not self-inclusive. In the beautiful picture of\n\"Hermann and Dorothea\" we are, on the contrary, under no necessity to\ndemand such a consistency. As we already have pointed out in another\nconnection, we find interwoven with the main threads of this poem,\nwhich is, no doubt, in its prevailing atmosphere entirely idyllic, the\ngreat political interests of the time, the struggles of the French\nRevolution, the defence of the Fatherland, asserted in a worthy way\nno less than with decision. The more limited scope of family life in\na little country town is not so presented us as a whole which can\neven possibly remain in total ignorance of that mighty wave of the\ngreat world under stress of a real cataclysm of events, which is the\nview we are given of the pastor in the \"Louise\" of Voss. In Goethe's\npoem we have, on the contrary, by means of the interfusion of these\ngreat world-movements, within which the idyllic characters and events\nare portrayed, the picture of a life with a typical character of its\nown set in the frame of a world of more significant content; and the\napothecary, who is here presented as the out-and-out Philistine, and\nwho merely lives within the more narrow borders of that country life's\nsurroundings, affected by that only, is excellently sketched for us\nwith the good heart, but at the same time peevish isolation, which we\nfind so natural. Add to this, in that which most closely touches the\nlife of the characters thus portrayed, we find a particular emphasis\nlaid on the fundamental aspect of this idyllic life as previously\nindicated in our former discussion of it. To mention one point only, we\nmay observe that the host does not by any means drink coffee with his\nguests, the parson and the apothecary; on the contrary, to cite a line\nor two:\nCarefully brought in the mother the sparkling and glorious red-wine,\nPoured in the clear-cut glasses, with rimlets all polished of pewter,\nBrought in the green-coloured rummers, those goblets most fit for the\nRhine-wine.\nThey drink in the fresh air what has been grown at home, of the '83\nvintage, and withal in glasses that, as home-made, are just the right\nones for Rhine-wine. A few lines further on our fancy is yet further\nkindled with the \"streams of the Rhine river and its dearly-loved\nbanks,\" and we are even introduced to the vineyard of the host behind\nthe house itself; and, in short, there is nothing to arrest our\nattention outside the typical circle of a self-contented life which of\nits own bounty provides for its wants.\n(_c_) In addition to both these types of human environment we must\nmention yet another in close association with which we all necessarily\nlive. It is no other than the universally prevailing _spiritual_\nsurroundings of our life whether they be religious, legal, or moral,\nthe organization of the State, that is to say, the constitution of the\ngovernment, the judicial institutions, the family, the institutions\nof both public and private life, and all other social relations. For\nthe ideal character is not merely to be portrayed in its relation\nto all that satisfies material wants, but as itself a focus of\nspiritual interests. It is certainly true that all that is truly\nsubstantive, divine, and essentially necessary in all these relations\nis fundamentally an envisagement of one reality. In the objective\nworld, however, the forms under which this reality is manifested are\nvarious, and they are, one and all, involved in that which is wholly\ncontingent in particular examples, and the conventional usages which\nare only valid for definite periods of time and distinct nations. In\nthis variety of form all the interests of men's spiritual life receive\nan external embodiment of reality, with which every man is confronted\nin the customs, usages, and habits of society. Every man thereby, in\naddition to possessing a self-exclusive individuality of his own,\nbecomes, in virtue of his association with such spiritual realities,\neven more a member of a whole cognate with and vital to himself than\nas a unit of that external world of Nature with which he is similarly\nconjoined. Speaking generally, we may attach to this spiritual\nassociation, of human life very much the same terms and significance we\nhave already discussed in the foregoing sections; consequently we will\nfor the present pass over the more detailed consideration of it, whose\nmost important features will apply more strictly to another aspect of\nour inquiry, and will then be more appropriately discussed.\n3. THE EXTERNALITY OF THE IDEAL WORK OF ART IN ITS RELATION TO A PUBLIC\nIt is therefore necessary that art, as the representation of the Ideal,\nmust embody this Ideal in all the relations to external reality we\nhave above described, and thereby associate the inward possessions of\ncharacter with the objective world. A work of art, however much in form\nit may be a self-including and harmonious world by itself, exists none\nthe less as such an object, both real and particular, not _for itself_\nbut for such as _behold_ and _enjoy_ it, that is the Public. Actors,\nfor example, in the representation they give us of a particular drama\ndo not merely enter into converse with one another, but appeal directly\nto ourselves, their audience; and it is equally important that they\nmake themselves intelligible under both these aspects. Every work of\nart is in fact a direct appeal to the intelligence of everyone who\nconfronts it. Now it is indeed true that the real Ideal, as envisaged\nfor us in the universal interests and passions of its gods and men, is\nso far intelligible to everyone as it gives us a view of its characters\nwithin some typical external world of customs, usages, and everything\nelse that characteristically distinguishes it. But the condition of art\nwe have above formulated makes it further necessary that this element\nof external reality is not merely one with which the characters thereby\nrepresented are harmoniously associated, but must be also one within\nwhich we ourselves to whom the work is addressed feel equally at home.\nThe appropriateness of the external environment to the characters\nenfolded within it must apply with equal force to our own attitude of\nmind in regarding both. But it so happens that from whatever period\nof the world's history the subject-matter of a work of art may be\nborrowed it will be sure to contain essential features, which are quite\ndistinct from those which specifically determine other nations and\nperiods. In other words artists of every description, whether they be\npoets, painters, sculptors, or musicians, select subject-matter from\nthe Past, which in their particular state of culture and intelligence,\nethical customs, usages, and the form of their government, differ\nfrom the civilization of the times they live in. Moreover, as we have\nalready observed, this return upon the Past possesses the considerable\nadvantage that in having thus recourse to memory instead of being face\nto face with all the facts of the present, there is an appreciable\ndiminution of the material from which the artist selects his subject,\nand this he cannot readily dispense with. At the same time the artist\nbelongs only to his own century, and it is in the ethical customs,\nmodes of conception, and generally the intellectual outlook of that he\nlives. The Homeric poems Homer, to take him for once as the individual\ncreator of both \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey,\" may have actually lived through\nor he may not; but in any case they are at least four hundred years\nlater[391] than the time of the Trojan war; and further a period twice\nas long separates the great Greek tragedians from the days of the\nancient heroes, who, as translated into the atmosphere of their own\ntime, form the subject-matter of their poetry. It is just the same\nin the case of the Niebelungenlied and the artist who finally fused\ntogether the various saga which that poem contains into one homogeneous\nwork. We may no doubt admit that the artist finds himself entirely on\ncongenial ground when dealing with everything truly pathetic, either\nin the history of gods or men; but the external and actual conditions\nof that ancient world, whose characters and actions he endeavours to\nportray, have altered in essential features and become consequently\nstrange to him. And further than this a poet creates for the sake of a\nPublic, and primarily for his own nation and his time, both of which\nshould be able to enter into such a work of art with intelligence,\nand feel at home in it. The most genuine works of art no doubt assert\na further claim to immortality, a hope that they may continue to be\na source of delight to all times and nations. But even in the case\nof works of the highest class it is none the less true that nations\nand times situated far away from those which produced them can only\nfully apprehend them with the assistance of an extensive apparatus of\ngeographical, historical, and it may be even philosophical knowledge\nand the results of much critical investigation.\nBearing in mind these fundamental, and to some extent incompatible\ndifferences which characterize the various points of view from which\na work of art must be regarded, the question arises what kind of form\nrelatively to its external framework of locality, custom, usage,\nand generally any and every condition of religious, political or\nethical significance a particular work of art should receive. Should\nan artist suffer his own times to pass from his mind altogether, and\nattempt only to secure the substantial appearance of the Past and\nwhat actually then existed, so that his work become simply a true\nportrayal of that; or is he not merely justified, but rather under\nan obligation, to pay an exclusive attention to his own nation and\nthe life around him, elaborating his work with express regard to the\nprinciple that it should stand in harmonious relation to his own\ntimes? Or, to put the same thing in rather more technical language,\nwe may propound the problem thus: Is the subject-matter of a work\nof art to be _objectively_ valid in its content as one entirely\nappropriate historically considered, or should such matter be treated\n_subjectively_, that is, in complete subordination to the artist's\npersonal standpoint relatively to the culture and social conditions\nof his own time? We would rather observe that both these positions,\nif thus pressed unduly, land us in extreme conclusions equally false;\nand we propose now to examine them briefly that we may by their means\nelucidate a more satisfactory theory.\nAnd we would consider three fundamental aspects which this problem\nsuggests. We will _first_ examine what is implied in the above\nsubjective assertion of the particular culture of the artist's own\ntime; _secondly_, there is the question what may be regarded as\nexclusively and objectively true when we refer to the Past; _thirdly_,\nwe have to consider what may still be objectively valid in the true\nsense, though we still have a representation and appropriation of\nmaterial borrowed from a time and nationality foreign to that of the\nartists.\n(_a_) Now to start with, if we consider this purely subjective\nassertion, it is obvious that when we press the position closely we\nare finally driven to exclude the objective embodiment of the Past\naltogether, and to maintain that artistic representation is exclusively\nconcerned with the appearance of present times.\n(_\u03b1_) Such a result may be doubtless, under one aspect of it,\npresented by mere ignorance of the Past. It is, then, rather the result\nof a _na\u00efvet\u00e9_, which is unable to feel the contradiction between\nthe object itself and the representation given, or at least fails to\nbring the same to consciousness. Such a form of artistic presentation\nis therefore fundamentally due to lack of sufficient culture. We\ncould hardly wish for a more vivid illustration of this than we find\nin the _na\u00efve_ productions of Hans Sachs, who has, no doubt with a\nvivid freshness of imaginative vigour and spirit, as we may truly say,\ndomesticated among us[392] our dear Lord and Father God no less than\nAdam, Eve, and the rest of the patriarchs. Here, for example, God the\nFather is portrayed as teaching a school in which Cain, Abel, and the\nrest of Adam's children--are the pupils, precisely as any pedagogue of\nthe time might have done. He catechizes them upon the ten commandments\nand the Lord's Prayer. Abel knows his lesson as a pious and good boy\nought to. Cain on the contrary behaves and replies to his teachers\nas only naughty and wicked boys would think of doing; and when it is\nhis turn to repeat the commandments turns them inside out: thou shalt\nsteal, thou shalt not honour thy father and mother, and so forth. A\nrepresentation of much the same crude simplicity having for its subject\nthe tale of our Lord's Passion used to be carried out in South Germany,\nwas then made illegal, and has since once more been resuscitated.\nIn this Pilate is portrayed in the character of an insolent, rough,\nand arrogant official, the common soldiers much in the same familiar\nway our own might, offer Christ surreptitiously a pinch of tobacco;\nhe disdains it, and they flatten it out on his nose. Vulgarity finds\nall the more jest in such an incident for the reason that it wholly\nconforms to its notions of piety and reverence, indeed calls up such\nfeelings all the more readily through its immediate reference to that\nwhich it finds in its own world, thereby making more vivid its own\nsense of devotional fervour. No doubt there is a certain justification\nfor this mode of translating, so to speak, the appearance and form\nof objective history into modern equivalents, such as we have found\nin our literature; and we may even attach a kind of greatness to\nthe courage of Hans Sachs in making himself so familiar with God\nAlmighty, and those old religious ideas that without the least vestige\nof impiety he could rivet them deep within the conditions of our most\ncommonplace life. At the same time such an attempt is none the less a\nrude intrusion upon our feelings, and indicates lack of cultivation,\ninasmuch as it not merely disallows to the object itself a right to\nassert itself as it really is, but forces upon it a mode of appearance\nso directly contrary to that which it possesses, that the result can\nonly impress us as an emphatic caricature.\n(_\u03b2_) As an antithesis to the above type of subjectivity we find\nanother equally supreme asserting itself out of sheer pride in its\nown culture under the belief that the views peculiar to its own\ntimes, its ethical customs, and social conventions are those alone\nworth preservation or acceptance. Owing to a bias of this kind it is\nquite unable to enjoy the content of a work of art until such a form\nof culture prevails in it. An illustration of this latter type is\nthe so-called classical good taste of the French school. Everything\nthat is here attempted must forthwith be Frenchified, and all that it\npresents under the form of any other nationality and more particularly\nwith any reference to the Middle Ages is voted incorrect and barbarous\nand is cast on one side with absolute contempt. Voltaire expressed\nanything but the truth when he said that the French have improved the\nworks of the ancient world. What they have done is to nationalize\nthem; and by this process of recasting have corrupted them with every\nkind of foreign and angular quality of their own that such a taste as\ntheirs could develop to any extent, requiring as it did throughout\na culture absolutely based on court etiquette, and a conformity to\nconventional rule and generalization in both the meaning and mode of\nany dramatic work. Indeed, we shall find the trail of this abstraction\nof a superfine culture visible in the very diction of their poetry. Not\na poet among them dare venture to use the word _cochon_, or add their\nown nomenclature to spoons, forks, and a thousand other simple objects.\nConsequently we have roundabout definitions and circumlocutions. We\ncannot have our spoons and forks; we get instead an instrument of the\nhand which conveys our victuals in a liquid or arid state to the\nmouth; and this by no means stands alone. And with all its refinement\ntheir taste is vulgar to a degree; for the simple truth is that genuine\nart, so far from planing away and polishing its content to one flat\nand unruffled surface of generalities, is most of all anxious to set\nin full relief all that makes toward the well-defined characterization\nof life. It is on account of this very taste that the French can make\nless of Shakespeare than any other poet. And when they have attempted\nto work him up to their graces they have clipped off from him precisely\nthat portion which we Germans find nearest to our hearts. For the same\nreason Voltaire makes merry over Pindar because he has made the remark,\n_\u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1._[393] And, consequently, in their works of art they\nfind it necessary to make Chinese, Americans, or the heroes of Greek\nor Roman antiquity all speak in one tongue and in one manner--that\nof their French court. Achilles, for instance, in the \"Iphigenie en\nAulide\"[394] is nothing more or less than a French prince; and if we\nhad no name to help us no one could conceivably discover one particle\nof Achilles in him. It is true that in the theatrical representation of\nthis drama he was habited as a Greek, appeared at least in helmet and\ncoat of mail; but at the same time his hair was curled and powdered,\nwith broad hips through _poschen_[395], with red claws worked on shoes\nfastened on the foot with coloured ribbons; and what is more, the\n\"Esther\" of Racine was expressly popular in the time of Louis XIV, for\nthe particular reason that Ahasuerus, on his first entrance on the\nstage, copied the appearance of Louis XIV himself, when he entered\nthe great hall of audience. No doubt, in this transcript, there was\na considerable admixture of the oriental luxuriance; but a Ahasuerus\nhe was none the less fully powdered and wearing the royal mantle of\nermine, and followed by a complete retinue of curled and powdered\nchamberlains got up thoroughly _en habit fran\u00e7ais_ with their wigs,\ntheir feathered caps under arm, their vests and hoses of _drap d'or_,\nwith their silk stockings and red buckles on their shoes. All that the\ncourt and a select circle of the privileged few were only permitted\nto see _de facto_ was here open to all classes alike--the _entr\u00e9e_\nof the king paraded in the poet's verses. The writing of history in\nFrance is not unfrequently conducted on very much the same principle.\nThat is to say, history itself and the real objects of history are\nnot the main purpose of the historian, whose interest is rather\nconcentrated either on giving the government in vogue a lesson or\nteaching others how they ought to detest it. And in the same way there\nare a host of dramas which, either expressly throughout their entire\ncontent or in passing episodes, divert the attention to the events of\nthe day; or, if passages occur in pieces which refer to former times\npresenting anything which may bear on matters of contemporary interest,\nthe parallel or the contrast is deliberately emphasized with every\nexpression of enthusiasm.\n(_\u03b3_) A third type of this personal treatment by the artist of his\nsubject-matter may be sufficiently described as the separation of\nthe same from all genuine artistic form whether it be characteristic\nof past or present works of art, a mode of production in fact which\nsimply presents us with the entirely evanescent colour of \"the man\nin the street\" in his ordinary everyday action and vocation without\nadding aught to the same. In other words we may describe it as the bare\ncounterpart of what the man of commonsense is conscious in the prosaic\nfacts of life, that and nothing more. In such an atmosphere of prose\nno doubt everyone finds himself at home readily enough; or rather, he\nwill only not find himself at home who takes up such a work with some\ndefinite conception of that which the very conditions of a work of art\ndemand, and consequently is aware that it is precisely from this type\nof handling that Art undertakes to liberate us. Kotzebue, in his day,\nobtained all his popular effects through compositions of this kind,\nwhich aimed at nothing else but letting the general public both see and\nhear life's troubles and vexations, the pocketing of silver spoons, the\nrisking of the pillory, or, to take particular characters, parsons,\nchamberlains, ensign-bearers, secretaries, and cavalry-majors, in their\nnaked colours. Everyone might here recognize his own household, or, at\nleast, that of some relation or friend, might see at a glance where in\nhis own precious circumstances and aims of life the shoe pinched. An\noriginality of this sort necessarily fails to stir any real sense or\nidea of that which is the vital content of a work of art, however much\nit may awake an interest for its productions in hearts that are wont to\nask for so little and are so ready to put up with the commonplaces of\nso-called ethical reflections. We may conclude, then, that the artistic\npresentation of the facts of external reality under any one of these\nthree types just examined is subjective in a one-sided way, that is\nto say, it wholly fails to present us with any adequate form of that\nobjective world as it really exists.\n(_b_) We next propose to examine a mode of presentation the reverse of\nthe above, one which endeavours to restore us the characters and events\nof the past so far as may be with every local detail of their former\nenvironment no less than any and every ethical or other particular\ncharacteristic which formerly distinguished them. We Germans have\nparticularly come to the front in this class of work. As a rule we are,\nin striking contrast to the French, the most painstaking recorders of\nall that is peculiar in nations other than our own, and consequently\nmake fidelity to the characteristic usages, dress, weapons, and all\nsuch antiquarian detail appropriate to particular epochs and localities\na first requisite of our art. Add to this we have the necessary\npatience to put ourselves to no end of trouble in the way of hard\nstudy in order that we may thoroughly enter into the modes of thought\nand perception which belong to foreign nations and centuries distant\nfrom our own, and make ourselves thoroughly conversant with all their\npeculiarities. This power of looking at facts from many and diverse\npoints of view in order to both apprehend and comprehend the spirit of\nevery kind of national existence makes us not merely tolerant in our\nart towards all that strikes us as exceptionally strange in foreign\ncustoms, but clamorous even to a painful degree in our insistence that\nwe have before us accurate correspondence with objective truth down\nto the most insignificant detail. The French are, no doubt, full of\nresource and energetic, but, however highly educated and practical men\nthey may be, such qualities do not increase, but rather diminish the\npatience which they possess for quiet and exhaustive study. Criticism\nis always of first importance with them. We Germans, on the contrary,\nare by nature inclined to accept any picture of real truth for what\nit is, and particularly this is so with foreign works of art. From\nwhatever part of Nature's storehouse such may come, whether it is\nplants or other creations of foreign growth, implements of any kind or\nform, dogs and cats, even absurdities, we accept them all genially; and\nthe result of this is we are able to be on excellent terms with modes\nof thought the most removed from our own, ay, sacrificial customs,\nlegends of the saints and all the extraordinary follies that go with\nthem, to say nothing of a host of other marvels equally surprising.\nAnd for the same reasons it only appears essentially rational that\nin attempting to represent characters in action we should make their\nconversation and pursuits conformable to their own substance, that\nis to say, in strict accord with the times when they lived and their\nown national characteristics, whether regarded individually or in\nassociation with each other.\nThis fundamental idea that the objective truth of a work of art\nis established by virtue of the type of historical accuracy above\ndescribed has obtained currency in comparatively recent times, mainly,\nthat is to say, since the literary work of Frederick von Schlegel. From\nthat time the importance of a first principle in literary criticism has\nattached to it; and further than this, it is asserted that our purely\npersonal interest should above all restrict itself to the enjoyment we\nmay derive from historical accuracy of this kind and the life it thus\nreproduces. Once accept these hard and fast rules and the conclusion\nis obvious that we are allowed no additional interest of any superior\nquality which an enquiry into the essential significance of any\nartistic content may or may not provide for us any more than we are\npermitted to derive any interest more vital to ourselves from aspects\nof such a work directly associated with the culture and aims of our own\ntimes. It is much on these lines that we find also in Germany, where\nthe enthusiasm of Herder in this direction started a closer attention\non all sides to the \"Volkslied,\" a poetic inundation of national\nfolk-songs imitating native tones of every sort of nationality whether\nit be the Iroquois, latter-day Greek, Lap, Turk, Tartar, Mongol, and\nmany another; and, of course, it is assumed to be indicative of\nnothing less than first-rate genius[396] to possess the power of thus\ndiving into the ways and ideas of other folk, and converting all\nwe discover into poetry. At the same time it is clear that however\ncompletely your poet may work his way into and emotionally realize all\nthis strange kind of world, it remains and must continue to remain for\nthat public to whose enjoyment these songs are addressed as something\nvery much aloof from it.\nThe truth is that such a theory, if pressed to its abstract logical\nconclusion, limits its boundaries solely to the truth of history in\nits formal accuracy, and by doing so neglects all consideration of\nthe nature of Art's content and questions relative to its essential\nsignificance, just as it disregards every aspect of it in which the\nculture and resources of modern thought and contemporary life are\nasserted. But it is as impossible to detach ourselves from the truth\nimplied in this theory as it is from equally important truths which it\nneglects; all equally claim satisfaction, and imperatively force upon\nus the necessity of finding a further solution in which the claims of\nhistorical truth may be reconciled with these rival aspects of truth\nin a very different way to that just examined. And this brings us to\nthe third question we proposed as to the nature of that objectivity and\nsubjectivity which can be fully sustained together as the reality to\nwhich a genuine work of art conforms.\n(_c_) The point of essential importance which we should before\nall others wish to emphasize here is this, that no one of those\nvarious aspects of truth we have above indicated should be allowed a\npredominant significance such as would impair the relative force of\nthe others; and, further, or rather notwithstanding this, historical\naccuracy pure and simple in external matters, such as local conditions,\ncustoms, usages, and social institutions generally, must receive in a\nwork of art their due place, if a subordinate one, it being only right\nthat the interest of mere historical truth should give way before that\nof a vitally true and imperishable content for the present no less than\nthe past.\nWe cannot, perhaps, do better by way of explaining what we consider\nto be the true form of artistic representation than by setting up in\ncontrast a few examples of some we take to be defective.\n(_\u03b1_) Now, to start with, the presentation of the characteristic\nfeatures of a given period may be entirely just, accurate, and\nimpregnated with life, nay more, wholly intelligible to a modern\naudience, and notwithstanding fail to escape the ordinary atmosphere of\nprose, and present us with the real substance of poetry. Goethe's \"G\u00f6tz\nvon Berlichingen\" will alone furnish us with notable illustrations of\nthis defect. It is only necessary to open the book at the first scene,\nwhich introduces us to an inn near Schwarzenberg in Franconia; the\n_dramatis personae_ are Metzler, and Sievers sitting at a table, two\ngrooms by the fire, also the landlord.\n_Sievers._ Another glass of brandy, Hans, my boy, and good\nChristian measure.\n_Landlord._ You carry a glass that is never full.\n_Metzler._ [_Aside to Sievers_.] Tell us that once again about\nBerlichingen; the Bambergers are in a pretty fume out there;\nay, black as thunder (etc.).\nThe same kind of thing we find in the third Act.\n_George._ [_Enters with a gutter-spout._] There you have lead\nand to spare; spot the target with but one half of it, and\ndevil a soul shall get off, who is like to say to your Majesty,\nthat's a miss this time[397].\n_Lerse._ [_Aloud._] A fine piece of metal.\n_George._ The rain may take another road for all I care; a\nbrave knight and a real good rain get through most things.\n_Lerse._ [_Pours into glass._] Hold the spoon. [_Goes to the\nwindow._] There's one of those imperial cockades prowling about\nwith his musket; they believe we have aimed a point too far.\nHe shall have a taste of my bullet, hot too and fresh from the\npan. [_Loads._]\n_George._ [_Drops the spoon._] Let me have a look.\n_Lerse._ [_Fires._] There lies the fool (etc.).\nAll this is exceedingly vivid, intelligible, depicted in perfect\nkeeping with the situation and the characters portrayed. Yet for all\nthat these scenes are both trivial to a degree and essentially prosaic.\nAll we get from either the matter or the form is just the ordinary\nman's way of seeing things and reality as it appears to him or rather\nall of us to some extent. We find the same tendency in many another\nof Goethe's youthful productions, which no doubt were deliberately\ndirected against everything which previously had passed for the rule\nof the guild, and which sought for their most impressive effect by\nmeans of the nearness made clear to ourselves, an impression gained by\nthe extraordinary grasp with which the poet's imagination and feeling\nseized upon everything. But the nearness was itself too near, and the\nvital content in part so petty, that such compositions ran constantly\ninto mere triviality. We are most conscious of this kind of triviality\nin dramatic works when we see them on the stage; it is then that\nafter being worked up to some excitement by all the concomitants of a\ntheatrical performance, lights, well-dressed folk, and the rest of it,\nwe expect to see something more than a couple of peasants, and troopers\nand a glass of schnapps thrown in[398]. This phase has mainly found its\nadmirers in readers; it never had a long run on the stage.\n(_\u03b2_) If we now consider our subject from an opposite point of view\nit may be admitted that we can sufficiently make ourselves acquainted\nwith and assimilate the historical content of a former mythology\nand all that is most strange to ourselves in earlier conditions of\nstate-life and national custom to secure through such an intimacy\nwith, the general culture then prevailing a varied knowledge of the\npast. In fact, this acquaintance with the art, mythology, literature,\n_cultus_, and usages of antiquity is the starting point of our present\nsystem of education. Every schoolboy knows something about the gods\nand heroes of Greece and the prominent characters in ancient history.\nIt is therefore quite possible, in so far as they really enter into\nthe imaginative life of our own times, that we may find enjoyment in\nthe imaginative representation of such characters and interests. It\nis further impossible to predict whether or no such an intimacy may\nnot be eventually carried equally as far in the case of the Indian,\nEgyptian, and Scandinavian mythologies. We may further observe that\nin the religious conceptions of all these peoples the Universal God\nis presented. The determinate form, however, of such conceptions,\nthat is to say, the particular gods of Greece or India, are no longer\n_true_ for us as so personified. We do not believe in their existence,\nand the pleasure we take in them is derived from their appeal to our\nimagination. For this reason they stand entirely apart from our deepest\nemotional life, and we can imagine nothing more empty and cold than\nsuch exclamations we hear only too often in opera: \"O ye gods!\" or \"O\nJupiter!\" or even \"O Isis and Osiris!\" And the folly of it all reaches\nits height when we have the wretched saws of oracular wisdom thrown\nin--and the opera can seldom get along without them--a position of\ndignity which nowadays for the first time in tragic drama is occupied\nby pure folly and clairvoyance.\nThe same criticism applies with equal truth to all other historical\nmaterial relating to national customs, laws, and the like. Such\nhistorical fact is excellent in its way, but it belongs to the past;\nand when it has once ceased to have anything in common with present\nlife it necessarily ceases, in spite of all our knowledge of it, to\nbelong to us. We have, in short, no interest[399] in what has passed\naway on the mere ground that it once existed. What is historical can\nonly truly be said to belong to us when it is the possession of the\nnation, to which we ourselves belong, or when we are able to regard\nthe present as in a general way casually connected with the events\nin question, to whose continuous series the characters or actions\nrepresented are united by a bond of essential membership. For if we\ncarefully consider the matter we shall find that the mere fact of\nbeing formerly bound together with the same external environment and\npeople to which we ourselves belong is not sufficient--rather the very\npart of our nation must present features in still closer relation\nto the conditions, life, and existence of our own times. To take an\nexample of what we mean, we find ourselves in the Niebelungenlied\ngeographically on a soil that belongs to us still, but the Burgundians\nand King Etzel are so absolutely cut off from all that touches our\npresent civilization and every interest which is now coincident with\npatriotism that, without borrowing anything from the learning of the\nsubject, it is but simple truth to say we feel infinitely more at home\nin the poems of Homer[400]. Klopstock, no doubt, in his enthusiasm for\neverything that concerned the Fatherland, was prompted to substitute\nhis Scandinavian gods for those of Hellenic mythology; but, for all his\nzeal, Wotan, Walhalla, and Freja remain mere names for us, which appeal\nto our imaginations and patriotic emotions even less than Zeus and his\ncompeers of Olympus.\nThe point above all we desire to emphasize is this. Works of art are\nnot composed primarily for the mere student or the professor, but with\nthe express purpose that they shall be intelligible on their face,\nand a source of enjoyment without any one having to undertake first a\ncircuitous route of extensive historical investigation. For Art is not\naddressed to a small and select circle of the privileged few, but to\nthe nation at large. What, moreover, is generally valid for a work of\nart applies also to the external form of the historical reality therein\nportrayed. Such exposition also must express itself with clearness open\nto the common apprehension requiring no considerable research to make\nit intelligible, must be clear to ourselves as representations of our\ncentury and our own people, so that we may be able to find ourselves\nentirely at home in it, and not have before us a world foreign to that\nwe live in, if not actually unintelligible.\n(_\u03b3_) Considerations such as the foregoing have already brought us\nwithin reach of the truer conception of the objective truth of art and\nthe mode under which it assimilates the material of past history. We\npropose now to offer further illustrations in support of the same.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) And we may start at once by drawing attention to a\ncharacteristic which is common alike to the genuine national poetry\nof all peoples and in every period of past history, namely, that the\nhistorical and formal aspect of that poetry is entirely national,\nthat is to say, it retains nothing incongruous to the people for whom\nit is composed. This is a feature shared alike by the great epics of\nIndia, the Homeric poems and the Greek drama. Sophocles never made\nhis Philoctetes, Antigone, Ajax, Orestes, \u0152dipus, his choregi and\nchoruses speak in the speech and manner that would have been entirely\nappropriate to their own times. The Spaniards have written their\nromances of the Cid under the same guiding principle. Tasso in his\n\"Jerusalem Liberated\" celebrated the universal interests of Catholic\nChristendom. Camoens, the poet of Portugal, depicted the discovery of\nthe seaway to the East Indies round the Cape of Good Hope, and all the\ninfinitely various adventures of the sea heroes that made it possible;\nand these acts of daring were the acts of his own people. Shakespeare\nthrew into dramatic form the tragic history of his own country and even\na Voltaire wrote his \"Henriade.\" Far indeed have we Germans strayed\nfrom the path thus marked for us when we hope to work up into national\nepics histories remote from our own, which carry no longer with them\na national interest of any kind. Bodmer's \"Noachide\" and Kloptock's\n\"Messias\" have started a new fashion of their own, ay, as they have\noverturned that old one which taught us that it redounds to a nation's\nglory to have its Homer, to say nothing of its Pindar and Sophocles.\nThose biblical stories, it is true, present points of special affinity\nwith the national imagination owing to our close acquaintance with the\nold and new Testaments; but the historical material in its association\nwith ancient custom and the like remains for all that only intelligible\nto the savant, and all the most of us can pick up from such epics is\nthe prosaic interfusion of events and characters, which, in such a\nprocess of translation, have merely some novel form of speech thrust\ninto their mouths, and the final result can only impress us as hollow\nand artificial.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) At the same time art cannot be restricted wholly to material\nborrowed from one nation. And as a matter of fact the more\nnationalities have come into contact with one another, the more\ntheir poets have looked abroad among all nations and times for the\nsubject-matter of their poems. But however this may be the case, it\nis none the less an error to suppose that the mere fact that a poet\nis able, so to speak, to live into times aloof from his own at once\nstamps him as a man of creative genius. It is more to the point to\nrecollect that this historical framework must, in the co-ordination of\na poem, be retained only in strict subordination, and as a means of\nexpressing that which permanently belongs to our humanity. Precisely in\nthis way the Middle Ages long ago borrowed much from antiquity, but so\nabsolutely suffused it with the content of its own epoch that, in this\nrespect verging on the opposite extreme, we really get nothing from\nthat antiquity but the bare names of Alexander, Aeneas, and the emperor\nOctavius.\nFirst in importance, then, is this permanent condition of true art,\nimmediate intelligibility. It will be found an invariable truth that\nall nations have emphasized precisely that in this life which was\nmost agreeable to their artistic sense, their desire being always to\nfind what was most intimate to themselves, their life and existence\nin their art. It was this independent flavour of patriotism which\nCalderon worked into such characters as his Zenobia and Semiramis; and\nShakespeare in the same way was able to imprint upon the most varied\nsubject-matter the hall-mark of his English ancestry, although he\nknew how to preserve along with it the essential traits of historical\ncharacters belonging to nations foreign to his own, the Roman for\nexample, in a far profounder degree than was possible to the Spanish\npoets. Even the Greek tragedians had their eyes constantly directed to\nthe actual conditions of their times and the particular city in which\nthey lived. The \"\u0152dipus Colonus\" in its local references is not merely\nin a peculiar way associated with Athens but, by virtue of the fact\nthat \u0152dipus dies in this locality, at once indicates him as the future\nPreserver of that city. In somewhat other associations the \"Eumenides\"\nof Aeschylus is, owing to the decisive sentence of the Areopagus,\nmarked by an interest of more vital interest to the Athenians[401].\nOn the other hand Greek mythology, despite all the varied and oft\nrepeated use that has been made of it since the revival of the arts\nand learning, has never fully come home to the general sense of modern\nemotions and in various degrees in the plastic arts and still more\nin poetry, despite its very extensive influence here, has failed to\narouse real enthusiasm. No one thinks now of writing an ode to Venus,\nZeus, or Pallas[402]. Sculpture, it is true, can hardly get along even\nin modern times without the assistance of the Greek Pantheon, but for\nthat very reason it is mainly only appreciated by and intelligible to a\nselect circle of cultivated men who are either connoisseurs or critics.\nAs one of these, Goethe spared no pains in his endeavour to arouse\nin contemporary artists an enthusiasm which should go so far as to\nimitate the pictures of Philostratus, but for the most part his pains\nwere thrown away. Such examples of the work of antiquity, on account\nof the very flavour of past time and a life that has vanished, which\nclings to them, remain as strange to contemporary art as they do to\nthe general public. As a contrary example of real success on the part\nof Goethe we may instance the far profounder insight he has shown us\nduring the later period of his poetic activity in fusing by means of\nhis \"West\u00f6stlicher Divan\" the colour of the East with the poetry that\nreally appeals to us to-day, giving to the Orient, in fact, its modern\nembodiment. In this process of assimilation he has clearly shown\nhimself alive to the fact that he is a poet of the West and a German\nas well, and consequently while preserving the fundamental key-note of\nthe Oriental spirit in his delineation of characters and situations to\nwhich it was appropriate, was able at the same time fully to satisfy\nthe claims of the modern spirit and those of his own personality.\nSubject to such reservations it is undoubtedly in the province of a\npoet to borrow his material from remote regions, past centuries and\nforeign nations, maintaining in their broad and most characteristic\noutlines the historical form of ancient mythology, custom, and\ninstitution. At the same time he will take care to utilize such forms\nonly as the external frame of his delineations, never permitting the\nessential content of such productions to fall into any disharmony\nwith the profounder instincts of his own native world. As the most\nextraordinary example of this Goethe's \"Iphigenia\" still stands without\na rival.\nIn their relation to such a transformation the several arts dispose of\ntheir material very differently. In the love-poems of lyrical poetry\nvery little use is made of local associations depicted with historical\naccuracy. The emotional situation and the movement of sentiment is\nhere the main thing. We receive, for example, in the sonnets of\nPetrarch a very small substratum of natural fact relatively to Laura,\nhardly anything more than her name, which might just as well have\nbeen another. Of local interest we get the barest scraps, and that\nentirely of general significance, such as the existence of the fountain\nof Vaucluse and things of that kind. Epical poetry, on the contrary,\nrequires the greatest detail in its natural descriptions, and we are\nmost readily pleased with their historical truth, provided always that\nthe picture is both clear and intelligible. The use of the external\ntruth of historical facts presents the greatest pitfalls to dramatic\nart, more particularly in reference to its theatrical presentation,\nwhere everything is directly addressed to an audience, or purports to\nstrike upon sense with the vividness of life, so that we are willing\nto recognize and entrust ourselves therein with equal directness. Here\nthe delineation of historical truth in its external aspects must for\nthe most part be of subsidiary importance, in fact retain little more\nthan the framework of it. It must, in short, remain true to that\nnatural relation we find in love-poetry, in which at the same time that\nwe are able completely to sympathize with the feelings expressed in\nevery way another name is given to the beloved than that of the lady\nmost loved by ourselves[403]. It does not here in the least signify\nwhether or no our critics fail to discover absolute precision in the\npicture presented of the particular manners, culture, and emotional\nexpression of the time. In Shakespeare's historical dramas we find a\ngreat deal that remains strange to us and of no considerable interest.\nWe are contented enough on a mere reading, but in the theatre our\nenjoyment ceases. Critics and men of learning no doubt stick fast to\ntheir idea that such exquisite scraps of genuine history should be\npresented on the stage on their own merits and come down severely\nupon the wretched taste of the public, when it lets us see how bored\nit is over such things. Unfortunately a work of art and the direct\nenjoyment we receive from it is in no sense particularly for critics\nor savants, but for this very public. Critics have really no reason\nto give themselves such airs. They are after all but units of this\npublic, and the mere attention to historical detail can be of as little\nserious interest to them as any other members of it. For this reason\nthe English nowadays in their theatrical performances only include such\nscenes from the Shakespearean drama which require nothing further to\nmake them clear and intelligible, being happily free from the pedantry\nof our aesthetic professors who held that all that is most remote in\nhistorical incident from the apprehension of an average audience should\nbe thrust before their eyes. It follows also from our view of the\nmatter that when foreign dramas are reproduced on the stage the public\nis clearly entitled to have them considerably remodelled[404]. Even\nthat which is excellent in itself may require some alteration. No doubt\nit will be contended that what is essentially first-rate art retains\nits excellence for all times; but a work of art has also an aspect of\ntransitory worth, which yields to the years, and it is this of course\nwhich requires remodelling. As people change so too the sense of beauty\nalters; and it is important that the particular public, before whom any\nwork is represented, should feel themselves quite at home in the whole\nof such a work including that aspect which derives all its significance\nfrom external history.\nIt is this conditional acceptance of historical truth which at once\nexplains and justifies that which is generally known in Art as\n_anachronism_, and which is usually attributed to artists as a serious\ndefect. Primarily such examples of anachronism will be found to attach\nto matters of purely external interest. That a Falstaff should talk\nabout pistols is no matter of consequence whatever. The case is more\nserious when we have a violin placed in the hands of Orpheus, for here\nthe association of such prehistorical times with an instrument so\nessentially modern as the violin, one which everybody knows was not\ninvented in those days, presents too glaring a violation of truth.\nFor this reason it is now the fashion in theatrical circles to bestow\nincredible pains and care upon the historical accuracy of details in\nthe matter of costume and the getting up of a piece, as, for example,\nthe infinite trouble lavished upon the historical procession in the\n\"Maid of Orleans.\"[405] Such efforts are in the majority of eases\nlost labour, for the simple reason that they only concern matters of\nrelative interest or points that might be wholly passed over. The\nmore important type of anachronisms has nothing whatever to do with\nstage costume and all that with which stage business is concerned,\nbut consists in making characters express their emotions and ideas,\nventure upon soliloquies and actions in a form or of a substance which\nabsolutely contradicts the conditions of their times and culture,\ntheir religious and general preconceptions. It is common to apply the\nconception of natural truth to such examples of anachronism, in other\nwords, to say that it is unnatural for characters to speak or act\notherwise than they would have spoken and acted in their own days. If\nwe stick, however, too closely to the logic of this naturalism we shall\nonly land ourselves in further complications[406]. For an artist, in\ndepicting the emotional life with all that results from it, and the\nfundamental passions that belong to it, being mainly interested in the\naffirmation of individuality, ought not merely to repeat that life\nunder its ordinary daily dress; it is rather his business to show every\ntrue manifestation of pathos in the particular light which best reveals\nits real quality. The whole object of his attainment as an artist is\nnot merely to understand what is of vital significance in the truth\nhe faces, but to be able to give it the precise form which will best\ndirect our own eyes and ears and heart to his own discovery. To attain\nthis it is obvious that he must keep in view the particular culture of\nhis own time no less than all its various powers of expression. In the\ntime of the Trojan war the kind of speech in general use, and indeed\nthe whole fabric of social life, was as far removed from the type of\nculture which is reflected on us from the pages of the \"Iliad\" as the\nmass of the nation and the pre-eminent worthies of the royal houses\nthen reigning in Greece were separated from the fully developed form\nof ideas and expression such as arouse our wonder when we read our\nAeschylus, or behold the perfected beauty of the style of Sophocles.\nA violation of the so-called \"path of Nature\" of this kind is in art\nan anachronism implied in her laws. The inward kernel of that which\nshe reveals remains unaffected, but the more developed power at the\nartist's command, in revealing and disclosing this essential core\nof his subject, renders some change in the mode of its expression\ninevitable. It is a wholly different matter when a modification of this\nkind proceeds so far as to impose ideas and conceptions of a later form\nof the religious and moral consciousness on a century or a nation whose\nentire spiritual outlook is opposed to such more recent conceptions.\nThe Christian religion has gathered in its train forms of the moral\nlife, which were entirely foreign to the moral consciousness of\nancient Greece. That inward introspection of conscience, for example,\never on the alert to decide the ethical significance of action, with\nits accompanying remorse and repentance, first appears in the moral\nculture of a more modern date. The heroic character knows nothing of\na repentance which sets itself in hostility to its past. What it has\ndone it abides by. Orestes does not repent of his mother's murder. The\nFuries that rise out of the shadow of his action pursue him, no doubt;\nbut the Eumenides are, at the same time, represented as universal\npowers, and not as voices that cry out to him from his own conscience\nsimply. This very heart and substance of a given period of man's\nhistory a poet must master, and only when we find him interfusing with\nthis central core of reality matter that directly contradicts it is he\nguilty of any truly grave anachronism. In conclusion, then, we may say\nthat it is indeed part of the poet's function to live into the spirit\nof past times and foreign peoples, for this substance of their life,\nif it be truly such, remains a possession for all time; but to attempt\nto reflect with every accuracy of detail all the definition of that\nexternal show now buried beneath the rust of antiquity is merely the\neffort of a learning essentially childish, intent on preserving what is\nitself shadow rather than substance. No doubt even in this direction,\nthe truth of general outlines should be carefully respected, but never\nto such lengths as would compel art to forfeit her claim of drawing\nupon the fiction of her invention, and the truth of fact with equal\nimpartiality.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) We are now in a better condition to understand all that is\nreally implied in the assimilation by art of that which is strange in\nthe external features of remote history, and the true conception of the\n_objective_ life of her creations. A work of art must primarily enclose\nfor us within its embrace the higher interests of spirit and volitional\npower, all that is essentially human, and possesses real weight, the\ndepths, that is to say, of man's emotional life. The main thing of\nall is that this embodied content[407] should transpierce all purely\nexternal conditions of manifestation, should ring, as it were, through\nall that is less vital in its significance[408] this fundamental\nchord of truth. The real objectivity, therefore, unfolds as from a\nsheath, the _pathos_, that is the substantive content of a situation,\nunfolds, moreover, the rich and powerful personality in which the\nessential phases of spirit are alive, and find their realization and\nexpression. For such embodiment all that is absolutely indispensable\nis a definition and determination of the real, which is generally\nsuitable to the object thus defined, and which requires nothing further\nto explain it. If we have once got hold of such a form unfolded in\nstrict accordance with our Ideal principle, then we have a work of art\nessentially objective in the true sense, and the question whether each\nand every historical detail is justified is of no further importance.\nWe have before us a work of art which appeals directly to our inner\nlife, and one which is our own possession. Once possessed of that, and\nwe may take as much as we please of that element of the form which lay\nmore closely to periods of life which have passed; but the eternal\nfoundation is that which appeals to all men in all places, which is\ncarried forward with a power that never wanes or fails to influence us,\nand it does so because the objective life it reveals is the same that\nabounds in and overflows our own souls. That which is merely historical\nin the appearance is, on the contrary, the element that vanishes; and,\nin dealing with works of art created in days remote from our own, we\nmust do our best to resolve the discordance, and, indeed, must be fully\nprepared to blot out from our vision similar defects in works that\nspring from our own times. Thus it is that the Psalms of David, with\ntheir immortal celebration of the Lord in His goodness, and the wrath\nof His almightiness, no less than the profound sorrows of the Hebrew\nprophets as they face Babylon and Zion, touch men with the same force\nto-day as they did of old time: nay, even a moral diatribe, such as\nis sung by Sarastro in the \"Zauberfl\u00f6te,\" may come home to the hearts\nof us all, including the sons of Egypt[409], owing to the soul and\nvitality which rings through its melodies.\nAnd we may add that every individual to whom a work of art objective\nin this, the true sense, is presented, must on his part discard his\nown false prepossessions, wherein he merely wishes to find his own\nidiosyncrasies repeated. On the first reproduction of \"William Tell,\"\nit appears, not a single Swiss among the audience was satisfied. In\nmuch the same way, when the most beautiful love-songs have been sung,\nmany another, failing to find therein his own passions reflected, has\npresumed to think the beauty untrue to life; just as so many more,\nwhose knowledge of love is confined to the perusal of romances, have\nimagined that the love-god would only then be their immortal possession\nwhen they found themselves face to face with precisely the same\nemotions and situations their favourite studies had propounded.\nC. THE ARTIST\nWe have, in this first part of our aesthetical philosophy, examined as\na first step the universal Idea of beauty; we then proceeded to inquire\nin what respects it was defective in its existence as the beauty of\nNature, and after thus clearing the way we were in a position to grasp\nthe complete notion of the Ideal as the adequate realization of beauty.\nWe developed the Ideal, _first_, as conceived abstractly according to\nthe _general_ notion of it, and having determined that were assisted\nthereby to elucidate the modes of its _particular_ manifestations.\nInasmuch, however, as a work of art has its origin in the human spirit\nit requires the pregnant activity of an individual life from which it\nproceeds, and as the creation of the same exists for others, that is,\na Public which is emotionally receptive. This spiritual and informing\nactivity is the imagination of the _artist_. We have consequently now,\nand this is the _third_ and last aspect of the Ideal to which we shall\nrefer, to raise the question how it comes about that this product of\nmen's inner world is not the direct and native growth[410] of that\nworld, but receives its due form through the _creative impulse_ of\nparticular men, in other words, by virtue of the genius and talent\nof the artist. At the same time we must admit that the question is\nonly raised that we may be able to add the statement that it really\nis excluded from the sphere of scientific investigation, or, at the\nmost, we can only furnish a few general remarks towards its solution.\nYet it is undoubtedly a question frequently raised this, namely, from\nwhat source an artist receives the gift and faculty of conception and\nexecution with which he creates his work. We should all of us like, no\ndoubt, to have a ready prescription, a recipe of what we must exactly\ndo, what conditions we must impose on ourselves to produce something as\nwonderful. We would emulate Cardinal von Este when he asked Ariosto,\nwith reference to his raging Roland: \"But, Master Louis, where in the\nworld did you get all this damned stuff from?\" Raphael replied to a\nsimilar question in a letter we still possess, that he was hunting\nafter a certain idea.\nThe more obvious aspects of artistic activity we propose to examine\nunder the following heads of discussion:\n_First_, we will give our definition of the general conception of\nartistic _genius_ and the inspiration it implies.\n_Secondly_, we will make a few observations on the _objective_\ncharacter of this creative activity.\n_Thirdly_, we will endeavour to ascertain in virtue of what real\nartistic _originality_ consists.\n1. IMAGINATION, GENIUS, AND INSPIRATION\nBefore inquiring more closely into the meaning of the term \"genius\"\nwe must obviously limit the field within which we propose to discuss\nit. Genius is an expression of very wide connotation, and is used\nnot merely in its application to artists, but equally when we refer\nto great generals and kings, as also to the heroic captains of\nscientific discovery. For the sake of simplification we would once\nmore discuss the distinctions involved under a triple division of our\nsubject-matter.\n_(a) The Imagination_[411]\nThe most conspicuous faculty of an artist which arrests our attention\nwhen we direct it expressly upon the capacities implied in artistic\nproductivity is the _imagination._ And we must be careful here not\nto confuse it with a _visionary fancy_ which is wholly passive. The\nimagination creates.\n(_\u03b1_) And, in the first place, we shall find that this creative\nactivity carries with it in possession and endowment a peculiar power\nof _grasping reality_ and the forms it presents, all that through the\nchannels of alert eyes and ears imprints pictures of infinite variety\ncaught from the external world upon the mind, and further implies an\nexceptionally retentive _memory_ wherein to store up this varied world\nof innumerable reflections. The artist, therefore, in this initial\nstage of our analysis is not merely thrown back upon images of his own\ncreation, but is rather compelled to turn aside from the dull level\nof ideals falsely so called and to boldly enter the fields of Nature\nand Life. To attempt art or poetry merely with fanciful ideas of our\nown is always a suspicious way of starting on our journey; for the\nartist must mould his creations from the abundance of his life and by\nno means from the overplus of abstract generalities. It is not, as in\nphilosophy, thoughts, but the real external forms of what actually\nexists which furnishes the material for artistic production. In contact\nwith this raw material to work upon the artist must feel thoroughly\nat home. He must have seen much, heard much, and stored away a great\ndeal as well; and in illustration of this we almost invariably find\nthat a great personality is distinguished by a capacious memory. All\nthat interests mankind he will lay hold of, and the more profound his\nspirit the more it will enlarge the field of its interests in countless\ndirections. This was the way in which we find the genius of Goethe\nfirst opened its wings, and throughout his life the circle of his\nspirit's restless horizon broadened and broadened. This peculiar gift\nof receptiveness, this interest in the comprehension of facts after\ntheir true definitions and colour, their steadfast adherence to the\ntruth of experience is the first thing we look for in a great artist.\nAnd this accurate knowledge of the truth of form must be accompanied\nin equal measure by a proved acquaintance with the souls of men, the\npassions that rise in the heart, and everything that it yearns and\nstrives for. And, in addition to this twofold armory of knowledge, he\nmust understand yet further all the various ways that this world of the\nhuman soul expresses itself on the face of the reality which confronts\nhis senses, transpiercing thus the outer veil.\n(_\u03b2_) But, in the second place, this imaginative power is not exhausted\nwith merely receiving that which is presented to the senses, or is\ninferred as the content of the human soul. The ideal work of art does\nnot merely embrace the outward semblance of the inward spirit as\nclothed in the forms of its actual existence, but should rather succeed\nin manifesting the essential truth and reason of the real itself. This\n_element of reason_, as determined in the particular object the artist\nhas selected, must not merely be pressed in his own consciousness,\nas an active influence, but must already have been reflected upon in\nthat essential and rich significance which brings it into relation\nwith the entire breadth and depth of reality. Without reflection no\nman can grasp fully the wealth that is in him, and it is consequently\nan inseparable feature of any great work of art that everything which\nattaches to it both as a whole and in its detail has been long and\ndeeply weighed and thought out. No artistic work of real sterling value\ncan be thrown off with any mere imaginative _tour de force._[412] We\ndo not, of course, suggest that the artist must therefore comprehend\nin the form of _philosophical_ thought this essential core of reason\nin his experience; albeit such is the fundamental rock upon which\nreligion no less than philosophy and art is based. Philosophy is by\nno means essential to his outfit; and, in fact, if he once begins to\nthink about things as a philosopher, he busies himself with modes of\nthought which are diametrically opposed to that which should engage\nan artist's attention. For what the imagination undertakes to do and\nonly to do is not to bring to consciousness this inner core of reason\nin the form of general propositions and conceptions, but to apprehend\nit clothed in the concrete form of actual existence and individuality.\nAll that ferments within his life the artist must reproduce in the\nbody and envisagement, whose connected picture and general outlines\nhe has already assimilated from the world outside, making such so\nfar subservient to his creative effort that they in their turn may\nparticipate in the truth of his own substance and enable him to crown\nit with complete expression. In this interfusion of an intelligible\ncontent with an embodiment received from actual existence the artist\nwill avail himself of the ever wakeful circumspection of his reflective\nfaculties no less than the deep resources of emotional life which\nleave the stamp of vitality on his work. It is consequently but one\nmore sample of critical aberration to imagine that poems such as the\nHomeric were introduced to our poet in his sleep. Without intelligent\nalertness, division, and distinctions of each part as related to the\nwhole, an artist will be unable to assert his mastery over any form\nwhatsoever that he may wish for; only fools are of the opinion that the\ngenuine artist does not in the least know what his hands and senses are\nabout.\nMoreover, the concentration of the artist's emotional life on each\naspect of his work is also as necessary to its success as the\nconcentration of his mind. For it is mainly through the impression of\nemotion, which permeates and gives a vital colour to the entire work,\nthat the artist asserts his claim to the substance and embodiment of\nhis creation as a part of his own spiritual substance, as something\nhe, a given personality, may peculiarly call his own. For the external\naspect of his work, the mere picture of it as we may say, tends rather\nto place us outside it and apart; it is the emotional energy it\nexpresses which primarily unites it with affinity to our very souls.\nOnly when thus understood shall we be able to realize the truth that\nan artist must not merely have much looked about him in the world and\nassimilated a rich knowledge both of its outward show and the very\nsubstance of its life, but, further, must himself have experienced many\nthings and great things, things that have moved him to the quick and\nleft their life-roots in his own heart and spirit--he must, as we say,\nhave \"gone through much\" and \"lived abundantly\"--before he will find\nhimself able to build from his stores in the concrete types of his art\nsomething approaching Life's unsounded repletion. And this will at once\nexplain and justify the bluster and ferment of genius in its youth, as\namply reflected in the lives of Goethe and Schiller. But only the age\nof maturity and gray hairs will bring us the perfect work of art in all\nits rounded ripeness[413].\n_(b) Talent and Genius_\nThis productive activity of the imagination by means of which the\nartist gives, by a process of elaboration to that which is essentially\nrational in its nature, a real embodiment, a creation more his own than\nanything else--this is what is usually summarized as genius and talent.\n(_\u03b1_) We have already drawn attention to those characteristics which\nare most obviously referable to genius. Genius is the general capacity\nof creating a genuine example of fine art no less than the energy\nimplied in the execution and elaboration of the same. Moreover, this\ncapability and the power which goes with it is essentially the property\nof a human soul; that is to say, self-conscious individuality alone is\nable to create in this sense that a spiritual creation of this quality\nis just what it sets before itself to produce. Critics, intent on\ncloser definition, are wont to distinguish sharply between genius and\ntalent. And, in fact, they are not absolutely the same things, although\nit is necessary to find them united in the artist who would give us\nartistic work of the highest class. To be more exact, Art, in so far\nas it generally becomes a _particular_ art, and is exemplified for us\nin the real and definite appearance of its products, requires various\naccomplishments appropriate to the peculiar modes of its realization.\nSuch forms of executive versatility we may call with propriety talent,\nas we may say that anyone possesses a talent for perfect playing on\nthe violin, or anyone else for singing. But a mere talent for this or\nthat can only effect for us anything really good in the, so to speak,\ninsulated nooks and corners of art[414]; it moreover itself requires\nfor its true perfection something of more universal art-capacity as\nalso that soul-animation, something more which is essentially the\nhall-mark of genius. Talent, in short, without the vital spark of\ngenius, never gets much beyond a purely mechanical facility.\n(_\u03b2_) It is also an opinion very commonly held that superior talent and\ngenius are _inborn._ Here again we must distinguish; for if there is a\nsense in which this is true, from another point of view it is equally\nmistaken. No doubt every man, by virtue of his humanity, receives\nat his birth the potential gifts of religion, thought, and science.\nIn other words he would not strictly be a man if he did not already\npossess a capacity to grasp the idea of a Supreme Being, and generally\nto become the subject of a thinking consciousness. All that he requires\nto gain these things, in addition to the fact of his human birth, are\neducation, culture, and perseverance. With art, however, the matter\nstands differently. Art requires _specific_ aptitude[415], in which\nunquestionably natural endowment plays an essential part. As, that is\nto say, beauty is itself the Idea realized in that which is apprehended\nas real by the senses, and a work of art embodies the workings of\nSpirit in a form of existence immediately cognized by the eye and the\near, in the same way the artist must discover and embody the content of\nhis art not in the exclusively spiritual form of thought, but within\nthe sphere of sensuous perception and feeling, and indeed as creator\nin actual relation to a given sensuous material and within the limits\nof the same. This artistic creativeness consequently encloses within\nitself, as art does throughout, the aspect of immediacy envisaged with\nthe directness of Nature's own creations, and it is this appearance,\nwhich the individual is unable to evolve from himself, but has to find\nit, if he finds it at all, as immediately presented to him. Herein lies\nthe significance of the statement, and herein alone, that genius and\ntalent are innate.\nIn much the same way the several arts adapt themselves as by a kind\nof natural affinity to particular nations. Song and melody are, we may\nalmost say, the birth-gift of an Italian; with our northern peoples,\non the contrary, music[416] and the opera, though seriously cultivated\nand with great success, are as far from being a real home growth as the\norange trees. The Greeks are conspicuous for the native and elaborate\nbeauty of their epic poetry, and most of all for the unique perfection\nof their sculpture. The Romans never possessed an art that was in any\nstrict sense exclusively their own. All that grew into blossom on their\nsoil was transplanted from the gardens of Greece. The art whose growth\nhas the widest natural range is that of poetry; and the reason of this\nis that in it we require least to draw upon a sensuous vehicle for its\nexpressed presentment. Within the province of poetry the folk-song is\nmost of all native to a people and inseparably yoked with their natural\nconditions. For this very reason the folk-song breaks into blossom\neven in times of the rudest culture and for the most part retains the\nunconscious simplicity of Nature herself. Of this Goethe himself is an\nexample. Though he produced works in every type of poetical expression\nhis first songs still go deepest and carry least dust from the study.\nIn them, too, there is least the flavour of culture. The latter-day\nGreek is still a living witness to a people whose native gift it is\nboth to write poetry and sing. Fauriel has published a collection of\nmodern Greek songs, taken for the most part just as women, nurses,\nand school-girls were heard singing them, who could not for the world\nunderstand what he found so wonderful in them. And this is a good\nillustration of the way that we find Art and its specific appearance\nassociate itself with a particular national type. In the same way the\nart of improvization is more than anywhere else the native growth\nof Italy and exemplified there with quite extraordinary talent. An\nItalian will even to-day improvize for you a five-act drama, and not a\nword of it is committed to memory; all grows up out of his experience\nof human passions and situations and the deeply-excited inspiration\nof the moment. As an example we mention the fact that a certain poor\nimprovizer after rhapsodizing in this way for a considerable time, and\nthen finally trudging off on his round to collect his pence from the\nbystanders in a battered hat, was still in such a fume of poetic frenzy\nthat he could not bring his declamations to a stop, waved about in fact\nso lustily with his arms and hands that in the end all the money he had\nbegged was shaken to the winds.\n(_\u03b3_) It is, thirdly[417], a characteristic of genius that it should\npossess, and indeed it is a part of this natural endowment[418],\nfacility in creating that which it is impelled to create, and in\nadapting itself to the technical requirements of all the subsidiary\naspects of artistic work. We talk, for instance, of the fetters with\nwhich the verse, measure, and rhyme shackle a poet; or, when referring\nto a painter, of the endless difficulties that draughtsmanship,\nknowledge of tints, chiaroscuro, and the rest fling in the way of\ninvention and execution. Unquestionably a long course of study is a\nnecessary condition of success in all the arts, a perseverance that\nnever tires, a facility that is continually assisted by repetition;\nthe greater the native strength, however, of the genius or superior\ngift, and the richer its resources the less it will feel the weight of\nits effort in securing all the necessary accomplishments involved in\ncreative excellence[419]. A really first-rate artist has the lust of\nwork _born in him_ and an imperative impulse akin to any other natural\nwant to give artistic form to his emotional and imaginative life that\nis in him. His emotional life and his ideas irresistibly run into this\nartistic mould; he finds as it were the instrument already within him\nmade to the hand, so fitted to express his soul-life that all the pains\nit takes him to learn it are as nothing. A musician can thus unfold to\nus in his melodies the depths of all that stirs and moves his soul and\nonly by this means. What he feels is at once wafted into melody, just\nas the life of a painter is impressed upon form and colour, or that\nof a poet is transmuted into the creations of his imagination, that\npoetry which clothes his ideas in the beauty and music of the written\nword. And this gift of vital form the artist does not merely possess\nas an imaginative power, a phantasy, an emotional impulse \"that leaves\nnot a wrack behind,\" but as a direct stimulus of feeling to active\nenterprise, as a gift, that is, of real executive accomplishment. Both\nof these aspects are united in the real artist. What springs to life in\nhis imagination is immediately alert upon his mobile fingers, precisely\nas the sudden thought of our mind breaks into word from the tips, or\nas our most intimate thoughts, ideas, and emotions are reflected on\nthe outward man and his demeanour. Genius of the real stamp, whenever\nand wherever found, is easily quit of the difficulties presented by\nthe technical workshop; and indeed has found the most beggarly and\napparently impracticable material to accept and embody as it pleased\nthe inward shapes of imagination. No doubt the endowment which the\nartist finds as a direct gift to himself must be kept alive and alert\nby indefatigable recourse to it, but he must also possess naturally a\npractical power of immediate execution. Without this all the facility\nhe may have acquired in imaginative conception will never produce an\nessentially creative work of art. The very notion of art demands of us\nthat both things should go together hand in hand, the productive energy\nof the soul and its technical realization in the forms of art.\n_(c) Inspiration_\nThe activity of the imagination, then, and the power of technical\nexecution, taking both together as the inseparable antecedents of a\nreal artist, are commonly understood as _inspiration._[420]\n(_\u03b1_) The first question that presents itself to us for solution with\nregard to it is under what conditions it arises, as to which many\ndifferent views have been held.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) There is, for instance, the strange notion, to some extent\narising from the general truth of the peculiar intimacy with which\ngenius attaches itself to the worlds of conscious life and Nature, that\ninspiration can be conjured up through mere excitation of the senses.\nBut making our blood dance will not carry us far; we are still a long\nway off from the Muses, despite the champagne bottle, Such, at least,\nwas the experience of Marmontel, for he tells us that he tried it in\na wine-cellar with six thousand bottles of champagne to choose from;\nbut not a breath of the Muses passed over him[421]. Ay, your genius\nmay be as great as he lists, and for all that stretch himself many a\ntime morning and evening on the green grass, while the fresh breeze\nfloats over him, and stare up into the sky, and not a whisper shall the\ninspired Muses breathe in his ear.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) Just as little is it likely that we shall make the charmed gates\nof inspiration spring open by merely presenting ourselves before them\nwith a desire to enter. Whoever fondly imagines that he is in the right\nmood to compose a poem, or paint a picture, or run off a first-rate\nmelody without already possessing the stuff in him to quicken that\nspark into vital form, and has first to hunt about for something to\nsay, despite all his talent, will find himself no better off for his\nbest intuitions, quite unable, at any rate, to conceive any complete\nthing of beauty, or perfect a really sterling work of art. Neither the\nmere tickling of our senses nor any act of will or determination can\nfather on us true inspiration. To attempt such things simply proves\nthat both the emotional life and the imagination have as yet no real\nobject of artistic interest. When once we have the artistic impulse of\nthe real kind, we may conclude the interest there has already its fixed\nseal and object, a content that it intends to master.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) True inspiration consequently is fixed in the presence of a\nspecific content, which the imagination takes up in order to give\nartistic expression to it. It is, in fact, the object of this active\nprocess of giving form both as inwardly made visible to the mind, and\nas outwardly reproduced in the execution of a work of art. Inspiration\nis equally necessary for both these aspects of artistic activity. The\nquestion once more presents itself to us, in what way such a material\nwill come to an artist, in order to bring about this inspiration. We\nfind many various opinions expressed on this head. On the one hand\nit is frequently required of an artist that the material of his work\nshould be drawn up from the world within him. No doubt this may be so\nwhen \"the poet sings as a bird from the bough.\" His own cheerfulness\nof spirit is then the incentive which enables him to represent a\nparticular mood of his own as the content of his production, and by\nthis very expression of it he gives vent to his enjoyment of the same.\nA song of this kind, straight from the heart[422], is indeed a rich\nreward. But quite as often, however, the greatest works of art are\ncreated from the suggestion of objects wholly external to himself.\nThe odes of Pindar were frequently the result of direct commissions;\nand, in the same way, the object and subject has times without number\nbeen given to artists both for buildings and pictures, and they have\nbeen able to arouse in themselves an enthusiasm for such. Indeed, it\nis only too frequently the express complaint of artists that they have\nnot the subject-matter on which to work. Such a reference to things\noutside, and its stimulus to artistic production, presents just that\nrelation of the artist to Nature and her immediacy which is essential\nto the notion of superior executive gifts[423], and is at the same time\na condition to the appearance of genuine inspiration. If we consider\nthe artist from this point of view, we shall find that it is here that\nthis natural endowment relates itself immediately to a material already\nfound for him, and through the incentive thereby offered him, through\nthe inspiration of actual fact, or as, for example, was the case with\nShakespeare, through that which was presented by old tales, ballads,\nromances, and chronicles, proceeds to embody such material in artistic\nform, and thereby generally to express his own personality. The impulse\nto production can therefore be given by something entirely outside the\nartist's life, and the only condition essential to a successful result\nis that the interest, which fixes the artist's attention should be of\nreal artistic significance, and that he is able to reproduce the same\nin all its vitality. Such conditions virtually imply the presence of\nrare inspiration. And an artist who is really alive and awake himself,\nby reason of this very vitality of his own powers, discovers endless\nopportunities for actively asserting the same, and feeling inspired\nwhile doing so, opportunities which pass over other people without\nsimilarly affecting them.\n(_\u03b2_) If we ask further, viz., of what precisely this artistic\ninspiration consists, we may perhaps best describe it by saying that\nit is the capacity of being entirely absorbed in a given subject, a\ncapacity not merely wholly to realize it, but incapable of resting\nuntil the same is completely minted anew, and rounded off in its\nartistic form.\n(_\u03b3_) Moreover, when an artist has thus entirely appropriated his\nsubject, it is but saying the same thing the other way to affirm that\nhe must know how to forget his own individual idiosyncrasies, and all\nthat accidentally attaches to them; he must, in short, on his part lose\nhimself in the matter on hand. He must make his artistic personality\nthe pure form under which the content he has assimilated is clothed and\nembodied. An inspiration in which the particular individual receives\ntoo emphatic a predominance and assertion, rather than being the\nvitally active instrument which displays the ideal significance of the\nmaterial worked upon, is an inferior type of inspiration. This truth\nopens the way to a fuller consideration of what is generally understood\nas the objective character of artistic production.\n2. THE OBJECTIVE CHARACTER OF THE REPRESENTATION\n(_a_) In the ordinary sense of the word we understand objectivity to\nmean that the content in any work of art necessarily receives the\nform of the reality already given, and in its artistic embodiment we\nhave the same clearly repeated. In this sense, that we desire to see\nobjective truth reproduced for us, we are entitled to call Kotzebue an\nobjective poet. In his work we undoubtedly find ordinary reality simply\nas it is again. The object of art is, however, more precisely stated,\nto strip away not merely the appearance, but the actual content of all\nthat meets us every day, and by means of the spiritual activity of the\nartist most personal to himself, to work out that which is essentially\nrational in that content in its really adequate external form. Indeed,\nif we look at yet better examples of art than Kotzebue's, such as those\nwe have already glanced at in the youthful productions of Goethe,\nwe shall find that this realistic type of objectivity can be made\nessentially living in its expression, and by virtue of this quality\nprove highly attractive to ourselves, and yet, on account of the fact\nthat the artistic form remains defective, fail to arrive at the real\nbeauty of art. Purely external objectivity, therefore, which still\nlacks the abiding and substantial significance, is not that for which\nan artist should strive.\n(_b_) A second type of objective realization presents itself to us in\nthe case where we find the external is not the artistic aim, but the\nartist has seized hold of his subject with all the depth and strength\nof his emotional life. This inward aspect of his work remains, however,\nso entirely enclosed within itself and concentrated that it fails to\nassert itself with a clearness thoroughly possessed, or to unfold\nitself in its full truth. The eloquence of pathos simply restricts\nitself by means of illustrations external to it, without possessing\neither the power or the culture to be able to present the fulness of\nthat content in an explicit form. Folksongs pre-eminently belong to\nsuch a mode of artistic production. Extremely simple as they are in\ntheir form, they suggest an emotional life which lies at their root\nof still wider range and depth, but which they are unable clearly to\nexpress. Their art, in fact, is itself not sufficiently elaborate\nor complete enough to carry into the light of day with transparent\nreflection all that it would unfold, and is forced to rest satisfied\nwith suggesting to our sympathies the same by means of an external\nsymbolism. The heart remains thrown back and concentrated upon itself,\nand in order to make its life intelligible to others, casts but a\nfainter reflection of its world upon entirely finite and external\ncircumstances and phenomena, which, no doubt, are thus eloquent in a\ndegree, albeit we receive from them only a far-off echo of the emotions\nand life they would bring home to us. Goethe has himself written many\nquite exquisite songs of this kind. \"The Shepherd's Lament\" is one of\nthe most beautiful. In this refrain a heart that is broken with pain\nand yearning still remains silent and reserved beneath the purely\nexternal traits which would fain relieve it; and, despite of this, we\nhear, as through an undertone, all the concentrated depth of emotion it\nfails to express. In the \"Erl-king,\" and many other of his songs, we\nhear the same tone. This tone, however, we may also meet in degenerate\nform right down to the most futile barbarism, unable to grasp either\nthe essential character of the facts or the situation, merely clinging\nto their most finite aspects in all their crudeness and absence of\nartistic taste. An example we may give from the \"Drummer-comrade of the\nboy Wunderhorn,\"[424] such inanities as \"O thou dwelling house of man,\nO gallows,\" or \"Adjutant sir corporal,\" expressions which are supposed\nto move us deeply. When on the contrary Goethe sings:\nDer Strauss, den ich gepfl\u00fccket,\nGr\u00fcsse Dich viel tausendmal,\nIch habe mich oft geb\u00fccket\nUnd ihn aus Herz gedr\u00fccket,\nAch, wie viel tausendmal[425].\nstrong emotion is suggested in a very different way, which brings\nbefore our mind nothing trivial or contrary to the main idea. What\nhowever is, as a rule, defective in this particular type of poetical\nrealization is the expression of emotion in all its true intensity.\nThis, in the rarest art, should not be suffered to remain a depth shut\naway, which merely reflects a distant echo through the external objects\npresented: it should either break forth in its full character, or be\nseen through the vehicle with complete transparency. Schiller, for\nexample, brings out his soul in its full strength in the pathos of his\nwork, withal a great soul, which penetrates to the very core of his\nsubject, and is able to express its very deepest significance in the\nfreest and most perspicuous way through the wealth and music of his\nverse.\n(_c_) In conformity, then, with the notion of the Ideal, we may\nconclude that even when we are dealing with the mere expression of\nemotional life, we shall never fully establish our title to truly\nobjective art so long as any part of all that is comprised in the\nsubject-matter, which stirs the artistic inspiration, remains still\nwrapped up within the soul that seeks to express itself; rather all\nthat lies there should be completely unfolded, and unfolded in a way\nwhich not merely shall reveal to us the essential soul and substance\nof the content selected, but shall embody it in some completely\nhomogeneous type of individual art, through which, as through a\ntransparency, both soul and substance shall radiate. For that which is\nhighest and most excellent is not by any means that we are unable to\nexpress, as though the poet contained in himself still greater depths\nthan those expressed on the face of his work. The work of an artist is\nthe consummate fruit of that artist, and reflects precisely what he is,\nand only what he is, and all that remains behind in the temple of his\nsoul is a naught or nothing[426].\n3. MANNER, STYLE, AND ORIGINALITY\nHowever much it may be imperatively required of the artist that he\nshould give to his work an objective character such as we have above\nindicated, this must not make us oblivious to the fact that the\nartist's production is at the same time the work of _his_ inspiration;\nit is he alone who has, by his entire identification of his personality\nwith the specific subject-matter and its artistic embodiment, brought\ninto being the entire creation out of the life of his _own_ emotional\nnature and imagination. And it is this identity of the free personality\nof the artist and the truly objective construction of his artistic\ncreation which constitutes the third fundamental aspect of his activity\nas set forth above and which we must now shortly consider, in so far as\nwe may be thus enabled to unite that which we have hitherto separated\nin our independent consideration of the conceptions of genius and\nthe objective presentment of a work of art. We may characterize such\na unity as the conception of true artistic _originality._ Before,\nhowever, we come to close quarters with all that is implied in this\nconception, it is necessary to clearly grasp two points of view already\nrelated to it whose insufficiency we have to expose on the ground of\ntheir one-sidedness before a true conception of originality can be\nfully appreciated. These may be sufficiently indicated by the terms\n\"subjective _manner_\"[427] and _style_.\n_(a) The Subjective Manner_\nThe point of first importance in discussing the meaning of the\nexpression \"artistic manner\" is to differentiate it fundamentally from\nartistic originality. The term \"manner,\" in our view, is only used\nin direct relation to the _specific_ and consequently _accidental\nidiosyncrasies_ of the artist, that is, merely in so far as such\nqualities assert themselves as effective in his work without being\ncalled forth by the nature of the subject itself and its ideal\nexposition.\n(_\u03b1_) A manner thus interpreted has no connection with the universal\ntypes of art, that is to say, types which require an essentially\ndifferent mode of representation, as, for instance, the landscape\npainter necessarily treats the objects of Nature in quite a different\nway from that under which a historical painter would so treat them; or\nthe epic poet would handle similar subject-matter in a different way\nfrom that appropriate to the dramatic poet. On the contrary, \"a manner\"\nis a form of artistic expression wholly emanating from a particular\nindividuality, an entirely supposititious idiosyncrasy of executive\nability which may be carried so far as to contradict absolutely the\ntrue notion of the Ideal. As thus defined \"manner\" stands at the\nbottom of the scale among the forms which may characterize an artist's\ngeneral handling. An artist who thus expresses his individuality simply\ngives free rein to any chance notions of his own without testing them\nas subject to the substantive claims of art. But it is a fundamental\nprinciple of art that it should abolish precisely all that is merely\naccidental to its content no less than to its artistic or rather\nexternal mode of presentment. And this is only to say that it requires\nof the artist that he should efface from his work all traces of purely\npersonal tastes and idiosyncrasies he shares with no one else[428].\n(_\u03b2_) And for these reasons we would point out that \"a manner\"\nof this kind is not so much to be contrasted directly with the true\nexposition of art as to be considered in relation to the purely\nexternal aspects of art where the individuality of the particular mode\nof treatment comes into play. This kind of manner is most conspicuous\nin the arts of painting and music for the reason that these arts[429]\npresent to the artist the widest variety of external characterization\nfor him to seize upon and reproduce. What we find here is a certain\nartificial manner of general execution entirely peculiar to some\nparticular artist and the school of imitators or pupils who follow him,\nwhich through constant repetition degenerates into mere habit.\n(_\u03b1\u03b1_) And its tendency is to develop on one of two ways in which\nwe may regard the artistic work. First, there is the aspect of its\ncomposition. To take painting, for example, we have all the variety\nof ways under which the prevailing atmospheric tone, the arrangement\nof foliage, the contrast of light and shade, in short the entire\nscheme of colour may be treated. Most particularly in this feature\nof the general scheme[430] of the colouring and lighting of a picture\nwe find that painters permit themselves the most varied freedom of\nindividual preference and distaste. Of course such a prevailing tone\nmay appear to us as that we do not find in Nature for the simple\nreason that we have not had our attention directed to it although\nit is really there. But we shall often find that such a scheme has\nsimply been adopted by this or that artist on grounds of personal\ntaste or convenience[431], and it becomes simply a habit in him to use\neverything now as subject to that particular scheme. And what we have\nobserved with reference to colouring is equally true when applied to\nthe treatment of natural objects, their grouping, position, motion,\nand general characterization. This inferior mode of treatment is\nparticularly to be observed in the works of the Dutch school. Take the\ncase of Van der Neer's night-scenes and his artificial presentation of\nmoonlight, or Van der Goyen's sand-hills in so many of his landscapes.\nThe ever-repeated reflections of light from satin and silk stuffs that\nwe find in so many pictures of other masters of the same school are\nindications of the same artificial mode of handling.\n(_\u03b2\u03b2_) A manner of this type may be still further, traced in the\nexecution of other details, the handling of brush or pencil, the laying\non and blending of tints and many other features of executive work.\n(_\u03b3\u03b3_) The general conclusion we come to, after considering all such\nexamples of specialized handling and conception in which constant\nrepetition grows at last habitual to, and indeed becomes a second\nnature of the artist, is this, that just in proportion as the manner\nadopted is more specialized[432], there is an increasing and dangerous\ntendency for it to degenerate into that which is nothing more than a\nsoulless and consequently arid repetition and mechanical exercise,\nthroughout which the artist is no longer present with the fulness of\nhis spiritual resources and the entire strength of his inspiration.\nWhen this takes place his art necessarily sinks to the level of a\nmere executive facility or accomplishment of his hands, and a manner,\notherwise innocent enough, may very readily grow starved and lifeless.\n(_\u03b3_) The more truly artistic \"manner\" has consequently to disengage\nitself from such jejune peculiarities, to broaden out into a freer\natmosphere[433], so that no specialized mode of handling shall be\nsuffered to sterilize itself into what is simply a matter of habit. In\nthis way an artist will approach the facts of Nature with a breadth of\nview more in keeping with her own, and will understand how to identify\nhis larger conceptions and the general technique of his craft with the\nsame ideal spirit. In something of the same sense we may describe it as\na peculiar manner of Goethe that he is particularly apt in concluding\nnot merely poems of society but also openings to works of a more\nserious character with a sudden turn of pleasantry, in order to remove\nthe impression of or throw into the background the serious nature of\nprevious reflection or situation. We meet with the same characteristic\nin the correspondence of Horace. It is, in fact, an application of the\nart of conversation and general sociability, which, in order to avoid\nfollowing up any matter more deeply, comes to a stop, breaks off and\ncleverly diverts the serious into more cheerful channels. Such a mode\nof the literary art is undoubtedly part of the manner of the artist and\nhis individual style, but the individuality thus exemplified is based\nupon a broader principle, and is asserted in a way wholly justified by\nthe artistic purpose of the work in hand. And this particular type of\nan artistic manner will enable us to pass readily to the consideration\nof \"style\" generally.\n_(b) Style_\n_Le style c'est l'homme m\u00eame_ is a famous phrase of the French.\nStyle is here generally understood as the unique characterization of\npersonality, the particular mode of expression, however it may be\napplied, which wholly reveals to us its substance. Herr von Rumohr,\non the other hand (\"Italian Investigations,\" i, p. 87), endeavours\nto interpret the expression as a mode habitual through its constant\nrepetition of bringing together the most vital characteristics of\nthe subject-matter artistically treated, by virtue of which the\nsculptor informs his figures with reality, and the painter gives to\nhis the appearance of life. He further adds important observations\nupon the appropriate form of representation which, in the case of\nan art such as sculpture, the specific _sensuous_ material either\npermits or proscribes. It is, however, not necessary to attach the\nexpression \"style\" solely to this aspect of sensuous material; we may\nunquestionably extend it to all those determinations and rules of\nartistic production which apply naturally to any particular type of\nart, and in virtue of which an object is reproduced in the medium of\nany one of them. We consequently distinguish in the art of music the\nstyle of church music from that of opera, and in that of painting, the\nhistorical style from the style of _genre_ painting. Style is therefore\na mode of artistic presentation, which not merely follows closely the\nfundamental conditions of its material, but asserts itself as adequate\nto all that any particular type of art demands for its composition and\nexecution and in strict conformity with the laws which apply to the\nsubject-matter on hand. Defect of style will then, in this extension\nof the meaning, either imply an inability to present a composition\nin accordance with such necessary conditions, or will amount to a\npersonal caprice which rather gives free rein to its own particular\npredilections than accepts the conditions of composition which are\nreally proposed to it, in other words adopts an inferior \"manner\"\nof its own. Consequently it is inadmissible, as Herr von Rumohr has\nalready pointed out, to apply principles peculiar to one type of art to\nanother, as Mengs has done in his famous museum in the villa Albani,\nwhere both in the general conception and execution of his Apollo he\nadopts the modes of colouring applicable only to sculpture. A defect\nof the same kind may be traced in many of the pictures of D\u00fcrer, where\nwe see that even in painting, especially in the folding of his drapery,\nhe adopts the style of wood-cut in which he is so consummate a master.\n_(c) Originality_\nThe final result, then, of our inquiry on this head is that true\noriginality does not consist in merely conforming to the paramount\nconditions of style, but in a kind of inspired state[434] personal\nto the artist which, instead of committing itself wholly to a\nmere external manner of composition, seizes hold of a particular\nsubject-matter that is essentially rational, and by virtue of its own\nresources and quality, re-clothes the same as from within the artist\nhimself and not merely in a way conformable to the essential notion of\nthe art adopted, but also in a form adequate to the universal notion of\nthe Ideal.\n(_\u03b1_) True originality is consequently identical with true objectivity,\nand combines that which is due to the personality of the artist and\nthe actual subject-matter of his work in such a way that both aspects\nof his artistic product are held together in complete accord. Looked\nat in one way, such a work appears to reveal to us the very essence\nof the artist's personality, while regarded from another we only find\nthere the essence of the subject-matter artistically treated, so that\nthis very uniqueness of expression appears to arise from the unique\ncharacteristics of the material to which it is applied; and we may\nsay with equal truth either that the expressed form is due to those\ncharacteristics, or that this unique impression we obtain from them\nproceeds from the creative unity of the artist.\n(_\u03b2_) True originality must be entirely kept distinct from individual\ncaprice and every kind of personal expression that is due to fortuitous\ncauses. A common idea of originality is simply the stringing together\nof so many curiosities, things which this particular individual and\nno other could perpetuate or even faintly imagine. That is, however,\nmerely idiosyncracy gone mad. No people on earth are more original in\nthis meaning of the term than Englishmen, a country where every one\nprides himself on committing some folly or other, which no man in his\nsenses is likely to repeat, and then fondly imagines his performance to\nbe original.\nWe may in this connection briefly refer to what has been so extolled,\nand never more than in our own days as the originality of wit and\nhumour. An artist of this type of humour starts off from a point of\nview or an experience wholly personal to himself, and constantly\nrecurs to the same so that the real object of his artistic production\nis merely treated as the peg on which he may hang, or the field in\nwhich he may give full play to, whatever wittiness, jest, quirks,\nand sallies his mood may chance to light upon. In this way the real\nobject of his art and that which should render it vital in himself fall\nentirely apart, and we have a capricious mode of artistic production,\nin which the idiosyncrasy of the artist is made to appear as of first\nimportance. A humour of this kind is often replete with intellectual\nbrilliance and deep feeling, and in its general result is very apt to\nimpose on us; yet for all that it is not generally such a difficult\nmatter as is commonly believed. To constantly interrupt the rational\ncontent of that which we are really dealing with, interrupting\nall steady progress with a stream of capricious fresh starts and\nconclusions, a sort of patchwork of whims and emotional excursions,\nand thereby to create a caricature of imaginative vigour is far\neasier than to develop and round off with completeness an artistic\nwhole of sterling quality throughout such as will testify to the real\nIdeal. Moreover, our humour nowadays is only too ready to give us\nthe repulsive features of a talent for wit essentially crude, and is\nconstantly degenerating into coarse buffoonery and emptiness. We do\nnot often get from it real humour at all. The stalest trivialities are\nwont to pass now for brilliancy and depth of soul provided they only\nrig themselves out in the pretentious motley of humour. Shakespeare, on\nthe contrary, possessed a grand and profound sense of humour, but even\nhis works are by no means destitute of shallows. The humour of Jean\nPaul too often surprises us with the depth of its wit and the beauty\nof its sentiment, but we are quite as often repelled by the absurdly\neccentric way in which he hitches together his subjects, or rather\nleaves them with the bare jointure to lie apart, and then floods all\nhe has to say with a kind of humour that leaves it almost impossible to\nmake head or tail of. No humourist, however great he may be, is likely\nto find anything resembling it in his memory; and our main impression\nis frequently, even in the case of Jean Paul's kaleidoscopic effects,\nthat they are rather the result of mechanical pasting together than\na spontaneous product from the crucible of genius. For this reason\nJean Paul finds it necessary, in order continually to present new\neffects, to drag into books differing wholly in kind, botanical, legal\nand philosophical disquisitions, no less than descriptions of travel;\nwhatever whim in fact may strike his fancy at the time is promptly\ninserted. Even when his subject relates to scientific discovery he will\nrun together the most heterogeneous material such as a collection of\nBrazilian plants and observations upon the old imperial chamber[435].\nThere are people who will praise a motley of this kind as original. But\nit is really precisely the kind of caprice which originality of the\ngenuine stamp excludes.\nWhile we are on this topic it will not be out of place to add some\nfurther remarks upon irony, which particularly prides itself upon\npresenting us with the very flower of originality on just those\noccasions when it has ceased to treat any artistic material with\nseriousness and converts the whole affair into a subject of witticism,\nonly worth notice for the sake of the wit it suggests. Looked at from\nanother point of view this irony rakes together a lot of things which\nare quite foreign to the essence of the matter in hand, things the\ndeeper significance of which the poet keeps to himself, and his notion\nseems to be that by this subtle exercise of his powers the imagination\nwill be enlarged. And it is just in external associations of this sort\nthat we get what we have already described as the poetry of a poetry,\nwherein everything that is deepest and most excellent is concealed from\nus for no other reason than this, that we must not be allowed to look\nat it because it is so profound. And we really find in Friedrich von\nSchlegel's poetry, more particularly when he became vain over his title\nto the rank of poet, that which clearly is set forth as the aroma of\nall is just that which is never expressed: no wonder this poetry of\npoetry turns out to be the flattest prose.\n(_\u03b3_) A genuine work of art must consequently be held intact from all\noriginality of this perverse type. True originality will be asserted\nthroughout by this and this alone, that the work has the appearance\nof being the unique creation of _one_ individual mind, which does\nnot go about picking up scraps from around it and then make thereof\na patchwork, but permits the material of that work, in complete\naccordance with the unity most congenial to its own substance, to bind\nitself together in a whole all parts of which are strictly related,\nas truly stamped with one mint as the founder's cast. When we find\nscenes and motives introduced upon grounds that are foreign to the\nreal artistic purpose, that is to say, which do not directly grow out\nof the true subject, we must inevitably lose that subtle and necessary\nconnection of all the parts which create this unity, and what we thus\ninterpolate will unavoidably impress us as something fortuitously\nattached by personal caprice. Much in this way it has been the fashion\nto give exceptional praise to the \"G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\" of Goethe\non the grounds of its great originality. No doubt it is true enough,\nas we have above remarked, that in this drama Goethe has with much\nintrepidity given the lie direct to and turned his back upon all that\nhad been taken as the established principles of the aesthetic science\nof his age; the execution of this work, however, does not bear the\nstamp of genuine originality. One finds, on the contrary, in this\nyouthful production indications of the poverty of the material upon\nwhich it is founded, so that many traits and entire scenes appear\nto have been raked together and united by connections foreign to\nthe subject from material of an interest contemporary with that of\nthe artist's life instead of being the genuine elaboration of the\nfundamental subject-matter. The scene, for example, between G\u00f6tz and\nbrother Martin, where Martin Luther is clearly suggested, contains\nideas which Goethe could only have borrowed from a time such as his own\nwhen people began once more to wail over the conditions of monastic\nlife, how they durst not drink wine, could only sleep off their meals,\nwere at the mercy of evil desires and generally must submit to the\nthree intolerable vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Brother\nMartin, on the other hand, grows enthusiastic over the knightly life\nof G\u00f6tz, how he recalled to memory the load of booty he took from\nhis foe, whom he ran through with lance on horseback before he could\nshoot, then tumbled over, horse and all, and finally returned to his\ncastle and wife. Whereupon the good monk drinks the health of the dame\nElizabeth, wiping his eyes the while. With mundane reflections of\nthis sort Luther never started on his journey, but rather as a pious\nmonk who had penetrated to their depths the religious conceptions\nand convictions of Augustine, another source altogether. Subject to\nprecisely similar defects are the pedagogical references to that period\nwhich occur in the following scene and for which Vasedow is mainly\nresponsible. We are informed that children of that age are taught much\nthat is unintelligible, that the true method of instruction should\nrather educate their minds through the senses and experience. Karl, for\nexample, repeats phrases to his father by heart precisely similar to\nthose current in Goethe's own younger days: \"Junthausen is a village\nand castle on the Junt and for two hundred years has been the ancestral\nproperty of the lords of Berlichingen.\" When G\u00f6tz asks him if he knows\nany lord of Berlichingen personally the lad stares blankly at him and\nthrough sheer over-teaching does not know his own father. G\u00f6tz declares\nthat he knew every path and road in the country before he knew the\nnames of a single river, village, or mountain. All this kind of thing\nis mere literary stucco which has nothing to do with the actual subject\nat all. And when an occasion does arise in which we ought to find some\nreally characteristic grip of the very marrow of the subject, as in the\nconversations between G\u00f6tz and Weisslingen, we get nothing more than\ncold reflections upon the times.\nWe find much the same association of irrelevant matter in the same\npoet's \"Wahlverwandschaften.\"[436] The laying out of pleasure grounds,\nthe living pictures, the observations upon pendulum oscillations, the\ntesting of metals, the headaches, the entire description of elective\naffinities, which is borrowed straight from chemical science, are all\nof this category. It may, of course, be freely admitted that in a\nromance, referring to an essentially prosaic age, such things are _prima\nfacie_ admissible, and more particularly so when we have a Goethe to\nintroduce them so cleverly and apply them so charmingly; moreover no\nwork of art of any kind can be kept wholly unaffected by the culture\nof the artist's own age. It is one thing to allow the reflection of\ncontemporary culture to appear as part of the artistic whole, quite\nanother to bring together such material of research in a way that\nplaces it as something wholly outside and independent of the genuine\nsubstance of the composition. For the true originality of the artist no\nless than that of his work consists exclusively in their being vitally\nbound up with that which is only intelligible as part of the real\nsubject-matter treated. When the artist has fully Appropriated this\nobjective reason, without mixing up with it, to the detriment of its\nclarity, details he may have borrowed from his personal experience or\nother sources which do not strictly belong to it; in that case alone\nwill he stamp the material with the genuine mark of his own artistic\nmintage. This personal effect upon his work merely serves him as a\nbridge of Life over which he passes to secure a work of art wholly\ncomplete in itself, just as in all genuine thought and action true\nfreedom consists in allowing that which is of essential significance to\nassert itself without restraint, so that it becomes itself the force\nwhich dominates both the particular thought and volition of the man\nwho thus appropriates it, and by so doing reconciles every vestige of\nopposition. In this way the originality of art absorbs every accidental\ntrait peculiar to a given personality; but it only absorbs it that the\nartist may follow without reserve the impulse and bent of his genius as\ninspired through every fibre of the material he moulds, and instead of\nreflecting a purely barren wilfulness and caprice of his own may give\nan objective form to his true artistic individuality conjoined with\nconsummate accomplishment. To have no \"manner\" was ever the one great\n\"manner,\" and in this sense alone can we ascribe originality to Homer,\nSophocles, Rafael, and Shakespeare.\n[Footnote 271: _Einer specifischen Seele._ We certainly should not in\nordinary speech say that inorganic objects possessed a soul. The phrase\nindeed is difficult to follow, except as explained by the previous\ntechnical discussion of _Einzelheit._]\n[Footnote 272: The expression _in dieser der Allgemeinheit\nentgegengehobenen \u00c4usserlichkeit_ refers to the manifold in opposition\nto which the principle of universality is posited as a test for the\nselection of those aspects which manifest it as vital individuality.]\n[Footnote 273: _Seligkeit._]\n[Footnote 274: _Heiterkeit._ I cannot satisfy myself with one English\nword.

In fact Hegel\nshows more insight here than Coleridge.]\n[Footnote 350: _Nicht \u00fcber Hamlet haltlos verf\u00fcgt._ It is also obvious,\nI think, that such a passage need not necessarily be opposed to\nGoethe's main conception. Such ideas may readily be explained as the\nexcuses of a man who inherently shrinks from forming a grave resolve of\nvigorous action. No doubts are suggested when Hamlet sees the ghost.]\n[Footnote 351: _Den eigentlichen Mittelpunkt._ Between what? I think\nthe examples show that it is both between a work of human art and\nNature and between the work of art itself and those to whom it is\naddressed.]\n[Footnote 352: Lit., Screws itself like a corkscrew into.]\n[Footnote 353: _Ausmalung_. The metaphor is taken from the art of\npainting and technically refers to the finish of the same in all its\ndetails. It is here used generally.]\n[Footnote 354: Vol. i, p. 153. I do not know the book.]\n[Footnote 355: _Als bewegendes Pathos._ This may mean \"as the motive\nprinciple of pathos,\" but I incline to the interpretation \"as the\npathos which affects others.\"]\n[Footnote 356: This appears at first sight to be somewhat contrary to\nthe statement made above (p. 309) that \"We cannot affirm pathos of\nthe gods.\" But if my translation in the above passage is the right\none _Die G\u00f6tter werden zum menschlichen Pathos_, I think we must\nunderstand _Die G\u00f6tter_ here in a more universal sense of the Divine\nthan in the former passage, and find the emphasis here is laid upon the\nword _menschlichen._ It is, in fact, but another way of stating the\nincarnation of the Divine in humanity.]\n[Footnote 357: _Als totale Individualit\u00e4t_, _i.e._, all that is\ncomprised in its essential notion.]\n[Footnote 358: _Der handelnden Character_, _i.e._, Character manifest\nin the action.]\n[Footnote 359: _Ausser sich_, \"goes to the dogs,\" as we say in vulgar\nparlance, _i.e._, ceases to be character in the true sense at all.]\n[Footnote 360: This example shows us that by the expression _fr\u00fcheren\nG\u00f6tter_ above Hegel must be referring to prehistoric times and quite\narchaic conceptions of Greek godhead.]\n[Footnote 361: _Eines in sick gebildeten Innern. Gebildet_ here used in\nthe sense of perfected, rounded to a co-ordinated content.]\n[Footnote 362: _Hineingegraben_, lit., buried in.]\n[Footnote 363: I am unable to express in two words the contrast\npresented by the German _tragen_ and _ertragen._]\n[Footnote 364: It is not easy to strike the exact interpretation of\nsuch a word as _Quetschlichkeit._ Apparently this or the more usual\nterm _Quabbelig_ have the sense of \"shaking.\" I believe there is a\nsynonym for quaker's grass, viz., quatch-grass.]\n[Footnote 365: _Und durch sie sich hindurchziehen._ The most obvious\nsense of these words would be: and (_i.e._, the threads) carry\nthemselves on through it (_i.e._, externality). Perhaps the meaning is\nthat the relations in question not merely unite the Ideal to the world\nbut are carried beyond (with the Ideal) the natural external world into\nthat higher plane of the objective spiritual world. In my translation\nI have practically evaded the difficulty and assumed there is either\nsomething missing, or we must understand, I admit, a very harsh change\nof subject.]\n[Footnote 366: Through self-consciousness he is both the individual\nsubject and the form of an infinite content.]\n[Footnote 367: _Eine subjektive Totalit\u00e4t._]\n[Footnote 368: I have amplified this sentence to make it quite clear\nto which of the three worlds, viz., (_a_) the subjective world in its\nabstraction, (_b_) the external world in its abstraction or, finally,\nthe world of reality, in which _a_ and _b_ are mutually related, the\nwriter here refers.]\n[Footnote 369: _In welche die in sick totale Einheit des Ideals nicht\nmehr ihrer konkreten Geistigkeit nach hineinzuscheinen bef\u00e4higt ist._\nLit., Into which the self-complete unity of the Ideal is no longer\ncapable of penetrating by virtue of the concrete spirituality which it\nessentially is.]\n[Footnote 370: An obvious distinction between the arts of architecture\nand garden-construction is that in the former all the materials used\nhave been already informed by human hands at least where building is in\nany advanced stage.]\n[Footnote 371: Hegel's actual words would seem to imply that the fact a\ngarden is created for use and enjoyment is detrimental to its beauty.]\n[Footnote 372: It must be admitted that this summary treatment of\ngardens is not very satisfactory. No doubt the best authorities concur\nin the view that the formal garden is more artistic than the landscape,\nbut hardly on the main ground given here. Landscape gardening such as\nwe find it in our great English country houses has a real justification\nof its own. And with regard to the reason given that a garden should be\nentirely subordinate to the human object do we not strike here upon a\nweakness which is to a certain extent apparent also in Hegel's theory\nof the artistic purpose of architecture. I think it must be admitted\nthat though it is true the object of both these arts is not entirely\nfor their own beauty, and in certain cases, not even primarily so,\nas in the case of a senate-house or ordinary garden, yet where the\nartistic purpose is manifested throughout with great deliberation they\nmay be essentially an independent work of art; take the case,.of a\ncathedral, for example, or a really beautiful and homogeneous formal\ngarden.]\n[Footnote 373: _Element_, subject-matter would be really a better word.]\n[Footnote 374: _Kein bloss quantatives._ They are not like a heap of\nstones, for example, but they possess relations which qualify each\nother, as of course the heap of stones will do in so far as it is\ndistinguished by diversity of colour.]\n[Footnote 375: I think this must be the meaning of the words _noch ah\nblass aufgel\u00f6ste Gegens\u00e4tze auftreten._]\n[Footnote 376: _Grau_ is the word Hegel uses, but I think he must\nuse it in the sense I have translated it. Gray in itself is a very\nbeautiful compound, and the subtlety of its use is that which is one of\nthe distinguishing characteristics of the very greatest colourists such\nas Turner and Velazquez.]\n[Footnote 377: I am not quite sure that Hegel means this exactly, but\nit is no doubt what an artist would mean and in water-colour especially\nit is of the utmost importance. Compare the flesh colour of the artists\nsuch as our Watts or Titian with that of Leighton. One of the most\nmarvellous examples I know is a small picture of Titian, the subject\nof which is Herodias with the head of John the Baptist, in one of the\npalaces at Rome. But a modern critic would, apart from the question of\ndirtiness, about which there can be no doubt, say that Hegel insists\ntoo much, precisely as Ruskin does, on the superiority of the pure\nsingle colour.]\n[Footnote 378: Hegel appears to be himself slightly incorrect here.\nNo doubt a string may ring false if it is not tightly fastened or if\ntoo slack or too long it may produce sounds the human ear is unable\nto appreciate. But primarily what musicians mean by a string ringing\nfalse, with wolf notes and so on, is due to the bad material or false\ncomposition of the string itself.]\n[Footnote 379: _Disparat_, _i.e._, composed of different elements, not\nmerely separate in position.]\n[Footnote 380: I think the expression _ein blosses an-sich_ must mean\nthis here. Of course the usual meaning is that of something potential,\nunrealized, but here I think it rather signifies \"not objectively or\nreally valid.\" No doubt in relation to the heads of discussion it is\npotential also.]\n[Footnote 381: _Die traurige B\u00fcnkels\u00e4ngerei._ I think the adjective\nmust here rather refer to the contrast than to the nature of the\npoetry. I presume the Minnesingers are referred to.]\n[Footnote 382: I do not know what book this is, nor have I ever heard\nof a hero with the name of _Otnith._]\n[Footnote 383: Or rather by virtue both of its medium and object.\n_Ihrer Natur nach_ are Hegel's words.]\n[Footnote 384: _Jenem ersten Ansichseyenden._ That is to say, a\nrelation indefinite, but essentially implying a further realization.]\n[Footnote 385: _Es nur eine unwahre Abstraction bezeigen w\u00fcrde._ \"Lack\nof comprehensiveness\" would, of course, be more literal.]\n[Footnote 386: _In ihrem abstracten Gehalt._ That is, regarded simply\nas the opinions of a private individual, and apart from all that may be\nimplied in it under more universal relations.]\n[Footnote 387: _Der Zustand der allgemeinen Bildung_, not an easy\nphrase to translate: the \"Culture-State\" perhaps sums it up most\ncompletely. \"The state of universal education\" is too indefinite or\ngoes too far.]\n[Footnote 388: The whole spirit of this passage is a striking witness\nto Hegel's admiration for classical art. Whether the arguments brought\nforward are wholly sound when we consider them in connection with the\nElizabethan drama, for example, may readily admit of a question. At\nthe same time, as Hegel himself points out, Shakespeare unquestionably\nthrows the time back to what is practically a mythical age in at least\nthree of his greatest tragedies, \"Hamlet,\" \"Macbeth,\" and above all\n\"King Lear.\"]\n[Footnote 389: For the element of beauty implied in ordinary\ncraftsmanship, and the modern view, pressed so strongly by William\nMorris and others, of this aspect of art and its modern necessity, the\nreader should peruse Professor Bosanquet's valuable \"Three Lectures on\nAesthetic\" (see particularly Lecture II, p. 61 _et seq._).]\n[Footnote 390: Even an admirer of our author must admit, I think, here\nthat the argument is somewhat overstrained. That Hegel possessed real\nhumour and yet more irony few will deny who have studied him, but at\ntimes \"the man with a theory\" rather tends, as is so frequently the\ncase with our German cousins, Goethe himself not excepted, to swallow\nup such sanative juices altogether.]\n[Footnote 391: I presume the meaning is that the poem in the shape we\nnow have it dates some 400 years after the Trojan war. But it is not\nvery clear from Hegel's language whether he regards Homer as the poet\nwho, as in the case of his example of the poet of the Niebelungenlied,\nfused that together or no. For if he did how could he have lived\nthrough the poems, an expression itself which is rather vague, more\nparticularly as the better opinion is that they represent a different\nage themselves.]\n[Footnote 392: _Vern\u00fcrnbergert._ A word of course coined by Hegel. Made\nthem, that is to say, at home in the Nuremberg of Hans Sachs.]\n[Footnote 393: \"Best of all things water.\" Compare Meredith's exquisite\npoem \"Phoebus with Admetus,\" \"Water, first of singers o'er rocky mount\nand mead,\" etc., stanza 3.]\n[Footnote 394: The drama of Racine.]\n[Footnote 395: What this word means I do not know--possibly\nquill-feathers.]\n[Footnote 396: _Eine grosse Genialit\u00e4t._ \"First-rate genius\" is rather\ntoo strong, \"talents of the highest rank\" would be more literal. We\nhave no word that expresses _Genialit\u00e4t._ As the passage is ironical I\nhave allowed \"genius\" to pass.]\n[Footnote 397: _Wir haben schlecht gestanden._ Literally, \"there is\nsome mistake between us.\" But the idiomatic sense I presume is, \"You've\nmade a bad shot this time.\"]\n[Footnote 398: What would Hegel have said of the first scene in the\n\"Merchant of Venice\"? No doubt Shakespeare's play contains very much\nmore than such scenes, and there is a profound significance in that\nopening scene, for it at once emphasizes the collision of families upon\nwhich the entire tragedy turns. But is such a defence needed? There\nappears to be indubitably a certain deficiency in the above criticism.\nThere is no reason that a scene in which a couple of peasants and two\ntroopers are the _dramatis personae_ should not be infinitely amusing\nprovided a Shakespeare, or even a Goethe, when he is not in one of his\ndull moods, performs the office of teaching them how to speak.]\n[Footnote 399: This surely goes too far unless \"interest\" is taken\nstrictly to mean artistic interest which would appear to be so from\nthe context. Everything that has once interested or affected mankind,\nhowever remote, has at heart an historical and antiquarian interest,\nand I am not sure that we should not be right in adding a general human\ninterest. At least such is almost a dogma with a poet of the type of\nBrowning.]\n[Footnote 400: I do not know the Teutonic poem here referred to. But\nwhat about Wagner's famous tetralogy? The above arguments, though\ncontaining much that is true, appear to overlook for one thing the\nsymbolic significance of mythological history, and in a certain\nsense to be lacking in sympathy for everything that is not modern or\nHellenic. How very differently Carlyle, for example, referred to this\nvery mythology, and his learning was not profound in the German sense.]\n[Footnote 401: The intention of Aeschylus went, of course, much\nfarther than this, and the entire play is essentially one written by a\nstaunch conservative against modern innovation.]\n[Footnote 402: It is strange that Hegel should have ventured such a\ngeneralization in the face of his old friend Holderlein's poetry.\nIn England some fine poems have been written such as Lady Margaret\nSackville's hymn to Dionysus and Swinburne's to Proserpine. But for\na good essay in support of the main contention I know none equal to\nRussell Lowell's Essay on Swinburne's \"Atalanta.\" I think that both\nour author and the critic who supports him somewhat fail to recognize\nthe permanent reality, whether symbolical or directly spiritual, that\nan increasing number of men find in these Hellenic personalities, as\nillustrated in the poetry of Meredith, to take the finest flavour of\nthe type.]\n[Footnote 403: I presume this is the meaning of _unserer eigenen\nGeliebten_, but from the example given of Petrarch's Laura one would\nrather have expected that it was the poet's beloved whose name was not\ngiven. In any case the sense is rather obscure.]\n[Footnote 404: I think it must be admitted that Hegel goes too far\nin the other extreme. The best tendency of our times is to reproduce\nShakespeare as near to the best authenticated text as possible.\nNo doubt our adaptation of French plays is in a certain sense an\nillustration of Hegel's contention; but generally it is recognized that\nwhere a work is great, as for example in the case of our Greek plays,\nit is far better to let them speak for themselves, and attempt no\nbotching.]\n[Footnote 405: Schiller's play.]\n[Footnote 406: _Schiefheiten_, errors that divert truth from its path.]\n[Footnote 407: We should rather have expected _Erhalt_ than _Gehalt_\nhere. _Gehalt_ means, therefore, the essential part of the entire\nmanifestation.]\n[Footnote 408: _Durch all das anderweitige Getriebe_, _i.e._, through\nall that is otherwise mechanical.]\n[Footnote 409: I am not certain whether there is a definite allusion\nhere to anything in particular, or whether the Egyptian is taken\nto signify any folk outside Western culture, with possibly some\nsubtle suggestion of those who held the favoured people in bondage,\nPhilistines in short.]\n[Footnote 410: _Herausgeboren ist_, cast forth, that is to say, as the\nnatural growth of it--as Minerva from the head of Zeus.]\n[Footnote 411: Imagination appears to me the best translation of\n_Phantasie._ Our English word, however, seems rather to lie between\nit and _Vorstellung_. Practically Hegel means here what we mean when\nwe distinguish it from fancy (_Einbildungskraft_), though in Ruskin's\noriginal and most suggestive analysis of the terms, \"fancy\" of course\nimplied a limited power of creative activity or at least associative\nactivity.]\n[Footnote 412: _Leichtfertigkeit der Phantasie_, _i.e._, a careless\nfacility of imaginative activity.]\n[Footnote 413: It must not be overlooked, however, that, especially\nin the arts of music and painting, genius may have reached maturity\nat a very early period, as was the case with Mozart, Rafael, and many\nanother.]\n[Footnote 414: _Ganz vereinzelten Seite._ It is a little strange to\nfind such an expression applied to the arts of violin-playing or\nsinging. But the emphasis is not so much on the art as a whole as to\nthe technical aspect of execution.]\n[Footnote 415: _Anlage_, lit., a laying to, an impulse in a certain\ndirection.]\n[Footnote 416: This statement is rather surprising from a fellow\ncountryman of Bach, Handel, Mozart, etc., down to Wagner and Strauss.\nThe explanation appears _first_ to be due to the distinction between\na national impulse toward popular singing which the Italian no doubt\npossesses, and a deep-rooted emotional life which finally discovers\nits supreme mode of expression in the art of instrumental music as\ndeveloped by the Teuton stock. _Secondly_, it is quite clear, I think,\nfrom Hegel's correspondence that he had no real sympathy for orchestral\nmusic though an enthusiastic admirer of opera, particularly Italian\nopera.]\n[Footnote 417: The other two aspects were: (_a_) That genius is a\nspiritual activity and in its operation offers a contrast to talent,\nwhere the personal initiative is not so prominent, (_b_) It has a\ncertain aspect which may be called innate.]\n[Footnote 418: It is a little surprising to find Hegel tracing\ntechnical accomplishment to the native gift. At least all technical\naccomplishment has to be learned.]\n[Footnote 419: This is the real point. Whatever ignoramuses may say of\nthe \"shackles\" of verse poets know only too well that they supply a\nsupreme stimulus to imaginative powers both in virtue of the atmosphere\nof music into which they are thus carried and the suggestiveness of\nthe words themselves. What Hegel's analysis appears rather to fail in\nis his perception of the unconscious work in the greatest men when\nworking in most inspired moments whether in painting or poetry--the\nextraordinary power of their intuition.]\n[Footnote 420: No doubt Hegel does not use our word \"inspiration\" in\nquite the sense it is usually used, and I should have said even less\nso the German word. At the same time we do apply the word inspiration\nto the technical execution and most justly where it is used as a\ndistinction.]\n[Footnote 421: Meredith in a letter to a correspondent expresses the\nsame conviction. He even adds that he thinks Schiller's compositions\nwere by no means improved by artificial stimulants.]\n[Footnote 422: The Germans say, a song which \"rings straight from the\nthroat,\" _der aus der Kehle dringt._]\n[Footnote 423: _Welche zum Begriff des Talente geh\u00f6rt._ Talent no\ndoubt to some extent includes genius here, but mainly in its aspect of\nproductive power.]\n[Footnote 424: I do not know the composition and cannot make much\nof the quotations. For all I know _Tamboure-gesellen_ may be the\ndrummer-boy himself.]\n[Footnote 425: This translation may pass perhaps:\n\"This little nosegay plucked by me\nA thousand times may it greet thee!\nHow many thousand times have I\nBowed over it; how many times\nPressed it to heart; how many times!\"\n[Footnote 426: Or, as Hegel puts it, \"_that_ he is not.\"]\n[Footnote 427: We should rather say a personal or individual manner\nperhaps.]\n[Footnote 428: I have translated _Zuf\u00e4lligen_ here with the words \"he\nshares with no one else.\" The suggestion is that there is no warrant or\nprinciple to support them.]\n[Footnote 429: It is rather surprising to find Hegel including music\nhere rather than sculpture or architecture, especially the latter,\nwhich seems peculiarly adapted to illustrate what I understand to be\nhis general point of view. His own illustrations throw no light on the\nmatter as they are borrowed from painting or poetry.]\n[Footnote 430: I presume the difference here alluded to is such as we\nmay see if we contrast the tone of a Correggio, for instance, with that\nof a Titian or a Rembrandt.]\n[Footnote 431: _Er hat ihn sich angeeignet._ Lack of artistic power is\nthe main factor in an artificial style. Though there are doubtless many\nexamples of men forced to paint in a way much below their true powers\nto obtain a living. But it must be admitted Hegel does not express\nhimself very clearly. Individuality of handling is essential to a great\nmaster. The real point is that it should not crystallize into a _mere_\nhabit, as in the Bologna school of painters.]\n[Footnote 432: \"Artificial\" would perhaps come closer to the mark.]\n[Footnote 433: _In sich selbst zu erweitern._ The phrase at once\nsuggests by contrast that expression so frequently used by painters\nof \"tightness,\" incapacity to enlarge, which is such a characteristic\nof artificial handling, and indeed of most academic work, and so\nfrequently gives to the original sketch of an artist a greater artistic\nvalue than to the highly finished work.]\n[Footnote 434: _In der subjektiven Begeistrung._]\n[Footnote 435: The chamber at Wetzlar.]\n[Footnote 436: Elective Affinities.]\nEND OF VOL.
