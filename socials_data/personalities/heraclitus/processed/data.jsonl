{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nAll things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.\nFire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, earth that of water.\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.\nThe sun is new each day.\nThe thunderbolt steers the universe.", "source": "on_nature.txt"}
{"text": "The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\nTo those who are awake, there is one ordered universe common (to all), whereas in sleep each turns away to one of his own.\nFools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them does the saying bear witness that they are absent when present.\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have souls that understand not the language.\nThe many do not take heed of such things as those they meet with, nor do they mark them when they are taught, but they think they do.\nDogs bark at everyone they do not know.\nOne man is ten thousand to me, if he be the best.", "source": "on_society.txt"}
