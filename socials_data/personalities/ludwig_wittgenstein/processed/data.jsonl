{"text": "1. 'Excalibur' is a sharp bright sword. 'Excalibur' is a proper name.\n2. But what does it mean to say that 'Excalibur' has a meaning?\n3. If the meaning of a name is the object it denotes, then if the object is destroyed, the name would lose its meaning.\n4. But if Excalibur is broken into pieces, the sentence 'Excalibur has a sharp blade' still makes sense."}
{"text": "5. So the meaning of 'Excalibur' cannot be the sword itself.\n6. The meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n7. Language is a game. We play language games.\n8. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws. The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects."}
