Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a
bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anybody who will
want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs
attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every
Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in
philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further.
Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are
going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted
that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for
them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore
all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think
it necessary to drop a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously
and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment on this point, not
even he could find any one who was willing to give him a hint, or even
to show him how the little trick is done.

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the
same thing may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it
applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing
without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything
outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it it can go no
further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular
individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his
ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his
particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the
individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the
universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile
himself with the universal. Whenever the individual after he has entered
the universal feels an impulse to assert himself as the particular, he
is in temptation (Anfechtung), and he can labor himself out of this only
by abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the
highest thing that can be said of man and of his existence, then the
ethical has the same character as man’s eternal blessedness, which to all
eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a
contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically
suspended), seeing that as soon as he suspends it he is lost, whereas in
other cases he is not lost but is not reached.

If such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on “The
Good and the Conscience,” he characterizes man only as the particular
and regards this character as “a moral form of evil” (cf. especially The
Philosophy of Right), which is to be annulled in the teleology of the
moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either
sinning or subjected to temptation (Anfechtung). On the other hand, he
is wrong in talking of faith, wrong in not loudly and clearly protesting
against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of
faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted as a murderer.

For faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the
universal--yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats
itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the
universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the
universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has
never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the
ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing
incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e.
the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one
needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers
possessed or which can be deduced from them. This is something which
Hegel should not have concealed. For it is by no means a difficult
matter to convert everybody to the notion that the man who thinks he has
outgrown Hegel is a dilemma of the same sort as the man who thinks he
has outgrown grammar and has to be punished--but it is a matter of no
little difficulty to reach the point where Hegel leaves one.
