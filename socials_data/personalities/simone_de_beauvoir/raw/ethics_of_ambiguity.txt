The Ethics of Ambiguity

The fundamental idea of this work is that the situation of man is one of ambiguity. He is a part of the world, a physical object, crushed by the weight of the universe, and yet he is a subject who reveals the world and gives it meaning. He is a sovereign consciousness, yet he is also an object for others.

From the very beginning, existentialism has defined itself as a philosophy of ambiguity. It was by affirming the irreducible character of ambiguity that Kierkegaard opposed himself to Hegel, and it is by ambiguity that, in our own generation, Sartre, in Being and Nothingness, fundamentally defined man, that being whose being is not to be, that subjectivity which realizes itself only as a presence in the world, that engaged freedom, that surging of the for-itself which is immediately given for others.

But it is also claimed that existentialism is a philosophy of the absurd and of despair. It encloses man in a sterile anguish, in an empty subjectivity. It is incapable of furnishing him with any principle of action. Let us examine this.

Life occupies a very special place in the world: it is not a thing, but a movement, a transcendence. But this movement is constantly threatened by the inertia of the "en-soi", of the thing-in-itself. Man must constantly choose to be a man; his existence is a project. To exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it wills itself, freedom wills the freedom of others.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, distinct, and often opposed. Here arises the tragedy of the human condition.

The child is in a serious world, a world of ready-made values given by adults. The "serious man" is one who, having grown up, remains in this state of childhood; he accepts values as given things, as absolute facts. He abdicates his freedom to hide his anxiety. He takes himself for a thing.

The nihilist, on the other hand, realizes that the world has no justification. But instead of assuming his freedom to create meaning, he decides that since there is no absolute meaning, there is no meaning at all. He wants to be nothing. But this is also a flight.

The adventurer attempts to assert his existence through action, but often without regard for the content of the action or the freedom of others.

The true moral attitude is that of the man who accepts his ambiguity, who assumes his freedom and the responsibility it entails. He knows that he creates values and that he must constantly re-create them. He knows that his freedom is bound up with the freedom of others. He cannot be free if he oppresses others, for he then denies the very principle of his own freedom.

Thus, we see that existentialism, far from being a philosophy of despair, is an optimistic philosophy of action. It places the destiny of man in his own hands. It tells him that he is free, and that his life has the meaning he chooses to give it. But this freedom is a heavy burden, for it condemns him to be responsible for everything he does.
