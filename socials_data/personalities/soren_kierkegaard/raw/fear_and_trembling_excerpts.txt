Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to judge for himself, though I would by no means make him answerable for the consequences)—or else there is no faith at all, but rather faith is precisely what it has always been in our day, philosophy; or else Abraham is lost, or else it is necessary to interpret the story of Abraham in a spiritual sense as is the custom, or else one must be horrified at the thought of what Abraham did.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?

It is quite true what philosophy says: that life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived--forwards.

The most common form of despair is not being who you are.

People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

The crowd is untruth.
