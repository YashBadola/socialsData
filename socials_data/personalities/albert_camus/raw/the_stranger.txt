Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know. I had a telegram from the home: "Mother passed away. Funeral tomorrow. Yours sincerely." That doesn't mean anything. It may have been yesterday.

I went to the home. It was very hot. I saw the director. He wore the Legion of Honor. He looked at me with his clear eyes. He shook my hand and held it so long that I didn't know how to get it away. He looked up a file and said, "Madame Meursault entered here three years ago. You were her sole support." I thought he was reproaching me for something and I started to explain. But he cut me short. "You don't have to justify yourself, my dear boy. I've read your mother's file. You weren't able to provide for her properly. She needed a nurse. You earn only a modest salary. And the truth is she was happier here." I said, "Yes, sir." He added, "You see, she had friends here, people of her own age. She was able to share interests from the old days. You're young, and it must have been hard for her with you."

It was true. When she was at home with me, she used to spend her time following me with her eyes, not saying a thing. For the first few days she was at the home she cried a lot. But that was because she wasn't used to it. A few months later and she would have cried if she'd been taken out. She was used to it. That was partly why I didn't go there much this last year. And also because it took up my Sunday - not to mention the trouble of getting to the bus, buying tickets, and spending two hours traveling.

As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself - so like a brother, really - I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.
