{"text": "THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY\nBy Bertrand Russell\nPREFACE\nIn the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those\nproblems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say\nsomething positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism\nseemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a\nlarger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics\nmuch discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.\nI have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E.\nMoore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, as regards the relations\nof sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards\nprobability and induction. I have also profited greatly by the\ncriticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.\n1912\nCHAPTER I. APPEARANCE AND REALITY\nIs there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no\nreasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might\nnot seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can\nbe asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a\nstraightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the\nstudy of philosophy--for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer\nsuch ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in\nordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring\nall that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the\nvagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.\nIn daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer\nscrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a\ngreat amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may\nbelieve. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our\npresent experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be\nderived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate\nexperiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that\nI am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I\nsee sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see out\nof the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun\nis about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot\nglobe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's\nrotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an\nindefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal\nperson comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and\nbooks and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as\nthe table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be\nso evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who\ndoubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted,\nand all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure\nthat we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.\nTo make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the\ntable. To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is\nsmooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound.\nAny one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this\ndescription, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise;\nbut as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. Although\nI believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the\nparts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts,\nand some parts look white because of reflected light. I know that, if\nI move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the\napparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows\nthat if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no\ntwo of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because\nno two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in\nthe point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.\nFor most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to\nthe painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit\nof thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says\nthey 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they\nappear. Here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions\nthat cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between\n'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they\nare. The painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man\nand the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher's\nwish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more\ntroubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.\nTo return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, that\nthere is no colour which pre-eminently appears to be _the_ colour of the\ntable, or even of any one particular part of the table--it appears to\nbe of different colours from different points of view, and there is\nno reason for regarding some of these as more really its colour than\nothers. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will\nseem different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a\nman wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour\nat all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This\ncolour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something\ndepending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls\non the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of _the_ colour of the\ntable, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a\nnormal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual conditions\nof light. But the other colours which appear under other conditions\nhave just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid\nfavouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any\none particular colour.\nThe same thing applies to the texture. With the naked eye one can see\nthe grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If we looked\nat it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and\nvalleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the\nnaked eye. Which of these is the 'real' table? We are naturally tempted\nto say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but that in\nturn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. If, then, we\ncannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we\nsee through a microscope? Thus, again, the confidence in our senses with\nwhich we began deserts us.\nThe shape of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging\nas to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that\nwe come to think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we\nall have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different\nin shape from every different point of view. If our table is 'really'\nrectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had\ntwo acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel,\nthey will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator;\nif they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were\nlonger. All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table,\nbecause experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the\napparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as practical\nmen. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred\nfrom what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape as we\nmove about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us\nthe truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the\ntable.\nSimilar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of touch. It is\ntrue that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel\nthat it resists pressure. But the sensation we obtain depends upon how\nhard we press the table and also upon what part of the body we press\nwith; thus the various sensations due to various pressures or various\nparts of the body cannot be supposed to reveal _directly_ any definite\nproperty of the table, but at most to be _signs_ of some property which\nperhaps _causes_ all the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any\nof them. And the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which\ncan be elicited by rapping the table.\nThus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the\nsame as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing. The\nreal table, if there is one, is not _immediately_ known to us at all,\nbut must be an inference from what is immediately known. Hence, two very\ndifficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at\nall? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be?\nIt will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple\nterms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give the name\nof 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation:\nsuch things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and\nso on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the experience of being\nimmediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever we see a colour,\nwe have a sensation _of_ the colour, but the colour itself is a\nsense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that _of_ which we are\nimmediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. It is\nplain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be\nby means of the sense-data--brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness,\netc.--which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have\nbeen given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even\nthat the sense-data are directly properties of the table. Thus a problem\narises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing\nthere is such a thing.\nThe real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical object'. Thus\nwe have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects.\nThe collection of all physical objects is called 'matter'. Thus our two\nquestions may be re-stated as follows: (1) Is there any such thing as\nmatter? (2) If so, what is its nature?\nThe philosopher who first brought prominently forward the reasons\nfor regarding the immediate objects of our senses as not existing\nindependently of us was Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753). His _Three\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and\nAtheists_, undertake to prove that there is no such thing as matter at\nall, and that the world consists of nothing but minds and their ideas.\nHylas has hitherto believed in matter, but he is no match for Philonous,\nwho mercilessly drives him into contradictions and paradoxes, and makes\nhis own denial of matter seem, in the end, as if it were almost common\nsense. The arguments employed are of very different value: some are\nimportant and sound, others are confused or quibbling. But Berkeley\nretains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is\ncapable of being denied without absurdity, and that if there are any\nthings that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate\nobjects of our sensations.\nThere are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter\nexists, and it is important to keep them clear. We commonly mean by\n'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind', something which we think\nof as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought\nor consciousness. It is chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies\nmatter; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we\ncommonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs\nof the existence of _something_ independent of us, but he does deny\nthat this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas\nentertained by some mind. He admits that there must be something which\ncontinues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that\nwhat we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing\nin something which persists even when we are not seeing it. But he\nthinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from\nwhat we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it\nmust be independent of _our_ seeing. He is thus led to regard the 'real'\ntable as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required\npermanence and independence of ourselves, without being--as matter would\notherwise be--something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only\ninfer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.\nOther philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, although the\ntable does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does\ndepend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by\n_some_ mind--not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole\ncollective mind of the universe. This they hold, as Berkeley does,\nchiefly because they think there can be nothing real--or at any rate\nnothing known to be real except minds and their thoughts and feelings.\nWe might state the argument by which they support their view in some\nsuch way as this: 'Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of\nthe person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except\nideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is\ninconceivable cannot exist.'\nSuch an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious; and of course those who\nadvance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. But whether valid or\nnot, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another;\nand very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, have held that there is\nnothing real except minds and their ideas. Such philosophers are called\n'idealists'. When they come to explaining matter, they either say, like\nBerkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas,\nor they say, like Leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is\nreally a collection of more or less rudimentary minds.\nBut these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind,\nnevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be remembered that\nwe asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If\nso, what sort of object can it be? Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit\nthat there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the\nmind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. Thus both of them\nanswer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the\nviews of ordinary mortals in their answer to our second question. In\nfact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real\ntable: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data--colour,\nshape, smoothness, etc.--may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is\na sign of something existing independently of us, something differing,\nperhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as\ncausing those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the\nreal table.\nNow obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed--the view\nthat there _is_ a real table, whatever its nature may be--is vitally\nimportant, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are\nfor accepting this view before we go on to the further question as\nto the nature of the real table. Our next chapter, therefore, will be\nconcerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at\nall.\nBefore we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it\nis that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if we take any\ncommon object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses,\nwhat the senses _immediately_ tell us is not the truth about the object\nas it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data\nwhich, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and\nthe object. Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance',\nwhich we believe to be a sign of some 'reality' behind. But if the\nreality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there\nis any reality at all? And if so, have we any means of finding out what\nit is like?\nSuch questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even\nthe strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table,\nwhich has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a\nproblem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing we know about it\nis that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we\nhave the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a\ncommunity of souls: Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God;\nsober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection\nof electric charges in violent motion.\nAmong these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there\nis no table at all. Philosophy, if it cannot _answer_ so many questions\nas we could wish, has at least the power of _asking_ questions which\nincrease the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder\nlying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.\nCHAPTER II. THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER\nIn this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all,\nthere is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain\nintrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is\nthe table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very\nprolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if\nwe cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot\nbe sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and\ntherefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds\nfor believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing\ntheir bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of\nobjects, we shall be left alone in a desert--it may be that the whole\nouter world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist. This is an\nuncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved to\nbe false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true.\nIn this chapter we have to see why this is the case.\nBefore we embark upon doubtful matters, let us try to find some more\nor less fixed point from which to start. Although we are doubting the\nphysical existence of the table, we are not doubting the existence\nof the sense-data which made us think there was a table; we are not\ndoubting that, while we look, a certain colour and shape appear to us,\nand while we press, a certain sensation of hardness is experienced by\nus. All this, which is psychological, we are not calling in question.\nIn fact, whatever else may be doubtful, some at least of our immediate\nexperiences seem absolutely certain.\nDescartes (1596-1650), the founder of modern philosophy, invented a\nmethod which may still be used with profit--the method of systematic\ndoubt. He determined that he would believe nothing which he did not see\nquite clearly and distinctly to be true. Whatever he could bring himself\nto doubt, he would doubt, until he saw reason for not doubting it.\nBy applying this method he gradually became convinced that the only\nexistence of which he could be _quite_ certain was his own. He imagined\na deceitful demon, who presented unreal things to his senses in a\nperpetual phantasmagoria; it might be very improbable that such a demon\nexisted, but still it was possible, and therefore doubt concerning\nthings perceived by the senses was possible.\nBut doubt concerning his own existence was not possible, for if he did\nnot exist, no demon could deceive him. If he doubted, he must exist; if\nhe had any experiences whatever, he must exist. Thus his own existence\nwas an absolute certainty to him. 'I think, therefore I am,' he said\n(_Cogito, ergo sum_); and on the basis of this certainty he set to work\nto build up again the world of knowledge which his doubt had laid in\nruins. By inventing the method of doubt, and by showing that subjective\nthings are the most certain, Descartes performed a great service to\nphilosophy, and one which makes him still useful to all students of the\nsubject.\nBut some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. 'I think,\ntherefore I am' says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem\nas though we were quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were\nyesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is\nas hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that\nabsolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.\nWhen I look at my table and see a certain brown colour, what is quite\ncertain at once is not '_I_ am seeing a brown colour', but rather,\n'a brown colour is being seen'. This of course involves something (or\nsomebody) which (or who) sees the brown colour; but it does not of\nitself involve that more or less permanent person whom we call 'I'. So\nfar as immediate certainty goes, it might be that the something which\nsees the brown colour is quite momentary, and not the same as the\nsomething which has some different experience the next moment.\nThus it is our particular thoughts and feelings that have primitive\ncertainty. And this applies to dreams and hallucinations as well as to\nnormal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, we certainly do have\nthe sensations we think we have, but for various reasons it is held that\nno physical object corresponds to these sensations. Thus the certainty\nof our knowledge of our own experiences does not have to be limited in\nany way to allow for exceptional cases. Here, therefore, we have, for\nwhat it is worth, a solid basis from which to begin our pursuit of\nknowledge.\nThe problem we have to consider is this: Granted that we are certain of\nour own sense-data, have we any reason for regarding them as signs of\nthe existence of something else, which we can call the physical object?\nWhen we have enumerated all the sense-data which we should naturally\nregard as connected with the table, have we said all there is to say\nabout the table, or is there still something else--something not a\nsense-datum, something which persists when we go out of the room? Common\nsense unhesitatingly answers that there is. What can be bought and sold\nand pushed about and have a cloth laid on it, and so on, cannot be\na _mere_ collection of sense-data. If the cloth completely hides the\ntable, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if\nthe table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and\nthe cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in\nthe place where the table formerly was. This seems plainly absurd; but\nwhoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened\nby absurdities.\nOne great reason why it is felt that we must secure a physical object\nin addition to the sense-data, is that we want the same object for\ndifferent people. When ten people are sitting round a dinner-table,\nit seems preposterous to maintain that they are not seeing the same\ntablecloth, the same knives and forks and spoons and glasses. But the\nsense-data are private to each separate person; what is immediately\npresent to the sight of one is not immediately present to the sight of\nanother: they all see things from slightly different points of view, and\ntherefore see them slightly differently. Thus, if there are to be public\nneutral objects, which can be in some sense known to many different\npeople, there must be something over and above the private and\nparticular sense-data which appear to various people. What reason, then,\nhave we for believing that there are such public neutral objects?\nThe first answer that naturally occurs to one is that, although\ndifferent people may see the table slightly differently, still they all\nsee more or less similar things when they look at the table, and\nthe variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and\nreflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object\nunderlying all the different people's sense-data. I bought my table from\nthe former occupant of my room; I could not buy _his_ sense-data,\nwhich died when he went away, but I could and did buy the confident\nexpectation of more or less similar sense-data. Thus it is the fact that\ndifferent people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given\nplace at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose\nthat over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object\nwhich underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various\ntimes.\nNow in so far as the above considerations depend upon supposing that\nthere are other people besides ourselves, they beg the very question at\nissue. Other people are represented to me by certain sense-data, such as\nthe sight of them or the sound of their voices, and if I had no\nreason to believe that there were physical objects independent of my\nsense-data, I should have no reason to believe that other people exist\nexcept as part of my dream. Thus, when we are trying to show that there\nmust be objects independent of our own sense-data, we cannot appeal to\nthe testimony of other people, since this testimony itself consists of\nsense-data, and does not reveal other people's experiences unless our\nown sense-data are signs of things existing independently of us. We must\ntherefore, if possible, find, in our own purely private experiences,\ncharacteristics which show, or tend to show, that there are in the world\nthings other than ourselves and our private experiences.\nIn one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence\nof things other than ourselves and our experiences. No logical absurdity\nresults from the hypothesis that the world consists of myself and my\nthoughts and feelings and sensations, and that everything else is mere\nfancy. In dreams a very complicated world may seem to be present, and\nyet on waking we find it was a delusion; that is to say, we find that\nthe sense-data in the dream do not appear to have corresponded with such\nphysical objects as we should naturally infer from our sense-data. (It\nis true that, when the physical world is assumed, it is possible to\nfind physical causes for the sense-data in dreams: a door banging, for\ninstance, may cause us to dream of a naval engagement. But although, in\nthis case, there is a physical cause for the sense-data, there is not a\nphysical object corresponding to the sense-data in the way in which an\nactual naval battle would correspond.) There is no logical impossibility\nin the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we\nourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this\nis not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that\nit is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a\nmeans of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense\nhypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action\non us causes our sensations.\nThe way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really\nare physical objects is easily seen. If the cat appears at one moment in\none part of the room, and at another in another part, it is natural\nto suppose that it has moved from the one to the other, passing over\na series of intermediate positions. But if it is merely a set of\nsense-data, it cannot have ever been in any place where I did not see\nit; thus we shall have to suppose that it did not exist at all while I\nwas not looking, but suddenly sprang into being in a new place. If\nthe cat exists whether I see it or not, we can understand from our own\nexperience how it gets hungry between one meal and the next; but if\nit does not exist when I am not seeing it, it seems odd that appetite\nshould grow during non-existence as fast as during existence. And if the\ncat consists only of sense-data, it cannot be hungry, since no hunger\nbut my own can be a sense-datum to me. Thus the behaviour of the\nsense-data which represent the cat to me, though it seems quite natural\nwhen regarded as an expression of hunger, becomes utterly inexplicable\nwhen regarded as mere movements and changes of patches of colour, which\nare as incapable of hunger as a triangle is of playing football.\nBut the difficulty in the case of the cat is nothing compared to the\ndifficulty in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that\nis, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and\nsimultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it\nis very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression\nof a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of\ncourse similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the\nexistence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what\nwe call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for\non scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical\nworld. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural\nview, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our\nsense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving\nthem.\nOf course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in\nan independent external world. We find this belief ready in ourselves as\nsoon as we begin to reflect: it is what may be called an _instinctive_\nbelief. We should never have been led to question this belief but for\nthe fact that, at any rate in the case of sight, it seems as if the\nsense-datum itself were instinctively believed to be the independent\nobject, whereas argument shows that the object cannot be identical\nwith the sense-datum. This discovery, however--which is not at all\nparadoxical in the case of taste and smell and sound, and only slightly\nso in the case of touch--leaves undiminished our instinctive belief that\nthere _are_ objects _corresponding_ to our sense-data. Since this belief\ndoes not lead to any difficulties, but on the contrary tends to simplify\nand systematize our account of our experiences, there seems no good\nreason for rejecting it. We may therefore admit--though with a slight\ndoubt derived from dreams--that the external world does really exist,\nand is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to\nperceive it.\nThe argument which has led us to this conclusion is doubtless less\nstrong than we could wish, but it is typical of many philosophical\narguments, and it is therefore worth while to consider briefly its\ngeneral character and validity. All knowledge, we find, must be built\nup upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing\nis left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than\nothers, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with\nother beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part\nof what is believed instinctively.\nPhilosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs,\nbeginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much\nisolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. It should\ntake care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth,\nour instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system.\nThere can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief\nexcept that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to\nharmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.\nIt is of course _possible_ that all or any of our beliefs may be\nmistaken, and therefore all ought to be held with at least some slight\nelement of doubt. But we cannot have _reason_ to reject a belief except\non the ground of some other belief. Hence, by organizing our instinctive\nbeliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most\npossible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the\nbasis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an\norderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the\n_possibility_ of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the\ninterrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which has\npreceded acquiescence.\nThis function, at least, philosophy can perform. Most philosophers,\nrightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than\nthis--that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attainable,\nconcerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of\nultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest\nfunction we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and\ncertainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequacy\nof common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that\nphilosophical problems involve.\nCHAPTER III. THE NATURE OF MATTER\nIn the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to\nfind demonstrative reasons, that it is rational to believe that our\nsense-data--for example, those which we regard as associated with my\ntable--are really signs of the existence of something independent of us\nand our perceptions. That is to say, over and above the sensations of\ncolour, hardness, noise, and so on, which make up the appearance of\nthe table to me, I assume that there is something else, of which these\nthings are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes,\nthe sensation of hardness ceases to exist if I remove my arm from\ncontact with the table, the sound ceases to exist if I cease to rap the\ntable with my knuckles. But I do not believe that when all these things\ncease the table ceases. On the contrary, I believe that it is because\nthe table exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear\nwhen I open my eyes, replace my arm, and begin again to rap with my\nknuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is: What\nis the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my\nperception of it?\nTo this question physical science gives an answer, somewhat incomplete\nit is true, and in part still very hypothetical, but yet deserving of\nrespect so far as it goes. Physical science, more or less unconsciously,\nhas drifted into the view that all natural phenomena ought to be reduced\nto motions. Light and heat and sound are all due to wave-motions, which\ntravel from the body emitting them to the person who sees light or feels\nheat or hears sound. That which has the wave-motion is either aether or\n'gross matter', but in either case is what the philosopher would call\nmatter. The only properties which science assigns to it are position in\nspace, and the power of motion according to the laws of motion. Science\ndoes not deny that it _may_ have other properties; but if so, such other\nproperties are not useful to the man of science, and in no way assist\nhim in explaining the phenomena.\nIt is sometimes said that 'light _is_ a form of wave-motion', but this\nis misleading, for the light which we immediately see, which we know\ndirectly by means of our senses, is _not_ a form of wave-motion, but\nsomething quite different--something which we all know if we are not\nblind, though we cannot describe it so as to convey our knowledge to a\nman who is blind. A wave-motion, on the contrary, could quite well be\ndescribed to a blind man, since he can acquire a knowledge of space by\nthe sense of touch; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage\nalmost as well as we can. But this, which a blind man can understand, is\nnot what we mean by _light_: we mean by _light_ just that which a blind\nman can never understand, and which we can never describe to him.\nNow this something, which all of us who are not blind know, is not,\naccording to science, really to be found in the outer world: it is\nsomething caused by the action of certain waves upon the eyes and nerves\nand brain of the person who sees the light. When it is said that light\n_is_ waves, what is really meant is that waves are the physical cause of\nour sensations of light. But light itself, the thing which seeing people\nexperience and blind people do not, is not supposed by science to form\nany part of the world that is independent of us and our senses. And very\nsimilar remarks would apply to other kinds of sensations.\nIt is not only colours and sounds and so on that are absent from the\nscientific world of matter, but also _space_ as we get it through sight\nor touch. It is essential to science that its matter should be in _a_\nspace, but the space in which it is cannot be exactly the space we see\nor feel. To begin with, space as we see it is not the same as space as\nwe get it by the sense of touch; it is only by experience in infancy\nthat we learn how to touch things we see, or how to get a sight of\nthings which we feel touching us. But the space of science is neutral as\nbetween touch and sight; thus it cannot be either the space of touch or\nthe space of sight.\nAgain, different people see the same object as of different shapes,\naccording to their point of view. A circular coin, for example, though\nwe should always _judge_ it to be circular, will _look_ oval unless we\nare straight in front of it. When we judge that it _is_ circular, we are\njudging that it has a real shape which is not its apparent shape, but\nbelongs to it intrinsically apart from its appearance. But this real\nshape, which is what concerns science, must be in a real space, not\nthe same as anybody's _apparent_ space. The real space is public, the\napparent space is private to the percipient. In different people's\n_private_ spaces the same object seems to have different shapes; thus\nthe real space, in which it has its real shape, must be different from\nthe private spaces. The space of science, therefore, though _connected_\nwith the spaces we see and feel, is not identical with them, and the\nmanner of its connexion requires investigation.\nWe agreed provisionally that physical objects cannot be quite like\nour sense-data, but may be regarded as _causing_ our sensations.\nThese physical objects are in the space of science, which we may call\n'physical' space. It is important to notice that, if our sensations\nare to be caused by physical objects, there must be a physical space\ncontaining these objects and our sense-organs and nerves and brain. We\nget a sensation of touch from an object when we are in contact with it;\nthat is to say, when some part of our body occupies a place in physical\nspace quite close to the space occupied by the object. We see an object\n(roughly speaking) when no opaque body is between the object and our\neyes in physical space. Similarly, we only hear or smell or taste an\nobject when we are sufficiently near to it, or when it touches the\ntongue, or has some suitable position in physical space relatively to\nour body. We cannot begin to state what different sensations we shall\nderive from a given object under different circumstances unless we\nregard the object and our body as both in one physical space, for it is\nmainly the relative positions of the object and our body that determine\nwhat sensations we shall derive from the object.\nNow our sense-data are situated in our private spaces, either the space\nof sight or the space of touch or such vaguer spaces as other senses\nmay give us. If, as science and common sense assume, there is one public\nall-embracing physical space in which physical objects are, the relative\npositions of physical objects in physical space must more or less\ncorrespond to the relative positions of sense-data in our private\nspaces. There is no difficulty in supposing this to be the case. If we\nsee on a road one house nearer to us than another, our other senses will\nbear out the view that it is nearer; for example, it will be reached\nsooner if we walk along the road. Other people will agree that the house\nwhich looks nearer to us is nearer; the ordnance map will take the\nsame view; and thus everything points to a spatial relation between the\nhouses corresponding to the relation between the sense-data which we see\nwhen we look at the houses. Thus we may assume that there is a physical\nspace in which physical objects have spatial relations corresponding to\nthose which the corresponding sense-data have in our private spaces. It\nis this physical space which is dealt with in geometry and assumed in\nphysics and astronomy.\nAssuming that there is physical space, and that it does thus correspond\nto private spaces, what can we know about it? We can know _only_ what is\nrequired in order to secure the correspondence. That is to say, we can\nknow nothing of what it is like in itself, but we can know the sort\nof arrangement of physical objects which results from their spatial\nrelations. We can know, for example, that the earth and moon and sun\nare in one straight line during an eclipse, though we cannot know what\na physical straight line is in itself, as we know the look of a straight\nline in our visual space. Thus we come to know much more about the\n_relations_ of distances in physical space than about the distances\nthemselves; we may know that one distance is greater than another, or\nthat it is along the same straight line as the other, but we cannot have\nthat immediate acquaintance with physical distances that we have with\ndistances in our private spaces, or with colours or sounds or other\nsense-data. We can know all those things about physical space which a\nman born blind might know through other people about the space of sight;\nbut the kind of things which a man born blind could never know about the\nspace of sight we also cannot know about physical space. We can know the\nproperties of the relations required to preserve the correspondence with\nsense-data, but we cannot know the nature of the terms between which the\nrelations hold.\nWith regard to time, our _feeling_ of duration or of the lapse of time\nis notoriously an unsafe guide as to the time that has elapsed by the\nclock. Times when we are bored or suffering pain pass slowly, times when\nwe are agreeably occupied pass quickly, and times when we are sleeping\npass almost as if they did not exist. Thus, in so far as time is\nconstituted by duration, there is the same necessity for distinguishing\na public and a private time as there was in the case of space. But in so\nfar as time consists in an _order_ of before and after, there is no need\nto make such a distinction; the time-order which events seem to have is,\nso far as we can see, the same as the time-order which they do have. At\nany rate no reason can be given for supposing that the two orders are\nnot the same. The same is usually true of space: if a regiment of men\nare marching along a road, the shape of the regiment will look different\nfrom different points of view, but the men will appear arranged in the\nsame order from all points of view. Hence we regard the order as true\nalso in physical space, whereas the shape is only supposed to correspond\nto the physical space so far as is required for the preservation of the\norder.\nIn saying that the time-order which events seem to have is the same as\nthe time-order which they really have, it is necessary to guard against\na possible misunderstanding. It must not be supposed that the various\nstates of different physical objects have the same time-order as the\nsense-data which constitute the perceptions of those objects. Considered\nas physical objects, the thunder and lightning are simultaneous; that is\nto say, the lightning is simultaneous with the disturbance of the air in\nthe place where the disturbance begins, namely, where the lightning\nis. But the sense-datum which we call hearing the thunder does not take\nplace until the disturbance of the air has travelled as far as to where\nwe are. Similarly, it takes about eight minutes for the sun's light\nto reach us; thus, when we see the sun we are seeing the sun of eight\nminutes ago. So far as our sense-data afford evidence as to the physical\nsun they afford evidence as to the physical sun of eight minutes ago; if\nthe physical sun had ceased to exist within the last eight minutes, that\nwould make no difference to the sense-data which we call 'seeing\nthe sun'. This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of\ndistinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.\nWhat we have found as regards space is much the same as what we find\nin relation to the correspondence of the sense-data with their\nphysical counterparts. If one object looks blue and another red, we may\nreasonably presume that there is some corresponding difference between\nthe physical objects; if two objects both look blue, we may presume a\ncorresponding similarity. But we cannot hope to be acquainted directly\nwith the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red.\nScience tells us that this quality is a certain sort of wave-motion, and\nthis sounds familiar, because we think of wave-motions in the space we\nsee. But the wave-motions must really be in physical space, with which\nwe have no direct acquaintance; thus the real wave-motions have not that\nfamiliarity which we might have supposed them to have. And what holds\nfor colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data. Thus\nwe find that, although the _relations_ of physical objects have all\nsorts of knowable properties, derived from their correspondence with the\nrelations of sense-data, the physical objects themselves remain unknown\nin their intrinsic nature, so far at least as can be discovered by means\nof the senses. The question remains whether there is any other method of\ndiscovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects.\nThe most natural, though not ultimately the most defensible, hypothesis\nto adopt in the first instance, at any rate as regards visual\nsense-data, would be that, though physical objects cannot, for the\nreasons we have been considering, be _exactly_ like sense-data, yet they\nmay be more or less like. According to this view, physical objects will,\nfor example, really have colours, and we might, by good luck, see an\nobject as of the colour it really is. The colour which an object seems\nto have at any given moment will in general be very similar, though\nnot quite the same, from many different points of view; we might thus\nsuppose the 'real' colour to be a sort of medium colour, intermediate\nbetween the various shades which appear from the different points of\nview.\nSuch a theory is perhaps not capable of being definitely refuted, but\nit can be shown to be groundless. To begin with, it is plain that the\ncolour we see depends only upon the nature of the light-waves that\nstrike the eye, and is therefore modified by the medium intervening\nbetween us and the object, as well as by the manner in which light is\nreflected from the object in the direction of the eye. The intervening\nair alters colours unless it is perfectly clear, and any strong\nreflection will alter them completely. Thus the colour we see is a\nresult of the ray as it reaches the eye, and not simply a property of\nthe object from which the ray comes. Hence, also, provided certain waves\nreach the eye, we shall see a certain colour, whether the object from\nwhich the waves start has any colour or not. Thus it is quite gratuitous\nto suppose that physical objects have colours, and therefore there is no\njustification for making such a supposition. Exactly similar arguments\nwill apply to other sense-data.\nIt remains to ask whether there are any general philosophical arguments\nenabling us to say that, if matter is real, it must be of such and such\na nature. As explained above, very many philosophers, perhaps most, have\nheld that whatever is real must be in some sense mental, or at any rate\nthat whatever we can know anything about must be in some sense mental.\nSuch philosophers are called 'idealists'. Idealists tell us that what\nappears as matter is really something mental; namely, either (as Leibniz\nheld) more or less rudimentary minds, or (as Berkeley contended) ideas\nin the minds which, as we should commonly say, 'perceive' the matter.\nThus idealists deny the existence of matter as something intrinsically\ndifferent from mind, though they do not deny that our sense-data are\nsigns of something which exists independently of our private sensations.\nIn the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons--in my\nopinion fallacious--which idealists advance in favour of their theory.\nCHAPTER IV. IDEALISM\nThe word 'idealism' is used by different philosophers in somewhat\ndifferent senses. We shall understand by it the doctrine that whatever\nexists, or at any rate whatever can be known to exist, must be in\nsome sense mental. This doctrine, which is very widely held among\nphilosophers, has several forms, and is advocated on several different\ngrounds. The doctrine is so widely held, and so interesting in itself,\nthat even the briefest survey of philosophy must give some account of\nit.\nThose who are unaccustomed to philosophical speculation may be inclined\nto dismiss such a doctrine as obviously absurd. There is no doubt that\ncommon sense regards tables and chairs and the sun and moon and material\nobjects generally as something radically different from minds and the\ncontents of minds, and as having an existence which might continue if\nminds ceased. We think of matter as having existed long before there\nwere any minds, and it is hard to think of it as a mere product of\nmental activity. But whether true or false, idealism is not to be\ndismissed as obviously absurd.\nWe have seen that, even if physical objects do have an independent\nexistence, they must differ very widely from sense-data, and can only\nhave a _correspondence_ with sense-data, in the same sort of way in\nwhich a catalogue has a correspondence with the things catalogued. Hence\ncommon sense leaves us completely in the dark as to the true intrinsic\nnature of physical objects, and if there were good reason to regard them\nas mental, we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because\nit strikes us as strange. The truth about physical objects _must_ be\nstrange. It may be unattainable, but if any philosopher believes that\nhe has attained it, the fact that what he offers as the truth is strange\nought not to be made a ground of objection to his opinion.\nThe grounds on which idealism is advocated are generally grounds derived\nfrom the theory of knowledge, that is to say, from a discussion of the\nconditions which things must satisfy in order that we may be able to\nknow them. The first serious attempt to establish idealism on such\ngrounds was that of Bishop Berkeley. He proved first, by arguments which\nwere largely valid, that our sense-data cannot be supposed to have an\nexistence independent of us, but must be, in part at least, 'in' the\nmind, in the sense that their existence would not continue if there were\nno seeing or hearing or touching or smelling or tasting. So far, his\ncontention was almost certainly valid, even if some of his arguments\nwere not so. But he went on to argue that sense-data were the only\nthings of whose existence our perceptions could assure us; and that\nto be known is to be 'in' a mind, and therefore to be mental. Hence he\nconcluded that nothing can ever be known except what is in some mind,\nand that whatever is known without being in my mind must be in some\nother mind.\nIn order to understand his argument, it is necessary to understand his\nuse of the word 'idea'. He gives the name 'idea' to anything which\nis _immediately_ known, as, for example, sense-data are known. Thus a\nparticular colour which we see is an idea; so is a voice which we hear,\nand so on. But the term is not wholly confined to sense-data. There will\nalso be things remembered or imagined, for with such things also we have\nimmediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining. All\nsuch immediate data he calls 'ideas'.\nHe then proceeds to consider common objects, such as a tree, for\ninstance. He shows that all we know immediately when we 'perceive' the\ntree consists of ideas in his sense of the word, and he argues that\nthere is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything\nreal about the tree except what is perceived. Its being, he says,\nconsists in being perceived: in the Latin of the schoolmen its '_esse_'\nis '_percipi_'. He fully admits that the tree must continue to exist\neven when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it. But this\ncontinued existence, he says, is due to the fact that God continues to\nperceive it; the 'real' tree, which corresponds to what we called the\nphysical object, consists of ideas in the mind of God, ideas more or\nless like those we have when we see the tree, but differing in the fact\nthat they are permanent in God's mind so long as the tree continues\nto exist. All our perceptions, according to him, consist in a\npartial participation in God's perceptions, and it is because of this\nparticipation that different people see more or less the same tree. Thus\napart from minds and their ideas there is nothing in the world, nor is\nit possible that anything else should ever be known, since whatever is\nknown is necessarily an idea.\nThere are in this argument a good many fallacies which have been\nimportant in the history of philosophy, and which it will be as well to\nbring to light. In the first place, there is a confusion engendered by\nthe use of the word 'idea'. We think of an idea as essentially something\nin somebody's mind, and thus when we are told that a tree consists\nentirely of ideas, it is natural to suppose that, if so, the tree\nmust be entirely in minds. But the notion of being 'in' the mind is\nambiguous. We speak of bearing a person in mind, not meaning that the\nperson is in our minds, but that a thought of him is in our minds. When\na man says that some business he had to arrange went clean out of his\nmind, he does not mean to imply that the business itself was ever in his\nmind, but only that a thought of the business was formerly in his mind,\nbut afterwards ceased to be in his mind. And so when Berkeley says that\nthe tree must be in our minds if we can know it, all that he really has\na right to say is that a thought of the tree must be in our minds. To\nargue that the tree itself must be in our minds is like arguing that a\nperson whom we bear in mind is himself in our minds. This confusion\nmay seem too gross to have been really committed by any competent\nphilosopher, but various attendant circumstances rendered it possible.\nIn order to see how it was possible, we must go more deeply into the\nquestion as to the nature of ideas.\nBefore taking up the general question of the nature of ideas, we must\ndisentangle two entirely separate questions which arise concerning\nsense-data and physical objects. We saw that, for various reasons of\ndetail, Berkeley was right in treating the sense-data which constitute\nour perception of the tree as more or less subjective, in the sense that\nthey depend upon us as much as upon the tree, and would not exist if the\ntree were not being perceived. But this is an entirely different point\nfrom the one by which Berkeley seeks to prove that whatever can be\nimmediately known must be in a mind. For this purpose arguments of\ndetail as to the dependence of sense-data upon us are useless. It is\nnecessary to prove, generally, that by being known, things are shown to\nbe mental. This is what Berkeley believes himself to have done. It\nis this question, and not our previous question as to the difference\nbetween sense-data and the physical object, that must now concern us.\nTaking the word 'idea' in Berkeley's sense, there are two quite distinct\nthings to be considered whenever an idea is before the mind. There is\non the one hand the thing of which we are aware--say the colour of my\ntable--and on the other hand the actual awareness itself, the mental act\nof apprehending the thing. The mental act is undoubtedly mental, but is\nthere any reason to suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense\nmental? Our previous arguments concerning the colour did not prove it to\nbe mental; they only proved that its existence depends upon the relation\nof our sense organs to the physical object--in our case, the table. That\nis to say, they proved that a certain colour will exist, in a certain\nlight, if a normal eye is placed at a certain point relatively to\nthe table. They did not prove that the colour is in the mind of the\npercipient.\nBerkeley's view, that obviously the colour must be in the mind, seems\nto depend for its plausibility upon confusing the thing apprehended\nwith the act of apprehension. Either of these might be called an 'idea';\nprobably either would have been called an idea by Berkeley. The act\nis undoubtedly in the mind; hence, when we are thinking of the act,\nwe readily assent to the view that ideas must be in the mind. Then,\nforgetting that this was only true when ideas were taken as acts of\napprehension, we transfer the proposition that 'ideas are in the mind'\nto ideas in the other sense, i.e. to the things apprehended by our acts\nof apprehension. Thus, by an unconscious equivocation, we arrive at the\nconclusion that whatever we can apprehend must be in our minds. This\nseems to be the true analysis of Berkeley's argument, and the ultimate\nfallacy upon which it rests.\nThis question of the distinction between act and object in our\napprehending of things is vitally important, since our whole power of\nacquiring knowledge is bound up with it. The faculty of being acquainted\nwith things other than itself is the main characteristic of a mind.\nAcquaintance with objects essentially consists in a relation between the\nmind and something other than the mind; it is this that constitutes the\nmind's power of knowing things. If we say that the things known must be\nin the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind's power of knowing,\nor we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if\nwe mean by '_in_ the mind' the same as by '_before_ the mind', i.e. if\nwe mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we\nshall have to admit that what, _in this sense_, is in the mind,\nmay nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of\nknowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well\nas in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'ideas'--i.e. the objects\napprehended--must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever.\nHence his grounds in favour of idealism may be dismissed. It remains to\nsee whether there are any other grounds.\nIt is often said, as though it were a self-evident truism, that we\ncannot know that anything exists which we do not know. It is inferred\nthat whatever can in any way be relevant to our experience must be at\nleast capable of being known by us; whence it follows that if matter\nwere essentially something with which we could not become acquainted,\nmatter would be something which we could not know to exist, and which\ncould have for us no importance whatever. It is generally also implied,\nfor reasons which remain obscure, that what can have no importance for\nus cannot be real, and that therefore matter, if it is not composed of\nminds or of mental ideas, is impossible and a mere chimaera.\nTo go into this argument fully at our present stage would be impossible,\nsince it raises points requiring a considerable preliminary discussion;\nbut certain reasons for rejecting the argument may be noticed at\nonce. To begin at the end: there is no reason why what cannot have any\n_practical_ importance for us should not be real. It is true that,\nif _theoretical_ importance is included, everything real is of _some_\nimportance to us, since, as persons desirous of knowing the truth about\nthe universe, we have some interest in everything that the universe\ncontains. But if this sort of interest is included, it is not the case\nthat matter has no importance for us, provided it exists even if we\ncannot know that it exists. We can, obviously, suspect that it may\nexist, and wonder whether it does; hence it is connected with our desire\nfor knowledge, and has the importance of either satisfying or thwarting\nthis desire.\nAgain, it is by no means a truism, and is in fact false, that we cannot\nknow that anything exists which we do not know. The word 'know' is here\nused in two different senses. (1) In its first use it is applicable to\nthe sort of knowledge which is opposed to error, the sense in which\nwhat we know is _true_, the sense which applies to our beliefs and\nconvictions, i.e. to what are called _judgements_. In this sense of the\nword we know _that_ something is the case. This sort of knowledge may\nbe described as knowledge of _truths_. (2) In the second use of the word\n'know' above, the word applies to our knowledge of _things_, which we\nmay call _acquaintance_. This is the sense in which we know sense-data.\n(The distinction involved is roughly that between _savoir_ and\n_conna\u00eetre_ in French, or between _wissen_ and _kennen_ in German.)\nThus the statement which seemed like a truism becomes, when re-stated,\nthe following: 'We can never truly judge that something with which we\nare not acquainted exists.' This is by no means a truism, but on the\ncontrary a palpable falsehood. I have not the honour to be acquainted\nwith the Emperor of China, but I truly judge that he exists. It may\nbe said, of course, that I judge this because of other people's\nacquaintance with him. This, however, would be an irrelevant retort,\nsince, if the principle were true, I could not know that any one else\nis acquainted with him. But further: there is no reason why I should not\nknow of the existence of something with which nobody is acquainted. This\npoint is important, and demands elucidation.\nIf I am acquainted with a thing which exists, my acquaintance gives\nme the knowledge that it exists. But it is not true that, conversely,\nwhenever I can know that a thing of a certain sort exists, I or some one\nelse must be acquainted with the thing. What happens, in cases where I\nhave true judgement without acquaintance, is that the thing is known to\nme by _description_, and that, in virtue of some general principle, the\nexistence of a thing answering to this description can be inferred\nfrom the existence of something with which I am acquainted. In order\nto understand this point fully, it will be well first to deal with\nthe difference between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by\ndescription, and then to consider what knowledge of general principles,\nif any, has the same kind of certainty as our knowledge of the existence\nof our own experiences. These subjects will be dealt with in the\nfollowing chapters.\nCHAPTER V. KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION\nIn the preceding chapter we saw that there are two sorts of knowledge:\nknowledge of things, and knowledge of truths. In this chapter we shall\nbe concerned exclusively with knowledge of things, of which in turn we\nshall have to distinguish two kinds. Knowledge of things, when it is\nof the kind we call knowledge by _acquaintance_, is essentially simpler\nthan any knowledge of truths, and logically independent of knowledge\nof truths, though it would be rash to assume that human beings ever,\nin fact, have acquaintance with things without at the same time knowing\nsome truth about them. Knowledge of things by _description_, on the\ncontrary, always involves, as we shall find in the course of the present\nchapter, some knowledge of truths as its source and ground. But first of\nall we must make clear what we mean by 'acquaintance' and what we mean\nby 'description'.\nWe shall say that we have _acquaintance_ with anything of which we are\ndirectly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference\nor any knowledge of truths. Thus in the presence of my table I am\nacquainted with the sense-data that make up the appearance of my\ntable--its colour, shape, hardness, smoothness, etc.; all these are\nthings of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching\nmy table. The particular shade of colour that I am seeing may have many\nthings said about it--I may say that it is brown, that it is rather\ndark, and so on. But such statements, though they make me know truths\nabout the colour, do not make me know the colour itself any better\nthan I did before so far as concerns knowledge of the colour itself, as\nopposed to knowledge of truths about it, I know the colour perfectly and\ncompletely when I see it, and no further knowledge of it itself is even\ntheoretically possible. Thus the sense-data which make up the\nappearance of my table are things with which I have acquaintance, things\nimmediately known to me just as they are.\nMy knowledge of the table as a physical object, on the contrary, is not\ndirect knowledge. Such as it is, it is obtained through acquaintance\nwith the sense-data that make up the appearance of the table. We have\nseen that it is possible, without absurdity, to doubt whether there is\na table at all, whereas it is not possible to doubt the sense-data. My\nknowledge of the table is of the kind which we shall call 'knowledge\nby description'. The table is 'the physical object which causes\nsuch-and-such sense-data'. This describes the table by means of the\nsense-data. In order to know anything at all about the table, we must\nknow truths connecting it with things with which we have acquaintance:\nwe must know that 'such-and-such sense-data are caused by a physical\nobject'. There is no state of mind in which we are directly aware of the\ntable; all our knowledge of the table is really knowledge of truths, and\nthe actual thing which is the table is not, strictly speaking, known\nto us at all. We know a description, and we know that there is just one\nobject to which this description applies, though the object itself is\nnot directly known to us. In such a case, we say that our knowledge of\nthe object is knowledge by description.\nAll our knowledge, both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths,\nrests upon acquaintance as its foundation. It is therefore important to\nconsider what kinds of things there are with which we have acquaintance.\nSense-data, as we have already seen, are among the things with which\nwe are acquainted; in fact, they supply the most obvious and striking\nexample of knowledge by acquaintance. But if they were the sole example,\nour knowledge would be very much more restricted than it is. We should\nonly know what is now present to our senses: we could not know anything\nabout the past--not even that there was a past--nor could we know any\ntruths about our sense-data, for all knowledge of truths, as we shall\nshow, demands acquaintance with things which are of an essentially\ndifferent character from sense-data, the things which are sometimes\ncalled 'abstract ideas', but which we shall call 'universals'. We have\ntherefore to consider acquaintance with other things besides sense-data\nif we are to obtain any tolerably adequate analysis of our knowledge.\nThe first extension beyond sense-data to be considered is acquaintance\nby _memory_. It is obvious that we often remember what we have seen or\nheard or had otherwise present to our senses, and that in such cases we\nare still immediately aware of what we remember, in spite of the fact\nthat it appears as past and not as present. This immediate knowledge by\nmemory is the source of all our knowledge concerning the past: without\nit, there could be no knowledge of the past by inference, since we\nshould never know that there was anything past to be inferred.\nThe next extension to be considered is acquaintance by _introspection_.\nWe are not only aware of things, but we are often aware of being aware\nof them. When I see the sun, I am often aware of my seeing the sun; thus\n'my seeing the sun' is an object with which I have acquaintance. When\nI desire food, I may be aware of my desire for food; thus 'my desiring\nfood' is an object with which I am acquainted. Similarly we may be\naware of our feeling pleasure or pain, and generally of the events which\nhappen in our minds. This kind of acquaintance, which may be called\nself-consciousness, is the source of all our knowledge of mental things.\nIt is obvious that it is only what goes on in our own minds that can be\nthus known immediately. What goes on in the minds of others is known\nto us through our perception of their bodies, that is, through the\nsense-data in us which are associated with their bodies. But for our\nacquaintance with the contents of our own minds, we should be unable to\nimagine the minds of others, and therefore we could never arrive at\nthe knowledge that they have minds. It seems natural to suppose that\nself-consciousness is one of the things that distinguish men from\nanimals: animals, we may suppose, though they have acquaintance with\nsense-data, never become aware of this acquaintance. I do not mean\nthat they _doubt_ whether they exist, but that they have never become\nconscious of the fact that they have sensations and feelings, nor\ntherefore of the fact that they, the subjects of their sensations and\nfeelings, exist.\nWe have spoken of acquaintance with the contents of our minds as\n_self_-consciousness, but it is not, of course, consciousness of our\n_self_: it is consciousness of particular thoughts and feelings. The\nquestion whether we are also acquainted with our bare selves, as opposed\nto particular thoughts and feelings, is a very difficult one, upon which\nit would be rash to speak positively. When we try to look into ourselves\nwe always seem to come upon some particular thought or feeling, and not\nupon the 'I' which has the thought or feeling. Nevertheless there are\nsome reasons for thinking that we are acquainted with the 'I', though\nthe acquaintance is hard to disentangle from other things. To make clear\nwhat sort of reason there is, let us consider for a moment what our\nacquaintance with particular thoughts really involves.\nWhen I am acquainted with 'my seeing the sun', it seems plain that I am\nacquainted with two different things in relation to each other. On the\none hand there is the sense-datum which represents the sun to me, on the\nother hand there is that which sees this sense-datum. All acquaintance,\nsuch as my acquaintance with the sense-datum which represents the sun,\nseems obviously a relation between the person acquainted and the object\nwith which the person is acquainted. When a case of acquaintance is one\nwith which I can be acquainted (as I am acquainted with my acquaintance\nwith the sense-datum representing the sun), it is plain that the person\nacquainted is myself. Thus, when I am acquainted with my\nseeing the sun, the whole fact with which I am acquainted is\n'Self-acquainted-with-sense-datum'.\nFurther, we know the truth 'I am acquainted with this sense-datum'. It\nis hard to see how we could know this truth, or even understand what is\nmeant by it, unless we were acquainted with something which we call 'I'.\nIt does not seem necessary to suppose that we are acquainted with a more\nor less permanent person, the same to-day as yesterday, but it does seem\nas though we must be acquainted with that thing, whatever its nature,\nwhich sees the sun and has acquaintance with sense-data. Thus, in some\nsense it would seem we must be acquainted with our Selves as opposed\nto our particular experiences. But the question is difficult, and\ncomplicated arguments can be adduced on either side. Hence, although\nacquaintance with ourselves seems _probably_ to occur, it is not wise to\nassert that it undoubtedly does occur.\nWe may therefore sum up as follows what has been said concerning\nacquaintance with things that exist. We have acquaintance in sensation\nwith the data of the outer senses, and in introspection with the data of\nwhat may be called the inner sense--thoughts, feelings, desires, etc.;\nwe have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either\nof the outer senses or of the inner sense. Further, it is probable,\nthough not certain, that we have acquaintance with Self, as that which\nis aware of things or has desires towards things.\nIn addition to our acquaintance with particular existing things, we also\nhave acquaintance with what we shall call _universals_, that is to say,\ngeneral ideas, such as _whiteness_, _diversity_, _brotherhood_, and so\non. Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands\nfor a universal, since all verbs have a meaning which is universal. We\nshall return to universals later on, in Chapter IX; for the present, it\nis only necessary to guard against the supposition that whatever we can\nbe acquainted with must be something particular and existent. Awareness\nof universals is called _conceiving_, and a universal of which we are\naware is called a _concept_.\nIt will be seen that among the objects with which we are acquainted\nare not included physical objects (as opposed to sense-data), nor other\npeople's minds. These things are known to us by what I call 'knowledge\nby description', which we must now consider.\nBy a 'description' I mean any phrase of the form 'a so-and-so' or\n'the so-and-so'. A phrase of the form 'a so-and-so' I shall call an\n'ambiguous' description; a phrase of the form 'the so-and-so' (in the\nsingular) I shall call a 'definite' description. Thus 'a man' is an\nambiguous description, and 'the man with the iron mask' is a definite\ndescription. There are various problems connected with ambiguous\ndescriptions, but I pass them by, since they do not directly concern\nthe matter we are discussing, which is the nature of our knowledge\nconcerning objects in cases where we know that there is an object\nanswering to a definite description, though we are not acquainted with\nany such object. This is a matter which is concerned exclusively with\ndefinite descriptions. I shall therefore, in the sequel, speak simply of\n'descriptions' when I mean 'definite descriptions'. Thus a description\nwill mean any phrase of the form 'the so-and-so' in the singular.\nWe shall say that an object is 'known by description' when we know that\nit is 'the so-and-so', i.e. when we know that there is one object, and\nno more, having a certain property; and it will generally be implied\nthat we do not have knowledge of the same object by acquaintance. We\nknow that the man with the iron mask existed, and many propositions\nare known about him; but we do not know who he was. We know that the\ncandidate who gets the most votes will be elected, and in this case we\nare very likely also acquainted (in the only sense in which one can\nbe acquainted with some one else) with the man who is, in fact, the\ncandidate who will get most votes; but we do not know which of the\ncandidates he is, i.e. we do not know any proposition of the form 'A is\nthe candidate who will get most votes' where A is one of the candidates\nby name. We shall say that we have 'merely descriptive knowledge' of the\nso-and-so when, although we know that the so-and-so exists, and although\nwe may possibly be acquainted with the object which is, in fact, the\nso-and-so, yet we do not know any proposition '_a_ is the so-and-so',\nwhere _a_ is something with which we are acquainted.\nWhen we say 'the so-and-so exists', we mean that there is just one\nobject which is the so-and-so. The proposition '_a_ is the so-and-so'\nmeans that _a_ has the property so-and-so, and nothing else has. 'Mr.\nA. is the Unionist candidate for this constituency' means 'Mr. A. is\na Unionist candidate for this constituency, and no one else is'. 'The\nUnionist candidate for this constituency exists' means 'some one is a\nUnionist candidate for this constituency, and no one else is'. Thus,\nwhen we are acquainted with an object which is the so-and-so, we know\nthat the so-and-so exists; but we may know that the so-and-so exists\nwhen we are not acquainted with any object which we know to be the\nso-and-so, and even when we are not acquainted with any object which, in\nfact, is the so-and-so.\nCommon words, even proper names, are usually really descriptions. That\nis to say, the thought in the mind of a person using a proper name\ncorrectly can generally only be expressed explicitly if we replace the\nproper name by a description. Moreover, the description required to\nexpress the thought will vary for different people, or for the same\nperson at different times. The only thing constant (so long as the name\nis rightly used) is the object to which the name applies. But so long as\nthis remains constant, the particular description involved usually makes\nno difference to the truth or falsehood of the proposition in which the\nname appears.\nLet us take some illustrations. Suppose some statement made about\nBismarck. Assuming that there is such a thing as direct acquaintance\nwith oneself, Bismarck himself might have used his name directly to\ndesignate the particular person with whom he was acquainted. In this\ncase, if he made a judgement about himself, he himself might be a\nconstituent of the judgement. Here the proper name has the direct use\nwhich it always wishes to have, as simply standing for a certain object,\nand not for a description of the object. But if a person who knew\nBismarck made a judgement about him, the case is different. What this\nperson was acquainted with were certain sense-data which he connected\n(rightly, we will suppose) with Bismarck's body. His body, as a physical\nobject, and still more his mind, were only known as the body and the\nmind connected with these sense-data. That is, they were known by\ndescription. It is, of course, very much a matter of chance which\ncharacteristics of a man's appearance will come into a friend's mind\nwhen he thinks of him; thus the description actually in the friend's\nmind is accidental. The essential point is that he knows that the\nvarious descriptions all apply to the same entity, in spite of not being\nacquainted with the entity in question.\nWhen we, who did not know Bismarck, make a judgement about him, the\ndescription in our minds will probably be some more or less vague mass\nof historical knowledge--far more, in most cases, than is required to\nidentify him. But, for the sake of illustration, let us assume that we\nthink of him as 'the first Chancellor of the German Empire'. Here all\nthe words are abstract except 'German'. The word 'German' will, again,\nhave different meanings for different people. To some it will recall\ntravels in Germany, to some the look of Germany on the map, and so on.\nBut if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable,\nwe shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a\nparticular with which we are acquainted. Such reference is involved in\nany mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite dates),\nor of here and there, or of what others have told us. Thus it would seem\nthat, in some way or other, a description known to be applicable to a\nparticular must involve some reference to a particular with which we\nare acquainted, if our knowledge about the thing described is not to be\nmerely what follows _logically_ from the description. For example, 'the\nmost long-lived of men' is a description involving only universals,\nwhich must apply to some man, but we can make no judgements concerning\nthis man which involve knowledge about him beyond what the description\ngives. If, however, we say, 'The first Chancellor of the German Empire\nwas an astute diplomatist', we can only be assured of the truth of our\njudgement in virtue of something with which we are acquainted--usually a\ntestimony heard or read. Apart from the information we convey to others,\napart from the fact about the actual Bismarck, which gives importance\nto our judgement, the thought we really have contains the one or more\nparticulars involved, and otherwise consists wholly of concepts.\nAll names of places--London, England, Europe, the Earth, the Solar\nSystem--similarly involve, when used, descriptions which start from some\none or more particulars with which we are acquainted. I suspect that\neven the Universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a\nconnexion with particulars. In logic, on the contrary, where we are\nconcerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or\ncould exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.\nIt would seem that, when we make a statement about something only known\nby description, we often _intend_ to make our statement, not in the form\ninvolving the description, but about the actual thing described. That\nis to say, when we say anything about Bismarck, we should like, if we\ncould, to make the judgement which Bismarck alone can make, namely,\nthe judgement of which he himself is a constituent. In this we are\nnecessarily defeated, since the actual Bismarck is unknown to us. But\nwe know that there is an object B, called Bismarck, and that B was an\nastute diplomatist. We can thus _describe_ the proposition we should\nlike to affirm, namely, 'B was an astute diplomatist', where B is the\nobject which was Bismarck. If we are describing Bismarck as 'the first\nChancellor of the German Empire', the proposition we should like to\naffirm may be described as 'the proposition asserting, concerning the\nactual object which was the first Chancellor of the German Empire, that\nthis object was an astute diplomatist'. What enables us to communicate\nin spite of the varying descriptions we employ is that we know there is\na true proposition concerning the actual Bismarck, and that however we\nmay vary the description (so long as the description is correct) the\nproposition described is still the same. This proposition, which is\ndescribed and is known to be true, is what interests us; but we are not\nacquainted with the proposition itself, and do not know it, though we\nknow it is true.\nIt will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from\nacquaintance with particulars: there is Bismarck to people who knew him;\nBismarck to those who only know of him through history; the man with\nthe iron mask; the longest-lived of men. These are progressively further\nremoved from acquaintance with particulars; the first comes as near to\nacquaintance as is possible in regard to another person; in the second,\nwe shall still be said to know 'who Bismarck was'; in the third, we do\nnot know who was the man with the iron mask, though we can know many\npropositions about him which are not logically deducible from the fact\nthat he wore an iron mask; in the fourth, finally, we know nothing\nbeyond what is logically deducible from the definition of the man. There\nis a similar hierarchy in the region of universals. Many universals,\nlike many particulars, are only known to us by description. But here,\nas in the case of particulars, knowledge concerning what is known by\ndescription is ultimately reducible to knowledge concerning what is\nknown by acquaintance.\nThe fundamental principle in the analysis of propositions containing\ndescriptions is this: _Every proposition which we can understand must be\ncomposed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted_.\nWe shall not at this stage attempt to answer all the objections which\nmay be urged against this fundamental principle. For the present, we\nshall merely point out that, in some way or other, it must be possible\nto meet these objections, for it is scarcely conceivable that we can\nmake a judgement or entertain a supposition without knowing what it is\nthat we are judging or supposing about. We must attach _some_ meaning\nto the words we use, if we are to speak significantly and not utter mere\nnoise; and the meaning we attach to our words must be something with\nwhich we are acquainted. Thus when, for example, we make a statement\nabout Julius Caesar, it is plain that Julius Caesar himself is not\nbefore our minds, since we are not acquainted with him. We have in mind\nsome description of Julius Caesar: 'the man who was assassinated on the\nIdes of March', 'the founder of the Roman Empire', or, perhaps, merely\n'the man whose name was _Julius Caesar_'. (In this last description,\n_Julius Caesar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted.)\nThus our statement does not mean quite what it seems to mean, but means\nsomething involving, instead of Julius Caesar, some description of him\nwhich is composed wholly of particulars and universals with which we are\nacquainted.\nThe chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us\nto pass beyond the limits of our private experience. In spite of the\nfact that we can only know truths which are wholly composed of terms\nwhich we have experienced in acquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by\ndescription of things which we have never experienced. In view of the\nvery narrow range of our immediate experience, this result is vital, and\nuntil it is understood, much of our knowledge must remain mysterious and\ntherefore doubtful.\nCHAPTER VI. ON INDUCTION\nIn almost all our previous discussions we have been concerned in\nthe attempt to get clear as to our data in the way of knowledge of\nexistence. What things are there in the universe whose existence is\nknown to us owing to our being acquainted with them? So far, our answer\nhas been that we are acquainted with our sense-data, and, probably,\nwith ourselves. These we know to exist. And past sense-data which\nare remembered are known to have existed in the past. This knowledge\nsupplies our data.\nBut if we are to be able to draw inferences from these data--if we are\nto know of the existence of matter, of other people, of the past before\nour individual memory begins, or of the future, we must know general\nprinciples of some kind by means of which such inferences can be drawn.\nIt must be known to us that the existence of some one sort of thing, A,\nis a sign of the existence of some other sort of thing, B, either at\nthe same time as A or at some earlier or later time, as, for example,\nthunder is a sign of the earlier existence of lightning. If this were\nnot known to us, we could never extend our knowledge beyond the\nsphere of our private experience; and this sphere, as we have seen, is\nexceedingly limited. The question we have now to consider is whether\nsuch an extension is possible, and if so, how it is effected.\nLet us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us, in fact,\nfeel the slightest doubt. We are all convinced that the sun will rise\nto-morrow. Why? Is this belief a mere blind outcome of past experience,\nor can it be justified as a reasonable belief? It is not easy to find\na test by which to judge whether a belief of this kind is reasonable or\nnot, but we can at least ascertain what sort of general beliefs would\nsuffice, if true, to justify the judgement that the sun will rise\nto-morrow, and the many other similar judgements upon which our actions\nare based.\nIt is obvious that if we are asked why we believe that the sun will rise\nto-morrow, we shall naturally answer 'Because it always has risen every\nday'. We have a firm belief that it will rise in the future, because it\nhas risen in the past. If we are challenged as to why we believe that\nit will continue to rise as heretofore, we may appeal to the laws of\nmotion: the earth, we shall say, is a freely rotating body, and such\nbodies do not cease to rotate unless something interferes from outside,\nand there is nothing outside to interfere with the earth between now and\nto-morrow. Of course it might be doubted whether we are quite certain\nthat there is nothing outside to interfere, but this is not the\ninteresting doubt. The interesting doubt is as to whether the laws\nof motion will remain in operation until to-morrow. If this doubt is\nraised, we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about\nthe sunrise was first raised.\nThe _only_ reason for believing that the laws of motion will remain in\noperation is that they have operated hitherto, so far as our knowledge\nof the past enables us to judge. It is true that we have a greater body\nof evidence from the past in favour of the laws of motion than we have\nin favour of the sunrise, because the sunrise is merely a particular\ncase of fulfilment of the laws of motion, and there are countless other\nparticular cases. But the real question is: Do _any_ number of cases\nof a law being fulfilled in the past afford evidence that it will be\nfulfilled in the future? If not, it becomes plain that we have no ground\nwhatever for expecting the sun to rise to-morrow, or for expecting the\nbread we shall eat at our next meal not to poison us, or for any of the\nother scarcely conscious expectations that control our daily lives. It\nis to be observed that all such expectations are only _probable_; thus\nwe have not to seek for a proof that they _must_ be fulfilled, but\nonly for some reason in favour of the view that they are _likely_ to be\nfulfilled.\nNow in dealing with this question we must, to begin with, make an\nimportant distinction, without which we should soon become involved\nin hopeless confusions. Experience has shown us that, hitherto, the\nfrequent repetition of some uniform succession or coexistence has been a\n_cause_ of our expecting the same succession or coexistence on the next\noccasion. Food that has a certain appearance generally has a certain\ntaste, and it is a severe shock to our expectations when the familiar\nappearance is found to be associated with an unusual taste. Things which\nwe see become associated, by habit, with certain tactile sensations\nwhich we expect if we touch them; one of the horrors of a ghost (in\nmany ghost-stories) is that it fails to give us any sensations of touch.\nUneducated people who go abroad for the first time are so surprised as\nto be incredulous when they find their native language not understood.\nAnd this kind of association is not confined to men; in animals also it\nis very strong. A horse which has been often driven along a certain\nroad resists the attempt to drive him in a different direction. Domestic\nanimals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We\nknow that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable\nto be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout\nits life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined\nviews as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the\nchicken.\nBut in spite of the misleadingness of such expectations, they\nnevertheless exist. The mere fact that something has happened a certain\nnumber of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen\nagain. Thus our instincts certainly cause us to believe that the sun\nwill rise to-morrow, but we may be in no better a position than the\nchicken which unexpectedly has its neck wrung. We have therefore to\ndistinguish the fact that past uniformities _cause_ expectations as to\nthe future, from the question whether there is any reasonable ground for\ngiving weight to such expectations after the question of their validity\nhas been raised.\nThe problem we have to discuss is whether there is any reason for\nbelieving in what is called 'the uniformity of nature'. The belief in\nthe uniformity of nature is the belief that everything that has happened\nor will happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no\nexceptions. The crude expectations which we have been considering are\nall subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who\nentertain them. But science habitually assumes, at least as a working\nhypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions can be replaced by\ngeneral rules which have no exceptions. 'Unsupported bodies in air fall'\nis a general rule to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. But\nthe laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which account for the\nfact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and\naeroplanes can rise; thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation\nare not subject to these exceptions.\nThe belief that the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the\nearth came suddenly into contact with a large body which destroyed its\nrotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not\nbe infringed by such an event. The business of science is to find\nuniformities, such as the laws of motion and the law of gravitation,\nto which, so far as our experience extends, there are no exceptions.\nIn this search science has been remarkably successful, and it may be\nconceded that such uniformities have held hitherto. This brings us back\nto the question: Have we any reason, assuming that they have always held\nin the past, to suppose that they will hold in the future?\nIt has been argued that we have reason to know that the future will\nresemble the past, because what was the future has constantly become the\npast, and has always been found to resemble the past, so that we really\nhave experience of the future, namely of times which were formerly\nfuture, which we may call past futures. But such an argument really begs\nthe very question at issue. We have experience of past futures, but not\nof future futures, and the question is: Will future futures resemble\npast futures? This question is not to be answered by an argument which\nstarts from past futures alone. We have therefore still to seek for some\nprinciple which shall enable us to know that the future will follow the\nsame laws as the past.\nThe reference to the future in this question is not essential. The same\nquestion arises when we apply the laws that work in our experience to\npast things of which we have no experience--as, for example, in geology,\nor in theories as to the origin of the Solar System. The question we\nreally have to ask is: 'When two things have been found to be often\nassociated, and no instance is known of the one occurring without the\nother, does the occurrence of one of the two, in a fresh instance, give\nany good ground for expecting the other?' On our answer to this question\nmust depend the validity of the whole of our expectations as to the\nfuture, the whole of the results obtained by induction, and in fact\npractically all the beliefs upon which our daily life is based.\nIt must be conceded, to begin with, that the fact that two things have\nbeen found often together and never apart does not, by itself, suffice\nto _prove_ demonstratively that they will be found together in the next\ncase we examine. The most we can hope is that the oftener things are\nfound together, the more probable it becomes that they will be found\ntogether another time, and that, if they have been found together often\nenough, the probability will amount _almost_ to certainty. It can\nnever quite reach certainty, because we know that in spite of frequent\nrepetitions there sometimes is a failure at the last, as in the case\nof the chicken whose neck is wrung. Thus probability is all we ought to\nseek.\nIt might be urged, as against the view we are advocating, that we\nknow all natural phenomena to be subject to the reign of law, and that\nsometimes, on the basis of observation, we can see that only one law\ncan possibly fit the facts of the case. Now to this view there are two\nanswers. The first is that, even if _some_ law which has no exceptions\napplies to our case, we can never, in practice, be sure that we have\ndiscovered that law and not one to which there are exceptions. The\nsecond is that the reign of law would seem to be itself only probable,\nand that our belief that it will hold in the future, or in unexamined\ncases in the past, is itself based upon the very principle we are\nexamining.\nThe principle we are examining may be called the _principle of\ninduction_, and its two parts may be stated as follows:\n(a) When a thing of a certain sort A has been found to be associated\nwith a thing of a certain other sort B, and has never been found\ndissociated from a thing of the sort B, the greater the number of cases\nin which A and B have been associated, the greater is the probability\nthat they will be associated in a fresh case in which one of them is\nknown to be present;\n(b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of\nassociation will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a\ncertainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.\nAs just stated, the principle applies only to the verification of our\nexpectation in a single fresh instance. But we want also to know that\nthere is a probability in favour of the general law that things of the\nsort A are _always_ associated with things of the sort B, provided a\nsufficient number of cases of association are known, and no cases of\nfailure of association are known. The probability of the general law is\nobviously less than the probability of the particular case, since if the\ngeneral law is true, the particular case must also be true, whereas\nthe particular case may be true without the general law being true.\nNevertheless the probability of the general law is increased by\nrepetitions, just as the probability of the particular case is. We may\ntherefore repeat the two parts of our principle as regards the general\nlaw, thus:\n(a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has\nbeen found associated with a thing of the sort B, the more probable it\nis (if no cases of failure of association are known) that A is always\nassociated with B;\nb) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the\nassociation of A with B will make it nearly certain that A is always\nassociated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty\nwithout limit.\nIt should be noted that probability is always relative to certain data.\nIn our case, the data are merely the known cases of coexistence of A and\nB. There may be other data, which _might_ be taken into account, which\nwould gravely alter the probability. For example, a man who had seen a\ngreat many white swans might argue, by our principle, that on the\ndata it was _probable_ that all swans were white, and this might be a\nperfectly sound argument. The argument is not disproved by the fact that\nsome swans are black, because a thing may very well happen in spite of\nthe fact that some data render it improbable. In the case of the swans,\na man might know that colour is a very variable characteristic in many\nspecies of animals, and that, therefore, an induction as to colour is\npeculiarly liable to error. But this knowledge would be a fresh datum,\nby no means proving that the probability relatively to our previous data\nhad been wrongly estimated. The fact, therefore, that things often fail\nto fulfil our expectations is no evidence that our expectations will not\n_probably_ be fulfilled in a given case or a given class of cases. Thus\nour inductive principle is at any rate not capable of being _disproved_\nby an appeal to experience.\nThe inductive principle, however, is equally incapable of being _proved_\nby an appeal to experience. Experience might conceivably confirm\nthe inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already\nexamined; but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle\nalone that can justify any inference from what has been examined to what\nhas not been examined. All arguments which, on the basis of experience,\nargue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or\npresent, assume the inductive principle; hence we can never use\nexperience to prove the inductive principle without begging the\nquestion. Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the\nground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our\nexpectations about the future. If the principle is unsound, we have no\nreason to expect the sun to rise to-morrow, to expect bread to be more\nnourishing than a stone, or to expect that if we throw ourselves off\nthe roof we shall fall. When we see what looks like our best friend\napproaching us, we shall have no reason to suppose that his body is not\ninhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. All\nour conduct is based upon associations which have worked in the past,\nand which we therefore regard as likely to work in the future; and this\nlikelihood is dependent for its validity upon the inductive principle.\nThe general principles of science, such as the belief in the reign\nof law, and the belief that every event must have a cause, are as\ncompletely dependent upon the inductive principle as are the beliefs of\ndaily life All such general principles are believed because mankind have\nfound innumerable instances of their truth and no instances of their\nfalsehood. But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future,\nunless the inductive principle is assumed.\nThus all knowledge which, on a basis of experience tells us something\nabout what is not experienced, is based upon a belief which experience\ncan neither confirm nor confute, yet which, at least in its more\nconcrete applications, appears to be as firmly rooted in us as many\nof the facts of experience. The existence and justification of such\nbeliefs--for the inductive principle, as we shall see, is not the only\nexample--raises some of the most difficult and most debated problems of\nphilosophy. We will, in the next chapter, consider briefly what may be\nsaid to account for such knowledge, and what is its scope and its degree\nof certainty.\nCHAPTER VII. ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the principle of induction, while\nnecessary to the validity of all arguments based on experience,\nis itself not capable of being proved by experience, and yet is\nunhesitatingly believed by every one, at least in all its concrete\napplications. In these characteristics the principle of induction does\nnot stand alone. There are a number of other principles which cannot be\nproved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start\nfrom what is experienced.\nSome of these principles have even greater evidence than the principle\nof induction, and the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty\nas the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. They constitute the\nmeans of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation; and if what\nwe infer is to be true, it is just as necessary that our principles\nof inference should be true as it is that our data should be true. The\nprinciples of inference are apt to be overlooked because of their\nvery obviousness--the assumption involved is assented to without our\nrealizing that it is an assumption. But it is very important to realize\nthe use of principles of inference, if a correct theory of knowledge\nis to be obtained; for our knowledge of them raises interesting and\ndifficult questions.\nIn all our knowledge of general principles, what actually happens\nis that first of all we realize some particular application of the\nprinciple, and then we realize that the particularity is irrelevant, and\nthat there is a generality which may equally truly be affirmed. This is\nof course familiar in such matters as teaching arithmetic: 'two and\ntwo are four' is first learnt in the case of some particular pair of\ncouples, and then in some other particular case, and so on, until at\nlast it becomes possible to see that it is true of any pair of couples.\nThe same thing happens with logical principles. Suppose two men are\ndiscussing what day of the month it is. One of them says, 'At least you\nwill admit that _if_ yesterday was the 15th to-day must be the 16th.'\n'Yes', says the other, 'I admit that.' 'And you know', the first\ncontinues, 'that yesterday was the 15th, because you dined with Jones,\nand your diary will tell you that was on the 15th.' 'Yes', says the\nsecond; 'therefore to-day _is_ the 16th.'\nNow such an argument is not hard to follow; and if it is granted that\nits premisses are true in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion\nmust also be true. But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a\ngeneral logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose\nit known that _if_ this is true, then that is true. Suppose it also\nknown that this _is_ true, then it follows that that is true.' When it\nis the case that if this is true, that is true, we shall say that this\n'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle\nstates that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true.\nIn other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or\n'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.\nThis principle is really involved--at least, concrete instances of it\nare involved--in all demonstrations. Whenever one thing which we believe\nis used to prove something else, which we consequently believe, this\nprinciple is relevant. If any one asks: 'Why should I accept the results\nof valid arguments based on true premisses?' we can only answer by\nappealing to our principle. In fact, the truth of the principle is\nimpossible to doubt, and its obviousness is so great that at first sight\nit seems almost trivial. Such principles, however, are not trivial to\nthe philosopher, for they show that we may have indubitable knowledge\nwhich is in no way derived from objects of sense.\nThe above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident\nlogical principles. Some at least of these principles must be granted\nbefore any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have\nbeen granted, others can be proved, though these others, so long as they\nare simple, are just as obvious as the principles taken for granted. For\nno very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by\ntradition under the name of 'Laws of Thought'.\nThey are as follows:\n(1) _The law of identity_: 'Whatever is, is.'\n(2) _The law of contradiction_: 'Nothing can both be and not be.'\n(3) _The law of excluded middle_: 'Everything must either be or not be.'\nThese three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles, but\nare not really more fundamental or more self-evident than various other\nsimilar principles: for instance, the one we considered just now, which\nstates that what follows from a true premiss is true. The name 'laws of\nthought' is also misleading, for what is important is not the fact that\nwe think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave\nin accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in\naccordance with them we think _truly_. But this is a large question, to\nwhich we must return at a later stage.\nIn addition to the logical principles which enable us to prove from\na given premiss that something is _certainly_ true, there are other\nlogical principles which enable us to prove, from a given premiss,\nthat there is a greater or less probability that something is true. An\nexample of such principles--perhaps the most important example is the\ninductive principle, which we considered in the preceding chapter.\nOne of the great historic controversies in philosophy is the controversy\nbetween the two schools called respectively 'empiricists' and\n'rationalists'. The empiricists--who are best represented by the\nBritish philosophers, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume--maintained that all\nour knowledge is derived from experience; the rationalists--who are\nrepresented by the Continental philosophers of the seventeenth century,\nespecially Descartes and Leibniz--maintained that, in addition to what\nwe know by experience, there are certain 'innate ideas' and 'innate\nprinciples', which we know independently of experience. It has now\nbecome possible to decide with some confidence as to the truth or\nfalsehood of these opposing schools. It must be admitted, for the\nreasons already stated, that logical principles are known to us, and\ncannot be themselves proved by experience, since all proof presupposes\nthem. In this, therefore, which was the most important point of the\ncontroversy, the rationalists were in the right.\nOn the other hand, even that part of our knowledge which is _logically_\nindependent of experience (in the sense that experience cannot prove\nit) is yet elicited and caused by experience. It is on occasion of\nparticular experiences that we become aware of the general laws which\ntheir connexions exemplify. It would certainly be absurd to suppose that\nthere are innate principles in the sense that babies are born with a\nknowledge of everything which men know and which cannot be deduced from\nwhat is experienced. For this reason, the word 'innate' would not now be\nemployed to describe our knowledge of logical principles. The phrase\n'_a priori_' is less objectionable, and is more usual in modern writers.\nThus, while admitting that all knowledge is elicited and caused by\nexperience, we shall nevertheless hold that some knowledge is _a\npriori_, in the sense that the experience which makes us think of it\ndoes not suffice to prove it, but merely so directs our attention that\nwe see its truth without requiring any proof from experience.\nThere is another point of great importance, in which the empiricists\nwere in the right as against the rationalists. Nothing can be known to\n_exist_ except by the help of experience. That is to say, if we wish to\nprove that something of which we have no direct experience exists, we\nmust have among our premisses the existence of one or more things of\nwhich we have direct experience. Our belief that the Emperor of China\nexists, for example, rests upon testimony, and testimony consists,\nin the last analysis, of sense-data seen or heard in reading or being\nspoken to. Rationalists believed that, from general consideration as\nto what must be, they could deduce the existence of this or that in the\nactual world. In this belief they seem to have been mistaken. All the\nknowledge that we can acquire _a priori_ concerning existence seems\nto be hypothetical: it tells us that if one thing exists, another must\nexist, or, more generally, that if one proposition is true, another must\nbe true. This is exemplified by the principles we have already dealt\nwith, such as '_if_ this is true, and this implies that, then that is\ntrue', or '_if_ this and that have been repeatedly found connected, they\nwill probably be connected in the next instance in which one of them is\nfound'. Thus the scope and power of _a priori_ principles is strictly\nlimited. All knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent\non experience. When anything is known immediately, its existence is\nknown by experience alone; when anything is proved to exist, without\nbeing known immediately, both experience and _a priori_ principles must\nbe required in the proof. Knowledge is called _empirical_ when it rests\nwholly or partly upon experience. Thus all knowledge which asserts\nexistence is empirical, and the only _a priori_ knowledge concerning\nexistence is hypothetical, giving connexions among things that exist or\nmay exist, but not giving actual existence.\n_A priori_ knowledge is not all of the logical kind we have been\nhitherto considering. Perhaps the most important example of non-logical\n_a priori_ knowledge is knowledge as to ethical value. I am not speaking\nof judgements as to what is useful or as to what is virtuous, for such\njudgements do require empirical premisses; I am speaking of judgements\nas to the intrinsic desirability of things. If something is useful, it\nmust be useful because it secures some end; the end must, if we have\ngone far enough, be valuable on its own account, and not merely because\nit is useful for some further end. Thus all judgements as to what is\nuseful depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account.\nWe judge, for example, that happiness is more desirable than misery,\nknowledge than ignorance, goodwill than hatred, and so on. Such\njudgements must, in part at least, be immediate and _a priori_. Like our\nprevious _a priori_ judgements, they may be elicited by experience, and\nindeed they must be; for it seems not possible to judge whether anything\nis intrinsically valuable unless we have experienced something of\nthe same kind. But it is fairly obvious that they cannot be proved by\nexperience; for the fact that a thing exists or does not exist cannot\nprove either that it is good that it should exist or that it is bad. The\npursuit of this subject belongs to ethics, where the impossibility of\ndeducing what ought to be from what is has to be established. In the\npresent connexion, it is only important to realize that knowledge as to\nwhat is intrinsically of value is _a priori_ in the same sense in\nwhich logic is _a priori_, namely in the sense that the truth of such\nknowledge can be neither proved nor disproved by experience.\nAll pure mathematics is _a priori_, like logic. This was strenuously\ndenied by the empirical philosophers, who maintained that experience was\nas much the source of our knowledge of arithmetic as of our knowledge of\ngeography. They maintained that by the repeated experience of seeing two\nthings and two other things, and finding that altogether they made four\nthings, we were led by induction to the conclusion that two things\nand two other things would _always_ make four things altogether. If,\nhowever, this were the source of our knowledge that two and two are\nfour, we should proceed differently, in persuading ourselves of its\ntruth, from the way in which we do actually proceed. In fact, a certain\nnumber of instances are needed to make us think of two abstractly,\nrather than of two coins or two books or two people, or two of any other\nspecified kind. But as soon as we are able to divest our thoughts of\nirrelevant particularity, we become able to see the general principle\nthat two and two are four; any one instance is seen to be _typical_, and\nthe examination of other instances becomes unnecessary.(1)\n(1) Cf. A. N. Whitehead, _Introduction to Mathematics_ (Home University\nLibrary).\nThe same thing is exemplified in geometry. If we want to prove some\nproperty of _all_ triangles, we draw some one triangle and reason about\nit; but we can avoid making use of any property which it does not share\nwith all other triangles, and thus, from our particular case, we obtain\na general result. We do not, in fact, feel our certainty that two and\ntwo are four increased by fresh instances, because, as soon as we have\nseen the truth of this proposition, our certainty becomes so great as\nto be incapable of growing greater. Moreover, we feel some quality of\nnecessity about the proposition 'two and two are four', which is\nabsent from even the best attested empirical generalizations. Such\ngeneralizations always remain mere facts: we feel that there might be a\nworld in which they were false, though in the actual world they happen\nto be true. In any possible world, on the contrary, we feel that two\nand two would be four: this is not a mere fact, but a necessity to which\neverything actual and possible must conform.\nThe case may be made clearer by considering a genuinely-empirical\ngeneralization, such as 'All men are mortal.' It is plain that we\nbelieve this proposition, in the first place, because there is no known\ninstance of men living beyond a certain age, and in the second place\nbecause there seem to be physiological grounds for thinking that an\norganism such as a man's body must sooner or later wear out. Neglecting\nthe second ground, and considering merely our experience of men's\nmortality, it is plain that we should not be content with one quite\nclearly understood instance of a man dying, whereas, in the case of 'two\nand two are four', one instance does suffice, when carefully considered,\nto persuade us that the same must happen in any other instance. Also\nwe can be forced to admit, on reflection, that there may be some doubt,\nhowever slight, as to whether _all_ men are mortal. This may be made\nplain by the attempt to imagine two different worlds, in one of which\nthere are men who are not mortal, while in the other two and two make\nfive. When Swift invites us to consider the race of Struldbugs who never\ndie, we are able to acquiesce in imagination. But a world where two\nand two make five seems quite on a different level. We feel that such a\nworld, if there were one, would upset the whole fabric of our knowledge\nand reduce us to utter doubt.\nThe fact is that, in simple mathematical judgements such as 'two and two\nare four', and also in many judgements of logic, we can know the general\nproposition without inferring it from instances, although some instance\nis usually necessary to make clear to us what the general proposition\nmeans. This is why there is real utility in the process of _deduction_,\nwhich goes from the general to the general, or from the general to the\nparticular, as well as in the process of _induction_, which goes from\nthe particular to the particular, or from the particular to the general.\nIt is an old debate among philosophers whether deduction ever gives\n_new_ knowledge. We can now see that in certain cases, at least, it does\ndo so. If we already know that two and two always make four, and we\nknow that Brown and Jones are two, and so are Robinson and Smith, we can\ndeduce that Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith are four. This is\nnew knowledge, not contained in our premisses, because the general\nproposition, 'two and two are four', never told us there were such\npeople as Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith, and the particular\npremisses do not tell us that there were four of them, whereas the\nparticular proposition deduced does tell us both these things.\nBut the newness of the knowledge is much less certain if we take the\nstock instance of deduction that is always given in books on logic,\nnamely, 'All men are mortal; Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is\nmortal.' In this case, what we really know beyond reasonable doubt is\nthat certain men, A, B, C, were mortal, since, in fact, they have died.\nIf Socrates is one of these men, it is foolish to go the roundabout way\nthrough 'all men are mortal' to arrive at the conclusion that _probably_\nSocrates is mortal. If Socrates is not one of the men on whom our\ninduction is based, we shall still do better to argue straight from our\nA, B, C, to Socrates, than to go round by the general proposition, 'all\nmen are mortal'. For the probability that Socrates is mortal is greater,\non our data, than the probability that all men are mortal. (This is\nobvious, because if all men are mortal, so is Socrates; but if Socrates\nis mortal, it does not follow that all men are mortal.) Hence we shall\nreach the conclusion that Socrates is mortal with a greater approach to\ncertainty if we make our argument purely inductive than if we go by way\nof 'all men are mortal' and then use deduction.\nThis illustrates the difference between general propositions known _a\npriori_ such as 'two and two are four', and empirical generalizations\nsuch as 'all men are mortal'. In regard to the former, deduction is the\nright mode of argument, whereas in regard to the latter, induction is\nalways theoretically preferable, and warrants a greater confidence in\nthe truth of our conclusion, because all empirical generalizations are\nmore uncertain than the instances of them.\nWe have now seen that there are propositions known _a priori_, and that\namong them are the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well\nas the fundamental propositions of ethics. The question which must\nnext occupy us is this: How is it possible that there should be such\nknowledge? And more particularly, how can there be knowledge of general\npropositions in cases where we have not examined all the instances, and\nindeed never can examine them all, because their number is infinite?\nThese questions, which were first brought prominently forward by\nthe German philosopher Kant (1724-1804), are very difficult, and\nhistorically very important.\nCHAPTER VIII. HOW _A PRIORI_ KNOWLEDGE IS POSSIBLE\nImmanuel Kant is generally regarded as the greatest of the modern\nphilosophers. Though he lived through the Seven Years War and the\nFrench Revolution, he never interrupted his teaching of philosophy at\nK\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia. His most distinctive contribution was the\ninvention of what he called the 'critical' philosophy, which, assuming\nas a datum that there is knowledge of various kinds, inquired how such\nknowledge comes to be possible, and deduced, from the answer to this\ninquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the world.\nWhether these results were valid may well be doubted. But Kant\nundoubtedly deserves credit for two things: first, for having perceived\nthat we have _a priori_ knowledge which is not purely 'analytic', i.e.\nsuch that the opposite would be self-contradictory, and secondly,\nfor having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of\nknowledge.\nBefore the time of Kant, it was generally held that whatever knowledge\nwas _a priori_ must be 'analytic'. What this word means will be best\nillustrated by examples. If I say, 'A bald man is a man', 'A plane\nfigure is a figure', 'A bad poet is a poet', I make a purely analytic\njudgement: the subject spoken about is given as having at least two\nproperties, of which one is singled out to be asserted of it. Such\npropositions as the above are trivial, and would never be enunciated\nin real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piece of\nsophistry. They are called 'analytic' because the predicate is obtained\nby merely analysing the subject. Before the time of Kant it was thought\nthat all judgements of which we could be certain _a priori_ were of this\nkind: that in all of them there was a predicate which was only part\nof the subject of which it was asserted. If this were so, we should be\ninvolved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything\nthat could be known _a priori_. 'A bald man is not bald' would assert\nand deny baldness of the same man, and would therefore contradict\nitself. Thus according to the philosophers before Kant, the law of\ncontradiction, which asserts that nothing can at the same time have and\nnot have a certain property, sufficed to establish the truth of all _a\npriori_ knowledge.\nHume (1711-76), who preceded Kant, accepting the usual view as to what\nmakes knowledge _a priori_, discovered that, in many cases which had\npreviously been supposed analytic, and notably in the case of cause and\neffect, the connexion was really synthetic. Before Hume, rationalists at\nleast had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the\ncause, if only we had sufficient knowledge. Hume argued--correctly, as\nwould now be generally admitted--that this could not be done. Hence he\ninferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known\n_a priori_ about the connexion of cause and effect. Kant, who had been\neducated in the rationalist tradition, was much perturbed by Hume's\nscepticism, and endeavoured to find an answer to it. He perceived that\nnot only the connexion of cause and effect, but all the propositions\nof arithmetic and geometry, are 'synthetic', i.e. not analytic: in\nall these propositions, no analysis of the subject will reveal the\npredicate. His stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. He pointed\nout, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12: the\nidea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them\ntogether. Thus he was led to the conclusion that all pure mathematics,\nthough _a priori_, is synthetic; and this conclusion raised a new\nproblem of which he endeavoured to find the solution.\nThe question which Kant put at the beginning of his philosophy, namely\n'How is pure mathematics possible?' is an interesting and difficult one,\nto which every philosophy which is not purely sceptical must find\nsome answer. The answer of the pure empiricists, that our mathematical\nknowledge is derived by induction from particular instances, we have\nalready seen to be inadequate, for two reasons: first, that the validity\nof the inductive principle itself cannot be proved by induction;\nsecondly, that the general propositions of mathematics, such as 'two\nand two always make four', can obviously be known with certainty by\nconsideration of a single instance, and gain nothing by enumeration of\nother cases in which they have been found to be true. Thus our knowledge\nof the general propositions of mathematics (and the same applies to\nlogic) must be accounted for otherwise than our (merely probable)\nknowledge of empirical generalizations such as 'all men are mortal'.\nThe problem arises through the fact that such knowledge is general,\nwhereas all experience is particular. It seems strange that we should\napparently be able to know some truths in advance about particular\nthings of which we have as yet no experience; but it cannot easily be\ndoubted that logic and arithmetic will apply to such things. We do not\nknow who will be the inhabitants of London a hundred years hence; but\nwe know that any two of them and any other two of them will make four of\nthem. This apparent power of anticipating facts about things of which\nwe have no experience is certainly surprising. Kant's solution of the\nproblem, though not valid in my opinion, is interesting. It is, however,\nvery difficult, and is differently understood by different philosophers.\nWe can, therefore, only give the merest outline of it, and even that\nwill be thought misleading by many exponents of Kant's system.\nWhat Kant maintained was that in all our experience there are two\nelements to be distinguished, the one due to the object (i.e. to what we\nhave called the 'physical object'), the other due to our own nature. We\nsaw, in discussing matter and sense-data, that the physical object is\ndifferent from the associated sense-data, and that the sense-data are to\nbe regarded as resulting from an interaction between the physical\nobject and ourselves. So far, we are in agreement with Kant. But what\nis distinctive of Kant is the way in which he apportions the shares of\nourselves and the physical object respectively. He considers that the\ncrude material given in sensation--the colour, hardness, etc.--is due\nto the object, and that what we supply is the arrangement in space\nand time, and all the relations between sense-data which result from\ncomparison or from considering one as the cause of the other or in any\nother way. His chief reason in favour of this view is that we seem\nto have _a priori_ knowledge as to space and time and causality and\ncomparison, but not as to the actual crude material of sensation. We can\nbe sure, he says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the\ncharacteristics affirmed of it in our _a priori_ knowledge, because\nthese characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore\nnothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these\ncharacteristics.\nThe physical object, which he calls the 'thing in itself',(1) he regards\nas essentially unknowable; what can be known is the object as we have it\nin experience, which he calls the 'phenomenon'. The phenomenon, being\na joint product of us and the thing in itself, is sure to have those\ncharacteristics which are due to us, and is therefore sure to conform\nto our _a priori_ knowledge. Hence this knowledge, though true of all\nactual and possible experience, must not be supposed to apply outside\nexperience. Thus in spite of the existence of _a priori_ knowledge, we\ncannot know anything about the thing in itself or about what is not\nan actual or possible object of experience. In this way he tries to\nreconcile and harmonize the contentions of the rationalists with the\narguments of the empiricists.\n(1) Kant's 'thing in itself' is identical in _definition_ with\nthe physical object, namely, it is the cause of sensations. In the\nproperties deduced from the definition it is not identical, since Kant\nheld (in spite of some inconsistency as regards cause) that we can know\nthat none of the categories are applicable to the 'thing in itself'.\nApart from minor grounds on which Kant's philosophy may be criticized,\nthere is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal\nwith the problem of _a priori_ knowledge by his method. The thing to\nbe accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to\nlogic and arithmetic. To say that logic and arithmetic are contributed\nby us does not account for this. Our nature is as much a fact of the\nexisting world as anything, and there can be no certainty that it will\nremain constant. It might happen, if Kant is right, that to-morrow\nour nature would so change as to make two and two become five. This\npossibility seems never to have occurred to him, yet it is one which\nutterly destroys the certainty and universality which he is anxious\nto vindicate for arithmetical propositions. It is true that this\npossibility, formally, is inconsistent with the Kantian view that time\nitself is a form imposed by the subject upon phenomena, so that our\nreal Self is not in time and has no to-morrow. But he will still have\nto suppose that the time-order of phenomena is determined by\ncharacteristics of what is behind phenomena, and this suffices for the\nsubstance of our argument.\nReflection, moreover, seems to make it clear that, if there is any truth\nin our arithmetical beliefs, they must apply to things equally whether\nwe think of them or not. Two physical objects and two other physical\nobjects must make four physical objects, even if physical objects cannot\nbe experienced. To assert this is certainly within the scope of what\nwe mean when we state that two and two are four. Its truth is just as\nindubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two\nother phenomena make four phenomena. Thus Kant's solution unduly limits\nthe scope of _a priori_ propositions, in addition to failing in the\nattempt at explaining their certainty.\nApart from the special doctrines advocated by Kant, it is very common\namong philosophers to regard what is _a priori_ as in some sense mental,\nas concerned rather with the way we must think than with any fact of\nthe outer world. We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles\ncommonly called 'laws of thought'. The view which led to their being so\nnamed is a natural one, but there are strong reasons for thinking\nthat it is erroneous. Let us take as an illustration the law of\ncontradiction. This is commonly stated in the form 'Nothing can both be\nand not be', which is intended to express the fact that nothing can at\nonce have and not have a given quality. Thus, for example, if a tree\nis a beech it cannot also be not a beech; if my table is rectangular it\ncannot also be not rectangular, and so on.\nNow what makes it natural to call this principle a law of _thought_\nis that it is by thought rather than by outward observation that we\npersuade ourselves of its necessary truth. When we have seen that a tree\nis a beech, we do not need to look again in order to ascertain whether\nit is also not a beech; thought alone makes us know that this is\nimpossible. But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law\nof _thought_ is nevertheless erroneous. What we believe, when we believe\nthe law of contradiction, is not that the mind is so made that it must\nbelieve the law of contradiction. _This_ belief is a subsequent result\nof psychological reflection, which presupposes the belief in the law of\ncontradiction. The belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about\nthings, not only about thoughts. It is not, e.g., the belief that if we\n_think_ a certain tree is a beech, we cannot at the same time _think_\nthat it is not a beech; it is the belief that if the tree _is_ a\nbeech, it cannot at the same time _be_ not a beech. Thus the law of\ncontradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts; and\nalthough belief in the law of contradiction is a thought, the law of\ncontradiction itself is not a thought, but a fact concerning the things\nin the world. If this, which we believe when we believe the law of\ncontradiction, were not true of the things in the world, the fact\nthat we were compelled to _think_ it true would not save the law of\ncontradiction from being false; and this shows that the law is not a law\nof _thought_.\nA similar argument applies to any other _a priori_ judgement. When we\njudge that two and two are four, we are not making a judgement about our\nthoughts, but about all actual or possible couples. The fact that our\nminds are so constituted as to believe that two and two are four, though\nit is true, is emphatically not what we assert when we assert that two\nand two are four. And no fact about the constitution of our minds could\nmake it _true_ that two and two are four. Thus our _a priori_ knowledge,\nif it is not erroneous, is not merely knowledge about the constitution\nof our minds, but is applicable to whatever the world may contain, both\nwhat is mental and what is non-mental.\nThe fact seems to be that all our _a priori_ knowledge is concerned with\nentities which do not, properly speaking, _exist_, either in the mental\nor in the physical world. These entities are such as can be named by\nparts of speech which are not substantives; they are such entities as\nqualities and relations. Suppose, for instance, that I am in my room. I\nexist, and my room exists; but does 'in' exist? Yet obviously the word\n'in' has a meaning; it denotes a relation which holds between me and my\nroom. This relation is something, although we cannot say that it exists\n_in the same sense_ in which I and my room exist. The relation 'in' is\nsomething which we can think about and understand, for, if we could not\nunderstand it, we could not understand the sentence 'I am in my room'.\nMany philosophers, following Kant, have maintained that relations are\nthe work of the mind, that things in themselves have no relations,\nbut that the mind brings them together in one act of thought and thus\nproduces the relations which it judges them to have.\nThis view, however, seems open to objections similar to those which we\nurged before against Kant. It seems plain that it is not thought which\nproduces the truth of the proposition 'I am in my room'. It may be true\nthat an earwig is in my room, even if neither I nor the earwig nor any\none else is aware of this truth; for this truth concerns only the earwig\nand the room, and does not depend upon anything else. Thus relations, as\nwe shall see more fully in the next chapter, must be placed in a world\nwhich is neither mental nor physical. This world is of great importance\nto philosophy, and in particular to the problems of _a priori_\nknowledge. In the next chapter we shall proceed to develop its nature\nand its bearing upon the questions with which we have been dealing.\nCHAPTER IX. THE WORLD OF UNIVERSALS\nAt the end of the preceding chapter we saw that such entities as\nrelations appear to have a being which is in some way different from\nthat of physical objects, and also different from that of minds and from\nthat of sense-data. In the present chapter we have to consider what is\nthe nature of this kind of being, and also what objects there are that\nhave this kind of being. We will begin with the latter question.\nThe problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one, since it\nwas brought into philosophy by Plato. Plato's 'theory of ideas' is an\nattempt to solve this very problem, and in my opinion it is one of the\nmost successful attempts hitherto made. The theory to be advocated in\nwhat follows is largely Plato's, with merely such modifications as time\nhas shown to be necessary.\nThe way the problem arose for Plato was more or less as follows. Let\nus consider, say, such a notion as _justice_. If we ask ourselves what\njustice is, it is natural to proceed by considering this, that, and the\nother just act, with a view to discovering what they have in common.\nThey must all, in some sense, partake of a common nature, which will be\nfound in whatever is just and in nothing else. This common nature, in\nvirtue of which they are all just, will be justice itself, the pure\nessence the admixture of which with facts of ordinary life produces the\nmultiplicity of just acts. Similarly with any other word which may be\napplicable to common facts, such as 'whiteness' for example. The word\nwill be applicable to a number of particular things because they all\nparticipate in a common nature or essence. This pure essence is what\nPlato calls an 'idea' or 'form'. (It must not be supposed that 'ideas',\nin his sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.)\nThe 'idea' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just: it is\nsomething other than particular things, which particular things partake\nof. Not being particular, it cannot itself exist in the world of sense.\nMoreover it is not fleeting or changeable like the things of sense: it\nis eternally itself, immutable and indestructible.\nThus Plato is led to a supra-sensible world, more real than the common\nworld of sense, the unchangeable world of ideas, which alone gives to\nthe world of sense whatever pale reflection of reality may belong to it.\nThe truly real world, for Plato, is the world of ideas; for whatever\nwe may attempt to say about things in the world of sense, we can only\nsucceed in saying that they participate in such and such ideas, which,\ntherefore, constitute all their character. Hence it is easy to pass\non into a mysticism. We may hope, in a mystic illumination, to see the\nideas as we see objects of sense; and we may imagine that the ideas\nexist in heaven. These mystical developments are very natural, but the\nbasis of the theory is in logic, and it is as based in logic that we\nhave to consider it.\nThe word 'idea' has acquired, in the course of time, many associations\nwhich are quite misleading when applied to Plato's 'ideas'. We shall\ntherefore use the word 'universal' instead of the word 'idea', to\ndescribe what Plato meant. The essence of the sort of entity that Plato\nmeant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in\nsensation. We speak of whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same\nnature as things given in sensation, as a _particular_; by opposition\nto this, a _universal_ will be anything which may be shared by many\nparticulars, and has those characteristics which, as we saw, distinguish\njustice and whiteness from just acts and white things.\nWhen we examine common words, we find that, broadly speaking, proper\nnames stand for particulars, while other substantives, adjectives,\nprepositions, and verbs stand for universals. Pronouns stand for\nparticulars, but are ambiguous: it is only by the context or the\ncircumstances that we know what particulars they stand for. The word\n'now' stands for a particular, namely the present moment; but like\npronouns, it stands for an ambiguous particular, because the present is\nalways changing.\nIt will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one\nword which denotes a universal. The nearest approach would be some such\nstatement as 'I like this'. But even here the word 'like' denotes\na universal, for I may like other things, and other people may like\nthings. Thus all truths involve universals, and all knowledge of truths\ninvolves acquaintance with universals.\nSeeing that nearly all the words to be found in the dictionary stand\nfor universals, it is strange that hardly anybody except students of\nphilosophy ever realizes that there are such entities as universals. We\ndo not naturally dwell upon those words in a sentence which do not stand\nfor particulars; and if we are forced to dwell upon a word which stands\nfor a universal, we naturally think of it as standing for some one of\nthe particulars that come under the universal. When, for example, we\nhear the sentence, 'Charles I's head was cut off', we may naturally\nenough think of Charles I, of Charles I's head, and of the operation\nof cutting off _his_ head, which are all particulars; but we do not\nnaturally dwell upon what is meant by the word 'head' or the word\n'cut', which is a universal: We feel such words to be incomplete and\ninsubstantial; they seem to demand a context before anything can be\ndone with them. Hence we succeed in avoiding all notice of universals as\nsuch, until the study of philosophy forces them upon our attention.\nEven among philosophers, we may say, broadly, that only those universals\nwhich are named by adjectives or substantives have been much or often\nrecognized, while those named by verbs and prepositions have been\nusually overlooked. This omission has had a very great effect upon\nphilosophy; it is hardly too much to say that most metaphysics, since\nSpinoza, has been largely determined by it. The way this has occurred\nis, in outline, as follows: Speaking generally, adjectives and common\nnouns express qualities or properties of single things, whereas\nprepositions and verbs tend to express relations between two or more\nthings. Thus the neglect of prepositions and verbs led to the belief\nthat every proposition can be regarded as attributing a property to a\nsingle thing, rather than as expressing a relation between two or more\nthings. Hence it was supposed that, ultimately, there can be no such\nentities as relations between things. Hence either there can be only\none thing in the universe, or, if there are many things, they cannot\npossibly interact in any way, since any interaction would be a relation,\nand relations are impossible.\nThe first of these views, advocated by Spinoza and held in our own day\nby Bradley and many other philosophers, is called _monism_; the second,\nadvocated by Leibniz but not very common nowadays, is called _monadism_,\nbecause each of the isolated things is called a _monad_. Both these\nopposing philosophies, interesting as they are, result, in my opinion,\nfrom an undue attention to one sort of universals, namely the sort\nrepresented by adjectives and substantives rather than by verbs and\nprepositions.\nAs a matter of fact, if any one were anxious to deny altogether that\nthere are such things as universals, we should find that we cannot\nstrictly prove that there are such entities as _qualities_, i.e. the\nuniversals represented by adjectives and substantives, whereas we\ncan prove that there must be _relations_, i.e. the sort of universals\ngenerally represented by verbs and prepositions. Let us take in\nillustration the universal _whiteness_. If we believe that there is such\na universal, we shall say that things are white because they have the\nquality of whiteness. This view, however, was strenuously denied by\nBerkeley and Hume, who have been followed in this by later empiricists.\nThe form which their denial took was to deny that there are such things\nas 'abstract ideas '. When we want to think of whiteness, they said, we\nform an image of some particular white thing, and reason concerning this\nparticular, taking care not to deduce anything concerning it which we\ncannot see to be equally true of any other white thing. As an account of\nour actual mental processes, this is no doubt largely true. In geometry,\nfor example, when we wish to prove something about all triangles, we\ndraw a particular triangle and reason about it, taking care not to use\nany characteristic which it does not share with other triangles. The\nbeginner, in order to avoid error, often finds it useful to draw several\ntriangles, as unlike each other as possible, in order to make sure that\nhis reasoning is equally applicable to all of them. But a difficulty\nemerges as soon as we ask ourselves how we know that a thing is white\nor a triangle. If we wish to avoid the universals _whiteness_ and\n_triangularity_, we shall choose some particular patch of white or some\nparticular triangle, and say that anything is white or a triangle if it\nhas the right sort of resemblance to our chosen particular. But then the\nresemblance required will have to be a universal. Since there are many\nwhite things, the resemblance must hold between many pairs of particular\nwhite things; and this is the characteristic of a universal. It will be\nuseless to say that there is a different resemblance for each pair, for\nthen we shall have to say that these resemblances resemble each other,\nand thus at last we shall be forced to admit resemblance as a universal.\nThe relation of resemblance, therefore, must be a true universal. And\nhaving been forced to admit this universal, we find that it is no longer\nworth while to invent difficult and unplausible theories to avoid the\nadmission of such universals as whiteness and triangularity.\nBerkeley and Hume failed to perceive this refutation of their rejection\nof 'abstract ideas', because, like their adversaries, they only thought\nof _qualities_, and altogether ignored _relations_ as universals. We\nhave therefore here another respect in which the rationalists appear to\nhave been in the right as against the empiricists, although, owing to\nthe neglect or denial of relations, the deductions made by rationalists\nwere, if anything, more apt to be mistaken than those made by\nempiricists.\nHaving now seen that there must be such entities as universals, the next\npoint to be proved is that their being is not merely mental. By this is\nmeant that whatever being belongs to them is independent of their being\nthought of or in any way apprehended by minds. We have already touched\non this subject at the end of the preceding chapter, but we must now\nconsider more fully what sort of being it is that belongs to universals.\nConsider such a proposition as 'Edinburgh is north of London'. Here we\nhave a relation between two places, and it seems plain that the relation\nsubsists independently of our knowledge of it. When we come to know that\nEdinburgh is north of London, we come to know something which has to\ndo only with Edinburgh and London: we do not cause the truth of the\nproposition by coming to know it, on the contrary we merely apprehend a\nfact which was there before we knew it. The part of the earth's surface\nwhere Edinburgh stands would be north of the part where London stands,\neven if there were no human being to know about north and south, and\neven if there were no minds at all in the universe. This is, of course,\ndenied by many philosophers, either for Berkeley's reasons or for\nKant's. But we have already considered these reasons, and decided that\nthey are inadequate. We may therefore now assume it to be true that\nnothing mental is presupposed in the fact that Edinburgh is north of\nLondon. But this fact involves the relation 'north of', which is a\nuniversal; and it would be impossible for the whole fact to involve\nnothing mental if the relation 'north of', which is a constituent part\nof the fact, did involve anything mental. Hence we must admit that the\nrelation, like the terms it relates, is not dependent upon thought, but\nbelongs to the independent world which thought apprehends but does not\ncreate.\nThis conclusion, however, is met by the difficulty that the relation\n'north of' does not seem to _exist_ in the same sense in which Edinburgh\nand London exist. If we ask 'Where and when does this relation exist?'\nthe answer must be 'Nowhere and nowhen'. There is no place or time where\nwe can find the relation 'north of'. It does not exist in Edinburgh any\nmore than in London, for it relates the two and is neutral as between\nthem. Nor can we say that it exists at any particular time. Now\neverything that can be apprehended by the senses or by introspection\nexists at some particular time. Hence the relation 'north of' is\nradically different from such things. It is neither in space nor in\ntime, neither material nor mental; yet it is something.\nIt is largely the very peculiar kind of being that belongs to universals\nwhich has led many people to suppose that they are really mental. We\ncan think _of_ a universal, and our thinking then exists in a perfectly\nordinary sense, like any other mental act. Suppose, for example, that\nwe are thinking of whiteness. Then _in one sense_ it may be said that\nwhiteness is 'in our mind'. We have here the same ambiguity as we noted\nin discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV. In the strict sense, it is not\nwhiteness that is in our mind, but the act of thinking of whiteness. The\nconnected ambiguity in the word 'idea', which we noted at the same time,\nalso causes confusion here. In one sense of this word, namely the sense\nin which it denotes the _object_ of an act of thought, whiteness is an\n'idea'. Hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to\nthink that whiteness is an 'idea' in the other sense, i.e. an act of\nthought; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. But in so\nthinking, we rob it of its essential quality of universality. One man's\nact of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man's; one\nman's act of thought at one time is necessarily a different thing from\nthe same man's act of thought at another time. Hence, if whiteness were\nthe thought as opposed to its object, no two different men could think\nof it, and no one man could think of it twice. That which many different\nthoughts of whiteness have in common is their _object_, and this object\nis different from all of them. Thus universals are not thoughts, though\nwhen known they are the objects of thoughts.\nWe shall find it convenient only to speak of things _existing_ when they\nare in time, that is to say, when we can point to some time at which\nthey exist (not excluding the possibility of their existing at all\ntimes). Thus thoughts and feelings, minds and physical objects exist.\nBut universals do not exist in this sense; we shall say that they\n_subsist_ or _have being_, where 'being' is opposed to 'existence'\nas being timeless. The world of universals, therefore, may also be\ndescribed as the world of being. The world of being is unchangeable,\nrigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder\nof metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The\nworld of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries,\nwithout any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and\nfeelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything\nthat can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to\nthe value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall\nprefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. The one we do not\nprefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and\nhardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real. But the truth is that\nboth have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real,\nand both are important to the metaphysician. Indeed no sooner have we\ndistinguished the two worlds than it becomes necessary to consider their\nrelations.\nBut first of all we must examine our knowledge of universals. This\nconsideration will occupy us in the following chapter, where we shall\nfind that it solves the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, from which we\nwere first led to consider universals.\nCHAPTER X. ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS\nIn regard to one man's knowledge at a given time, universals, like\nparticulars, may be divided into those known by acquaintance, those\nknown only by description, and those not known either by acquaintance or\nby description.\nLet us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance. It is\nobvious, to begin with, that we are acquainted with such universals as\nwhite, red, black, sweet, sour, loud, hard, etc., i.e. with qualities\nwhich are exemplified in sense-data. When we see a white patch, we are\nacquainted, in the first instance, with the particular patch; but by\nseeing many white patches, we easily learn to abstract the whiteness\nwhich they all have in common, and in learning to do this we are\nlearning to be acquainted with whiteness. A similar process will make us\nacquainted with any other universal of the same sort. Universals of this\nsort may be called 'sensible qualities'. They can be apprehended with\nless effort of abstraction than any others, and they seem less removed\nfrom particulars than other universals are.\nWe come next to relations. The easiest relations to apprehend are those\nwhich hold between the different parts of a single complex sense-datum.\nFor example, I can see at a glance the whole of the page on which I\nam writing; thus the whole page is included in one sense-datum. But I\nperceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts,\nand some parts are above other parts. The process of abstraction in this\ncase seems to proceed somewhat as follows: I see successively a number\nof sense-data in which one part is to the left of another; I perceive,\nas in the case of different white patches, that all these sense-data\nhave something in common, and by abstraction I find that what they have\nin common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the relation\nwhich I call 'being to the left of'. In this way I become acquainted\nwith the universal relation.\nIn like manner I become aware of the relation of before and after in\ntime. Suppose I hear a chime of bells: when the last bell of the chime\nsounds, I can retain the whole chime before my mind, and I can perceive\nthat the earlier bells came before the later ones. Also in memory I\nperceive that what I am remembering came before the present time. From\neither of these sources I can abstract the universal relation of before\nand after, just as I abstracted the universal relation 'being to the\nleft of'. Thus time-relations, like space-relations, are among those\nwith which we are acquainted.\nAnother relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is\nresemblance. If I see simultaneously two shades of green, I can see\nthat they resemble each other; if I also see a shade of red: at the same\ntime, I can see that the two greens have more resemblance to each other\nthan either has to the red. In this way I become acquainted with the\nuniversal _resemblance_ or _similarity_.\nBetween universals, as between particulars, there are relations of which\nwe may be immediately aware. We have just seen that we can perceive\nthat the resemblance between two shades of green is greater than the\nresemblance between a shade of red and a shade of green. Here we are\ndealing with a relation, namely 'greater than', between two relations.\nOur knowledge of such relations, though it requires more power of\nabstraction than is required for perceiving the qualities of sense-data,\nappears to be equally immediate, and (at least in some cases) equally\nindubitable. Thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as\nwell as concerning sense-data.\nReturning now to the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, which we left\nunsolved when we began the consideration of universals, we find\nourselves in a position to deal with it in a much more satisfactory\nmanner than was possible before. Let us revert to the proposition 'two\nand two are four'. It is fairly obvious, in view of what has been said,\nthat this proposition states a relation between the universal 'two' and\nthe universal 'four'. This suggests a proposition which we shall\nnow endeavour to establish: namely, _All _a priori_ knowledge deals\nexclusively with the relations of universals_. This proposition is\nof great importance, and goes a long way towards solving our previous\ndifficulties concerning _a priori_ knowledge.\nThe only case in which it might seem, at first sight, as if our\nproposition were untrue, is the case in which an _a priori_ proposition\nstates that _all_ of one class of particulars belong to some other\nclass, or (what comes to the same thing) that _all_ particulars having\nsome one property also have some other. In this case it might seem\nas though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property\nrather than with the property. The proposition 'two and two are four' is\nreally a case in point, for this may be stated in the form 'any two\nand any other two are four', or 'any collection formed of two twos is a\ncollection of four'. If we can show that such statements as this really\ndeal only with universals, our proposition may be regarded as proved.\nOne way of discovering what a proposition deals with is to ask ourselves\nwhat words we must understand--in other words, what objects we must be\nacquainted with--in order to see what the proposition means. As soon as\nwe see what the proposition means, even if we do not yet know whether\nit is true or false, it is evident that we must have acquaintance with\nwhatever is really dealt with by the proposition. By applying this test,\nit appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with\nparticulars are really concerned only with universals. In the special\ncase of 'two and two are four', even when we interpret it as meaning\n'any collection formed of two twos is a collection of four', it is plain\nthat we can understand the proposition, i.e. we can see what it is that\nit asserts, as soon as we know what is meant by 'collection' and 'two'\nand 'four'. It is quite unnecessary to know all the couples in the\nworld: if it were necessary, obviously we could never understand the\nproposition, since the couples are infinitely numerous and therefore\ncannot all be known to us. Thus although our general statement _implies_\nstatements about particular couples, _as soon as we know that there are\nsuch particular couples_, yet it does not itself assert or imply that\nthere are such particular couples, and thus fails to make any statement\nwhatever about any actual particular couple. The statement made is about\n'couple', the universal, and not about this or that couple.\nThus the statement 'two and two are four' deals exclusively with\nuniversals, and therefore may be known by anybody who is acquainted\nwith the universals concerned and can perceive the relation between them\nwhich the statement asserts. It must be taken as a fact, discovered\nby reflecting upon our knowledge, that we have the power of sometimes\nperceiving such relations between universals, and therefore of sometimes\nknowing general _a priori_ propositions such as those of arithmetic and\nlogic. The thing that seemed mysterious, when we formerly considered\nsuch knowledge, was that it seemed to anticipate and control experience.\nThis, however, we can now see to have been an error. _No_ fact\nconcerning anything capable of being experienced can be known\nindependently of experience. We know _a priori_ that two things and two\nother things together make four things, but we do _not_ know _a priori_\nthat if Brown and Jones are two, and Robinson and Smith are two, then\nBrown and Jones and Robinson and Smith are four. The reason is that this\nproposition cannot be understood at all unless we know that there are\nsuch people as Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith, and this we can\nonly know by experience. Hence, although our general proposition is _a\npriori_, all its applications to actual particulars involve experience\nand therefore contain an empirical element. In this way what seemed\nmysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon\nan error.\nIt will serve to make the point clearer if we contrast our genuine _a\npriori_ judgement with an empirical generalization, such as 'all men are\nmortals'. Here as before, we can _understand_ what the proposition\nmeans as soon as we understand the universals involved, namely _man_ and\n_mortal_. It is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance\nwith the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition\nmeans. Thus the difference between an _a priori_ general proposition\nand an empirical generalization does not come in the _meaning_ of the\nproposition; it comes in the nature of the _evidence_ for it. In the\nempirical case, the evidence consists in the particular instances.\nWe believe that all men are mortal because we know that there are\ninnumerable instances of men dying, and no instances of their living\nbeyond a certain age. We do not believe it because we see a connexion\nbetween the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_. It is true that\nif physiology can prove, assuming the general laws that govern living\nbodies, that no living organism can last for ever, that gives a\nconnexion between _man_ and _mortality_ which would enable us to assert\nour proposition without appealing to the special evidence of _men_\ndying. But that only means that our generalization has been subsumed\nunder a wider generalization, for which the evidence is still of the\nsame kind, though more extensive. The progress of science is constantly\nproducing such subsumptions, and therefore giving a constantly wider\ninductive basis for scientific generalizations. But although this gives\na greater _degree_ of certainty, it does not give a different _kind_:\nthe ultimate ground remains inductive, i.e. derived from instances, and\nnot an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and\narithmetic.\nTwo opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general\npropositions. The first is that, if many particular instances are known,\nour general proposition may be arrived at in the first instance by\ninduction, and the connexion of universals may be only subsequently\nperceived. For example, it is known that if we draw perpendiculars\nto the sides of a triangle from the opposite angles, all three\nperpendiculars meet in a point. It would be quite possible to be first\nled to this proposition by actually drawing perpendiculars in many\ncases, and finding that they always met in a point; this experience\nmight lead us to look for the general proof and find it. Such cases are\ncommon in the experience of every mathematician.\nThe other point is more interesting, and of more philosophical\nimportance. It is, that we may sometimes know a general proposition in\ncases where we do not know a single instance of it. Take such a case as\nthe following: We know that any two numbers can be multiplied together,\nand will give a third called their _product_. We know that all pairs\nof integers the product of which is less than 100 have been actually\nmultiplied together, and the value of the product recorded in the\nmultiplication table. But we also know that the number of integers is\ninfinite, and that only a finite number of pairs of integers ever have\nbeen or ever will be thought of by human beings. Hence it follows that\nthere are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be\nthought of by human beings, and that all of them deal with integers the\nproduct of which is over 100. Hence we arrive at the proposition:\n'All products of two integers, which never have been and never will\nbe thought of by any human being, are over 100.' Here is a general\nproposition of which the truth is undeniable, and yet, from the very\nnature of the case, we can never give an instance; because any two\nnumbers we may think of are excluded by the terms of the proposition.\nThis possibility, of knowledge of general propositions of which no\ninstance can be given, is often denied, because it is not perceived\nthat the knowledge of such propositions only requires a knowledge of the\nrelations of universals, and does not require any knowledge of instances\nof the universals in question. Yet the knowledge of such general\npropositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally\nadmitted to be known. For example, we saw, in our early chapters,\nthat knowledge of physical objects, as opposed to sense-data, is only\nobtained by an inference, and that they are not things with which we are\nacquainted. Hence we can never know any proposition of the form 'this\nis a physical object', where 'this' is something immediately known. It\nfollows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that\nno actual instance can be given. We can give instances of the associated\nsense-data, but we cannot give instances of the actual physical objects.\nHence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this\npossibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given. And the\nsame applies to our knowledge of other people's minds, or of any other\nclass of things of which no instance is known to us by acquaintance.\nWe may now take a survey of the sources of our knowledge, as they have\nappeared in the course of our analysis. We have first to distinguish\nknowledge of things and knowledge of truths. In each there are two\nkinds, one immediate and one derivative. Our immediate knowledge of\nthings, which we called _acquaintance_, consists of two sorts, according\nas the things known are particulars or universals. Among particulars, we\nhave acquaintance with sense-data and (probably) with ourselves. Among\nuniversals, there seems to be no principle by which we can decide which\ncan be known by acquaintance, but it is clear that among those that\ncan be so known are sensible qualities, relations of space and time,\nsimilarity, and certain abstract logical universals. Our derivative\nknowledge of things, which we call knowledge by _description_, always\ninvolves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths. Our\nimmediate knowledge of _truths_ may be called _intuitive_ knowledge,\nand the truths so known may be called _self-evident_ truths. Among such\ntruths are included those which merely state what is given in sense, and\nalso certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though\nwith less certainty) some ethical propositions. Our _derivative_\nknowledge of truths consists of everything that we can deduce from\nself-evident truths by the use of self-evident principles of deduction.\nIf the above account is correct, all our knowledge of truths depends\nupon our intuitive knowledge. It therefore becomes important to consider\nthe nature and scope of intuitive knowledge, in much the same way as,\nat an earlier stage, we considered the nature and scope of knowledge by\nacquaintance. But knowledge of truths raises a further problem, which\ndoes not arise in regard to knowledge of things, namely the problem of\n_error_. Some of our beliefs turn out to be erroneous, and therefore\nit becomes necessary to consider how, if at all, we can distinguish\nknowledge from error. This problem does not arise with regard\nto knowledge by acquaintance, for, whatever may be the object of\nacquaintance, even in dreams and hallucinations, there is no error\ninvolved so long as we do not go beyond the immediate object: error can\nonly arise when we regard the immediate object, i.e. the sense-datum,\nas the mark of some physical object. Thus the problems connected\nwith knowledge of truths are more difficult than those connected\nwith knowledge of things. As the first of the problems connected\nwith knowledge of truths, let us examine the nature and scope of our\nintuitive judgements.\nCHAPTER XI. ON INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE\nThere is a common impression that everything that we believe ought to be\ncapable of proof, or at least of being shown to be highly probable. It\nis felt by many that a belief for which no reason can be given is an\nunreasonable belief. In the main, this view is just. Almost all our\ncommon beliefs are either inferred, or capable of being inferred, from\nother beliefs which may be regarded as giving the reason for them. As a\nrule, the reason has been forgotten, or has even never been consciously\npresent to our minds. Few of us ever ask ourselves, for example, what\nreason there is to suppose the food we are just going to eat will not\nturn out to be poison. Yet we feel, when challenged, that a perfectly\ngood reason could be found, even if we are not ready with it at the\nmoment. And in this belief we are usually justified.\nBut let us imagine some insistent Socrates, who, whatever reason we\ngive him, continues to demand a reason for the reason. We must sooner\nor later, and probably before very long, be driven to a point where we\ncannot find any further reason, and where it becomes almost certain that\nno further reason is even theoretically discoverable. Starting with the\ncommon beliefs of daily life, we can be driven back from point to point,\nuntil we come to some general principle, or some instance of a general\nprinciple, which seems luminously evident, and is not itself capable\nof being deduced from anything more evident. In most questions of\ndaily life, such as whether our food is likely to be nourishing and not\npoisonous, we shall be driven back to the inductive principle, which we\ndiscussed in Chapter VI. But beyond that, there seems to be no further\nregress. The principle itself is constantly used in our reasoning,\nsometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously; but there is no\nreasoning which, starting from some simpler self-evident principle,\nleads us to the principle of induction as its conclusion. And the same\nholds for other logical principles. Their truth is evident to us, and we\nemploy them in constructing demonstrations; but they themselves, or at\nleast some of them, are incapable of demonstration.\nSelf-evidence, however, is not confined to those among general\nprinciples which are incapable of proof. When a certain number of\nlogical principles have been admitted, the rest can be deduced from\nthem; but the propositions deduced are often just as self-evident as\nthose that were assumed without proof. All arithmetic, moreover, can\nbe deduced from the general principles of logic, yet the simple\npropositions of arithmetic, such as 'two and two are four', are just as\nself-evident as the principles of logic.\nIt would seem, also, though this is more disputable, that there are some\nself-evident ethical principles, such as 'we ought to pursue what is\ngood'.\nIt should be observed that, in all cases of general principles,\nparticular instances, dealing with familiar things, are more evident\nthan the general principle. For example, the law of contradiction states\nthat nothing can both have a certain property and not have it. This is\nevident as soon as it is understood, but it is not so evident as that a\nparticular rose which we see cannot be both red and not red. (It is of\ncourse possible that parts of the rose may be red and parts not red, or\nthat the rose may be of a shade of pink which we hardly know whether to\ncall red or not; but in the former case it is plain that the rose as a\nwhole is not red, while in the latter case the answer is theoretically\ndefinite as soon as we have decided on a precise definition of 'red'.)\nIt is usually through particular instances that we come to be able to\nsee the general principle. Only those who are practised in dealing with\nabstractions can readily grasp a general principle without the help of\ninstances.\nIn addition to general principles, the other kind of self-evident truths\nare those immediately derived from sensation. We will call such truths\n'truths of perception', and the judgements expressing them we will\ncall 'judgements of perception'. But here a certain amount of care\nis required in getting at the precise nature of the truths that are\nself-evident. The actual sense-data are neither true nor false. A\nparticular patch of colour which I see, for example, simply exists: it\nis not the sort of thing that is true or false. It is true that there is\nsuch a patch, true that it has a certain shape and degree of brightness,\ntrue that it is surrounded by certain other colours. But the patch\nitself, like everything else in the world of sense, is of a radically\ndifferent kind from the things that are true or false, and therefore\ncannot properly be said to be _true_. Thus whatever self-evident truths\nmay be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data\nfrom which they are obtained.\nIt would seem that there are two kinds of self-evident truths of\nperception, though perhaps in the last analysis the two kinds may\ncoalesce. First, there is the kind which simply asserts the _existence_\nof the sense-datum, without in any way analysing it. We see a patch\nof red, and we judge 'there is such-and-such a patch of red', or more\nstrictly 'there is that'; this is one kind of intuitive judgement of\nperception. The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex,\nand we subject it to some degree of analysis. If, for instance, we see a\n_round_ patch of red, we may judge 'that patch of red is round'. This is\nagain a judgement of perception, but it differs from our previous kind.\nIn our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour\nand shape: the colour is red and the shape is round. Our judgement\nanalyses the datum into colour and shape, and then recombines them by\nstating that the red colour is round in shape. Another example of this\nkind of judgement is 'this is to the right of that', where 'this'\nand 'that' are seen simultaneously. In this kind of judgement the\nsense-datum contains constituents which have some relation to each\nother, and the judgement asserts that these constituents have this\nrelation.\nAnother class of intuitive judgements, analogous to those of sense and\nyet quite distinct from them, are judgements of _memory_. There is some\ndanger of confusion as to the nature of memory, owing to the fact that\nmemory of an object is apt to be accompanied by an image of the object,\nand yet the image cannot be what constitutes memory. This is easily seen\nby merely noticing that the image is in the present, whereas what is\nremembered is known to be in the past. Moreover, we are certainly able\nto some extent to compare our image with the object remembered, so\nthat we often know, within somewhat wide limits, how far our image is\naccurate; but this would be impossible, unless the object, as opposed to\nthe image, were in some way before the mind. Thus the essence of memory\nis not constituted by the image, but by having immediately before the\nmind an object which is recognized as past. But for the fact of memory\nin this sense, we should not know that there ever was a past at all,\nnor should we be able to understand the word 'past', any more than a man\nborn blind can understand the word 'light'. Thus there must be intuitive\njudgements of memory, and it is upon them, ultimately, that all our\nknowledge of the past depends.\nThe case of memory, however, raises a difficulty, for it is notoriously\nfallacious, and thus throws doubt on the trustworthiness of intuitive\njudgements in general. This difficulty is no light one. But let us\nfirst narrow its scope as far as possible. Broadly speaking, memory is\ntrustworthy in proportion to the vividness of the experience and to its\nnearness in time. If the house next door was struck by lightning half a\nminute ago, my memory of what I saw and heard will be so reliable that\nit would be preposterous to doubt whether there had been a flash at\nall. And the same applies to less vivid experiences, so long as they are\nrecent. I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in\nthe same chair in which I am sitting now. Going backward over the day,\nI find things of which I am quite certain, other things of which I am\nalmost certain, other things of which I can become certain by thought\nand by calling up attendant circumstances, and some things of which I\nam by no means certain. I am quite certain that I ate my breakfast this\nmorning, but if I were as indifferent to my breakfast as a philosopher\nshould be, I should be doubtful. As to the conversation at breakfast,\nI can recall some of it easily, some with an effort, some only with a\nlarge element of doubt, and some not at all. Thus there is a continual\ngradation in the degree of self-evidence of what I remember, and a\ncorresponding gradation in the trustworthiness of my memory.\nThus the first answer to the difficulty of fallacious memory is to say\nthat memory has degrees of self-evidence, and that these correspond\nto the degrees of its trustworthiness, reaching a limit of perfect\nself-evidence and perfect trustworthiness in our memory of events which\nare recent and vivid.\nIt would seem, however, that there are cases of very firm belief in a\nmemory which is wholly false. It is probable that, in these cases, what\nis really remembered, in the sense of being immediately before the mind,\nis something other than what is falsely believed in, though something\ngenerally associated with it. George IV is said to have at last believed\nthat he was at the battle of Waterloo, because he had so often said that\nhe was. In this case, what was immediately remembered was his repeated\nassertion; the belief in what he was asserting (if it existed) would\nbe produced by association with the remembered assertion, and would\ntherefore not be a genuine case of memory. It would seem that cases of\nfallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way, i.e. they\ncan be shown to be not cases of memory in the strict sense at all.\nOne important point about self-evidence is made clear by the case of\nmemory, and that is, that self-evidence has degrees: it is not a quality\nwhich is simply present or absent, but a quality which may be more or\nless present, in gradations ranging from absolute certainty down to an\nalmost imperceptible faintness. Truths of perception and some of the\nprinciples of logic have the very highest degree of self-evidence;\ntruths of immediate memory have an almost equally high degree. The\ninductive principle has less self-evidence than some of the other\nprinciples of logic, such as 'what follows from a true premiss must be\ntrue'. Memories have a diminishing self-evidence as they become remoter\nand fainter; the truths of logic and mathematics have (broadly speaking)\nless self-evidence as they become more complicated. Judgements of\nintrinsic ethical or aesthetic value are apt to have some self-evidence,\nbut not much.\nDegrees of self-evidence are important in the theory of knowledge,\nsince, if propositions may (as seems likely) have some degree of\nself-evidence without being true, it will not be necessary to abandon\nall connexion between self-evidence and truth, but merely to say that,\nwhere there is a conflict, the more self-evident proposition is to be\nretained and the less self-evident rejected.\nIt seems, however, highly probable that two different notions are\ncombined in 'self-evidence' as above explained; that one of them,\nwhich corresponds to the highest degree of self-evidence, is really an\ninfallible guarantee of truth, while the other, which corresponds to\nall the other degrees, does not give an infallible guarantee, but only a\ngreater or less presumption. This, however, is only a suggestion, which\nwe cannot as yet develop further. After we have dealt with the nature\nof truth, we shall return to the subject of self-evidence, in connexion\nwith the distinction between knowledge and error.\nCHAPTER XII. TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD\nOur knowledge of truths, unlike our knowledge of things, has an\nopposite, namely _error_. So far as things are concerned, we may know\nthem or not know them, but there is no positive state of mind which can\nbe described as erroneous knowledge of things, so long, at any rate,\nas we confine ourselves to knowledge by acquaintance. Whatever we are\nacquainted with must be something; we may draw wrong inferences from\nour acquaintance, but the acquaintance itself cannot be deceptive. Thus\nthere is no dualism as regards acquaintance. But as regards knowledge of\ntruths, there is a dualism. We may believe what is false as well as\nwhat is true. We know that on very many subjects different people\nhold different and incompatible opinions: hence some beliefs must be\nerroneous. Since erroneous beliefs are often held just as strongly\nas true beliefs, it becomes a difficult question how they are to be\ndistinguished from true beliefs. How are we to know, in a given case,\nthat our belief is not erroneous? This is a question of the very\ngreatest difficulty, to which no completely satisfactory answer is\npossible. There is, however, a preliminary question which is rather less\ndifficult, and that is: What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood? It is\nthis preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter. In\nthis chapter we are not asking how we can know whether a belief is true\nor false: we are asking what is meant by the question whether a belief\nis true or false. It is to be hoped that a clear answer to this question\nmay help us to obtain an answer to the question what beliefs are\ntrue, but for the present we ask only 'What is truth?' and 'What is\nfalsehood?' not 'What beliefs are true?' and 'What beliefs are false?'\nIt is very important to keep these different questions entirely\nseparate, since any confusion between them is sure to produce an answer\nwhich is not really applicable to either.\nThere are three points to observe in the attempt to discover the nature\nof truth, three requisites which any theory must fulfil.\n(1) Our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite,\nfalsehood. A good many philosophers have failed adequately to satisfy\nthis condition: they have constructed theories according to which all\nour thinking ought to have been true, and have then had the greatest\ndifficulty in finding a place for falsehood. In this respect our theory\nof belief must differ from our theory of acquaintance, since in the case\nof acquaintance it was not necessary to take account of any opposite.\n(2) It seems fairly evident that if there were no beliefs there could\nbe no falsehood, and no truth either, in the sense in which truth is\ncorrelative to falsehood. If we imagine a world of mere matter, there\nwould be no room for falsehood in such a world, and although it would\ncontain what may be called 'facts', it would not contain any truths, in\nthe sense in which truths are things of the same kind as falsehoods.\nIn fact, truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements:\nhence a world of mere matter, since it would contain no beliefs or\nstatements, would also contain no truth or falsehood.\n(3) But, as against what we have just said, it is to be observed that\nthe truth or falsehood of a belief always depends upon something which\nlies outside the belief itself. If I believe that Charles I died on the\nscaffold, I believe truly, not because of any intrinsic quality of my\nbelief, which could be discovered by merely examining the belief, but\nbecause of an historical event which happened two and a half centuries\nago. If I believe that Charles I died in his bed, I believe falsely: no\ndegree of vividness in my belief, or of care in arriving at it, prevents\nit from being false, again because of what happened long ago, and not\nbecause of any intrinsic property of my belief. Hence, although truth\nand falsehood are properties of beliefs, they are properties dependent\nupon the relations of the beliefs to other things, not upon any internal\nquality of the beliefs.\nThe third of the above requisites leads us to adopt the view--which has\non the whole been commonest among philosophers--that truth consists in\nsome form of correspondence between belief and fact. It is, however, by\nno means an easy matter to discover a form of correspondence to which\nthere are no irrefutable objections. By this partly--and partly by the\nfeeling that, if truth consists in a correspondence of thought with\nsomething outside thought, thought can never know when truth has been\nattained--many philosophers have been led to try to find some definition\nof truth which shall not consist in relation to something wholly outside\nbelief. The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the\ntheory that truth consists in _coherence_. It is said that the mark of\nfalsehood is failure to cohere in the body of our beliefs, and that it\nis the essence of a truth to form part of the completely rounded system\nwhich is The Truth.\nThere is, however, a great difficulty in this view, or rather two great\ndifficulties. The first is that there is no reason to suppose that\nonly _one_ coherent body of beliefs is possible. It may be that, with\nsufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world\nthat would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different\nfrom the real past. In more scientific matters, it is certain that there\nare often two or more hypotheses which account for all the known facts\non some subject, and although, in such cases, men of science endeavour\nto find facts which will rule out all the hypotheses except one, there\nis no reason why they should always succeed.\nIn philosophy, again, it seems not uncommon for two rival hypotheses\nto be both able to account for all the facts. Thus, for example, it is\npossible that life is one long dream, and that the outer world has only\nthat degree of reality that the objects of dreams have; but although\nsuch a view does not seem inconsistent with known facts, there is no\nreason to prefer it to the common-sense view, according to which other\npeople and things do really exist. Thus coherence as the definition\nof truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one\ncoherent system.\nThe other objection to this definition of truth is that it assumes the\nmeaning of 'coherence' known, whereas, in fact, 'coherence' presupposes\nthe truth of the laws of logic. Two propositions are coherent when both\nmay be true, and are incoherent when one at least must be false. Now in\norder to know whether two propositions can both be true, we must\nknow such truths as the law of contradiction. For example, the two\npropositions, 'this tree is a beech' and 'this tree is not a beech',\nare not coherent, because of the law of contradiction. But if the law of\ncontradiction itself were subjected to the test of coherence, we should\nfind that, if we choose to suppose it false, nothing will any longer\nbe incoherent with anything else. Thus the laws of logic supply the\nskeleton or framework within which the test of coherence applies, and\nthey themselves cannot be established by this test.\nFor the above two reasons, coherence cannot be accepted as giving the\n_meaning_ of truth, though it is often a most important _test_ of truth\nafter a certain amount of truth has become known.\nHence we are driven back to _correspondence with fact_ as constituting\nthe nature of truth. It remains to define precisely what we mean by\n'fact', and what is the nature of the correspondence which must subsist\nbetween belief and fact, in order that belief may be true.\nIn accordance with our three requisites, we have to seek a theory of\ntruth which (1) allows truth to have an opposite, namely falsehood, (2)\nmakes truth a property of beliefs, but (3) makes it a property wholly\ndependent upon the relation of the beliefs to outside things.\nThe necessity of allowing for falsehood makes it impossible to regard\nbelief as a relation of the mind to a single object, which could be said\nto be what is believed. If belief were so regarded, we should find that,\nlike acquaintance, it would not admit of the opposition of truth and\nfalsehood, but would have to be always true. This may be made clear\nby examples. Othello believes falsely that Desdemona loves Cassio. We\ncannot say that this belief consists in a relation to a single object,\n'Desdemona's love for Cassio', for if there were such an object, the\nbelief would be true. There is in fact no such object, and therefore\nOthello cannot have any relation to such an object. Hence his belief\ncannot possibly consist in a relation to this object.\nIt might be said that his belief is a relation to a different object,\nnamely 'that Desdemona loves Cassio'; but it is almost as difficult to\nsuppose that there is such an object as this, when Desdemona does not\nlove Cassio, as it was to suppose that there is 'Desdemona's love for\nCassio'. Hence it will be better to seek for a theory of belief which\ndoes not make it consist in a relation of the mind to a single object.\nIt is common to think of relations as though they always held between\ntwo terms, but in fact this is not always the case. Some relations\ndemand three terms, some four, and so on. Take, for instance, the\nrelation 'between'. So long as only two terms come in, the relation\n'between' is impossible: three terms are the smallest number that render\nit possible. York is between London and Edinburgh; but if London and\nEdinburgh were the only places in the world, there could be nothing\nwhich was between one place and another. Similarly _jealousy_ requires\nthree people: there can be no such relation that does not involve three\nat least. Such a proposition as 'A wishes B to promote C's marriage with\nD' involves a relation of four terms; that is to say, A and B and C and\nD all come in, and the relation involved cannot be expressed otherwise\nthan in a form involving all four. Instances might be multiplied\nindefinitely, but enough has been said to show that there are relations\nwhich require more than two terms before they can occur.\nThe relation involved in _judging_ or _believing_ must, if falsehood is\nto be duly allowed for, be taken to be a relation between several terms,\nnot between two. When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, he\nmust not have before his mind a single object, 'Desdemona's love for\nCassio', or 'that Desdemona loves Cassio ', for that would require that\nthere should be objective falsehoods, which subsist independently of\nany minds; and this, though not logically refutable, is a theory to be\navoided if possible. Thus it is easier to account for falsehood if\nwe take judgement to be a relation in which the mind and the various\nobjects concerned all occur severally; that is to say, Desdemona and\nloving and Cassio must all be terms in the relation which subsists when\nOthello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio. This relation, therefore,\nis a relation of four terms, since Othello also is one of the terms of\nthe relation. When we say that it is a relation of four terms, we do not\nmean that Othello has a certain relation to Desdemona, and has the same\nrelation to loving and also to Cassio. This may be true of some other\nrelation than believing; but believing, plainly, is not a relation which\nOthello has to _each_ of the three terms concerned, but to _all_ of\nthem together: there is only one example of the relation of believing\ninvolved, but this one example knits together four terms. Thus the\nactual occurrence, at the moment when Othello is entertaining his\nbelief, is that the relation called 'believing' is knitting together\ninto one complex whole the four terms Othello, Desdemona, loving, and\nCassio. What is called belief or judgement is nothing but this relation\nof believing or judging, which relates a mind to several things other\nthan itself. An _act_ of belief or of judgement is the occurrence\nbetween certain terms at some particular time, of the relation of\nbelieving or judging.\nWe are now in a position to understand what it is that distinguishes a\ntrue judgement from a false one. For this purpose we will adopt certain\ndefinitions. In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges, and\nthere are terms concerning which it judges. We will call the mind the\n_subject_ in the judgement, and the remaining terms the _objects_. Thus,\nwhen Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello is the subject,\nwhile the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio. The subject and\nthe objects together are called the _constituents_ of the judgement.\nIt will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a\n'sense' or 'direction'. We may say, metaphorically, that it puts its\nobjects in a certain _order_, which we may indicate by means of the\norder of the words in the sentence. (In an inflected language, the same\nthing will be indicated by inflections, e.g. by the difference between\nnominative and accusative.) Othello's judgement that Cassio loves\nDesdemona differs from his judgement that Desdemona loves Cassio, in\nspite of the fact that it consists of the same constituents, because the\nrelation of judging places the constituents in a different order in the\ntwo cases. Similarly, if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello,\nthe constituents of the judgement are still the same, but their order is\ndifferent. This property of having a 'sense' or 'direction' is one which\nthe relation of judging shares with all other relations. The 'sense'\nof relations is the ultimate source of order and series and a host of\nmathematical concepts; but we need not concern ourselves further with\nthis aspect.\nWe spoke of the relation called 'judging' or 'believing' as knitting\ntogether into one complex whole the subject and the objects. In this\nrespect, judging is exactly like every other relation. Whenever a\nrelation holds between two or more terms, it unites the terms into a\ncomplex whole. If Othello loves Desdemona, there is such a complex whole\nas 'Othello's love for Desdemona'. The terms united by the relation may\nbe themselves complex, or may be simple, but the whole which results\nfrom their being united must be complex. Wherever there is a relation\nwhich relates certain terms, there is a complex object formed of the\nunion of those terms; and conversely, wherever there is a complex\nobject, there is a relation which relates its constituents. When an act\nof believing occurs, there is a complex, in which 'believing' is the\nuniting relation, and subject and objects are arranged in a certain\norder by the 'sense' of the relation of believing. Among the objects,\nas we saw in considering 'Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio',\none must be a relation--in this instance, the relation 'loving'. But\nthis relation, as it occurs in the act of believing, is not the relation\nwhich creates the unity of the complex whole consisting of the subject\nand the objects. The relation 'loving', as it occurs in the act of\nbelieving, is one of the objects--it is a brick in the structure, not\nthe cement. The cement is the relation 'believing'. When the belief is\n_true_, there is another complex unity, in which the relation which was\none of the objects of the belief relates the other objects. Thus, e.g.,\nif Othello believes _truly_ that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there is\na complex unity, 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', which is composed\nexclusively of the _objects_ of the belief, in the same order as they\nhad in the belief, with the relation which was one of the objects\noccurring now as the cement that binds together the other objects of the\nbelief. On the other hand, when a belief is _false_, there is no such\ncomplex unity composed only of the objects of the belief. If Othello\nbelieves _falsely_ that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there is no such\ncomplex unity as 'Desdemona's love for Cassio'.\nThus a belief is _true_ when it _corresponds_ to a certain associated\ncomplex, and _false_ when it does not. Assuming, for the sake of\ndefiniteness, that the objects of the belief are two terms and a\nrelation, the terms being put in a certain order by the 'sense' of\nthe believing, then if the two terms in that order are united by the\nrelation into a complex, the belief is true; if not, it is false. This\nconstitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search\nof. Judging or believing is a certain complex unity of which a mind is\na constituent; if the remaining constituents, taken in the order which\nthey have in the belief, form a complex unity, then the belief is true;\nif not, it is false.\nThus although truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, yet they\nare in a sense extrinsic properties, for the condition of the truth of\na belief is something not involving beliefs, or (in general) any mind\nat all, but only the _objects_ of the belief. A mind, which believes,\nbelieves truly when there is a _corresponding_ complex not involving the\nmind, but only its objects. This correspondence ensures truth, and its\nabsence entails falsehood. Hence we account simultaneously for the two\nfacts that beliefs (a) depend on minds for their _existence_, (b) do not\ndepend on minds for their _truth_.\nWe may restate our theory as follows: If we take such a belief as\n'Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio', we will call Desdemona\nand Cassio the _object-terms_, and loving the _object-relation_. If\nthere is a complex unity 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', consisting of\nthe object-terms related by the object-relation in the same order as\nthey have in the belief, then this complex unity is called the _fact\ncorresponding to the belief_. Thus a belief is true when there is a\ncorresponding fact, and is false when there is no corresponding fact.\nIt will be seen that minds do not _create_ truth or falsehood. They\ncreate beliefs, but when once the beliefs are created, the mind cannot\nmake them true or false, except in the special case where they concern\nfuture things which are within the power of the person believing, such\nas catching trains. What makes a belief true is a _fact_, and this fact\ndoes not (except in exceptional cases) in any way involve the mind of\nthe person who has the belief.\nHaving now decided what we _mean_ by truth and falsehood, we have next\nto consider what ways there are of knowing whether this or that belief\nis true or false. This consideration will occupy the next chapter.\nCHAPTER XIII. KNOWLEDGE, ERROR, AND PROBABLE OPINION\nThe question as to what we mean by truth and falsehood, which we\nconsidered in the preceding chapter, is of much less interest than the\nquestion as to how we can know what is true and what is false. This\nquestion will occupy us in the present chapter. There can be no doubt\nthat _some_ of our beliefs are erroneous; thus we are led to inquire\nwhat certainty we can ever have that such and such a belief is not\nerroneous. In other words, can we ever _know_ anything at all, or do we\nmerely sometimes by good luck believe what is true? Before we can attack\nthis question, we must, however, first decide what we mean by 'knowing',\nand this question is not so easy as might be supposed.\nAt first sight we might imagine that knowledge could be defined as 'true\nbelief'. When what we believe is true, it might be supposed that we had\nachieved a knowledge of what we believe. But this would not accord\nwith the way in which the word is commonly used. To take a very trivial\ninstance: If a man believes that the late Prime Minister's last name\nbegan with a B, he believes what is true, since the late Prime Minister\nwas Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman. But if he believes that Mr. Balfour\nwas the late Prime Minister, he will still believe that the late Prime\nMinister's last name began with a B, yet this belief, though true,\nwould not be thought to constitute knowledge. If a newspaper, by an\nintelligent anticipation, announces the result of a battle before any\ntelegram giving the result has been received, it may by good fortune\nannounce what afterwards turns out to be the right result, and it may\nproduce belief in some of its less experienced readers. But in spite of\nthe truth of their belief, they cannot be said to have knowledge. Thus\nit is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from\na false belief.\nIn like manner, a true belief cannot be called knowledge when it is\ndeduced by a fallacious process of reasoning, even if the premisses from\nwhich it is deduced are true. If I know that all Greeks are men and that\nSocrates was a man, and I infer that Socrates was a Greek, I cannot be\nsaid to _know_ that Socrates was a Greek, because, although my premisses\nand my conclusion are true, the conclusion does not follow from the\npremisses.\nBut are we to say that nothing is knowledge except what is validly\ndeduced from true premisses? Obviously we cannot say this. Such a\ndefinition is at once too wide and too narrow. In the first place, it is\ntoo wide, because it is not enough that our premisses should be _true_,\nthey must also be _known_. The man who believes that Mr. Balfour was the\nlate Prime Minister may proceed to draw valid deductions from the true\npremiss that the late Prime Minister's name began with a B, but he\ncannot be said to _know_ the conclusions reached by these deductions.\nThus we shall have to amend our definition by saying that knowledge\nis what is validly deduced from _known_ premisses. This, however, is a\ncircular definition: it assumes that we already know what is meant\nby 'known premisses'. It can, therefore, at best define one sort\nof knowledge, the sort we call derivative, as opposed to intuitive\nknowledge. We may say: '_Derivative_ knowledge is what is validly\ndeduced from premisses known intuitively'. In this statement there is\nno formal defect, but it leaves the definition of _intuitive_ knowledge\nstill to seek.\nLeaving on one side, for the moment, the question of intuitive\nknowledge, let us consider the above suggested definition of derivative\nknowledge. The chief objection to it is that it unduly limits knowledge.\nIt constantly happens that people entertain a true belief, which has\ngrown up in them because of some piece of intuitive knowledge from which\nit is capable of being validly inferred, but from which it has not, as a\nmatter of fact, been inferred by any logical process.\nTake, for example, the beliefs produced by reading. If the newspapers\nannounce the death of the King, we are fairly well justified in\nbelieving that the King is dead, since this is the sort of announcement\nwhich would not be made if it were false. And we are quite amply\njustified in believing that the newspaper asserts that the King is\ndead. But here the intuitive knowledge upon which our belief is based\nis knowledge of the existence of sense-data derived from looking at\nthe print which gives the news. This knowledge scarcely rises into\nconsciousness, except in a person who cannot read easily. A child may be\naware of the shapes of the letters, and pass gradually and painfully to\na realization of their meaning. But anybody accustomed to reading\npasses at once to what the letters mean, and is not aware, except on\nreflection, that he has derived this knowledge from the sense-data\ncalled seeing the printed letters. Thus although a valid inference from\nthe-letters to their meaning is possible, and _could_ be performed\nby the reader, it is not in fact performed, since he does not in fact\nperform any operation which can be called logical inference. Yet\nit would be absurd to say that the reader does not _know_ that the\nnewspaper announces the King's death.\nWe must, therefore, admit as derivative knowledge whatever is the result\nof intuitive knowledge even if by mere association, provided there _is_\na valid logical connexion, and the person in question could become aware\nof this connexion by reflection. There are in fact many ways, besides\nlogical inference, by which we pass from one belief to another: the\npassage from the print to its meaning illustrates these ways. These\nways may be called 'psychological inference'. We shall, then, admit such\npsychological inference as a means of obtaining derivative knowledge,\nprovided there is a discoverable logical inference which runs parallel\nto the psychological inference. This renders our definition of\nderivative knowledge less precise than we could wish, since the word\n'discoverable' is vague: it does not tell us how much reflection may be\nneeded in order to make the discovery. But in fact 'knowledge' is not a\nprecise conception: it merges into 'probable opinion', as we shall\nsee more fully in the course of the present chapter. A very precise\ndefinition, therefore, should not be sought, since any such definition\nmust be more or less misleading.\nThe chief difficulty in regard to knowledge, however, does not arise\nover derivative knowledge, but over intuitive knowledge. So long as we\nare dealing with derivative knowledge, we have the test of intuitive\nknowledge to fall back upon. But in regard to intuitive beliefs, it is\nby no means easy to discover any criterion by which to distinguish\nsome as true and others as erroneous. In this question it is scarcely\npossible to reach any very precise result: all our knowledge of truths\nis infected with some degree of doubt, and a theory which ignored this\nfact would be plainly wrong. Something may be done, however, to mitigate\nthe difficulties of the question.\nOur theory of truth, to begin with, supplies the possibility of\ndistinguishing certain truths as _self-evident_ in a sense which ensures\ninfallibility. When a belief is true, we said, there is a corresponding\nfact, in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex.\nThe belief is said to constitute _knowledge_ of this fact, provided\nit fulfils those further somewhat vague conditions which we have been\nconsidering in the present chapter. But in regard to any fact, besides\nthe knowledge constituted by belief, we may also have the kind of\nknowledge constituted by _perception_ (taking this word in its widest\npossible sense). For example, if you know the hour of the sunset,\nyou can at that hour know the fact that the sun is setting: this is\nknowledge of the fact by way of knowledge of _truths_; but you can also,\nif the weather is fine, look to the west and actually see the setting\nsun: you then know the same fact by the way of knowledge of _things_.\nThus in regard to any complex fact, there are, theoretically, two ways\nin which it may be known: (1) by means of a judgement, in which its\nseveral parts are judged to be related as they are in fact related; (2)\nby means of _acquaintance_ with the complex fact itself, which may (in a\nlarge sense) be called perception, though it is by no means confined to\nobjects of the senses. Now it will be observed that the second way of\nknowing a complex fact, the way of acquaintance, is only possible when\nthere really is such a fact, while the first way, like all judgement,\nis liable to error. The second way gives us the complex whole, and is\ntherefore only possible when its parts do actually have that relation\nwhich makes them combine to form such a complex. The first way, on the\ncontrary, gives us the parts and the relation severally, and demands\nonly the reality of the parts and the relation: the relation may not\nrelate those parts in that way, and yet the judgement may occur.\nIt will be remembered that at the end of Chapter XI we suggested that\nthere might be two kinds of self-evidence, one giving an absolute\nguarantee of truth, the other only a partial guarantee. These two kinds\ncan now be distinguished.\nWe may say that a truth is self-evident, in the first and most absolute\nsense, when we have acquaintance with the fact which corresponds to\nthe truth. When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, the\ncorresponding fact, if his belief were true, would be 'Desdemona's\nlove for Cassio'. This would be a fact with which no one could have\nacquaintance except Desdemona; hence in the sense of self-evidence that\nwe are considering, the truth that Desdemona loves Cassio (if it were\na truth) could only be self-evident to Desdemona. All mental facts, and\nall facts concerning sense-data, have this same privacy: there is only\none person to whom they can be self-evident in our present sense, since\nthere is only one person who can be acquainted with the mental things\nor the sense-data concerned. Thus no fact about any particular existing\nthing can be self-evident to more than one person. On the other hand,\nfacts about universals do not have this privacy. Many minds may be\nacquainted with the same universals; hence a relation between universals\nmay be known by acquaintance to many different people. In all cases\nwhere we know by acquaintance a complex fact consisting of certain terms\nin a certain relation, we say that the truth that these terms are so\nrelated has the first or absolute kind of self-evidence, and in these\ncases the judgement that the terms are so related _must_ be true. Thus\nthis sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of truth.\nBut although this sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of\ntruth, it does not enable us to be _absolutely_ certain, in the case of\nany given judgement, that the judgement in question is true. Suppose\nwe first perceive the sun shining, which is a complex fact, and thence\nproceed to make the judgement 'the sun is shining'. In passing from\nthe perception to the judgement, it is necessary to analyse the given\ncomplex fact: we have to separate out 'the sun' and 'shining' as\nconstituents of the fact. In this process it is possible to commit\nan error; hence even where a _fact_ has the first or absolute kind of\nself-evidence, a judgement believed to correspond to the fact is not\nabsolutely infallible, because it may not really correspond to the\nfact. But if it does correspond (in the sense explained in the preceding\nchapter), then it _must_ be true.\nThe second sort of self-evidence will be that which belongs to\njudgements in the first instance, and is not derived from direct\nperception of a fact as a single complex whole. This second kind of\nself-evidence will have degrees, from the very highest degree down to a\nbare inclination in favour of the belief. Take, for example, the case of\na horse trotting away from us along a hard road. At first our certainty\nthat we hear the hoofs is complete; gradually, if we listen intently,\nthere comes a moment when we think perhaps it was imagination or the\nblind upstairs or our own heartbeats; at last we become doubtful whether\nthere was any noise at all; then we _think_ we no longer hear anything,\nand at last we _know_ we no longer hear anything. In this process, there\nis a continual gradation of self-evidence, from the highest degree to\nthe least, not in the sense-data themselves, but in the judgements based\non them.\nOr again: Suppose we are comparing two shades of colour, one blue and\none green. We can be quite sure they are different shades of colour; but\nif the green colour is gradually altered to be more and more like the\nblue, becoming first a blue-green, then a greeny-blue, then blue,\nthere will come a moment when we are doubtful whether we can see any\ndifference, and then a moment when we know that we cannot see any\ndifference. The same thing happens in tuning a musical instrument, or in\nany other case where there is a continuous gradation. Thus self-evidence\nof this sort is a matter of degree; and it seems plain that the higher\ndegrees are more to be trusted than the lower degrees.\nIn derivative knowledge our ultimate premisses must have some degree of\nself-evidence, and so must their connexion with the conclusions deduced\nfrom them. Take for example a piece of reasoning in geometry. It is not\nenough that the axioms from which we start should be self-evident: it\nis necessary also that, at each step in the reasoning, the connexion of\npremiss and conclusion should be self-evident. In difficult reasoning,\nthis connexion has often only a very small degree of self-evidence;\nhence errors of reasoning are not improbable where the difficulty is\ngreat.\nFrom what has been said it is evident that, both as regards intuitive\nknowledge and as regards derivative knowledge, if we assume that\nintuitive knowledge is trustworthy in proportion to the degree of its\nself-evidence, there will be a gradation in trustworthiness, from the\nexistence of noteworthy sense-data and the simpler truths of logic and\narithmetic, which may be taken as quite certain, down to judgements\nwhich seem only just more probable than their opposites. What we firmly\nbelieve, if it is true, is called _knowledge_, provided it is either\nintuitive or inferred (logically or psychologically) from intuitive\nknowledge from which it follows logically. What we firmly believe, if it\nis not true, is called _error_. What we firmly believe, if it is neither\nknowledge nor error, and also what we believe hesitatingly, because it\nis, or is derived from, something which has not the highest degree of\nself-evidence, may be called _probable opinion_. Thus the greater\npart of what would commonly pass as knowledge is more or less probable\nopinion.\nIn regard to probable opinion, we can derive great assistance from\n_coherence_, which we rejected as the _definition_ of truth, but may\noften use as a _criterion_. A body of individually probable opinions,\nif they are mutually coherent, become more probable than any one of them\nwould be individually. It is in this way that many scientific hypotheses\nacquire their probability. They fit into a coherent system of probable\nopinions, and thus become more probable than they would be in isolation.\nThe same thing applies to general philosophical hypotheses. Often in a\nsingle case such hypotheses may seem highly doubtful, while yet, when\nwe consider the order and coherence which they introduce into a mass of\nprobable opinion, they become pretty nearly certain. This applies, in\nparticular, to such matters as the distinction between dreams and\nwaking life. If our dreams, night after night, were as coherent one with\nanother as our days, we should hardly know whether to believe the dreams\nor the waking life. As it is, the test of coherence condemns the\ndreams and confirms the waking life. But this test, though it increases\nprobability where it is successful, never gives absolute certainty,\nunless there is certainty already at some point in the coherent system.\nThus the mere organization of probable opinion will never, by itself,\ntransform it into indubitable knowledge.\nCHAPTER XIV. THE LIMITS OF PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE\nIn all that we have said hitherto concerning philosophy, we have\nscarcely touched on many matters that occupy a great space in the\nwritings of most philosophers. Most philosophers--or, at any rate, very\nmany--profess to be able to prove, by _a priori_ metaphysical reasoning,\nsuch things as the fundamental dogmas of religion, the essential\nrationality of the universe, the illusoriness of matter, the unreality\nof all evil, and so on. There can be no doubt that the hope of finding\nreason to believe such theses as these has been the chief inspiration of\nmany life-long students of philosophy. This hope, I believe, is vain. It\nwould seem that knowledge concerning the universe as a whole is not to\nbe obtained by metaphysics, and that the proposed proofs that, in virtue\nof the laws of logic such and such things _must_ exist and such and such\nothers cannot, are not capable of surviving a critical scrutiny. In\nthis chapter we shall briefly consider the kind of way in which such\nreasoning is attempted, with a view to discovering whether we can hope\nthat it may be valid.\nThe great representative, in modern times, of the kind of view which\nwe wish to examine, was Hegel (1770-1831). Hegel's philosophy is very\ndifficult, and commentators differ as to the true interpretation of it.\nAccording to the interpretation I shall adopt, which is that of many, if\nnot most, of the commentators and has the merit of giving an interesting\nand important type of philosophy, his main thesis is that everything\nshort of the Whole is obviously fragmentary, and obviously incapable of\nexisting without the complement supplied by the rest of the world. Just\nas a comparative anatomist, from a single bone, sees what kind of animal\nthe whole must have been, so the metaphysician, according to Hegel,\nsees, from any one piece of reality, what the whole of reality must\nbe--at least in its large outlines. Every apparently separate piece of\nreality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece;\nthe next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole\nuniverse is reconstructed. This essential incompleteness appears,\naccording to Hegel, equally in the world of thought and in the world of\nthings. In the world of thought, if we take any idea which is\nabstract or incomplete, we find, on examination, that if we forget\nits incompleteness, we become involved in contradictions; these\ncontradictions turn the idea in question into its opposite, or\nantithesis; and in order to escape, we have to find a new, less\nincomplete idea, which is the synthesis of our original idea and its\nantithesis. This new idea, though less incomplete than the idea we\nstarted with, will be found, nevertheless, to be still not wholly\ncomplete, but to pass into its antithesis, with which it must be\ncombined in a new synthesis. In this way Hegel advances until he reaches\nthe 'Absolute Idea', which, according to him, has no incompleteness,\nno opposite, and no need of further development. The Absolute Idea,\ntherefore, is adequate to describe Absolute Reality; but all lower ideas\nonly describe reality as it appears to a partial view, not as it is\nto one who simultaneously surveys the Whole. Thus Hegel reaches the\nconclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious system, not\nin space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and wholly\nspiritual. Any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can be\nproved logically--so he believes--to be entirely due to our fragmentary\npiecemeal view of the universe. If we saw the universe whole, as we may\nsuppose God sees it, space and time and matter and evil and all striving\nand struggling would disappear, and we should see instead an eternal\nperfect unchanging spiritual unity.\nIn this conception, there is undeniably something sublime, something to\nwhich we could wish to yield assent. Nevertheless, when the arguments\nin support of it are carefully examined, they appear to involve much\nconfusion and many unwarrantable assumptions. The fundamental tenet\nupon which the system is built up is that what is incomplete must be not\nself-subsistent, but must need the support of other things before it can\nexist. It is held that whatever has relations to things outside itself\nmust contain some reference to those outside things in its own nature,\nand could not, therefore, be what it is if those outside things did not\nexist. A man's nature, for example, is constituted by his memories and\nthe rest of his knowledge, by his loves and hatreds, and so on; thus,\nbut for the objects which he knows or loves or hates, he could not be\nwhat he is. He is essentially and obviously a fragment: taken as the\nsum-total of reality he would be self-contradictory.\nThis whole point of view, however, turns upon the notion of the 'nature'\nof a thing, which seems to mean 'all the truths about the thing'. It is\nof course the case that a truth which connects one thing with another\nthing could not subsist if the other thing did not subsist. But a\ntruth about a thing is not part of the thing itself, although it must,\naccording to the above usage, be part of the 'nature' of the thing.\nIf we mean by a thing's 'nature' all the truths about the thing, then\nplainly we cannot know a thing's 'nature' unless we know all the thing's\nrelations to all the other things in the universe. But if the word\n'nature' is used in this sense, we shall have to hold that the thing\nmay be known when its 'nature' is not known, or at any rate is not known\ncompletely. There is a confusion, when this use of the word 'nature' is\nemployed, between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths. We may\nhave knowledge of a thing by acquaintance even if we know very few\npropositions about it--theoretically we need not know any propositions\nabout it. Thus, acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of\nits 'nature' in the above sense. And although acquaintance with a thing\nis involved in our knowing any one proposition about a thing, knowledge\nof its 'nature', in the above sense, is not involved. Hence, (1)\nacquaintance with a thing does not logically involve a knowledge of its\nrelations, and (2) a knowledge of some of its relations does not involve\na knowledge of all of its relations nor a knowledge of its 'nature' in\nthe above sense. I may be acquainted, for example, with my toothache,\nand this knowledge may be as complete as knowledge by acquaintance ever\ncan be, without knowing all that the dentist (who is not acquainted\nwith it) can tell me about its cause, and without therefore knowing its\n'nature' in the above sense. Thus the fact that a thing has relations\ndoes not prove that its relations are logically necessary. That is to\nsay, from the mere fact that it is the thing it is we cannot deduce\nthat it must have the various relations which in fact it has. This only\n_seems_ to follow because we know it already.\nIt follows that we cannot prove that the universe as a whole forms a\nsingle harmonious system such as Hegel believes that it forms. And if we\ncannot prove this, we also cannot prove the unreality of space and time\nand matter and evil, for this is deduced by Hegel from the fragmentary\nand relational character of these things. Thus we are left to the\npiecemeal investigation of the world, and are unable to know the\ncharacters of those parts of the universe that are remote from our\nexperience. This result, disappointing as it is to those whose hopes\nhave been raised by the systems of philosophers, is in harmony with\nthe inductive and scientific temper of our age, and is borne out by the\nwhole examination of human knowledge which has occupied our previous\nchapters.\nMost of the great ambitious attempts of metaphysicians have proceeded by\nthe attempt to prove that such and such apparent features of the actual\nworld were self-contradictory, and therefore could not be real. The\nwhole tendency of modern thought, however, is more and more in the\ndirection of showing that the supposed contradictions were illusory, and\nthat very little can be proved _a priori_ from considerations of what\n_must_ be. A good illustration of this is afforded by space and\ntime. Space and time appear to be infinite in extent, and infinitely\ndivisible. If we travel along a straight line in either direction, it\nis difficult to believe that we shall finally reach a last point,\nbeyond which there is nothing, not even empty space. Similarly, if in\nimagination we travel backwards or forwards in time, it is difficult to\nbelieve that we shall reach a first or last time, with not even empty\ntime beyond it. Thus space and time appear to be infinite in extent.\nAgain, if we take any two points on a line, it seems evident that there\nmust be other points between them however small the distance between\nthem may be: every distance can be halved, and the halves can be halved\nagain, and so on _ad infinitum_. In time, similarly, however little\ntime may elapse between two moments, it seems evident that there will be\nother moments between them. Thus space and time appear to be infinitely\ndivisible. But as against these apparent facts--infinite extent and\ninfinite divisibility--philosophers have advanced arguments tending to\nshow that there could be no infinite collections of things, and that\ntherefore the number of points in space, or of instants in time, must\nbe finite. Thus a contradiction emerged between the apparent nature of\nspace and time and the supposed impossibility of infinite collections.\nKant, who first emphasized this contradiction, deduced the impossibility\nof space and time, which he declared to be merely subjective; and since\nhis time very many philosophers have believed that space and time are\nmere appearance, not characteristic of the world as it really is. Now,\nhowever, owing to the labours of the mathematicians, notably Georg\nCantor, it has appeared that the impossibility of infinite collections\nwas a mistake. They are not in fact self-contradictory, but only\ncontradictory of certain rather obstinate mental prejudices. Hence the\nreasons for regarding space and time as unreal have become inoperative,\nand one of the great sources of metaphysical constructions is dried up.\nThe mathematicians, however, have not been content with showing that\nspace as it is commonly supposed to be is possible; they have shown also\nthat many other forms of space are equally possible, so far as logic\ncan show. Some of Euclid's axioms, which appear to common sense to be\nnecessary, and were formerly supposed to be necessary by philosophers,\nare now known to derive their appearance of necessity from our mere\nfamiliarity with actual space, and not from any _a priori_ logical\nfoundation. By imagining worlds in which these axioms are false, the\nmathematicians have used logic to loosen the prejudices of common\nsense, and to show the possibility of spaces differing--some more, some\nless--from that in which we live. And some of these spaces differ so\nlittle from Euclidean space, where distances such as we can measure are\nconcerned, that it is impossible to discover by observation whether our\nactual space is strictly Euclidean or of one of these other kinds.\nThus the position is completely reversed. Formerly it appeared that\nexperience left only one kind of space to logic, and logic showed this\none kind to be impossible. Now, logic presents many kinds of space as\npossible apart from experience, and experience only partially decides\nbetween them. Thus, while our knowledge of what is has become less\nthan it was formerly supposed to be, our knowledge of what may be is\nenormously increased. Instead of being shut in within narrow walls, of\nwhich every nook and cranny could be explored, we find ourselves in an\nopen world of free possibilities, where much remains unknown because\nthere is so much to know.\nWhat has happened in the case of space and time has happened, to some\nextent, in other directions as well. The attempt to prescribe to the\nuniverse by means of _a priori_ principles has broken down; logic,\ninstead of being, as formerly, the bar to possibilities, has become the\ngreat liberator of the imagination, presenting innumerable alternatives\nwhich are closed to unreflective common sense, and leaving to experience\nthe task of deciding, where decision is possible, between the many\nworlds which logic offers for our choice. Thus knowledge as to what\nexists becomes limited to what we can learn from experience--not to\nwhat we can actually experience, for, as we have seen, there is much\nknowledge by description concerning things of which we have no direct\nexperience. But in all cases of knowledge by description, we need some\nconnexion of universals, enabling us, from such and such a datum, to\ninfer an object of a certain sort as implied by our datum. Thus in\nregard to physical objects, for example, the principle that sense-data\nare signs of physical objects is itself a connexion of universals; and\nit is only in virtue of this principle that experience enables us to\nacquire knowledge concerning physical objects. The same applies to\nthe law of causality, or, to descend to what is less general, to such\nprinciples as the law of gravitation.\nPrinciples such as the law of gravitation are proved, or rather are\nrendered highly probable, by a combination of experience with some\nwholly _a priori_ principle, such as the principle of induction. Thus\nour intuitive knowledge, which is the source of all our other knowledge\nof truths, is of two sorts: pure empirical knowledge, which tells us of\nthe existence and some of the properties of particular things with\nwhich we are acquainted, and pure _a priori_ knowledge, which gives us\nconnexions between universals, and enables us to draw inferences from\nthe particular facts given in empirical knowledge. Our derivative\nknowledge always depends upon some pure _a priori_ knowledge and usually\nalso depends upon some pure empirical knowledge.\nPhilosophical knowledge, if what has been said above is true, does not\ndiffer essentially from scientific knowledge; there is no special\nsource of wisdom which is open to philosophy but not to science, and the\nresults obtained by philosophy are not radically different from those\nobtained from science. The essential characteristic of philosophy,\nwhich makes it a study distinct from science, is criticism. It examines\ncritically the principles employed in science and in daily life; it\nsearches out any inconsistencies there may be in these principles,\nand it only accepts them when, as the result of a critical inquiry, no\nreason for rejecting them has appeared. If, as many philosophers have\nbelieved, the principles underlying the sciences were capable, when\ndisengaged from irrelevant detail, of giving us knowledge concerning\nthe universe as a whole, such knowledge would have the same claim on our\nbelief as scientific knowledge has; but our inquiry has not revealed any\nsuch knowledge, and therefore, as regards the special doctrines of the\nbolder metaphysicians, has had a mainly negative result. But as regards\nwhat would be commonly accepted as knowledge, our result is in the main\npositive: we have seldom found reason to reject such knowledge as the\nresult of our criticism, and we have seen no reason to suppose man\nincapable of the kind of knowledge which he is generally believed to\npossess.\nWhen, however, we speak of philosophy as a _criticism_ of knowledge, it\nis necessary to impose a certain limitation. If we adopt the attitude\nof the complete sceptic, placing ourselves wholly outside all knowledge,\nand asking, from this outside position, to be compelled to return within\nthe circle of knowledge, we are demanding what is impossible, and our\nscepticism can never be refuted. For all refutation must begin with\nsome piece of knowledge which the disputants share; from blank doubt,\nno argument can begin. Hence the criticism of knowledge which philosophy\nemploys must not be of this destructive kind, if any result is to be\nachieved. Against this absolute scepticism, no _logical_ argument can be\nadvanced. But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind\nis unreasonable. Descartes' 'methodical doubt', with which modern\nphilosophy began, is not of this kind, but is rather the kind of\ncriticism which we are asserting to be the essence of philosophy. His\n'methodical doubt' consisted in doubting whatever seemed doubtful; in\npausing, with each apparent piece of knowledge, to ask himself whether,\non reflection, he could feel certain that he really knew it. This is the\nkind of criticism which constitutes philosophy. Some knowledge, such as\nknowledge of the existence of our sense-data, appears quite indubitable,\nhowever calmly and thoroughly we reflect upon it. In regard to such\nknowledge, philosophical criticism does not require that we should\nabstain from belief. But there are beliefs--such, for example, as the\nbelief that physical objects exactly resemble our sense-data--which are\nentertained until we begin to reflect, but are found to melt away\nwhen subjected to a close inquiry. Such beliefs philosophy will bid us\nreject, unless some new line of argument is found to support them.\nBut to reject the beliefs which do not appear open to any objections,\nhowever closely we examine them, is not reasonable, and is not what\nphilosophy advocates.\nThe criticism aimed at, in a word, is not that which, without reason,\ndetermines to reject, but that which considers each piece of apparent\nknowledge on its merits, and retains whatever still appears to be\nknowledge when this consideration is completed. That some risk of error\nremains must be admitted, since human beings are fallible. Philosophy\nmay claim justly that it diminishes the risk of error, and that in some\ncases it renders the risk so small as to be practically negligible. To\ndo more than this is not possible in a world where mistakes must occur;\nand more than this no prudent advocate of philosophy would claim to have\nperformed.\nCHAPTER XV. THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY\nHaving now come to the end of our brief and very incomplete review of\nthe problems of philosophy, it will be well to consider, in conclusion,\nwhat is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is\nthe more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that\nmany men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are\ninclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent\nbut useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on\nmatters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThis view of philosophy appears to result, partly from a wrong\nconception of the ends of life, partly from a wrong conception of the\nkind of goods which philosophy strives to achieve. Physical science,\nthrough the medium of inventions, is useful to innumerable people who\nare wholly ignorant of it; thus the study of physical science is to\nbe recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the\nstudent, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. Thus\nutility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has\nany value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only\nindirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it.\nIt is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of\nphilosophy must be primarily sought.\nBut further, if we are not to fail in our endeavour to determine the\nvalue of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices\nof what are wrongly called 'practical' men. The 'practical' man, as\nthis word is often used, is one who recognizes only material needs, who\nrealizes that men must have food for the body, but is oblivious of the\nnecessity of providing food for the mind. If all men were well off, if\npoverty and disease had been reduced to their lowest possible point,\nthere would still remain much to be done to produce a valuable society;\nand even in the existing world the goods of the mind are at least as\nimportant as the goods of the body. It is exclusively among the goods of\nthe mind that the value of philosophy is to be found; and only those who\nare not indifferent to these goods can be persuaded that the study of\nphilosophy is not a waste of time.\nPhilosophy, like all other studies, aims primarily at knowledge. The\nknowledge it aims at is the kind of knowledge which gives unity and\nsystem to the body of the sciences, and the kind which results from a\ncritical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and\nbeliefs. But it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very\ngreat measure of success in its attempts to provide definite answers to\nits questions. If you ask a mathematician, a mineralogist, a historian,\nor any other man of learning, what definite body of truths has been\nascertained by his science, his answer will last as long as you are\nwilling to listen. But if you put the same question to a philosopher, he\nwill, if he is candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved\npositive results such as have been achieved by other sciences. It is\ntrue that this is partly accounted for by the fact that, as soon as\ndefinite knowledge concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject\nceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science. The\nwhole study of the heavens, which now belongs to astronomy, was once\nincluded in philosophy; Newton's great work was called 'the mathematical\nprinciples of natural philosophy'. Similarly, the study of the human\nmind, which was a part of philosophy, has now been separated from\nphilosophy and has become the science of psychology. Thus, to a great\nextent, the uncertainty of philosophy is more apparent than real: those\nquestions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in\nthe sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer\ncan be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.\nThis is, however, only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of\nphilosophy. There are many questions--and among them those that are of\nthe profoundest interest to our spiritual life--which, so far as we\ncan see, must remain insoluble to the human intellect unless its powers\nbecome of quite a different order from what they are now. Has the\nuniverse any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse\nof atoms? Is consciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving\nhope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on\na small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible? Are good\nand evil of importance to the universe or only to man? Such questions\nare asked by philosophy, and variously answered by various philosophers.\nBut it would seem that, whether answers be otherwise discoverable or\nnot, the answers suggested by philosophy are none of them demonstrably\ntrue. Yet, however slight may be the hope of discovering an answer, it\nis part of the business of philosophy to continue the consideration of\nsuch questions, to make us aware of their importance, to examine all the\napproaches to them, and to keep alive that speculative interest in the\nuniverse which is apt to be killed by confining ourselves to definitely\nascertainable knowledge.\nMany philosophers, it is true, have held that philosophy could establish\nthe truth of certain answers to such fundamental questions. They have\nsupposed that what is of most importance in religious beliefs could be\nproved by strict demonstration to be true. In order to judge of such\nattempts, it is necessary to take a survey of human knowledge, and to\nform an opinion as to its methods and its limitations. On such a subject\nit would be unwise to pronounce dogmatically; but if the investigations\nof our previous chapters have not led us astray, we shall be compelled\nto renounce the hope of finding philosophical proofs of religious\nbeliefs. We cannot, therefore, include as part of the value of\nphilosophy any definite set of answers to such questions. Hence, once\nmore, the value of philosophy must not depend upon any supposed body of\ndefinitely ascertainable knowledge to be acquired by those who study it.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very\nuncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through\nlife imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the\nhabitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which\nhave grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his\ndeliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite,\nfinite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar\npossibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to\nphilosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening\nchapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which\nonly very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to\ntell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it\nraises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts\nand free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our\nfeeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our\nknowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant\ndogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of\nliberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing\nfamiliar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\nApart from its utility in showing unsuspected possibilities, philosophy\nhas a value--perhaps its chief value--through the greatness of the\nobjects which it contemplates, and the freedom from narrow and personal\naims resulting from this contemplation. The life of the instinctive\nman is shut up within the circle of his private interests: family and\nfriends may be included, but the outer world is not regarded except\nas it may help or hinder what comes within the circle of instinctive\nwishes. In such a life there is something feverish and confined, in\ncomparison with which the philosophic life is calm and free. The private\nworld of instinctive interests is a small one, set in the midst of a\ngreat and powerful world which must, sooner or later, lay our private\nworld in ruins. Unless we can so enlarge our interests as to include the\nwhole outer world, we remain like a garrison in a beleagured fortress,\nknowing that the enemy prevents escape and that ultimate surrender is\ninevitable. In such a life there is no peace, but a constant strife\nbetween the insistence of desire and the powerlessness of will. In one\nway or another, if our life is to be great and free, we must escape this\nprison and this strife.\nOne way of escape is by philosophic contemplation. Philosophic\ncontemplation does not, in its widest survey, divide the universe into\ntwo hostile camps--friends and foes, helpful and hostile, good and\nbad--it views the whole impartially. Philosophic contemplation, when it\nis unalloyed, does not aim at proving that the rest of the universe is\nakin to man. All acquisition of knowledge is an enlargement of the Self,\nbut this enlargement is best attained when it is not directly sought. It\nis obtained when the desire for knowledge is alone operative, by a study\nwhich does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that\ncharacter, but adapts the Self to the characters which it finds in its\nobjects. This enlargement of Self is not obtained when, taking the Self\nas it is, we try to show that the world is so similar to this Self that\nknowledge of it is possible without any admission of what seems alien.\nThe desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion and, like all\nself-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of Self which it\ndesires, and of which the Self knows that it is capable. Self-assertion,\nin philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to\nits own ends; thus it makes the world of less account than Self, and the\nSelf sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. In contemplation, on\nthe contrary, we start from the not-Self, and through its greatness the\nboundaries of Self are enlarged; through the infinity of the universe\nthe mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.\nFor this reason greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies\nwhich assimilate the universe to Man. Knowledge is a form of union\nof Self and not-Self; like all union, it is impaired by dominion, and\ntherefore by any attempt to force the universe into conformity with\nwhat we find in ourselves. There is a widespread philosophical tendency\ntowards the view which tells us that Man is the measure of all things,\nthat truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals\nare properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created\nby the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us. This view, if\nour previous discussions were correct, is untrue; but in addition to\nbeing untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of\nall that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to Self. What\nit calls knowledge is not a union with the not-Self, but a set of\nprejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between\nus and the world beyond. The man who finds pleasure in such a theory of\nknowledge is like the man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear\nhis word might not be law.\nThe true philosophic contemplation, on the contrary, finds its\nsatisfaction in every enlargement of the not-Self, in everything\nthat magnifies the objects contemplated, and thereby the subject\ncontemplating. Everything, in contemplation, that is personal or\nprivate, everything that depends upon habit, self-interest, or desire,\ndistorts the object, and hence impairs the union which the intellect\nseeks. By thus making a barrier between subject and object, such\npersonal and private things become a prison to the intellect. The free\nintellect will see as God might see, without a _here_ and _now_,\nwithout hopes and fears, without the trammels of customary beliefs\nand traditional prejudices, calmly, dispassionately, in the sole and\nexclusive desire of knowledge--knowledge as impersonal, as purely\ncontemplative, as it is possible for man to attain. Hence also the free\nintellect will value more the abstract and universal knowledge into\nwhich the accidents of private history do not enter, than the knowledge\nbrought by the senses, and dependent, as such knowledge must be, upon\nan exclusive and personal point of view and a body whose sense-organs\ndistort as much as they reveal.\nThe mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of\nphilosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom\nand impartiality in the world of action and emotion. It will view\nits purposes and desires as parts of the whole, with the absence of\ninsistence that results from seeing them as infinitesimal fragments in\na world of which all the rest is unaffected by any one man's deeds. The\nimpartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth,\nis the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in\nemotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only\nto those who are judged useful or admirable. Thus contemplation enlarges\nnot only the objects of our thoughts, but also the objects of our\nactions and our affections: it makes us citizens of the universe, not\nonly of one walled city at war with all the rest. In this citizenship\nof the universe consists man's true freedom, and his liberation from the\nthraldom of narrow hopes and fears.\nThus, to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy; Philosophy\nis to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its\nquestions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be\ntrue, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because\nthese questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich\nour intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which\ncloses the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the\ngreatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also\nis rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe\nwhich constitutes its highest good.\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\nThe student who wishes to acquire an elementary knowledge of philosophy\nwill find it both easier and more profitable to read some of the works\nof the great philosophers than to attempt to derive an all-round view\nfrom handbooks.

Ltd.,\nWatford, Herts._\nPREFACE\nThe following essays have been written and published at various times,\nand my thanks are due to the previous publishers for the permission to\nreprint them.\nThe essay on \"Mysticism and Logic\" appeared in the _Hibbert Journal_\nfor July, 1914. \"The Place of Science in a Liberal Education\" appeared\nin two numbers of _The New Statesman_, May 24 and 31, 1913. \"The Free\nMan's Worship\" and \"The Study of Mathematics\" were included in a\nformer collection (now out of print), _Philosophical Essays_, also\npublished by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. Both were written in 1902;\nthe first appeared originally in the _Independent Review_ for 1903,\nthe second in the _New Quarterly_, November, 1907. In theoretical\nEthics, the position advocated in \"The Free Man's Worship\" is not\nquite identical with that which I hold now: I feel less convinced than\nI did then of the objectivity of good and evil. But the general\nattitude towards life which is suggested in that essay still seems to\nme, in the main, the one which must be adopted in times of stress and\ndifficulty by those who have no dogmatic religious beliefs, if inward\ndefeat is to be avoided.\nThe essay on \"Mathematics and the Metaphysicians\" was written in 1901,\nand appeared in an American magazine, _The International Monthly_,\nunder the title \"Recent Work in the Philosophy of Mathematics.\" Some\npoints in this essay require modification in view of later work.\nThese are indicated in footnotes. Its tone is partly explained by the\nfact that the editor begged me to make the article \"as romantic as\npossible.\"\nAll the above essays are entirely popular, but those that follow are\nsomewhat more technical. \"On Scientific Method in Philosophy\" was the\nHerbert Spencer lecture at Oxford in 1914, and was published by the\nClarendon Press, which has kindly allowed me to include it in this\ncollection. \"The Ultimate Constituents of Matter\" was an address to\nthe Manchester Philosophical Society, early in 1915, and was published\nin the _Monist_ in July of that year. The essay on \"The Relation of\nSense-data to Physics\" was written in January, 1914, and first\nappeared in No. 4 of that year's volume of _Scientia_, an\nInternational Review of Scientific Synthesis, edited by M. Eugenio\nRignano, published monthly by Messrs. Williams and Norgate, London,\nNicola Zanichelli, Bologna, and F\u00e9lix Alcan, Paris. The essay \"On the\nNotion of Cause\" was the presidential address to the Aristotelian\nSociety in November, 1912, and was published in their _Proceedings_\nfor 1912-13. \"Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description\"\nwas also a paper read before the Aristotelian Society, and published\nin their _Proceedings_ for 1910-11.\nLONDON,\n_September, 1917_\nCONTENTS\n_Chapter_                                                  _Page_\nI. _Mysticism and Logic_                                     1\nII. _The Place of Science in a Liberal Education_            33\nIII. _A Free Man's Worship_                                   46\nIV. _The Study of Mathematics_                               58\nV. _Mathematics and the Metaphysicians_                     74\nVI. _On Scientific Method in Philosophy_                     97\nVII. _The Ultimate Constituents of Matter_                   125\nVIII. _The Relation of Sense-data to Physics_                 145\nIX. _On the Notion of Cause_                                180\nX. _Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription_                                           209\nMYSTICISM AND LOGIC AND OTHER ESSAYS\nI\nMYSTICISM AND LOGIC\nMetaphysics, or the attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means\nof thought, has been developed, from the first, by the union and\nconflict of two very different human impulses, the one urging men\ntowards mysticism, the other urging them towards science. Some men\nhave achieved greatness through one of these impulses alone, others\nthrough the other alone: in Hume, for example, the scientific impulse\nreigns quite unchecked, while in Blake a strong hostility to science\nco-exists with profound mystic insight. But the greatest men who have\nbeen philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism:\nthe attempt to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what\nalways must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make philosophy, to some\nminds, a greater thing than either science or religion.\nBefore attempting an explicit characterisation of the scientific and\nthe mystical impulses, I will illustrate them by examples from two\nphilosophers whose greatness lies in the very intimate blending which\nthey achieved. The two philosophers I mean are Heraclitus and Plato.\nHeraclitus, as every one knows, was a believer in universal flux: time\nbuilds and destroys all things. From the few fragments that remain, it\nis not easy to discover how he arrived at his opinions, but there are\nsome sayings that strongly suggest scientific observation as the\nsource.\n\"The things that can be seen, heard, and learned,\" he says, \"are what\nI prize the most.\" This is the language of the empiricist, to whom\nobservation is the sole guarantee of truth. \"The sun is new every\nday,\" is another fragment; and this opinion, in spite of its\nparadoxical character, is obviously inspired by scientific reflection,\nand no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding\nhow the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the\nnight. Actual observation must also have suggested to him his central\ndoctrine, that Fire is the one permanent substance, of which all\nvisible things are passing phases. In combustion we see things change\nutterly, while their flame and heat rise up into the air and vanish.\n\"This world, which is the same for all,\" he says, \"no one of gods or\nmen has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be, an\never-living Fire, with measures kindling, and measures going out.\"\n\"The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the\nsea is earth, half whirlwind.\"\nThis theory, though no longer one which science can accept, is\nnevertheless scientific in spirit. Science, too, might have inspired\nthe famous saying to which Plato alludes: \"You cannot step twice into\nthe same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\" But\nwe find also another statement among the extant fragments: \"We step\nand do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\"\nThe comparison of this statement, which is mystical, with the one\nquoted by Plato, which is scientific, shows how intimately the two\ntendencies are blended in the system of Heraclitus. Mysticism is, in\nessence, little more than a certain intensity and depth of feeling in\nregard to what is believed about the universe; and this kind of\nfeeling leads Heraclitus, on the basis of his science, to strangely\npoignant sayings concerning life and the world, such as:\n\"Time is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child's.\"\nIt is poetic imagination, not science, which presents Time as despotic\nlord of the world, with all the irresponsible frivolity of a child. It\nis mysticism, too, which leads Heraclitus to assert the identity of\nopposites: \"Good and ill are one,\" he says; and again: \"To God all\nthings are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and\nsome right.\"\nMuch of mysticism underlies the ethics of Heraclitus. It is true that\na scientific determinism alone might have inspired the statement:\n\"Man's character is his fate\"; but only a mystic would have said:\n\"Every beast is driven to the pasture with blows\"; and again:\n\"It is hard to fight with one's heart's desire. Whatever it wishes to\nget, it purchases at the cost of soul\"; and again:\n\"Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things\nare steered through all things.\"[1]\nExamples might be multiplied, but those that have been given are\nenough to show the character of the man: the facts of science, as they\nappeared to him, fed the flame in his soul, and in its light he saw\ninto the depths of the world by the reflection of his own dancing\nswiftly penetrating fire. In such a nature we see the true union of\nthe mystic and the man of science--the highest eminence, as I think,\nthat it is possible to achieve in the world of thought.\nIn Plato, the same twofold impulse exists, though the mystic impulse\nis distinctly the stronger of the two, and secures ultimate victory\nwhenever the conflict is sharp. His description of the cave is the\nclassical statement of belief in a knowledge and reality truer and\nmore real than that of the senses:\n\"Imagine[2] a number of men living in an underground cavernous\nchamber, with an entrance open to the light, extending along the\nentire length of the cavern, in which they have been confined, from\ntheir childhood, with their legs and necks so shackled that they\nare obliged to sit still and look straight forwards, because their\nchains render it impossible for them to turn their heads round: and\nimagine a bright fire burning some way off, above and behind them,\nand an elevated roadway passing between the fire and the prisoners,\nwith a low wall built along it, like the screens which conjurors\nput up in front of their audience, and above which they exhibit\ntheir wonders.\nI have it, he replied.\nAlso figure to yourself a number of persons walking behind this\nwall, and carrying with them statues of men, and images of other\nanimals, wrought in wood and stone and all kinds of materials,\ntogether with various other articles, which overtop the wall; and,\nas you might expect, let some of the passers-by be talking, and\nothers silent.\nYou are describing a strange scene, and strange prisoners.\nThey resemble us, I replied.\nNow consider what would happen if the course of nature brought them\na release from their fetters, and a remedy for their foolishness,\nin the following manner. Let us suppose that one of them has been\nreleased, and compelled suddenly to stand up, and turn his neck\nround and walk with open eyes towards the light; and let us suppose\nthat he goes through all these actions with pain, and that the\ndazzling splendour renders him incapable of discerning those\nobjects of which he used formerly to see the shadows. What answer\nshould you expect him to make, if some one were to tell him that in\nthose days he was watching foolish phantoms, but that now he is\nsomewhat nearer to reality, and is turned towards things more real,\nand sees more correctly; above all, if he were to point out to him\nthe several objects that are passing by, and question him, and\ncompel him to answer what they are? Should you not expect him to be\npuzzled, and to regard his old visions as truer than the objects\nnow forced upon his notice?\nYes, much truer....\nHence, I suppose, habit will be necessary to enable him to perceive\nobjects in that upper world. At first he will be most successful in\ndistinguishing shadows; then he will discern the reflections of men\nand other things in water, and afterwards the realities; and after\nthis he will raise his eyes to encounter the light of the moon and\nstars, finding it less difficult to study the heavenly bodies and\nthe heaven itself by night, than the sun and the sun's light by\nday.\nDoubtless.\nLast of all, I imagine, he will be able to observe and contemplate\nthe nature of the sun, not as it _appears_ in water or on alien\nground, but as it is in itself in its own territory.\nOf course.\nHis next step will be to draw the conclusion, that the sun is the\nauthor of the seasons and the years, and the guardian of all things\nin the visible world, and in a manner the cause of all those things\nwhich he and his companions used to see.\nObviously, this will be his next step....\nNow this imaginary case, my dear Glancon, you must apply in all its\nparts to our former statements, by comparing the region which the\neye reveals to the prison house, and the light of the fire therein\nto the power of the sun: and if, by the upward ascent and the\ncontemplation of the upper world, you understand the mounting of\nthe soul into the intellectual region, you will hit the tendency of\nmy own surmises, since you desire to be told what they are; though,\nindeed, God only knows whether they are correct. But, be that as it\nmay, the view which I take of the subject is to the following\neffect. In the world of knowledge, the essential Form of Good is\nthe limit of our enquiries, and can barely be perceived; but, when\nperceived, we cannot help concluding that it is in every case the\nsource of all that is bright and beautiful,--in the visible world\ngiving birth to light and its master, and in the intellectual world\ndispensing, immediately and with full authority, truth and\nreason;--and that whosoever would act wisely, either in private or\nin public, must set this Form of Good before his eyes.\"\nBut in this passage, as throughout most of Plato's teaching, there is\nan identification of the good with the truly real, which became\nembodied in the philosophical tradition, and is still largely\noperative in our own day. In thus allowing a legislative function to\nthe good, Plato produced a divorce between philosophy and science,\nfrom which, in my opinion, both have suffered ever since and are still\nsuffering. The man of science, whatever his hopes may be, must lay\nthem aside while he studies nature; and the philosopher, if he is to\nachieve truth, must do the same. Ethical considerations can only\nlegitimately appear when the truth has been ascertained: they can and\nshould appear as determining our feeling towards the truth, and our\nmanner of ordering our lives in view of the truth, but not as\nthemselves dictating what the truth is to be.\nThere are passages in Plato--among those which illustrate the\nscientific side of his mind--where he seems clearly aware of this. The\nmost noteworthy is the one in which Socrates, as a young man, is\nexplaining the theory of ideas to Parmenides.\nAfter Socrates has explained that there is an idea of the good, but\nnot of such things as hair and mud and dirt, Parmenides advises him\n\"not to despise even the meanest things,\" and this advice shows the\ngenuine scientific temper. It is with this impartial temper that the\nmystic's apparent insight into a higher reality and a hidden good has\nto be combined if philosophy is to realise its greatest possibilities.\nAnd it is failure in this respect that has made so much of idealistic\nphilosophy thin, lifeless, and insubstantial. It is only in marriage\nwith the world that our ideals can bear fruit: divorced from it, they\nremain barren. But marriage with the world is not to be achieved by an\nideal which shrinks from fact, or demands in advance that the world\nshall conform to its desires.\nParmenides himself is the source of a peculiarly interesting strain\nof mysticism which pervades Plato's thought--the mysticism which may\nbe called \"logical\" because it is embodied in theories on logic. This\nform of mysticism, which appears, so far as the West is concerned, to\nhave originated with Parmenides, dominates the reasonings of all the\ngreat mystical metaphysicians from his day to that of Hegel and his\nmodern disciples. Reality, he says, is uncreated, indestructible,\nunchanging, indivisible; it is \"immovable in the bonds of mighty\nchains, without beginning and without end; since coming into being and\npassing away have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them\naway.\" The fundamental principle of his inquiry is stated in a\nsentence which would not be out of place in Hegel: \"Thou canst not\nknow what is not--that is impossible--nor utter it; for it is the same\nthing that can be thought and that can be.\" And again: \"It needs must\nbe that what can be thought and spoken of is; for it is possible for\nit to be, and it is not possible for what is nothing to be.\" The\nimpossibility of change follows from this principle; for what is past\ncan be spoken of, and therefore, by the principle, still is.\nMystical philosophy, in all ages and in all parts of the world, is\ncharacterised by certain beliefs which are illustrated by the\ndoctrines we have been considering.\nThere is, first, the belief in insight as against discursive analytic\nknowledge: the belief in a way of wisdom, sudden, penetrating,\ncoercive, which is contrasted with the slow and fallible study of\noutward appearance by a science relying wholly upon the senses. All\nwho are capable of absorption in an inward passion must have\nexperienced at times the strange feeling of unreality in common\nobjects, the loss of contact with daily things, in which the solidity\nof the outer world is lost, and the soul seems, in utter loneliness,\nto bring forth, out of its own depths, the mad dance of fantastic\nphantoms which have hitherto appeared as independently real and\nliving. This is the negative side of the mystic's initiation: the\ndoubt concerning common knowledge, preparing the way for the reception\nof what seems a higher wisdom. Many men to whom this negative\nexperience is familiar do not pass beyond it, but for the mystic it is\nmerely the gateway to an ampler world.\nThe mystic insight begins with the sense of a mystery unveiled, of a\nhidden wisdom now suddenly become certain beyond the possibility of a\ndoubt. The sense of certainty and revelation comes earlier than any\ndefinite belief. The definite beliefs at which mystics arrive are the\nresult of reflection upon the inarticulate experience gained in the\nmoment of insight. Often, beliefs which have no real connection with\nthis moment become subsequently attracted into the central nucleus;\nthus in addition to the convictions which all mystics share, we find,\nin many of them, other convictions of a more local and temporary\ncharacter, which no doubt become amalgamated with what was essentially\nmystical in virtue of their subjective certainty. We may ignore such\ninessential accretions, and confine ourselves to the beliefs which all\nmystics share.\nThe first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination is\nbelief in the possibility of a way of knowledge which may be called\nrevelation or insight or intuition, as contrasted with sense, reason,\nand analysis, which are regarded as blind guides leading to the morass\nof illusion. Closely connected with this belief is the conception of a\nReality behind the world of appearance and utterly different from it.\nThis Reality is regarded with an admiration often amounting to\nworship; it is felt to be always and everywhere close at hand, thinly\nveiled by the shows of sense, ready, for the receptive mind, to shine\nin its glory even through the apparent folly and wickedness of Man.\nThe poet, the artist, and the lover are seekers after that glory: the\nhaunting beauty that they pursue is the faint reflection of its sun.\nBut the mystic lives in the full light of the vision: what others\ndimly seek he knows, with a knowledge beside which all other knowledge\nis ignorance.\nThe second characteristic of mysticism is its belief in unity, and its\nrefusal to admit opposition or division anywhere. We found Heraclitus\nsaying \"good and ill are one\"; and again he says, \"the way up and the\nway down is one and the same.\" The same attitude appears in the\nsimultaneous assertion of contradictory propositions, such as: \"We\nstep and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\" The\nassertion of Parmenides, that reality is one and indivisible, comes\nfrom the same impulse towards unity. In Plato, this impulse is less\nprominent, being held in check by his theory of ideas; but it\nreappears, so far as his logic permits, in the doctrine of the primacy\nof the Good.\nA third mark of almost all mystical metaphysics is the denial of the\nreality of Time. This is an outcome of the denial of division; if all\nis one, the distinction of past and future must be illusory. We have\nseen this doctrine prominent in Parmenides; and among moderns it is\nfundamental in the systems of Spinoza and Hegel.\nThe last of the doctrines of mysticism which we have to consider is\nits belief that all evil is mere appearance, an illusion produced by\nthe divisions and oppositions of the analytic intellect. Mysticism\ndoes not maintain that such things as cruelty, for example, are good,\nbut it denies that they are real: they belong to that lower world of\nphantoms from which we are to be liberated by the insight of the\nvision. Sometimes--for example in Hegel, and at least verbally in\nSpinoza--not only evil, but good also, is regarded as illusory, though\nnevertheless the emotional attitude towards what is held to be Reality\nis such as would naturally be associated with the belief that Reality\nis good. What is, in all cases, ethically characteristic of mysticism\nis absence of indignation or protest, acceptance with joy, disbelief\nin the ultimate truth of the division into two hostile camps, the good\nand the bad. This attitude is a direct outcome of the nature of the\nmystical experience: with its sense of unity is associated a feeling\nof infinite peace. Indeed it may be suspected that the feeling of\npeace produces, as feelings do in dreams, the whole system of\nassociated beliefs which make up the body of mystic doctrine. But this\nis a difficult question, and one on which it cannot be hoped that\nmankind will reach agreement.\nFour questions thus arise in considering the truth or falsehood of\nmysticism, namely:\nI. Are there two ways of knowing, which may be called respectively\nreason and intuition? And if so, is either to be preferred to the\nother?\nII. Is all plurality and division illusory?\nIII. Is time unreal?\nIV. What kind of reality belongs to good and evil?\nOn all four of these questions, while fully developed mysticism seems\nto me mistaken, I yet believe that, by sufficient restraint, there is\nan element of wisdom to be learned from the mystical way of feeling,\nwhich does not seem to be attainable in any other manner. If this is\nthe truth, mysticism is to be commended as an attitude towards life,\nnot as a creed about the world. The meta-physical creed, I shall\nmaintain, is a mistaken outcome of the emotion, although this emotion,\nas colouring and informing all other thoughts and feelings, is the\ninspirer of whatever is best in Man. Even the cautious and patient\ninvestigation of truth by science, which seems the very antithesis of\nthe mystic's swift certainty, may be fostered and nourished by that\nvery spirit of reverence in which mysticism lives and moves.\nI. REASON AND INTUITION[3]\nOf the reality or unreality of the mystic's world I know nothing. I\nhave no wish to deny it, nor even to declare that the insight which\nreveals it is not a genuine insight. What I do wish to maintain--and\nit is here that the scientific attitude becomes imperative--is that\ninsight, untested and unsupported, is an insufficient guarantee of\ntruth, in spite of the fact that much of the most important truth is\nfirst suggested by its means. It is common to speak of an opposition\nbetween instinct and reason; in the eighteenth century, the opposition\nwas drawn in favour of reason, but under the influence of Rousseau and\nthe romantic movement instinct was given the preference, first by\nthose who rebelled against artificial forms of government and thought,\nand then, as the purely rationalistic defence of traditional theology\nbecame increasingly difficult, by all who felt in science a menace to\ncreeds which they associated with a spiritual outlook on life and the\nworld. Bergson, under the name of \"intuition,\" has raised instinct to\nthe position of sole arbiter of metaphysical truth. But in fact the\nopposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct,\nintuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which\nsubsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it\nis possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other\nbeliefs no less instinctive. Reason is a harmonising, controlling\nforce rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical\nrealm, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.\nWhere instinct and reason do sometimes conflict is in regard to single\nbeliefs, held instinctively, and held with such determination that no\ndegree of inconsistency with other beliefs leads to their abandonment.\nInstinct, like all human faculties, is liable to error. Those in whom\nreason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards\nthemselves, though all admit it in regard to others. Where instinct is\nleast liable to error is in practical matters as to which right\njudgment is a help to survival: friendship and hostility in others,\nfor instance, are often felt with extraordinary discrimination through\nvery careful disguises. But even in such matters a wrong impression\nmay be given by reserve or flattery; and in matters less directly\npractical, such as philosophy deals with, very strong instinctive\nbeliefs are sometimes wholly mistaken, as we may come to know through\ntheir perceived inconsistency with other equally strong beliefs. It is\nsuch considerations that necessitate the harmonising mediation of\nreason, which tests our beliefs by their mutual compatibility, and\nexamines, in doubtful cases, the possible sources of error on the one\nside and on the other. In this there is no opposition to instinct as a\nwhole, but only to blind reliance upon some one interesting aspect of\ninstinct to the exclusion of other more commonplace but not less\ntrustworthy aspects. It is such one-sidedness, not instinct itself,\nthat reason aims at correcting.\nThese more or less trite maxims may be illustrated by application to\nBergson's advocacy of \"intuition\" as against \"intellect.\" There are,\nhe says, \"two profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. The first\nimplies that we move round the object: the second that we enter into\nit. The first depends on the point of view at which we are placed and\non the symbols by which we express ourselves. The second neither\ndepends on a point of view nor relies on any symbol. The first kind of\nknowledge may be said to stop at the _relative_; the second, in those\ncases where it is possible, to attain the _absolute_.\"[4] The second\nof these, which is intuition, is, he says, \"the kind of _intellectual\nsympathy_ by which one places oneself within an object in order to\ncoincide with what is unique in it and therefore inexpressible\" (p.\n6). In illustration, he mentions self-knowledge: \"there is one\nreality, at least, which we all seize from within, by intuition and\nnot by simple analysis. It is our own personality in its flowing\nthrough time--our self which endures\" (p. 8). The rest of Bergson's\nphilosophy consists in reporting, through the imperfect medium of\nwords, the knowledge gained by intuition, and the consequent complete\ncondemnation of all the pretended knowledge derived from science and\ncommon sense.\nThis procedure, since it takes sides in a conflict of instinctive\nbeliefs, stands in need of justification by proving the greater\ntrustworthiness of the beliefs on one side than of those on the other.\nBergson attempts this justification in two ways, first by explaining\nthat intellect is a purely practical faculty to secure biological\nsuccess, secondly by mentioning remarkable feats of instinct in\nanimals and by pointing out characteristics of the world which, though\nintuition can apprehend them, are baffling to intellect as he\ninterprets it.\nOf Bergson's theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty,\ndeveloped in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true\nbeliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we\nknow of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of\nman: if the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred\nhistory is presumably untrue. If, on the other hand, we agree with him\nin thinking that evolution took place as Darwin believed, then it is\nnot only intellect, but all our faculties, that have been developed\nunder the stress of practical utility. Intuition is seen at its best\nwhere it is directly useful, for example in regard to other people's\ncharacters and dispositions. Bergson apparently holds that capacity\nfor this kind of knowledge is less explicable by the struggle for\nexistence than, for example, capacity for pure mathematics. Yet the\nsavage deceived by false friendship is likely to pay for his mistake\nwith his life; whereas even in the most civilised societies men are\nnot put to death for mathematical incompetence. All the most striking\nof his instances of intuition in animals have a very direct survival\nvalue. The fact is, of course, that both intuition and intellect have\nbeen developed because they are useful, and that, speaking broadly,\nthey are useful when they give truth and become harmful when they give\nfalsehood. Intellect, in civilised man, like artistic capacity, has\noccasionally been developed beyond the point where it is useful to the\nindividual; intuition, on the other hand, seems on the whole to\ndiminish as civilisation increases. It is greater, as a rule, in\nchildren than in adults, in the uneducated than in the educated.\nProbably in dogs it exceeds anything to be found in human beings. But\nthose who see in these facts a recommendation of intuition ought to\nreturn to running wild in the woods, dyeing themselves with woad and\nliving on hips and haws.\nLet us next examine whether intuition possesses any such infallibility\nas Bergson claims for it. The best instance of it, according to him,\nis our acquaintance with ourselves; yet self-knowledge is proverbially\nrare and difficult. Most men, for example, have in their nature\nmeannesses, vanities, and envies of which they are quite unconscious,\nthough even their best friends can perceive them without any\ndifficulty. It is true that intuition has a convincingness which is\nlacking to intellect: while it is present, it is almost impossible to\ndoubt its truth. But if it should appear, on examination, to be at\nleast as fallible as intellect, its greater subjective certainty\nbecomes a demerit, making it only the more irresistibly deceptive.\nApart from self-knowledge, one of the most notable examples of\nintuition is the knowledge people believe themselves to possess of\nthose with whom they are in love: the wall between different\npersonalities seems to become transparent, and people think they see\ninto another soul as into their own. Yet deception in such cases is\nconstantly practised with success; and even where there is no\nintentional deception, experience gradually proves, as a rule, that\nthe supposed insight was illusory, and that the slower more groping\nmethods of the intellect are in the long run more reliable.\nBergson maintains that intellect can only deal with things in so far\nas they resemble what has been experienced in the past, while\nintuition has the power of apprehending the uniqueness and novelty\nthat always belong to each fresh moment. That there is something\nunique and new at every moment, is certainly true; it is also true\nthat this cannot be fully expressed by means of intellectual concepts.\nOnly direct acquaintance can give knowledge of what is unique and new.\nBut direct acquaintance of this kind is given fully in sensation, and\ndoes not require, so far as I can see, any special faculty of\nintuition for its apprehension. It is neither intellect nor intuition,\nbut sensation, that supplies new data; but when the data are new in\nany remarkable manner, intellect is much more capable of dealing with\nthem than intuition would be. The hen with a brood of ducklings no\ndoubt has intuition which seems to place her inside them, and not\nmerely to know them analytically; but when the ducklings take to the\nwater, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be illusory, and the\nhen is left helpless on the shore. Intuition, in fact, is an aspect\nand development of instinct, and, like all instinct, is admirable in\nthose customary surroundings which have moulded the habits of the\nanimal in question, but totally incompetent as soon as the\nsurroundings are changed in a way which demands some non-habitual mode\nof action.\nThe theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of\nphilosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals,\nor to savages, or even to most civilised men. It is hardly to be\nsupposed, therefore, that the rapid, rough and ready methods of\ninstinct or intuition will find in this field a favourable ground for\ntheir application. It is the older kinds of activity, which bring out\nour kinship with remote generations of animal and semi-human\nancestors, that show intuition at its best. In such matters as\nself-preservation and love, intuition will act sometimes (though not\nalways) with a swiftness and precision which are astonishing to the\ncritical intellect. But philosophy is not one of the pursuits which\nillustrate our affinity with the past: it is a highly refined, highly\ncivilised pursuit, demanding, for its success, a certain liberation\nfrom the life of instinct, and even, at times, a certain aloofness\nfrom all mundane hopes and fears. It is not in philosophy, therefore,\nthat we can hope to see intuition at its best. On the contrary, since\nthe true objects of philosophy, and the habit of thought demanded for\ntheir apprehension, are strange, unusual, and remote, it is here, more\nalmost than anywhere else, that intellect proves superior to\nintuition, and that quick unanalysed convictions are least deserving\nof uncritical acceptance.\nIn advocating the scientific restraint and balance, as against the\nself-assertion of a confident reliance upon intuition, we are only\nurging, in the sphere of knowledge, that largeness of contemplation,\nthat impersonal disinterestedness, and that freedom from practical\npreoccupations which have been inculcated by all the great religions\nof the world. Thus our conclusion, however it may conflict with the\nexplicit beliefs of many mystics, is, in essence, not contrary to the\nspirit which inspires those beliefs, but rather the outcome of this\nvery spirit as applied in the realm of thought.\nII. UNITY AND PLURALITY\nOne of the most convincing aspects of the mystic illumination is the\napparent revelation of the oneness of all things, giving rise to\npantheism in religion and to monism in philosophy. An elaborate logic,\nbeginning with Parmenides, and culminating in Hegel and his followers,\nhas been gradually developed, to prove that the universe is one\nindivisible Whole, and that what seem to be its parts, if considered\nas substantial and self-existing, are mere illusion. The conception\nof a Reality quite other than the world of appearance, a reality one,\nindivisible, and unchanging, was introduced into Western philosophy by\nParmenides, not, nominally at least, for mystical or religious\nreasons, but on the basis of a logical argument as to the\nimpossibility of not-being, and most subsequent metaphysical systems\nare the outcome of this fundamental idea.\nThe logic used in defence of mysticism seems to be faulty as logic,\nand open to technical criticisms, which I have explained elsewhere. I\nshall not here repeat these criticisms, since they are lengthy and\ndifficult, but shall instead attempt an analysis of the state of mind\nfrom which mystical logic has arisen.\nBelief in a reality quite different from what appears to the senses\narises with irresistible force in certain moods, which are the source\nof most mysticism, and of most metaphysics. While such a mood is\ndominant, the need of logic is not felt, and accordingly the more\nthoroughgoing mystics do not employ logic, but appeal directly to the\nimmediate deliverance of their insight. But such fully developed\nmysticism is rare in the West. When the intensity of emotional\nconviction subsides, a man who is in the habit of reasoning will\nsearch for logical grounds in favour of the belief which he finds in\nhimself. But since the belief already exists, he will be very\nhospitable to any ground that suggests itself. The paradoxes\napparently proved by his logic are really the paradoxes of mysticism,\nand are the goal which he feels his logic must reach if it is to be in\naccordance with insight. The resulting logic has rendered most\nphilosophers incapable of giving any account of the world of science\nand daily life. If they had been anxious to give such an account, they\nwould probably have discovered the errors of their logic; but most of\nthem were less anxious to understand the world of science and daily\nlife than to convict it of unreality in the interests of a\nsuper-sensible \"real\" world.\nIt is in this way that logic has been pursued by those of the great\nphilosophers who were mystics. But since they usually took for granted\nthe supposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines\nwere presented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their\ndisciples to be quite independent of the sudden illumination from\nwhich they sprang. Nevertheless their origin clung to them, and they\nremained--to borrow a useful word from Mr. Santayana--\"malicious\" in\nregard to the world of science and common sense. It is only so that we\ncan account for the complacency with which philosophers have accepted\nthe inconsistency of their doctrines with all the common and\nscientific facts which seem best established and most worthy of\nbelief.\nThe logic of mysticism shows, as is natural, the defects which are\ninherent in anything malicious. The impulse to logic, not felt while\nthe mystic mood is dominant, reasserts itself as the mood fades, but\nwith a desire to retain the vanishing insight, or at least to prove\nthat it _was_ insight, and that what seems to contradict it is\nillusion. The logic which thus arises is not quite disinterested or\ncandid, and is inspired by a certain hatred of the daily world to\nwhich it is to be applied. Such an attitude naturally does not tend to\nthe best results. Everyone knows that to read an author simply in\norder to refute him is not the way to understand him; and to read the\nbook of Nature with a conviction that it is all illusion is just as\nunlikely to lead to understanding. If our logic is to find the common\nworld intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired by a\ngenuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among\nmetaphysicians.\nIII. TIME\nThe unreality of time is a cardinal doctrine of many metaphysical\nsystems, often nominally based, as already by Parmenides, upon logical\narguments, but originally derived, at any rate in the founders of new\nsystems, from the certainty which is born in the moment of mystic\ninsight. As a Persian Sufi poet says:\n\"Past and future are what veil God from our sight.\nBurn up both of them with fire! How long\nWilt thou be partitioned by these segments as a reed?\"[5]\nThe belief that what is ultimately real must be immutable is a very\ncommon one: it gave rise to the metaphysical notion of substance, and\nfinds, even now, a wholly illegitimate satisfaction in such scientific\ndoctrines as the conservation of energy and mass.\nIt is difficult to disentangle the truth and the error in this view.\nThe arguments for the contention that time is unreal and that the\nworld of sense is illusory must, I think, be regarded as fallacious.\nNevertheless there is some sense--easier to feel than to state--in\nwhich time is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of\nreality. Past and future must be acknowledged to be as real as the\npresent, and a certain emancipation from slavery to time is essential\nto philosophic thought. The importance of time is rather practical\nthan theoretical, rather in relation to our desires than in relation\nto truth. A truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by\npicturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal\nworld outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring\ntyrant of all that is. Both in thought and in feeling, even though\ntime be real, to realise the unimportance of time is the gate of\nwisdom.\nThat this is the case may be seen at once by asking ourselves why our\nfeelings towards the past are so different from our feelings towards\nthe future. The reason for this difference is wholly practical: our\nwishes can affect the future but not the past, the future is to some\nextent subject to our power, while the past is unalterably fixed. But\nevery future will some day be past: if we see the past truly now, it\nmust, when it was still future, have been just what we now see it to\nbe, and what is now future must be just what we shall see it to be\nwhen it has become past. The felt difference of quality between past\nand future, therefore, is not an intrinsic difference, but only a\ndifference in relation to us: to impartial contemplation, it ceases to\nexist. And impartiality of contemplation is, in the intellectual\nsphere, that very same virtue of disinterestedness which, in the\nsphere of action, appears as justice and unselfishness. Whoever wishes\nto see the world truly, to rise in thought above the tyranny of\npractical desires, must learn to overcome the difference of attitude\ntowards past and future, and to survey the whole stream of time in one\ncomprehensive vision.\nThe kind of way in which, as it seems to me, time ought not to enter\ninto our theoretic philosophical thought, may be illustrated by the\nphilosophy which has become associated with the idea of evolution, and\nwhich is exemplified by Nietzsche, pragmatism, and Bergson. This\nphilosophy, on the basis of the development which has led from the\nlowest forms of life up to man, sees in _progress_ the fundamental law\nof the universe, and thus admits the difference between _earlier_ and\n_later_ into the very citadel of its contemplative outlook. With its\npast and future history of the world, conjectural as it is, I do not\nwish to quarrel. But I think that, in the intoxication of a quick\nsuccess, much that is required for a true understanding of the\nuniverse has been forgotten. Something of Hellenism, something, too,\nof Oriental resignation, must be combined with its hurrying Western\nself-assertion before it can emerge from the ardour of youth into the\nmature wisdom of manhood. In spite of its appeals to science, the true\nscientific philosophy, I think, is something more arduous and more\naloof, appealing to less mundane hopes, and requiring a severer\ndiscipline for its successful practice.\nDarwin's _Origin of Species_ persuaded the world that the difference\nbetween different species of animals and plants is not the fixed\nimmutable difference that it appears to be. The doctrine of natural\nkinds, which had rendered classification easy and definite, which was\nenshrined in the Aristotelian tradition, and protected by its supposed\nnecessity for orthodox dogma, was suddenly swept away for ever out of\nthe biological world. The difference between man and the lower\nanimals, which to our human conceit appears enormous, was shown to be\na gradual achievement, involving intermediate being who could not with\ncertainty be placed either within or without the human family. The sun\nand the planets had already been shown by Laplace to be very probably\nderived from a primitive more or less undifferentiated nebula. Thus\nthe old fixed landmarks became wavering and indistinct, and all sharp\noutlines were blurred. Things and species lost their boundaries, and\nnone could say where they began or where they ended.\nBut if human conceit was staggered for a moment by its kinship with\nthe ape, it soon found a way to reassert itself, and that way is the\n\"philosophy\" of evolution. A process which led from the amoeba to Man\nappeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress--though\nwhether the amoeba would agree with this opinion is not known. Hence\nthe cycle of changes which science had shown to be the probable\nhistory of the past was welcomed as revealing a law of development\ntowards good in the universe--an evolution or unfolding of an idea\nslowly embodying itself in the actual. But such a view, though it\nmight satisfy Spencer and those whom we may call Hegelian\nevolutionists, could not be accepted as adequate by the more\nwhole-hearted votaries of change. An ideal to which the world\ncontinuously approaches is, to these minds, too dead and static to be\ninspiring. Not only the aspiration, but the ideal too, must change and\ndevelop with the course of evolution: there must be no fixed goal, but\na continual fashioning of fresh needs by the impulse which is life and\nwhich alone gives unity to the process.\nLife, in this philosophy, is a continuous stream, in which all\ndivisions are artificial and unreal. Separate things, beginnings and\nendings, are mere convenient fictions: there is only smooth unbroken\ntransition. The beliefs of to-day may count as true to-day, if they\ncarry us along the stream; but to-morrow they will be false, and must\nbe replaced by new beliefs to meet the new situation. All our thinking\nconsists of convenient fictions, imaginary congealings of the stream:\nreality flows on in spite of all our fictions, and though it can be\nlived, it cannot be conceived in thought. Somehow, without explicit\nstatement, the assurance is slipped in that the future, though we\ncannot foresee it, will be better than the past or the present: the\nreader is like the child which expects a sweet because it has been\ntold to open its mouth and shut its eyes. Logic, mathematics, physics\ndisappear in this philosophy, because they are too \"static\"; what is\nreal is no impulse and movement towards a goal which, like the\nrainbow, recedes as we advance, and makes every place different when\nit reaches it from what it appeared to be at a distance.\nI do not propose to enter upon a technical examination of this\nphilosophy. I wish only to maintain that the motives and interests\nwhich inspire it are so exclusively practical, and the problems with\nwhich it deals are so special, that it can hardly be regarded as\ntouching any of the questions that, to my mind, constitute genuine\nphilosophy.\nThe predominant interest of evolutionism is in the question of human\ndestiny, or at least of the destiny of Life. It is more interested in\nmorality and happiness than in knowledge for its own sake. It must be\nadmitted that the same may be said of many other philosophies, and\nthat a desire for the kind of knowledge which philosophy can give is\nvery rare. But if philosophy is to attain truth, it is necessary first\nand foremost that philosophers should acquire the disinterested\nintellectual curiosity which characterises the genuine man of science.\nKnowledge concerning the future--which is the kind of knowledge that\nmust be sought if we are to know about human destiny--is possible\nwithin certain narrow limits. It is impossible to say how much the\nlimits may be enlarged with the progress of science. But what is\nevident is that any proposition about the future belongs by its\nsubject-matter to some particular science, and is to be ascertained,\nif at all, by the methods of that science. Philosophy is not a short\ncut to the same kind of results as those of the other sciences: if it\nis to be a genuine study, it must have a province of its own, and aim\nat results which the other sciences can neither prove nor disprove.\nEvolutionism, in basing itself upon the notion of _progress_, which is\nchange from the worse to the better, allows the notion of time, as it\nseems to me, to become its tyrant rather than its servant, and thereby\nloses that impartiality of contemplation which is the source of all\nthat is best in philosophic thought and feeling. Metaphysicians, as we\nsaw, have frequently denied altogether the reality of time. I do not\nwish to do this; I wish only to preserve the mental outlook which\ninspired the denial, the attitude which, in thought, regards the past\nas having the same reality as the present and the same importance as\nthe future. \"In so far,\" says Spinoza,[6] \"as the mind conceives a\nthing according to the dictate of reason, it will be equally affected\nwhether the idea is that of a future, past, or present thing.\" It is\nthis \"conceiving according to the dictate of reason\" that I find\nlacking in the philosophy which is based on evolution.\nIV. GOOD AND EVIL\nMysticism maintains that all evil is illusory, and sometimes maintains\nthe same view as regards good, but more often holds that all Reality\nis good. Both views are to be found in Heraclitus: \"Good and ill are\none,\" he says, but again, \"To God all things are fair and good and\nright, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\" A similar\ntwofold position is to be found in Spinoza, but he uses the word\n\"perfection\" when he means to speak of the good that is not merely\nhuman. \"By reality and perfection I mean the same thing,\" he says;[7]\nbut elsewhere we find the definition: \"By _good_ I shall mean that\nwhich we certainly know to be useful to us.\"[8] Thus perfection\nbelongs to Reality in its own nature, but goodness is relative to\nourselves and our needs, and disappears in an impartial survey. Some\nsuch distinction, I think, is necessary in order to understand the\nethical outlook of mysticism: there is a lower mundane kind of good\nand evil, which divides the world of appearance into what seem to be\nconflicting parts; but there is also a higher, mystical kind of good,\nwhich belongs to Reality and is not opposed by any correlative kind of\nevil.\nIt is difficult to give a logically tenable account of this position\nwithout recognising that good and evil are subjective, that what is\ngood is merely that towards which we have one kind of feeling, and\nwhat is evil is merely that towards which we have another kind of\nfeeling. In our active life, where we have to exercise choice, and to\nprefer this to that of two possible acts, it is necessary to have a\ndistinction of good and evil, or at least of better and worse. But\nthis distinction, like everything pertaining to action, belongs to\nwhat mysticism regards as the world of illusion, if only because it is\nessentially concerned with time. In our contemplative life, where\naction is not called for, it is possible to be impartial, and to\novercome the ethical dualism which action requires. So long as we\nremain _merely_ impartial, we may be content to say that both the good\nand the evil of action are illusions. But if, as we must do if we have\nthe mystic vision, we find the whole world worthy of love and worship,\nif we see\n\"The earth, and every common sight....\nApparell'd in celestial light,\"\nwe shall say that there is a higher good than that of action, and that\nthis higher good belongs to the whole world as it is in reality. In\nthis way the twofold attitude and the apparent vacillation of\nmysticism are explained and justified.\nThe possibility of this universal love and joy in all that exists is\nof supreme importance for the conduct and happiness of life, and gives\ninestimable value to the mystic emotion, apart from any creeds which\nmay be built upon it. But if we are not to be led into false beliefs,\nit is necessary to realise exactly _what_ the mystic emotion reveals.\nIt reveals a possibility of human nature--a possibility of a nobler,\nhappier, freer life than any that can be otherwise achieved. But it\ndoes not reveal anything about the non-human, or about the nature of\nthe universe in general. Good and bad, and even the higher good that\nmysticism finds everywhere, are the reflections of our own emotions on\nother things, not part of the substance of things as they are in\nthemselves. And therefore an impartial contemplation, freed from all\npre-occupation with Self, will not judge things good or bad, although\nit is very easily combined with that feeling of universal love which\nleads the mystic to say that the whole world is good.\nThe philosophy of evolution, through the notion of progress, is bound\nup with the ethical dualism of the worse and the better, and is thus\nshut out, not only from the kind of survey which discards good and\nevil altogether from its view, but also from the mystical belief in\nthe goodness of everything. In this way the distinction of good and\nevil, like time, becomes a tyrant in this philosophy, and introduces\ninto thought the restless selectiveness of action. Good and evil, like\ntime, are, it would seem, not general or fundamental in the world of\nthought, but late and highly specialised members of the intellectual\nhierarchy.\nAlthough, as we saw, mysticism can be interpreted so as to agree with\nthe view that good and evil are not intellectually fundamental, it\nmust be admitted that here we are no longer in verbal agreement with\nmost of the great philosophers and religious teachers of the past. I\nbelieve, however, that the elimination of ethical considerations from\nphilosophy is both scientifically necessary and--though this may seem\na paradox--an ethical advance. Both these contentions must be briefly\ndefended.\nThe hope of satisfaction to our more human desires--the hope of\ndemonstrating that the world has this or that desirable ethical\ncharacteristic--is not one which, so far as I can see, a scientific\nphilosophy can do anything whatever to satisfy. The difference between\na good world and a bad one is a difference in the particular\ncharacteristics of the particular things that exist in these worlds:\nit is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the\nprovince of philosophy. Love and hate, for example, are ethical\nopposites, but to philosophy they are closely analogous attitudes\ntowards objects. The general form and structure of those attitudes\ntowards objects which constitute mental phenomena is a problem for\nphilosophy, but the difference between love and hate is not a\ndifference of form or structure, and therefore belongs rather to the\nspecial science of psychology than to philosophy. Thus the ethical\ninterests which have often inspired philosophers must remain in the\nbackground: some kind of ethical interest may inspire the whole study,\nbut none must obtrude in the detail or be expected in the special\nresults which are sought.\nIf this view seems at first sight disappointing, we may remind\nourselves that a similar change has been found necessary in all the\nother sciences. The physicist or chemist is not now required to prove\nthe ethical importance of his ions or atoms; the biologist is not\nexpected to prove the utility of the plants or animals which he\ndissects. In pre-scientific ages this was not the case. Astronomy, for\nexample, was studied because men believed in astrology: it was thought\nthat the movements of the planets had the most direct and important\nbearing upon the lives of human beings. Presumably, when this belief\ndecayed and the disinterested study of astronomy began, many who had\nfound astrology absorbingly interesting decided that astronomy had too\nlittle human interest to be worthy of study. Physics, as it appears in\nPlato's Tim\u00e6us for example, is full of ethical notions: it is an\nessential part of its purpose to show that the earth is worthy of\nadmiration. The modern physicist, on the contrary, though he has no\nwish to deny that the earth is admirable, is not concerned, as\nphysicist, with its ethical attributes: he is merely concerned to find\nout facts, not to consider whether they are good or bad. In\npsychology, the scientific attitude is even more recent and more\ndifficult than in the physical sciences: it is natural to consider\nthat human nature is either good or bad, and to suppose that the\ndifference between good and bad, so all-important in practice, must be\nimportant in theory also. It is only during the last century that an\nethically neutral psychology has grown up; and here too, ethical\nneutrality has been essential to scientific success.\nIn philosophy, hitherto, ethical neutrality has been seldom sought and\nhardly ever achieved. Men have remembered their wishes, and have\njudged philosophies in relation to their wishes. Driven from the\nparticular sciences, the belief that the notions of good and evil must\nafford a key to the understanding of the world has sought a refuge in\nphilosophy. But even from this last refuge, if philosophy is not to\nremain a set of pleasing dreams, this belief must be driven forth. It\nis a commonplace that happiness is not best achieved by those who\nseek it directly; and it would seem that the same is true of the good.\nIn thought, at any rate, those who forget good and evil and seek only\nto know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view\nthe world through the distorting medium of their own desires.\nWe are thus brought back to our seeming paradox, that a philosophy\nwhich does not seek to impose upon the world its own conceptions of\ngood and evil is not only more likely to achieve truth, but is also\nthe outcome of a higher ethical standpoint than one which, like\nevolutionism and most traditional systems, is perpetually appraising\nthe universe and seeking to find in it an embodiment of present\nideals. In religion, and in every deeply serious view of the world and\nof human destiny, there is an element of submission, a realisation of\nthe limits of human power, which is somewhat lacking in the modern\nworld, with its quick material successes and its insolent belief in\nthe boundless possibilities of progress. \"He that loveth his life\nshall lose it\"; and there is danger lest, through a too confident love\nof life, life itself should lose much of what gives it its highest\nworth. The submission which religion inculcates in action is\nessentially the same in spirit as that which science teaches in\nthought; and the ethical neutrality by which its victories have been\nachieved is the outcome of that submission.\nThe good which it concerns us to remember is the good which it lies in\nour power to create--the good in our own lives and in our attitude\ntowards the world. Insistence on belief in an external realisation of\nthe good is a form of self-assertion, which, while it cannot secure\nthe external good which it desires, can seriously impair the inward\ngood which lies within our power, and destroy that reverence towards\nfact which constitutes both what is valuable in humility and what is\nfruitful in the scientific temper.\nHuman beings cannot, of course, wholly transcend human nature;\nsomething subjective, if only the interest that determines the\ndirection of our attention, must remain in all our thought. But\nscientific philosophy comes nearer to objectivity than any other human\npursuit, and gives us, therefore, the closest constant and the most\nintimate relation with the outer world that it is possible to achieve.\nTo the primitive mind, everything is either friendly or hostile; but\nexperience has shown that friendliness and hostility are not the\nconceptions by which the world is to be understood. Scientific\nphilosophy thus represents, though as yet only in a nascent condition,\na higher form of thought than any pre-scientific belief or\nimagination, and, like every approach to self-transcendence, it brings\nwith it a rich reward in increase of scope and breadth and\ncomprehension. Evolutionism, in spite of its appeals to particular\nscientific facts, fails to be a truly scientific philosophy because of\nits slavery to time, its ethical preoccupations, and its predominant\ninterest in our mundane concerns and destiny. A truly scientific\nphilosophy will be more humble, more piecemeal, more arduous, offering\nless glitter of outward mirage to flatter fallacious hopes, but more\nindifferent to fate, and more capable of accepting the world without\nthe tyrannous imposition of our human and temporary demands.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] All the above quotations are from Burnet's _Early Greek\nPhilosophy_, (2nd ed., 1908), pp. 146-156.\n[2] _Republic_, 514, translated by Davies and Vaughan.\n[3] This section, and also one or two pages in later sections, have\nbeen printed in a course of Lowell lectures _On our knowledge of the\nexternal world_, published by the Open Court Publishing Company.

It is\nnot of this aspect of science that I wish to speak. Science, in this\naspect, consists of detached up-to-date fragments, interesting only\nuntil they are replaced by something newer and more up-to-date,\ndisplaying nothing of the systems of patiently constructed knowledge\nout of which, almost as a casual incident, have come the practically\nuseful results which interest the man in the street. The increased\ncommand over the forces of nature which is derived from science is\nundoubtedly an amply sufficient reason for encouraging scientific\nresearch, but this reason has been so often urged and is so easily\nappreciated that other reasons, to my mind quite as important, are apt\nto be overlooked. It is with these other reasons, especially with the\nintrinsic value of a scientific habit of mind in forming our outlook\non the world, that I shall be concerned in what follows.\nThe instance of wireless telegraphy will serve to illustrate the\ndifference between the two points of view. Almost all the serious\nintellectual labour required for the possibility of this invention is\ndue to three men--Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. In alternating layers\nof experiment and theory these three men built up the modern theory of\nelectromagnetism, and demonstrated the identity of light with\nelectromagnetic waves. The system which they discovered is one of\nprofound intellectual interest, bringing together and unifying an\nendless variety of apparently detached phenomena, and displaying a\ncumulative mental power which cannot but afford delight to every\ngenerous spirit. The mechanical details which remained to be adjusted\nin order to utilise their discoveries for a practical system of\ntelegraphy demanded, no doubt, very considerable ingenuity, but had\nnot that broad sweep and that universality which could give them\nintrinsic interest as an object of disinterested contemplation.\nFrom the point of view of training the mind, of giving that\nwell-informed, impersonal outlook which constitutes culture in the\ngood sense of this much-misused word, it seems to be generally held\nindisputable that a literary education is superior to one based on\nscience. Even the warmest advocates of science are apt to rest their\nclaims on the contention that culture ought to be sacrificed to\nutility. Those men of science who respect culture, when they associate\nwith men learned in the classics, are apt to admit, not merely\npolitely, but sincerely, a certain inferiority on their side,\ncompensated doubtless by the services which science renders to\nhumanity, but none the less real. And so long as this attitude exists\namong men of science, it tends to verify itself: the intrinsically\nvaluable aspects of science tend to be sacrificed to the merely\nuseful, and little attempt is made to preserve that leisurely,\nsystematic survey by which the finer quality of mind is formed and\nnourished.\nBut even if there be, in present fact, any such inferiority as is\nsupposed in the educational value of science, this is, I believe, not\nthe fault of science itself, but the fault of the spirit in which\nscience is taught. If its full possibilities were realised by those\nwho teach it, I believe that its capacity of producing those habits of\nmind which constitute the highest mental excellence would be at least\nas great as that of literature, and more particularly of Greek and\nLatin literature. In saying this I have no wish whatever to disparage\na classical education. I have not myself enjoyed its benefits, and my\nknowledge of Greek and Latin authors is derived almost wholly from\ntranslations. But I am firmly persuaded that the Greeks fully deserve\nall the admiration that is bestowed upon them, and that it is a very\ngreat and serious loss to be unacquainted with their writings. It is\nnot by attacking them, but by drawing attention to neglected\nexcellences in science, that I wish to conduct my argument.\nOne defect, however, does seem inherent in a purely classical\neducation--namely, a too exclusive emphasis on the past. By the study\nof what is absolutely ended and can never be renewed, a habit of\ncriticism towards the present and the future is engendered. The\nqualities in which the present excels are qualities to which the study\nof the past does not direct attention, and to which, therefore, the\nstudent of Greek civilisation may easily become blind. In what is new\nand growing there is apt to be something crude, insolent, even a\nlittle vulgar, which is shocking to the man of sensitive taste;\nquivering from the rough contact, he retires to the trim gardens of a\npolished past, forgetting that they were reclaimed from the wilderness\nby men as rough and earth-soiled as those from whom he shrinks in his\nown day. The habit of being unable to recognise merit until it is\ndead is too apt to be the result of a purely bookish life, and a\nculture based wholly on the past will seldom be able to pierce through\neveryday surroundings to the essential splendour of contemporary\nthings, or to the hope of still greater splendour in the future.\n\"My eyes saw not the men of old;\nAnd now their age away has rolled.\nI weep--to think I shall not see\nThe heroes of posterity.\"\nSo says the Chinese poet; but such impartiality is rare in the more\npugnacious atmosphere of the West, where the champions of past and\nfuture fight a never-ending battle, instead of combining to seek out\nthe merits of both.\nThis consideration, which militates not only against the exclusive\nstudy of the classics, but against every form of culture which has\nbecome static, traditional, and academic, leads inevitably to the\nfundamental question: What is the true end of education? But before\nattempting to answer this question it will be well to define the sense\nin which we are to use the word \"education.\" For this purpose I shall\ndistinguish the sense in which I mean to use it from two others, both\nperfectly legitimate, the one broader and the other narrower than the\nsense in which I mean to use the word.\nIn the broader sense, education will include not only what we learn\nthrough instruction, but all that we learn through personal\nexperience--the formation of character through the education of life.\nOf this aspect of education, vitally important as it is, I will say\nnothing, since its consideration would introduce topics quite foreign\nto the question with which we are concerned.\nIn the narrower sense, education may be confined to instruction, the\nimparting of definite information on various subjects, because such\ninformation, in and for itself, is useful in daily life. Elementary\neducation--reading, writing, and arithmetic--is almost wholly of this\nkind. But instruction, necessary as it is, does not _per se_\nconstitute education in the sense in which I wish to consider it.\nEducation, in the sense in which I mean it, may be defined as _the\nformation, by means of instruction, of certain mental habits and a\ncertain outlook on life and the world_. It remains to ask ourselves,\nwhat mental habits, and what sort of outlook, can be hoped for as the\nresult of instruction? When we have answered this question we can\nattempt to decide what science has to contribute to the formation of\nthe habits and outlook which we desire.\nOur whole life is built about a certain number--not a very small\nnumber--of primary instincts and impulses. Only what is in some way\nconnected with these instincts and impulses appears to us desirable or\nimportant; there is no faculty, whether \"reason\" or \"virtue\" or\nwhatever it may be called, that can take our active life and our hopes\nand fears outside the region controlled by these first movers of all\ndesire. Each of them is like a queen-bee, aided by a hive of workers\ngathering honey; but when the queen is gone the workers languish and\ndie, and the cells remain empty of their expected sweetness. So with\neach primary impulse in civilised man: it is surrounded and protected\nby a busy swarm of attendant derivative desires, which store up in its\nservice whatever honey the surrounding world affords. But if the\nqueen-impulse dies, the death-dealing influence, though retarded a\nlittle by habit, spreads slowly through all the subsidiary impulses,\nand a whole tract of life becomes inexplicably colourless. What was\nformerly full of zest, and so obviously worth doing that it raised no\nquestions, has now grown dreary and purposeless: with a sense of\ndisillusion we inquire the meaning of life, and decide, perhaps, that\nall is vanity. The search for an outside meaning that can _compel_ an\ninner response must always be disappointed: all \"meaning\" must be at\nbottom related to our primary desires, and when they are extinct no\nmiracle can restore to the world the value which they reflected upon\nit.\nThe purpose of education, therefore, cannot be to create any primary\nimpulse which is lacking in the uneducated; the purpose can only be to\nenlarge the scope of those that human nature provides, by increasing\nthe number and variety of attendant thoughts, and by showing where the\nmost permanent satisfaction is to be found. Under the impulse of a\nCalvinistic horror of the \"natural man,\" this obvious truth has been\ntoo often misconceived in the training of the young; \"nature\" has been\nfalsely regarded as excluding all that is best in what is natural, and\nthe endeavour to teach virtue has led to the production of stunted and\ncontorted hypocrites instead of full-grown human beings. From such\nmistakes in education a better psychology or a kinder heart is\nbeginning to preserve the present generation; we need, therefore,\nwaste no more words on the theory that the purpose of education is to\nthwart or eradicate nature.\nBut although nature must supply the initial force of desire, nature is\nnot, in the civilised man, the spasmodic, fragmentary, and yet violent\nset of impulses that it is in the savage. Each impulse has its\nconstitutional ministry of thought and knowledge and reflection,\nthrough which possible conflicts of impulses are foreseen, and\ntemporary impulses are controlled by the unifying impulse which may be\ncalled wisdom. In this way education destroys the crudity of\ninstinct, and increases through knowledge the wealth and variety of\nthe individual's contacts with the outside world, making him no longer\nan isolated fighting unit, but a citizen of the universe, embracing\ndistant countries, remote regions of space, and vast stretches of past\nand future within the circle of his interests. It is this simultaneous\nsoftening in the insistence of desire and enlargement of its scope\nthat is the chief moral end of education.\nClosely connected with this moral end is the more purely intellectual\naim of education, the endeavour to make us see and imagine the world\nin an objective manner, as far as possible as it is in itself, and not\nmerely through the distorting medium of personal desire. The complete\nattainment of such an objective view is no doubt an ideal,\nindefinitely approachable, but not actually and fully realisable.\nEducation, considered as a process of forming our mental habits and\nour outlook on the world, is to be judged successful in proportion as\nits outcome approximates to this ideal; in proportion, that is to say,\nas it gives us a true view of our place in society, of the relation of\nthe whole human society to its non-human environment, and of the\nnature of the non-human world as it is in itself apart from our\ndesires and interests. If this standard is admitted, we can return to\nthe consideration of science, inquiring how far science contributes to\nsuch an aim, and whether it is in any respect superior to its rivals\nin educational practice.\nII\nTwo opposite and at first sight conflicting merits belong to science\nas against literature and art. The one, which is not inherently\nnecessary, but is certainly true at the present day, is hopefulness\nas to the future of human achievement, and in particular as to the\nuseful work that may be accomplished by any intelligent student. This\nmerit and the cheerful outlook which it engenders prevent what might\notherwise be the depressing effect of another aspect of science, to my\nmind also a merit, and perhaps its greatest merit--I mean the\nirrelevance of human passions and of the whole subjective apparatus\nwhere scientific truth is concerned. Each of these reasons for\npreferring the study of science requires some amplification. Let us\nbegin with the first.\nIn the study of literature or art our attention is perpetually riveted\nupon the past: the men of Greece or of the Renaissance did better than\nany men do now; the triumphs of former ages, so far from facilitating\nfresh triumphs in our own age, actually increase the difficulty of\nfresh triumphs by rendering originality harder of attainment; not only\nis artistic achievement not cumulative, but it seems even to depend\nupon a certain freshness and _na\u00efvet\u00e9_ of impulse and vision which\ncivilisation tends to destroy. Hence comes, to those who have been\nnourished on the literary and artistic productions of former ages, a\ncertain peevishness and undue fastidiousness towards the present, from\nwhich there seems no escape except into the deliberate vandalism which\nignores tradition and in the search after originality achieves only\nthe eccentric. But in such vandalism there is none of the simplicity\nand spontaneity out of which great art springs: theory is still the\ncanker in its core, and insincerity destroys the advantages of a\nmerely pretended ignorance.\nThe despair thus arising from an education which suggests no\npre-eminent mental activity except that of artistic creation is wholly\nabsent from an education which gives the knowledge of scientific\nmethod. The discovery of scientific method, except in pure\nmathematics, is a thing of yesterday; speaking broadly, we may say\nthat it dates from Galileo. Yet already it has transformed the world,\nand its success proceeds with ever-accelerating velocity. In science\nmen have discovered an activity of the very highest value in which\nthey are no longer, as in art, dependent for progress upon the\nappearance of continually greater genius, for in science the\nsuccessors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one\nman of supreme genius has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can\napply it. No transcendent ability is required in order to make useful\ndiscoveries in science; the edifice of science needs its masons,\nbricklayers, and common labourers as well as its foremen,\nmaster-builders, and architects. In art nothing worth doing can be\ndone without genius; in science even a very moderate capacity can\ncontribute to a supreme achievement.\nIn science the man of real genius is the man who invents a new method.\nThe notable discoveries are often made by his successors, who can\napply the method with fresh vigour, unimpaired by the previous labour\nof perfecting it; but the mental calibre of the thought required for\ntheir work, however brilliant, is not so great as that required by the\nfirst inventor of the method. There are in science immense numbers of\ndifferent methods, appropriate to different classes of problems; but\nover and above them all, there is something not easily definable,\nwhich may be called _the_ method of science. It was formerly customary\nto identify this with the inductive method, and to associate it with\nthe name of Bacon. But the true inductive method was not discovered by\nBacon, and the true method of science is something which includes\ndeduction as much as induction, logic and mathematics as much as\nbotany and geology. I shall not attempt the difficult task of stating\nwhat the scientific method is, but I will try to indicate the temper\nof mind out of which the scientific method grows, which is the second\nof the two merits that were mentioned above as belonging to a\nscientific education.\nThe kernel of the scientific outlook is a thing so simple, so obvious,\nso seemingly trivial, that the mention of it may almost excite\nderision. The kernel of the scientific outlook is the refusal to\nregard our own desires, tastes, and interests as affording a key to\nthe understanding of the world. Stated thus baldly, this may seem no\nmore than a trite truism. But to remember it consistently in matters\narousing our passionate partisanship is by no means easy, especially\nwhere the available evidence is uncertain and inconclusive. A few\nillustrations will make this clear.\nAristotle, I understand, considered that the stars must move in\ncircles because the circle is the most perfect curve. In the absence\nof evidence to the contrary, he allowed himself to decide a question\nof fact by an appeal to \u00e6sthetico-moral considerations. In such a case\nit is at once obvious to us that this appeal was unjustifiable. We\nknow now how to ascertain as a fact the way in which the heavenly\nbodies move, and we know that they do not move in circles, or even in\naccurate ellipses, or in any other kind of simply describable curve.\nThis may be painful to a certain hankering after simplicity of pattern\nin the universe, but we know that in astronomy such feelings are\nirrelevant. Easy as this knowledge seems now, we owe it to the courage\nand insight of the first inventors of scientific method, and more\nespecially of Galileo.\nWe may take as another illustration Malthus's doctrine of population.\nThis illustration is all the better for the fact that his actual\ndoctrine is now known to be largely erroneous. It is not his\nconclusions that are valuable, but the temper and method of his\ninquiry. As everyone knows, it was to him that Darwin owed an\nessential part of his theory of natural selection, and this was only\npossible because Malthus's outlook was truly scientific. His great\nmerit lies in considering man not as the object of praise or blame,\nbut as a part of nature, a thing with a certain characteristic\nbehaviour from which certain consequences must follow. If the\nbehaviour is not quite what Malthus supposed, if the consequences are\nnot quite what he inferred, that may falsify his conclusions, but does\nnot impair the value of his method. The objections which were made\nwhen his doctrine was new--that it was horrible and depressing, that\npeople ought not to act as he said they did, and so on--were all such\nas implied an unscientific attitude of mind; as against all of them,\nhis calm determination to treat man as a natural phenomenon marks an\nimportant advance over the reformers of the eighteenth century and the\nRevolution.\nUnder the influence of Darwinism the scientific attitude towards man\nhas now become fairly common, and is to some people quite natural,\nthough to most it is still a difficult and artificial intellectual\ncontortion. There is however, one study which is as yet almost wholly\nuntouched by the scientific spirit--I mean the study of philosophy.\nPhilosophers and the public imagine that the scientific spirit must\npervade pages that bristle with allusions to ions, germ-plasms, and\nthe eyes of shell-fish. But as the devil can quote Scripture, so the\nphilosopher can quote science. The scientific spirit is not an affair\nof quotation, of externally acquired information, any more than\nmanners are an affair of the etiquette-book. The scientific attitude\nof mind involves a sweeping away of all other desires in the interests\nof the desire to know--it involves suppression of hopes and fears,\nloves and hates, and the whole subjective emotional life, until we\nbecome subdued to the material, able to see it frankly, without\npreconceptions, without bias, without any wish except to see it as it\nis, and without any belief that what it is must be determined by some\nrelation, positive or negative, to what we should like it to be, or to\nwhat we can easily imagine it to be.\nNow in philosophy this attitude of mind has not as yet been achieved.\nA certain self-absorption, not personal, but human, has marked almost\nall attempts to conceive the universe as a whole. Mind, or some aspect\nof it--thought or will or sentience--has been regarded as the pattern\nafter which the universe is to be conceived, for no better reason, at\nbottom, than that such a universe would not seem strange, and would\ngive us the cosy feeling that every place is like home. To conceive\nthe universe as essentially progressive or essentially deteriorating,\nfor example, is to give to our hopes and fears a cosmic importance\nwhich _may_, of course, be justified, but which we have as yet no\nreason to suppose justified. Until we have learnt to think of it in\nethically neutral terms, we have not arrived at a scientific attitude\nin philosophy; and until we have arrived at such an attitude, it is\nhardly to be hoped that philosophy will achieve any solid results.\nI have spoken so far largely of the negative aspect of the scientific\nspirit, but it is from the positive aspect that its value is derived.\nThe instinct of constructiveness, which is one of the chief incentives\nto artistic creation, can find in scientific systems a satisfaction\nmore massive than any epic poem. Disinterested curiosity, which is the\nsource of almost all intellectual effort, finds with astonished\ndelight that science can unveil secrets which might well have seemed\nfor ever undiscoverable. The desire for a larger life and wider\ninterests, for an escape from private circumstances, and even from the\nwhole recurring human cycle of birth and death, is fulfilled by the\nimpersonal cosmic outlook of science as by nothing else. To all these\nmust be added, as contributing to the happiness of the man of science,\nthe admiration of splendid achievement, and the consciousness of\ninestimable utility to the human race. A life devoted to science is\ntherefore a happy life, and its happiness is derived from the very\nbest sources that are open to dwellers on this troubled and passionate\nplanet.\nIII\nA FREE MAN'S WORSHIP[9]\nTo Dr. Faustus in his study Mephistopheles told the history of the\nCreation, saying:\n\"The endless praises of the choirs of angels had begun to grow\nwearisome; for, after all, did he not deserve their praise? Had he not\ngiven them endless joy? Would it not be more amusing to obtain\nundeserved praise, to be worshipped by beings whom he tortured? He\nsmiled inwardly, and resolved that the great drama should be\nperformed.\n\"For countless ages the hot nebula whirled aimlessly through space. At\nlength it began to take shape, the central mass threw off planets, the\nplanets cooled, boiling seas and burning mountains heaved and tossed,\nfrom black masses of cloud hot sheets of rain deluged the barely solid\ncrust. And now the first germ of life grew in the depths of the ocean,\nand developed rapidly in the fructifying warmth into vast forest\ntrees, huge ferns springing from the damp mould, sea monsters\nbreeding, fighting, devouring, and passing away. And from the\nmonsters, as the play unfolded itself, Man was born, with the power of\nthought, the knowledge of good and evil, and the cruel thirst for\nworship. And Man saw that all is passing in this mad, monstrous world,\nthat all is struggling to snatch, at any cost, a few brief moments of\nlife before Death's inexorable decree. And Man said: 'There is a\nhidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for\nwe must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing\nworthy of reverence.' And Man stood aside from the struggle, resolving\nthat God intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. And\nwhen he followed the instincts which God had transmitted to him from\nhis ancestry of beasts of prey, he called it Sin, and asked God to\nforgive him. But he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until\nhe invented a divine Plan by which God's wrath was to have been\nappeased. And seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that\nthereby the future might be better. And he gave God thanks for the\nstrength that enabled him to forgo even the joys that were possible.\nAnd God smiled; and when he saw that Man had become perfect in\nrenunciation and worship, he sent another sun through the sky, which\ncrashed into Man's sun; and all returned again to nebula.\n\"'Yes,' he murmured, 'it was a good play; I will have it performed\nagain.'\"\nSuch, in outline, but even more purposeless, more void of meaning, is\nthe world which Science presents for our belief. Amid such a world, if\nanywhere, our ideals henceforward must find a home. That Man is the\nproduct of causes which had no prevision of the end they were\nachieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves\nand his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of\natoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling,\ncan preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours\nof the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday\nbrightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast\ndeath of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man's\nachievement must inevitably be buried beneath the d\u00e9bris of a universe\nin ruins--all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so\nnearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to\nstand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm\nfoundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth\nbe safely built.\nHow, in such an alien and inhuman world, can so powerless a creature\nas Man preserve his aspirations untarnished? A strange mystery it is\nthat Nature, omnipotent but blind, in the revolutions of her secular\nhurryings through the abysses of space, has brought forth at last a\nchild, subject still to her power, but gifted with sight, with\nknowledge of good and evil, with the capacity of judging all the works\nof his unthinking Mother. In spite of Death, the mark and seal of the\nparental control, Man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine,\nto criticise, to know, and in imagination to create. To him alone, in\nthe world with which he is acquainted, this freedom belongs; and in\nthis lies his superiority to the resistless forces that control his\noutward life.\nThe savage, like ourselves, feels the oppression of his impotence\nbefore the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he\nrespects more than Power, he is willing to prostrate himself before\nhis gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship.\nPathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture,\nof degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating\nthe jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is\nmost precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be\nappeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch--as\nsuch creeds may be generically called--is in essence the cringing\nsubmission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the\nthought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence\nof ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and\nreceive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.\nBut gradually, as morality grows bolder, the claim of the ideal world\nbegins to be felt; and worship, if it is not to cease, must be given\nto gods of another kind than those created by the savage. Some, though\nthey feel the demands of the ideal, will still consciously reject\nthem, still urging that naked Power is worthy of worship. Such is the\nattitude inculcated in God's answer to Job out of the whirlwind: the\ndivine power and knowledge are paraded, but of the divine goodness\nthere is no hint. Such also is the attitude of those who, in our own\nday, base their morality upon the struggle for survival, maintaining\nthat the survivors are necessarily the fittest. But others, not\ncontent with an answer so repugnant to the moral sense, will adopt the\nposition which we have become accustomed to regard as specially\nreligious, maintaining that, in some hidden manner, the world of fact\nis really harmonious with the world of ideals. Thus Man creates God,\nall-powerful and all-good, the mystic unity of what is and what should\nbe.\nBut the world of fact, after all, is not good; and, in submitting our\njudgment to it, there is an element of slavishness from which our\nthoughts must be purged. For in all things it is well to exalt the\ndignity of Man, by freeing him as far as possible from the tyranny of\nnon-human Power. When we have realised that Power is largely bad, that\nman, with his knowledge of good and evil, is but a helpless atom in a\nworld which has no such knowledge, the choice is again presented to\nus: Shall we worship Force, or shall we worship Goodness? Shall our\nGod exist and be evil, or shall he be recognised as the creation of\nour own conscience?\nThe answer to this question is very momentous, and affects profoundly\nour whole morality. The worship of Force, to which Carlyle and\nNietzsche and the creed of Militarism have accustomed us, is the\nresult of failure to maintain our own ideals against a hostile\nuniverse: it is itself a prostrate submission to evil, a sacrifice of\nour best to Moloch. If strength indeed is to be respected, let us\nrespect rather the strength of those who refuse that false\n\"recognition of facts\" which fails to recognise that facts are often\nbad. Let us admit that, in the world we know, there are many things\nthat would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and\nmust adhere are not realised in the realm of matter. Let us preserve\nour respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which\nlife does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meet\nwith the approval of the unconscious universe. If Power is bad, as it\nseems to be, let us reject it from our hearts. In this lies Man's true\nfreedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own\nlove of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the\ninsight of our best moments. In action, in desire, we must submit\nperpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in\naspiration, we are free, free from our fellow-men, free from the petty\nplanet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live,\nfrom the tyranny of death. Let us learn, then, that energy of faith\nwhich enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good; and let\nus descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always\nbefore us.\nWhen first the opposition of fact and ideal grows fully visible, a\nspirit of fiery revolt, of fierce hatred of the gods, seems necessary\nto the assertion of freedom. To defy with Promethean constancy a\nhostile universe, to keep its evil always in view, always actively\nhated, to refuse no pain that the malice of Power can invent, appears\nto be the duty of all who will not bow before the inevitable. But\nindignation is still a bondage, for it compels our thoughts to be\noccupied with an evil world; and in the fierceness of desire from\nwhich rebellion springs there is a kind of self-assertion which it is\nnecessary for the wise to overcome. Indignation is a submission of our\nthoughts, but not of our desires; the Stoic freedom in which wisdom\nconsists is found in the submission of our desires, but not of our\nthoughts. From the submission of our desires springs the virtue of\nresignation; from the freedom of our thoughts springs the whole world\nof art and philosophy, and the vision of beauty by which, at last, we\nhalf reconquer the reluctant world. But the vision of beauty is\npossible only to unfettered contemplation, to thoughts not weighted by\nthe load of eager wishes; and thus Freedom comes only to those who no\nlonger ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal\ngoods that are subject to the mutations of Time.\nAlthough the necessity of renunciation is evidence of the existence of\nevil, yet Christianity, in preaching it, has shown a wisdom exceeding\nthat of the Promethean philosophy of rebellion. It must be admitted\nthat, of the things we desire, some, though they prove impossible, are\nyet real goods; others, however, as ardently longed for, do not form\npart of a fully purified ideal. The belief that what must be renounced\nis bad, though sometimes false, is far less often false than untamed\npassion supposes; and the creed of religion, by providing a reason\nfor proving that it is never false, has been the means of purifying\nour hopes by the discovery of many austere truths.\nBut there is in resignation a further good element: even real goods,\nwhen they are unattainable, ought not to be fretfully desired. To\nevery man comes, sooner or later, the great renunciation. For the\nyoung, there is nothing unattainable; a good thing desired with the\nwhole force of a passionate will, and yet impossible, is to them not\ncredible. Yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of\nduty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for\nus, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave, Fate may\nnevertheless forbid them. It is the part of courage, when misfortune\ncomes, to bear without repining the ruin of our hopes, to turn away\nour thoughts from vain regrets. This degree of submission to Power is\nnot only just and right: it is the very gate of wisdom.\nBut passive renunciation is not the whole of wisdom; for not by\nrenunciation alone can we build a temple for the worship of our own\nideals. Haunting foreshadowings of the temple appear in the realm of\nimagination, in music, in architecture, in the untroubled kingdom of\nreason, and in the golden sunset magic of lyrics, where beauty shines\nand glows, remote from the touch of sorrow, remote from the fear of\nchange, remote from the failures and disenchantments of the world of\nfact. In the contemplation of these things the vision of heaven will\nshape itself in our hearts, giving at once a touchstone to judge the\nworld about us, and an inspiration by which to fashion to our needs\nwhatever is not incapable of serving as a stone in the sacred temple.\nExcept for those rare spirits that are born without sin, there is a\ncavern of darkness to be traversed before that temple can be entered.\nThe gate of the cavern is despair, and its floor is paved with the\ngravestones of abandoned hopes. There Self must die; there the\neagerness, the greed of untamed desire must be slain, for only so can\nthe soul be freed from the empire of Fate. But out of the cavern the\nGate of Renunciation leads again to the daylight of wisdom, by whose\nradiance a new insight, a new joy, a new tenderness, shine forth to\ngladden the pilgrim's heart.\nWhen, without the bitterness of impotent rebellion, we have learnt\nboth to resign ourselves to the outward rule of Fate and to recognise\nthat the non-human world is unworthy of our worship, it becomes\npossible at last so to transform and refashion the unconscious\nuniverse, so to transmute it in the crucible of imagination, that a\nnew image of shining gold replaces the old idol of clay. In all the\nmultiform facts of the world--in the visual shapes of trees and\nmountains and clouds, in the events of the life of man, even in the\nvery omnipotence of Death--the insight of creative idealism can find\nthe reflection of a beauty which its own thoughts first made. In this\nway mind asserts its subtle mastery over the thoughtless forces of\nNature. The more evil the material with which it deals, the more\nthwarting to untrained desire, the greater is its achievement in\ninducing the reluctant rock to yield up its hidden treasures, the\nprouder its victory in compelling the opposing forces to swell the\npageant of its triumph. Of all the arts, Tragedy is the proudest, the\nmost triumphant; for it builds its shining citadel in the very centre\nof the enemy's country, on the very summit of his highest mountain;\nfrom its impregnable watchtowers, his camps and arsenals, his columns\nand forts, are all revealed; within its walls the free life continues,\nwhile the legions of Death and Pain and Despair, and all the servile\ncaptains of tyrant Fate, afford the burghers of that dauntless city\nnew spectacles of beauty. Happy those sacred ramparts, thrice happy\nthe dwellers on that all-seeing eminence. Honour to those brave\nwarriors who, through countless ages of warfare, have preserved for us\nthe priceless heritage of liberty, and have kept undefiled by\nsacrilegious invaders the home of the unsubdued.\nBut the beauty of Tragedy does but make visible a quality which, in\nmore or less obvious shapes, is present always and everywhere in life.\nIn the spectacle of Death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and\nin the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an\noverpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the depth, the\ninexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange\nmarriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of\nsorrow. In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of\ntemporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care\nfor the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the\ncommon life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft\nillumined by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean\non whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night\nwithout, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness\nof humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual\nsoul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command,\nagainst the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its\nhopes and fears. Victory, in this struggle with the powers of\ndarkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the\ntrue initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence. From\nthat awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, renunciation,\nwisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins.\nTo take into the inmost shrine of the soul the irresistible forces\nwhose puppets we seem to be--Death and change, the irrevocableness of\nthe past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the\nuniverse from vanity to vanity--to feel these things and know them is\nto conquer them.\nThis is the reason why the Past has such magical power. The beauty of\nits motionless and silent pictures is like the enchanted purity of\nlate autumn, when the leaves, though one breath would make them fall,\nstill glow against the sky in golden glory. The Past does not change\nor strive; like Duncan, after life's fitful fever it sleeps well; what\nwas eager and grasping, what was petty and transitory, has faded away,\nthe things that were beautiful and eternal shine out of it like stars\nin the night. Its beauty, to a soul not worthy of it, is unendurable;\nbut to a soul which has conquered Fate it is the key of religion.\nThe life of Man, viewed outwardly, is but a small thing in comparison\nwith the forces of Nature. The slave is doomed to worship Time and\nFate and Death, because they are greater than anything he finds in\nhimself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour.\nBut, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their\npassionless splendour, is greater still. And such thought makes us\nfree men; we no longer bow before the inevitable in Oriental\nsubjection, but we absorb it, and make it a part of ourselves. To\nabandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of\ntemporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things--this is\nemancipation, and this is the free man's worship. And this liberation\nis effected by a contemplation of Fate; for Fate itself is subdued by\nthe mind which leaves nothing to be purged by the purifying fire of\nTime.\nUnited with his fellow-men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a\ncommon doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always,\nshedding over every daily task the light of love. The life of Man is a\nlong march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured\nby weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and\nwhere none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades\nvanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent\nDeath. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which\ntheir happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on\ntheir path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give\nthem the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing\ncourage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in\ngrudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of\ntheir need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses,\nthat make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are\nfellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with\nourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their\nevil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to\nfeel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was\nthe cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their\nhearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave\nwords in which high courage glowed.\nBrief and powerless is Man's life; on him and all his race the slow,\nsure doom falls pitiless and dark. Blind to good and evil, reckless of\ndestruction, omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way; for Man,\ncondemned to-day to lose his dearest, to-morrow himself to pass\nthrough the gate of darkness, it remains only to cherish, ere yet the\nblow falls, the lofty thoughts that ennoble his little day; disdaining\nthe coward terrors of the slave of Fate, to worship at the shrine that\nhis own hands have built; undismayed by the empire of chance, to\npreserve a mind free from the wanton tyranny that rules his outward\nlife; proudly defiant of the irresistible forces that tolerate, for a\nmoment, his knowledge and his condemnation, to sustain alone, a weary\nbut unyielding Atlas, the world that his own ideals have fashioned\ndespite the trampling march of unconscious power.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[9] Reprinted from the _Independent Review_, December, 1903.\nIV\nTHE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS\nIn regard to every form of human activity it is necessary that the\nquestion should be asked from time to time, What is its purpose and\nideal? In what way does it contribute to the beauty of human\nexistence? As respects those pursuits which contribute only remotely,\nby providing the mechanism of life, it is well to be reminded that not\nthe mere fact of living is to be desired, but the art of living in the\ncontemplation of great things. Still more in regard to those\navocations which have no end outside themselves, which are to be\njustified, if at all, as actually adding to the sum of the world's\npermanent possessions, it is necessary to keep alive a knowledge of\ntheir aims, a clear prefiguring vision of the temple in which creative\nimagination is to be embodied.\nThe fulfilment of this need, in what concerns the studies forming the\nmaterial upon which custom has decided to train the youthful mind, is\nindeed sadly remote--so remote as to make the mere statement of such a\nclaim appear preposterous. Great men, fully alive to the beauty of the\ncontemplations to whose service their lives are devoted, desiring that\nothers may share in their joys, persuade mankind to impart to the\nsuccessive generations the mechanical knowledge without which it is\nimpossible to cross the threshold. Dry pedants possess themselves of\nthe privilege of instilling this knowledge: they forget that it is to\nserve but as a key to open the doors of the temple; though they spend\ntheir lives on the steps leading up to those sacred doors, they turn\ntheir backs upon the temple so resolutely that its very existence is\nforgotten, and the eager youth, who would press forward to be\ninitiated to its domes and arches, is bidden to turn back and count\nthe steps.\nMathematics, perhaps more even than the study of Greece and Rome, has\nsuffered from this oblivion of its due place in civilisation. Although\ntradition has decreed that the great bulk of educated men shall know\nat least the elements of the subject, the reasons for which the\ntradition arose are forgotten, buried beneath a great rubbish-heap of\npedantries and trivialities. To those who inquire as to the purpose of\nmathematics, the usual answer will be that it facilitates the making\nof machines, the travelling from place to place, and the victory over\nforeign nations, whether in war or commerce. If it be objected that\nthese ends--all of which are of doubtful value--are not furthered by\nthe merely elementary study imposed upon those who do not become\nexpert mathematicians, the reply, it is true, will probably be that\nmathematics trains the reasoning faculties. Yet the very men who make\nthis reply are, for the most part, unwilling to abandon the teaching\nof definite fallacies, known to be such, and instinctively rejected by\nthe unsophisticated mind of every intelligent learner. And the\nreasoning faculty itself is generally conceived, by those who urge its\ncultivation, as merely a means for the avoidance of pitfalls and a\nhelp in the discovery of rules for the guidance of practical life. All\nthese are undeniably important achievements to the credit of\nmathematics; yet it is none of these that entitles mathematics to a\nplace in every liberal education. Plato, we know, regarded the\ncontemplation of mathematical truths as worthy of the Deity; and\nPlato realised, more perhaps than any other single man, what those\nelements are in human life which merit a place in heaven. There is in\nmathematics, he says, \"something which is _necessary_ and cannot be\nset aside ... and, if I mistake not, of divine necessity; for as to\nthe human necessities of which the Many talk in this connection,\nnothing can be more ridiculous than such an application of the words.\n_Cleinias._ And what are these necessities of knowledge, Stranger,\nwhich are divine and not human? _Athenian._ Those things without some\nuse or knowledge of which a man cannot become a God to the world, nor\na spirit, nor yet a hero, nor able earnestly to think and care for\nman\" (_Laws_, p. 818).[10] Such was Plato's judgment of mathematics;\nbut the mathematicians do not read Plato, while those who read him\nknow no mathematics, and regard his opinion upon this question as\nmerely a curious aberration.\nMathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme\nbeauty--a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without\nappeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous\ntrappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a\nstern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true\nspirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man,\nwhich is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in\nmathematics as surely as in poetry. What is best in mathematics\ndeserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to be assimilated as a\npart of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind\nwith ever-renewed encouragement. Real life is, to most men, a long\nsecond-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the\npossible; but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no\npractical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity embodying\nin splendid edifices the passionate aspiration after the perfect from\nwhich all great work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even\nfrom the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually\ncreated an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its\nnatural home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can\nescape from the dreary exile of the actual world.\nSo little, however, have mathematicians aimed at beauty, that hardly\nanything in their work has had this conscious purpose. Much, owing to\nirrepressible instincts, which were better than avowed beliefs, has\nbeen moulded by an unconscious taste; but much also has been spoilt by\nfalse notions of what was fitting. The characteristic excellence of\nmathematics is only to be found where the reasoning is rigidly\nlogical: the rules of logic are to mathematics what those of structure\nare to architecture. In the most beautiful work, a chain of argument\nis presented in which every link is important on its own account, in\nwhich there is an air of ease and lucidity throughout, and the\npremises achieve more than would have been thought possible, by means\nwhich appear natural and inevitable. Literature embodies what is\ngeneral in particular circumstances whose universal significance\nshines through their individual dress; but mathematics endeavours to\npresent whatever is most general in its purity, without any irrelevant\ntrappings.\nHow should the teaching of mathematics be conducted so as to\ncommunicate to the learner as much as possible of this high ideal?\nHere experience must, in a great measure, be our guide; but some\nmaxims may result from our consideration of the ultimate purpose to be\nachieved.\nOne of the chief ends served by mathematics, when rightly taught, is\nto awaken the learner's belief in reason, his confidence in the truth\nof what has been demonstrated, and in the value of demonstration. This\npurpose is not served by existing instruction; but it is easy to see\nways in which it might be served. At present, in what concerns\narithmetic, the boy or girl is given a set of rules, which present\nthemselves as neither true nor false, but as merely the will of the\nteacher, the way in which, for some unfathomable reason, the teacher\nprefers to have the game played. To some degree, in a study of such\ndefinite practical utility, this is no doubt unavoidable; but as soon\nas possible, the reasons of rules should be set forth by whatever\nmeans most readily appeal to the childish mind. In geometry, instead\nof the tedious apparatus of fallacious proofs for obvious truisms\nwhich constitutes the beginning of Euclid, the learner should be\nallowed at first to assume the truth of everything obvious, and should\nbe instructed in the demonstrations of theorems which are at once\nstartling and easily verifiable by actual drawing, such as those in\nwhich it is shown that three or more lines meet in a point. In this\nway belief is generated; it is seen that reasoning may lead to\nstartling conclusions, which nevertheless the facts will verify; and\nthus the instinctive distrust of whatever is abstract or rational is\ngradually overcome. Where theorems are difficult, they should be first\ntaught as exercises in geometrical drawing, until the figure has\nbecome thoroughly familiar; it will then be an agreeable advance to be\ntaught the logical connections of the various lines or circles that\noccur. It is desirable also that the figure illustrating a theorem\nshould be drawn in all possible cases and shapes, that so the abstract\nrelations with which geometry is concerned may of themselves emerge\nas the residue of similarity amid such great apparent diversity. In\nthis way the abstract demonstrations should form but a small part of\nthe instruction, and should be given when, by familiarity with\nconcrete illustrations, they have come to be felt as the natural\nembodiment of visible fact. In this early stage proofs should not be\ngiven with pedantic fullness; definitely fallacious methods, such as\nthat of superposition, should be rigidly excluded from the first, but\nwhere, without such methods, the proof would be very difficult, the\nresult should be rendered acceptable by arguments and illustrations\nwhich are explicitly contrasted with demonstrations.\nIn the beginning of algebra, even the most intelligent child finds, as\na rule, very great difficulty. The use of letters is a mystery, which\nseems to have no purpose except mystification. It is almost\nimpossible, at first, not to think that every letter stands for some\nparticular number, if only the teacher would reveal _what_ number it\nstands for. The fact is, that in algebra the mind is first taught to\nconsider general truths, truths which are not asserted to hold only of\nthis or that particular thing, but of any one of a whole group of\nthings. It is in the power of understanding and discovering such\ntruths that the mastery of the intellect over the whole world of\nthings actual and possible resides; and ability to deal with the\ngeneral as such is one of the gifts that a mathematical education\nshould bestow. But how little, as a rule, is the teacher of algebra\nable to explain the chasm which divides it from arithmetic, and how\nlittle is the learner assisted in his groping efforts at\ncomprehension! Usually the method that has been adopted in arithmetic\nis continued: rules are set forth, with no adequate explanation of\ntheir grounds; the pupil learns to use the rules blindly, and\npresently, when he is able to obtain the answer that the teacher\ndesires, he feels that he has mastered the difficulties of the\nsubject. But of inner comprehension of the processes employed he has\nprobably acquired almost nothing.\nWhen algebra has been learnt, all goes smoothly until we reach those\nstudies in which the notion of infinity is employed--the infinitesimal\ncalculus and the whole of higher mathematics. The solution of the\ndifficulties which formerly surrounded the mathematical infinite is\nprobably the greatest achievement of which our own age has to boast.\nSince the beginnings of Greek thought these difficulties have been\nknown; in every age the finest intellects have vainly endeavoured to\nanswer the apparently unanswerable questions that had been asked by\nZeno the Eleatic. At last Georg Cantor has found the answer, and has\nconquered for the intellect a new and vast province which had been\ngiven over to Chaos and old Night. It was assumed as self-evident,\nuntil Cantor and Dedekind established the opposite, that if, from any\ncollection of things, some were taken away, the number of things left\nmust always be less than the original number of things. This\nassumption, as a matter of fact, holds only of finite collections; and\nthe rejection of it, where the infinite is concerned, has been shown\nto remove all the difficulties that had hitherto baffled human reason\nin this matter, and to render possible the creation of an exact\nscience of the infinite. This stupendous fact ought to produce a\nrevolution in the higher teaching of mathematics; it has itself added\nimmeasurably to the educational value of the subject, and it has at\nlast given the means of treating with logical precision many studies\nwhich, until lately, were wrapped in fallacy and obscurity. By those\nwho were educated on the old lines, the new work is considered to be\nappallingly difficult, abstruse, and obscure; and it must be confessed\nthat the discoverer, as is so often the case, has hardly himself\nemerged from the mists which the light of his intellect is dispelling.\nBut inherently, the new doctrine of the infinite, to all candid and\ninquiring minds, has facilitated the mastery of higher mathematics;\nfor hitherto, it has been necessary to learn, by a long process of\nsophistication, to give assent to arguments which, on first\nacquaintance, were rightly judged to be confused and erroneous. So far\nfrom producing a fearless belief in reason, a bold rejection of\nwhatever failed to fulfil the strictest requirements of logic, a\nmathematical training, during the past two centuries, encouraged the\nbelief that many things, which a rigid inquiry would reject as\nfallacious, must yet be accepted because they work in what the\nmathematician calls \"practice.\" By this means, a timid, compromising\nspirit, or else a sacerdotal belief in mysteries not intelligible to\nthe profane, has been bred where reason alone should have ruled. All\nthis it is now time to sweep away; let those who wish to penetrate\ninto the arcana of mathematics be taught at once the true theory in\nall its logical purity, and in the concatenation established by the\nvery essence of the entities concerned.\nIf we are considering mathematics as an end in itself, and not as a\ntechnical training for engineers, it is very desirable to preserve the\npurity and strictness of its reasoning. Accordingly those who have\nattained a sufficient familiarity with its easier portions should be\nled backward from propositions to which they have assented as\nself-evident to more and more fundamental principles from which what\nhad previously appeared as premises can be deduced. They should be\ntaught--what the theory of infinity very aptly illustrates--that many\npropositions seem self-evident to the untrained mind which,\nnevertheless, a nearer scrutiny shows to be false. By this means they\nwill be led to a sceptical inquiry into first principles, an\nexamination of the foundations upon which the whole edifice of\nreasoning is built, or, to take perhaps a more fitting metaphor, the\ngreat trunk from which the spreading branches spring. At this stage,\nit is well to study afresh the elementary portions of mathematics,\nasking no longer merely whether a given proposition is true, but also\nhow it grows out of the central principles of logic. Questions of this\nnature can now be answered with a precision and certainty which were\nformerly quite impossible; and in the chains of reasoning that the\nanswer requires the unity of all mathematical studies at last unfolds\nitself.\nIn the great majority of mathematical text-books there is a total lack\nof unity in method and of systematic development of a central theme.\nPropositions of very diverse kinds are proved by whatever means are\nthought most easily intelligible, and much space is devoted to mere\ncuriosities which in no way contribute to the main argument. But in\nthe greatest works, unity and inevitability are felt as in the\nunfolding of a drama; in the premisses a subject is proposed for\nconsideration, and in every subsequent step some definite advance is\nmade towards mastery of its nature. The love of system, of\ninterconnection, which is perhaps the inmost essence of the\nintellectual impulse, can find free play in mathematics as nowhere\nelse. The learner who feels this impulse must not be repelled by an\narray of meaningless examples or distracted by amusing oddities, but\nmust be encouraged to dwell upon central principles, to become\nfamiliar with the structure of the various subjects which are put\nbefore him, to travel easily over the steps of the more important\ndeductions. In this way a good tone of mind is cultivated, and\nselective attention is taught to dwell by preference upon what is\nweighty and essential.\nWhen the separate studies into which mathematics is divided have each\nbeen viewed as a logical whole, as a natural growth from the\npropositions which constitute their principles, the learner will be\nable to understand the fundamental science which unifies and\nsystematises the whole of deductive reasoning. This is symbolic\nlogic--a study which, though it owes its inception to Aristotle, is\nyet, in its wider developments, a product, almost wholly, of the\nnineteenth century, and is indeed, in the present day, still growing\nwith great rapidity. The true method of discovery in symbolic logic,\nand probably also the best method for introducing the study to a\nlearner acquainted with other parts of mathematics, is the analysis of\nactual examples of deductive reasoning, with a view to the discovery\nof the principles employed. These principles, for the most part, are\nso embedded in our ratiocinative instincts, that they are employed\nquite unconsciously, and can be dragged to light only by much patient\neffort. But when at last they have been found, they are seen to be few\nin number, and to be the sole source of everything in pure\nmathematics. The discovery that all mathematics follows inevitably\nfrom a small collection of fundamental laws is one which immeasurably\nenhances the intellectual beauty of the whole; to those who have been\noppressed by the fragmentary and incomplete nature of most existing\nchains of deduction this discovery comes with all the overwhelming\nforce of a revelation; like a palace emerging from the autumn mist as\nthe traveller ascends an Italian hill-side, the stately storeys of the\nmathematical edifice appear in their due order and proportion, with a\nnew perfection in every part.\nUntil symbolic logic had acquired its present development, the\nprinciples upon which mathematics depends were always supposed to be\nphilosophical, and discoverable only by the uncertain, unprogressive\nmethods hitherto employed by philosophers. So long as this was\nthought, mathematics seemed to be not autonomous, but dependent upon a\nstudy which had quite other methods than its own. Moreover, since the\nnature of the postulates from which arithmetic, analysis, and geometry\nare to be deduced was wrapped in all the traditional obscurities of\nmetaphysical discussion, the edifice built upon such dubious\nfoundations began to be viewed as no better than a castle in the air.\nIn this respect, the discovery that the true principles are as much a\npart of mathematics as any of their consequences has very greatly\nincreased the intellectual satisfaction to be obtained. This\nsatisfaction ought not to be refused to learners capable of enjoying\nit, for it is of a kind to increase our respect for human powers and\nour knowledge of the beauties belonging to the abstract world.\nPhilosophers have commonly held that the laws of logic, which underlie\nmathematics, are laws of thought, laws regulating the operations of\nour minds. By this opinion the true dignity of reason is very greatly\nlowered: it ceases to be an investigation into the very heart and\nimmutable essence of all things actual and possible, becoming,\ninstead, an inquiry into something more or less human and subject to\nour limitations. The contemplation of what is non-human, the discovery\nthat our minds are capable of dealing with material not created by\nthem, above all, the realisation that beauty belongs to the outer\nworld as to the inner, are the chief means of overcoming the terrible\nsense of impotence, of weakness, of exile amid hostile powers, which\nis too apt to result from acknowledging the all-but omnipotence of\nalien forces. To reconcile us, by the exhibition of its awful beauty,\nto the reign of Fate--which is merely the literary personification of\nthese forces--is the task of tragedy. But mathematics takes us still\nfurther from what is human, into the region of absolute necessity, to\nwhich not only the actual world, but every possible world, must\nconform; and even here it builds a habitation, or rather finds a\nhabitation eternally standing, where our ideals are fully satisfied\nand our best hopes are not thwarted. It is only when we thoroughly\nunderstand the entire independence of ourselves, which belongs to this\nworld that reason finds, that we can adequately realise the profound\nimportance of its beauty.\nNot only is mathematics independent of us and our thoughts, but in\nanother sense we and the whole universe of existing things are\nindependent of mathematics. The apprehension of this purely ideal\ncharacter is indispensable, if we are to understand rightly the place\nof mathematics as one among the arts. It was formerly supposed that\npure reason could decide, in some respects, as to the nature of the\nactual world: geometry, at least, was thought to deal with the space\nin which we live. But we now know that pure mathematics can never\npronounce upon questions of actual existence: the world of reason, in\na sense, controls the world of fact, but it is not at any point\ncreative of fact, and in the application of its results to the world\nin time and space, its certainty and precision are lost among\napproximations and working hypotheses. The objects considered by\nmathematicians have, in the past, been mainly of a kind suggested by\nphenomena; but from such restrictions the abstract imagination should\nbe wholly free. A reciprocal liberty must thus be accorded: reason\ncannot dictate to the world of facts, but the facts cannot restrict\nreason's privilege of dealing with whatever objects its love of beauty\nmay cause to seem worthy of consideration. Here, as elsewhere, we\nbuild up our own ideals out of the fragments to be found in the world;\nand in the end it is hard to say whether the result is a creation or a\ndiscovery.\nIt is very desirable, in instruction, not merely to persuade the\nstudent of the accuracy of important theorems, but to persuade him in\nthe way which itself has, of all possible ways, the most beauty. The\ntrue interest of a demonstration is not, as traditional modes of\nexposition suggest, concentrated wholly in the result; where this does\noccur, it must be viewed as a defect, to be remedied, if possible, by\nso generalising the steps of the proof that each becomes important in\nand for itself. An argument which serves only to prove a conclusion is\nlike a story subordinated to some moral which it is meant to teach:\nfor \u00e6sthetic perfection no part of the whole should be merely a means.\nA certain practical spirit, a desire for rapid progress, for conquest\nof new realms, is responsible for the undue emphasis upon results\nwhich prevails in mathematical instruction. The better way is to\npropose some theme for consideration--in geometry, a figure having\nimportant properties; in analysis, a function of which the study is\nilluminating, and so on. Whenever proofs depend upon some only of the\nmarks by which we define the object to be studied, these marks should\nbe isolated and investigated on their own account. For it is a defect,\nin an argument, to employ more premisses than the conclusion demands:\nwhat mathematicians call elegance results from employing only the\nessential principles in virtue of which the thesis is true. It is a\nmerit in Euclid that he advances as far as he is able to go without\nemploying the axiom of parallels--not, as is often said, because this\naxiom is inherently objectionable, but because, in mathematics, every\nnew axiom diminishes the generality of the resulting theorems, and the\ngreatest possible generality is before all things to be sought.\nOf the effects of mathematics outside its own sphere more has been\nwritten than on the subject of its own proper ideal. The effect upon\nphilosophy has, in the past, been most notable, but most varied; in\nthe seventeenth century, idealism and rationalism, in the eighteenth,\nmaterialism and sensationalism, seemed equally its offspring. Of the\neffect which it is likely to have in the future it would be very rash\nto say much; but in one respect a good result appears probable.\nAgainst that kind of scepticism which abandons the pursuit of ideals\nbecause the road is arduous and the goal not certainly attainable,\nmathematics, within its own sphere, is a complete answer. Too often it\nis said that there is no absolute truth, but only opinion and private\njudgment; that each of us is conditioned, in his view of the world, by\nhis own peculiarities, his own taste and bias; that there is no\nexternal kingdom of truth to which, by patience and discipline, we may\nat last obtain admittance, but only truth for me, for you, for every\nseparate person. By this habit of mind one of the chief ends of human\neffort is denied, and the supreme virtue of candour, of fearless\nacknowledgment of what is, disappears from our moral vision. Of such\nscepticism mathematics is a perpetual reproof; for its edifice of\ntruths stands unshakable and inexpungable to all the weapons of\ndoubting cynicism.\nThe effects of mathematics upon practical life, though they should not\nbe regarded as the motive of our studies, may be used to answer a\ndoubt to which the solitary student must always be liable. In a world\nso full of evil and suffering, retirement into the cloister of\ncontemplation, to the enjoyment of delights which, however noble, must\nalways be for the few only, cannot but appear as a somewhat selfish\nrefusal to share the burden imposed upon others by accidents in which\njustice plays no part. Have any of us the right, we ask, to withdraw\nfrom present evils, to leave our fellow-men unaided, while we live a\nlife which, though arduous and austere, is yet plainly good in its own\nnature? When these questions arise, the true answer is, no doubt, that\nsome must keep alive the sacred fire, some must preserve, in every\ngeneration, the haunting vision which shadows forth the goal of so\nmuch striving. But when, as must sometimes occur, this answer seems\ntoo cold, when we are almost maddened by the spectacle of sorrows to\nwhich we bring no help, then we may reflect that indirectly the\nmathematician often does more for human happiness than any of his more\npractically active contemporaries. The history of science abundantly\nproves that a body of abstract propositions--even if, as in the case\nof conic sections, it remains two thousand years without effect upon\ndaily life--may yet, at any moment, be used to cause a revolution in\nthe habitual thoughts and occupations of every citizen. The use of\nsteam and electricity--to take striking instances--is rendered\npossible only by mathematics. In the results of abstract thought the\nworld possesses a capital of which the employment in enriching the\ncommon round has no hitherto discoverable limits. Nor does experience\ngive any means of deciding what parts of mathematics will be found\nuseful. Utility, therefore, can be only a consolation in moments of\ndiscouragement, not a guide in directing our studies.\nFor the health of the moral life, for ennobling the tone of an age or\na nation, the austerer virtues have a strange power, exceeding the\npower of those not informed and purified by thought. Of these austerer\nvirtues the love of truth is the chief, and in mathematics, more than\nelsewhere, the love of truth may find encouragement for waning faith.\nEvery great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of\ncreating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind; and this purpose should\nbe kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of\nmathematics.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[10] This passage was pointed out to me by Professor Gilbert Murray.\nV\nMATHEMATICS AND THE METAPHYSICIANS\nThe nineteenth century, which prided itself upon the invention of\nsteam and evolution, might have derived a more legitimate title to\nfame from the discovery of pure mathematics. This science, like most\nothers, was baptised long before it was born; and thus we find writers\nbefore the nineteenth century alluding to what they called pure\nmathematics. But if they had been asked what this subject was, they\nwould only have been able to say that it consisted of Arithmetic,\nAlgebra, Geometry, and so on. As to what these studies had in common,\nand as to what distinguished them from applied mathematics, our\nancestors were completely in the dark.\nPure mathematics was discovered by Boole, in a work which he called\nthe _Laws of Thought_ (1854). This work abounds in asseverations that\nit is not mathematical, the fact being that Boole was too modest to\nsuppose his book the first ever written on mathematics. He was also\nmistaken in supposing that he was dealing with the laws of thought:\nthe question how people actually think was quite irrelevant to him,\nand if his book had really contained the laws of thought, it was\ncurious that no one should ever have thought in such a way before. His\nbook was in fact concerned with formal logic, and this is the same\nthing as mathematics.\nPure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that,\nif such and such a proposition is true of _anything_, then such and\nsuch another proposition is true of that thing. It is essential not to\ndiscuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to\nmention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true. Both\nthese points would belong to applied mathematics. We start, in pure\nmathematics, from certain rules of inference, by which we can infer\nthat _if_ one proposition is true, then so is some other proposition.\nThese rules of inference constitute the major part of the principles\nof formal logic. We then take any hypothesis that seems amusing, and\ndeduce its consequences. _If_ our hypothesis is about _anything_, and\nnot about some one or more particular things, then our deductions\nconstitute mathematics. Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject\nin which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we\nare saying is true. People who have been puzzled by the beginnings of\nmathematics will, I hope, find comfort in this definition, and will\nprobably agree that it is accurate.\nAs one of the chief triumphs of modern mathematics consists in having\ndiscovered what mathematics really is, a few more words on this\nsubject may not be amiss. It is common to start any branch of\nmathematics--for instance, Geometry--with a certain number of\nprimitive ideas, supposed incapable of definition, and a certain\nnumber of primitive propositions or axioms, supposed incapable of\nproof. Now the fact is that, though there are indefinables and\nindemonstrables in every branch of applied mathematics, there are none\nin pure mathematics except such as belong to general logic. Logic,\nbroadly speaking, is distinguished by the fact that its propositions\ncan be put into a form in which they apply to anything whatever. All\npure mathematics--Arithmetic, Analysis, and Geometry--is built up by\ncombinations of the primitive ideas of logic, and its propositions are\ndeduced from the general axioms of logic, such as the syllogism and\nthe other rules of inference. And this is no longer a dream or an\naspiration. On the contrary, over the greater and more difficult part\nof the domain of mathematics, it has been already accomplished; in the\nfew remaining cases, there is no special difficulty, and it is now\nbeing rapidly achieved. Philosophers have disputed for ages whether\nsuch deduction was possible; mathematicians have sat down and made the\ndeduction. For the philosophers there is now nothing left but graceful\nacknowledgments.\nThe subject of formal logic, which has thus at last shown itself to be\nidentical with mathematics, was, as every one knows, invented by\nAristotle, and formed the chief study (other than theology) of the\nMiddle Ages. But Aristotle never got beyond the syllogism, which is a\nvery small part of the subject, and the schoolmen never got beyond\nAristotle. If any proof were required of our superiority to the\nmedi\u00e6val doctors, it might be found in this. Throughout the Middle\nAges, almost all the best intellects devoted themselves to formal\nlogic, whereas in the nineteenth century only an infinitesimal\nproportion of the world's thought went into this subject.\nNevertheless, in each decade since 1850 more has been done to advance\nthe subject than in the whole period from Aristotle to Leibniz. People\nhave discovered how to make reasoning symbolic, as it is in Algebra,\nso that deductions are effected by mathematical rules. They have\ndiscovered many rules besides the syllogism, and a new branch of\nlogic, called the Logic of Relatives,[11] has been invented to deal\nwith topics that wholly surpassed the powers of the old logic, though\nthey form the chief contents of mathematics.\nIt is not easy for the lay mind to realise the importance of symbolism\nin discussing the foundations of mathematics, and the explanation may\nperhaps seem strangely paradoxical. The fact is that symbolism is\nuseful because it makes things difficult. (This is not true of the\nadvanced parts of mathematics, but only of the beginnings.) What we\nwish to know is, what can be deduced from what. Now, in the\nbeginnings, everything is self-evident; and it is very hard to see\nwhether one self-evident proposition follows from another or not.\nObviousness is always the enemy to correctness. Hence we invent some\nnew and difficult symbolism, in which nothing seems obvious. Then we\nset up certain rules for operating on the symbols, and the whole thing\nbecomes mechanical. In this way we find out what must be taken as\npremiss and what can be demonstrated or defined. For instance, the\nwhole of Arithmetic and Algebra has been shown to require three\nindefinable notions and five indemonstrable propositions. But without\na symbolism it would have been very hard to find this out. It is so\nobvious that two and two are four, that we can hardly make ourselves\nsufficiently sceptical to doubt whether it can be proved. And the same\nholds in other cases where self-evident things are to be proved.\nBut the proof of self-evident propositions may seem, to the\nuninitiated, a somewhat frivolous occupation. To this we might reply\nthat it is often by no means self-evident that one obvious proposition\nfollows from another obvious proposition; so that we are really\ndiscovering new truths when we prove what is evident by a method which\nis not evident. But a more interesting retort is, that since people\nhave tried to prove obvious propositions, they have found that many of\nthem are false. Self-evidence is often a mere will-o'-the-wisp, which\nis sure to lead us astray if we take it as our guide. For instance,\nnothing is plainer than that a whole always has more terms than a\npart, or that a number is increased by adding one to it. But these\npropositions are now known to be usually false. Most numbers are\ninfinite, and if a number is infinite you may add ones to it as long\nas you like without disturbing it in the least. One of the merits of a\nproof is that it instils a certain doubt as to the result proved; and\nwhen what is obvious can be proved in some cases, but not in others,\nit becomes possible to suppose that in these other cases it is false.\nThe great master of the art of formal reasoning, among the men of our\nown day, is an Italian, Professor Peano, of the University of\nTurin.[12] He has reduced the greater part of mathematics (and he or\nhis followers will, in time, have reduced the whole) to strict\nsymbolic form, in which there are no words at all. In the ordinary\nmathematical books, there are no doubt fewer words than most readers\nwould wish. Still, little phrases occur, such as _therefore, let us\nassume, consider_, or _hence it follows_. All these, however, are a\nconcession, and are swept away by Professor Peano. For instance, if we\nwish to learn the whole of Arithmetic, Algebra, the Calculus, and\nindeed all that is usually called pure mathematics (except Geometry),\nwe must start with a dictionary of three words. One symbol stands for\n_zero_, another for _number_, and a third for _next after_. What these\nideas mean, it is necessary to know if you wish to become an\narithmetician. But after symbols have been invented for these three\nideas, not another word is required in the whole development. All\nfuture symbols are symbolically explained by means of these three.\nEven these three can be explained by means of the notions of\n_relation_ and _class_; but this requires the Logic of Relations,\nwhich Professor Peano has never taken up. It must be admitted that\nwhat a mathematician has to know to begin with is not much. There are\nat most a dozen notions out of which all the notions in all pure\nmathematics (including Geometry) are compounded. Professor Peano, who\nis assisted by a very able school of young Italian disciples, has\nshown how this may be done; and although the method which he has\ninvented is capable of being carried a good deal further than he has\ncarried it, the honour of the pioneer must belong to him.\nTwo hundred years ago, Leibniz foresaw the science which Peano has\nperfected, and endeavoured to create it. He was prevented from\nsucceeding by respect for the authority of Aristotle, whom he could\nnot believe guilty of definite, formal fallacies; but the subject\nwhich he desired to create now exists, in spite of the patronising\ncontempt with which his schemes have been treated by all superior\npersons. From this \"Universal Characteristic,\" as he called it, he\nhoped for a solution of all problems, and an end to all disputes. \"If\ncontroversies were to arise,\" he says, \"there would be no more need of\ndisputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For\nit would suffice to take their pens in their hands, to sit down to\ntheir desks, and to say to each other (with a friend as witness, if\nthey liked), 'Let us calculate.'\" This optimism has now appeared to be\nsomewhat excessive; there still are problems whose solution is\ndoubtful, and disputes which calculation cannot decide. But over an\nenormous field of what was formerly controversial, Leibniz's dream has\nbecome sober fact. In the whole philosophy of mathematics, which used\nto be at least as full of doubt as any other part of philosophy, order\nand certainty have replaced the confusion and hesitation which\nformerly reigned. Philosophers, of course, have not yet discovered\nthis fact, and continue to write on such subjects in the old way. But\nmathematicians, at least in Italy, have now the power of treating the\nprinciples of mathematics in an exact and masterly manner, by means of\nwhich the certainty of mathematics extends also to mathematical\nphilosophy. Hence many of the topics which used to be placed among the\ngreat mysteries--for example, the natures of infinity, of continuity,\nof space, time and motion--are now no longer in any degree open to\ndoubt or discussion. Those who wish to know the nature of these things\nneed only read the works of such men as Peano or Georg Cantor; they\nwill there find exact and indubitable expositions of all these quondam\nmysteries.\nIn this capricious world, nothing is more capricious than posthumous\nfame. One of the most notable examples of posterity's lack of judgment\nis the Eleatic Zeno. This man, who may be regarded as the founder of\nthe philosophy of infinity, appears in Plato's Parmenides in the\nprivileged position of instructor to Socrates. He invented four\narguments, all immeasurably subtle and profound, to prove that motion\nis impossible, that Achilles can never overtake the tortoise, and that\nan arrow in flight is really at rest. After being refuted by\nAristotle, and by every subsequent philosopher from that day to our\nown, these arguments were reinstated, and made the basis of a\nmathematical renaissance, by a German professor, who probably never\ndreamed of any connection between himself and Zeno. Weierstrass,[13]\nby strictly banishing from mathematics the use of infinitesimals, has\nat last shown that we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow\nin its flight is truly at rest. Zeno's only error lay in inferring (if\nhe did infer) that, because there is no such thing as a state of\nchange, therefore the world is in the same state at any one time as at\nany other. This is a consequence which by no means follows; and in\nthis respect, the German mathematician is more constructive than the\ningenious Greek. Weierstrass has been able, by embodying his views in\nmathematics, where familiarity with truth eliminates the vulgar\nprejudices of common sense, to invest Zeno's paradoxes with the\nrespectable air of platitudes; and if the result is less delightful to\nthe lover of reason than Zeno's bold defiance, it is at any rate more\ncalculated to appease the mass of academic mankind.\nZeno was concerned, as a matter of fact, with three problems, each\npresented by motion, but each more abstract than motion, and capable\nof a purely arithmetical treatment. These are the problems of the\ninfinitesimal, the infinite, and continuity. To state clearly the\ndifficulties involved, was to accomplish perhaps the hardest part of\nthe philosopher's task. This was done by Zeno. From him to our own\nday, the finest intellects of each generation in turn attacked the\nproblems, but achieved, broadly speaking, nothing. In our own time,\nhowever, three men--Weierstrass, Dedekind, and Cantor--have not merely\nadvanced the three problems, but have completely solved them. The\nsolutions, for those acquainted with mathematics, are so clear as to\nleave no longer the slightest doubt or difficulty. This achievement is\nprobably the greatest of which our age has to boast; and I know of no\nage (except perhaps the golden age of Greece) which has a more\nconvincing proof to offer of the transcendent genius of its great men.\nOf the three problems, that of the infinitesimal was solved by\nWeierstrass; the solution of the other two was begun by Dedekind, and\ndefinitively accomplished by Cantor.\nThe infinitesimal played formerly a great part in mathematics. It was\nintroduced by the Greeks, who regarded a circle as differing\ninfinitesimally from a polygon with a very large number of very small\nequal sides. It gradually grew in importance, until, when Leibniz\ninvented the Infinitesimal Calculus, it seemed to become the\nfundamental notion of all higher mathematics. Carlyle tells, in his\n_Frederick the Great_, how Leibniz used to discourse to Queen Sophia\nCharlotte of Prussia concerning the infinitely little, and how she\nwould reply that on that subject she needed no instruction--the\nbehaviour of courtiers had made her thoroughly familiar with it. But\nphilosophers and mathematicians--who for the most part had less\nacquaintance with courts--continued to discuss this topic, though\nwithout making any advance. The Calculus required continuity, and\ncontinuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody\ncould discover what the infinitely little might be. It was plainly not\nquite zero, because a sufficiently large number of infinitesimals,\nadded together, were seen to make up a finite whole. But nobody could\npoint out any fraction which was not zero, and yet not finite. Thus\nthere was a deadlock. But at last Weierstrass discovered that the\ninfinitesimal was not needed at all, and that everything could be\naccomplished without it. Thus there was no longer any need to suppose\nthat there was such a thing. Nowadays, therefore, mathematicians are\nmore dignified than Leibniz: instead of talking about the infinitely\nsmall, they talk about the infinitely great--a subject which, however\nappropriate to monarchs, seems, unfortunately, to interest them even\nless than the infinitely little interested the monarchs to whom\nLeibniz discoursed.\nThe banishment of the infinitesimal has all sorts of odd consequences,\nto which one has to become gradually accustomed. For example, there is\nno such thing as the next moment. The interval between one moment and\nthe next would have to be infinitesimal, since, if we take two moments\nwith a finite interval between them, there are always other moments in\nthe interval. Thus if there are to be no infinitesimals, no two\nmoments are quite consecutive, but there are always other moments\nbetween any two. Hence there must be an infinite number of moments\nbetween any two; because if there were a finite number one would be\nnearest the first of the two moments, and therefore next to it. This\nmight be thought to be a difficulty; but, as a matter of fact, it is\nhere that the philosophy of the infinite comes in, and makes all\nstraight.\nThe same sort of thing happens in space. If any piece of matter be cut\nin two, and then each part be halved, and so on, the bits will become\nsmaller and smaller, and can theoretically be made as small as we\nplease. However small they may be, they can still be cut up and made\nsmaller still. But they will always have _some_ finite size, however\nsmall they may be. We never reach the infinitesimal in this way, and\nno finite number of divisions will bring us to points. Nevertheless\nthere _are_ points, only these are not to be reached by successive\ndivisions. Here again, the philosophy of the infinite shows us how\nthis is possible, and why points are not infinitesimal lengths.\nAs regards motion and change, we get similarly curious results. People\nused to think that when a thing changes, it must be in a state of\nchange, and that when a thing moves, it is in a state of motion. This\nis now known to be a mistake. When a body moves, all that can be said\nis that it is in one place at one time and in another at another. We\nmust not say that it will be in a neighbouring place at the next\ninstant, since there is no next instant. Philosophers often tell us\nthat when a body is in motion, it changes its position within the\ninstant. To this view Zeno long ago made the fatal retort that every\nbody always is where it is; but a retort so simple and brief was not\nof the kind to which philosophers are accustomed to give weight, and\nthey have continued down to our own day to repeat the same phrases\nwhich roused the Eleatic's destructive ardour. It was only recently\nthat it became possible to explain motion in detail in accordance with\nZeno's platitude, and in opposition to the philosopher's paradox. We\nmay now at last indulge the comfortable belief that a body in motion\nis just as truly where it is as a body at rest. Motion consists merely\nin the fact that bodies are sometimes in one place and sometimes in\nanother, and that they are at intermediate places at intermediate\ntimes. Only those who have waded through the quagmire of philosophic\nspeculation on this subject can realise what a liberation from antique\nprejudices is involved in this simple and straightforward commonplace.\nThe philosophy of the infinitesimal, as we have just seen, is mainly\nnegative. People used to believe in it, and now they have found out\ntheir mistake. The philosophy of the infinite, on the other hand, is\nwholly positive. It was formerly supposed that infinite numbers, and\nthe mathematical infinite generally, were self-contradictory. But as\nit was obvious that there were infinities--for example, the number of\nnumbers--the contradictions of infinity seemed unavoidable, and\nphilosophy seemed to have wandered into a \"cul-de-sac.\" This\ndifficulty led to Kant's antinomies, and hence, more or less\nindirectly, to much of Hegel's dialectic method. Almost all current\nphilosophy is upset by the fact (of which very few philosophers are as\nyet aware) that all the ancient and respectable contradictions in the\nnotion of the infinite have been once for all disposed of. The method\nby which this has been done is most interesting and instructive. In\nthe first place, though people had talked glibly about infinity ever\nsince the beginnings of Greek thought, nobody had ever thought of\nasking, What is infinity? If any philosopher had been asked for a\ndefinition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible\nrigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a\ndefinition that had any meaning at all. Twenty years ago, roughly\nspeaking, Dedekind and Cantor asked this question, and, what is more\nremarkable, they answered it. They found, that is to say, a perfectly\nprecise definition of an infinite number or an infinite collection of\nthings. This was the first and perhaps the greatest step. It then\nremained to examine the supposed contradictions in this notion. Here\nCantor proceeded in the only proper way. He took pairs of\ncontradictory propositions, in which both sides of the contradiction\nwould be usually regarded as demonstrable, and he strictly examined\nthe supposed proofs. He found that all proofs adverse to infinity\ninvolved a certain principle, at first sight obviously true, but\ndestructive, in its consequences, of almost all mathematics. The\nproofs favourable to infinity, on the other hand, involved no\nprinciple that had evil consequences. It thus appeared that common\nsense had allowed itself to be taken in by a specious maxim, and that,\nwhen once this maxim was rejected, all went well.\nThe maxim in question is, that if one collection is part of another,\nthe one which is a part has fewer terms than the one of which it is a\npart. This maxim is true of finite numbers. For example, Englishmen\nare only some among Europeans, and there are fewer Englishmen than\nEuropeans. But when we come to infinite numbers, this is no longer\ntrue. This breakdown of the maxim gives us the precise definition of\ninfinity. A collection of terms is infinite when it contains as parts\nother collections which have just as many terms as it has. If you can\ntake away some of the terms of a collection, without diminishing the\nnumber of terms, then there are an infinite number of terms in the\ncollection. For example, there are just as many even numbers as there\nare numbers altogether, since every number can be doubled. This may be\nseen by putting odd and even numbers together in one row, and even\nnumbers alone in a row below:--\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _ad infinitum_.\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, _ad infinitum_.\nThere are obviously just as many numbers in the row below as in the\nrow above, because there is one below for each one above. This\nproperty, which was formerly thought to be a contradiction, is now\ntransformed into a harmless definition of infinity, and shows, in the\nabove case, that the number of finite numbers is infinite.\nBut the uninitiated may wonder how it is possible to deal with a\nnumber which cannot be counted. It is impossible to count up _all_ the\nnumbers, one by one, because, however many we may count, there are\nalways more to follow. The fact is that counting is a very vulgar and\nelementary way of finding out how many terms there are in a\ncollection. And in any case, counting gives us what mathematicians\ncall the _ordinal_ number of our terms; that is to say, it arranges\nour terms in an order or series, and its result tells us what type of\nseries results from this arrangement. In other words, it is impossible\nto count things without counting some first and others afterwards, so\nthat counting always has to do with order. Now when there are only a\nfinite number of terms, we can count them in any order we like; but\nwhen there are an infinite number, what corresponds to counting will\ngive us quite different results according to the way in which we carry\nout the operation. Thus the ordinal number, which results from what,\nin a general sense may be called counting, depends not only upon how\nmany terms we have, but also (where the number of terms is infinite)\nupon the way in which the terms are arranged.\nThe fundamental infinite numbers are not ordinal, but are what is\ncalled _cardinal_. They are not obtained by putting our terms in order\nand counting them, but by a different method, which tells us, to begin\nwith, whether two collections have the same number of terms, or, if\nnot, which is the greater.[14] It does not tell us, in the way in\nwhich counting does, _what_ number of terms a collection has; but if\nwe define a number as the number of terms in such and such a\ncollection, then this method enables us to discover whether some other\ncollection that may be mentioned has more or fewer terms. An\nillustration will show how this is done. If there existed some country\nin which, for one reason or another, it was impossible to take a\ncensus, but in which it was known that every man had a wife and every\nwoman a husband, then (provided polygamy was not a national\ninstitution) we should know, without counting, that there were exactly\nas many men as there were women in that country, neither more nor\nless. This method can be applied generally. If there is some relation\nwhich, like marriage, connects the things in one collection each with\none of the things in another collection, and vice versa, then the two\ncollections have the same number of terms. This was the way in which\nwe found that there are as many even numbers as there are numbers.\nEvery number can be doubled, and every even number can be halved, and\neach process gives just one number corresponding to the one that is\ndoubled or halved. And in this way we can find any number of\ncollections each of which has just as many terms as there are finite\nnumbers. If every term of a collection can be hooked on to a number,\nand all the finite numbers are used once, and only once, in the\nprocess, then our collection must have just as many terms as there are\nfinite numbers. This is the general method by which the numbers of\ninfinite collections are defined.\nBut it must not be supposed that all infinite numbers are equal. On\nthe contrary, there are infinitely more infinite numbers than finite\nones. There are more ways of arranging the finite numbers in different\ntypes of series than there are finite numbers. There are probably more\npoints in space and more moments in time than there are finite\nnumbers. There are exactly as many fractions as whole numbers,\nalthough there are an infinite number of fractions between any two\nwhole numbers. But there are more irrational numbers than there are\nwhole numbers or fractions. There are probably exactly as many points\nin space as there are irrational numbers, and exactly as many points\non a line a millionth of an inch long as in the whole of infinite\nspace. There is a greatest of all infinite numbers, which is the\nnumber of things altogether, of every sort and kind. It is obvious\nthat there cannot be a greater number than this, because, if\neverything has been taken, there is nothing left to add. Cantor has a\nproof that there is no greatest number, and if this proof were valid,\nthe contradictions of infinity would reappear in a sublimated form.\nBut in this one point, the master has been guilty of a very subtle\nfallacy, which I hope to explain in some future work.[15]\nWe can now understand why Zeno believed that Achilles cannot overtake\nthe tortoise and why as a matter of fact he can overtake it. We shall\nsee that all the people who disagreed with Zeno had no right to do so,\nbecause they all accepted premises from which his conclusion followed.\nThe argument is this: Let Achilles and the tortoise start along a road\nat the same time, the tortoise (as is only fair) being allowed a\nhandicap. Let Achilles go twice as fast as the tortoise, or ten times\nor a hundred times as fast. Then he will never reach the tortoise. For\nat every moment the tortoise is somewhere and Achilles is somewhere;\nand neither is ever twice in the same place while the race is going\non. Thus the tortoise goes to just as many places as Achilles does,\nbecause each is in one place at one moment, and in another at any\nother moment. But if Achilles were to catch up with the tortoise, the\nplaces where the tortoise would have been would be only part of the\nplaces where Achilles would have been. Here, we must suppose, Zeno\nappealed to the maxim that the whole has more terms than the part.[16]\nThus if Achilles were to overtake the tortoise, he would have been in\nmore places than the tortoise; but we saw that he must, in any period,\nbe in exactly as many places as the tortoise. Hence we infer that he\ncan never catch the tortoise. This argument is strictly correct, if we\nallow the axiom that the whole has more terms than the part. As the\nconclusion is absurd, the axiom must be rejected, and then all goes\nwell. But there is no good word to be said for the philosophers of the\npast two thousand years and more, who have all allowed the axiom and\ndenied the conclusion.\nThe retention of this axiom leads to absolute contradictions, while\nits rejection leads only to oddities. Some of these oddities, it must\nbe confessed, are very odd. One of them, which I call the paradox of\nTristram Shandy, is the converse of the Achilles, and shows that the\ntortoise, if you give him time, will go just as far as Achilles.\nTristram Shandy, as we know, employed two years in chronicling the\nfirst two days of his life, and lamented that, at this rate, material\nwould accumulate faster than he could deal with it, so that, as years\nwent by, he would be farther and farther from the end of his history.\nNow I maintain that, if he had lived for ever, and had not wearied of\nhis task, then, even if his life had continued as event fully as it\nbegan, no part of his biography would have remained unwritten. For\nconsider: the hundredth day will be described in the hundredth year,\nthe thousandth in the thousandth year, and so on. Whatever day we may\nchoose as so far on that he cannot hope to reach it, that day will be\ndescribed in the corresponding year. Thus any day that may be\nmentioned will be written up sooner or later, and therefore no part of\nthe biography will remain permanently unwritten. This paradoxical but\nperfectly true proposition depends upon the fact that the number of\ndays in all time is no greater than the number of years.\nThus on the subject of infinity it is impossible to avoid conclusions\nwhich at first sight appear paradoxical, and this is the reason why so\nmany philosophers have supposed that there were inherent\ncontradictions in the infinite. But a little practice enables one to\ngrasp the true principles of Cantor's doctrine, and to acquire new and\nbetter instincts as to the true and the false. The oddities then\nbecome no odder than the people at the antipodes, who used to be\nthought impossible because they would find it so inconvenient to stand\non their heads.\nThe solution of the problems concerning infinity has enabled Cantor to\nsolve also the problems of continuity. Of this, as of infinity, he has\ngiven a perfectly precise definition, and has shown that there are no\ncontradictions in the notion so defined. But this subject is so\ntechnical that it is impossible to give any account of it here.\nThe notion of continuity depends upon that of _order_, since\ncontinuity is merely a particular type of order. Mathematics has, in\nmodern times, brought order into greater and greater prominence. In\nformer days, it was supposed (and philosophers are still apt to\nsuppose) that quantity was the fundamental notion of mathematics. But\nnowadays, quantity is banished altogether, except from one little\ncorner of Geometry, while order more and more reigns supreme. The\ninvestigation of different kinds of series and their relations is now\na very large part of mathematics, and it has been found that this\ninvestigation can be conducted without any reference to quantity, and,\nfor the most part, without any reference to number. All types of\nseries are capable of formal definition, and their properties can be\ndeduced from the principles of symbolic logic by means of the Algebra\nof Relatives. The notion of a limit, which is fundamental in the\ngreater part of higher mathematics, used to be defined by means of\nquantity, as a term to which the terms of some series approximate as\nnearly as we please. But nowadays the limit is defined quite\ndifferently, and the series which it limits may not approximate to it\nat all. This improvement also is due to Cantor, and it is one which\nhas revolutionised mathematics. Only order is now relevant to limits.\nThus, for instance, the smallest of the infinite integers is the limit\nof the finite integers, though all finite integers are at an infinite\ndistance from it. The study of different types of series is a general\nsubject of which the study of ordinal numbers (mentioned above) is a\nspecial and very interesting branch. But the unavoidable\ntechnicalities of this subject render it impossible to explain to any\nbut professed mathematicians.\nGeometry, like Arithmetic, has been subsumed, in recent times, under\nthe general study of order. It was formerly supposed that Geometry was\nthe study of the nature of the space in which we live, and accordingly\nit was urged, by those who held that what exists can only be known\nempirically, that Geometry should really be regarded as belonging to\napplied mathematics. But it has gradually appeared, by the increase of\nnon-Euclidean systems, that Geometry throws no more light upon the\nnature of space than Arithmetic throws upon the population of the\nUnited States. Geometry is a whole collection of deductive sciences\nbased on a corresponding collection of sets of axioms. One set of\naxioms is Euclid's; other equally good sets of axioms lead to other\nresults. Whether Euclid's axioms are true, is a question as to which\nthe pure mathematician is indifferent; and, what is more, it is a\nquestion which it is theoretically impossible to answer with certainty\nin the affirmative. It might possibly be shown, by very careful\nmeasurements, that Euclid's axioms are false; but no measurements\ncould ever assure us (owing to the errors of observation) that they\nare exactly true. Thus the geometer leaves to the man of science to\ndecide, as best he may, what axioms are most nearly true in the actual\nworld. The geometer takes any set of axioms that seem interesting, and\ndeduces their consequences. What defines Geometry, in this sense, is\nthat the axioms must give rise to a series of more than one dimension.\nAnd it is thus that Geometry becomes a department in the study of\norder.\nIn Geometry, as in other parts of mathematics, Peano and his disciples\nhave done work of the very greatest merit as regards principles.\nFormerly, it was held by philosophers and mathematicians alike that\nthe proofs in Geometry depended on the figure; nowadays, this is known\nto be false. In the best books there are no figures at all. The\nreasoning proceeds by the strict rules of formal logic from a set of\naxioms laid down to begin with. If a figure is used, all sorts of\nthings seem obviously to follow, which no formal reasoning can prove\nfrom the explicit axioms, and which, as a matter of fact, are only\naccepted because they are obvious. By banishing the figure, it becomes\npossible to discover _all_ the axioms that are needed; and in this way\nall sorts of possibilities, which would have otherwise remained\nundetected, are brought to light.\nOne great advance, from the point of view of correctness, has been\nmade by introducing points as they are required, and not starting, as\nwas formerly done, by assuming the whole of space. This method is due\npartly to Peano, partly to another Italian named Fano. To those\nunaccustomed to it, it has an air of somewhat wilful pedantry. In this\nway, we begin with the following axioms: (1) There is a class of\nentities called _points_. (2) There is at least one point. (3) If _a_\nbe a point, there is at least one other point besides _a_. Then we\nbring in the straight line joining two points, and begin again with\n(4), namely, on the straight line joining _a_ and _b_, there is at\nleast one other point besides _a_ and _b_. (5) There is at least one\npoint not on the line _ab_. And so we go on, till we have the means of\nobtaining as many points as we require. But the word _space_, as Peano\nhumorously remarks, is one for which Geometry has no use at all.\nThe rigid methods employed by modern geometers have deposed Euclid\nfrom his pinnacle of correctness. It was thought, until recent times,\nthat, as Sir Henry Savile remarked in 1621, there were only two\nblemishes in Euclid, the theory of parallels and the theory of\nproportion. It is now known that these are almost the only points in\nwhich Euclid is free from blemish. Countless errors are involved in\nhis first eight propositions. That is to say, not only is it doubtful\nwhether his axioms are true, which is a comparatively trivial matter,\nbut it is certain that his propositions do not follow from the axioms\nwhich he enunciates. A vastly greater number of axioms, which Euclid\nunconsciously employs, are required for the proof of his propositions.\nEven in the first proposition of all, where he constructs an\nequilateral triangle on a given base, he uses two circles which are\nassumed to intersect. But no explicit axiom assures us that they do\nso, and in some kinds of spaces they do not always intersect. It is\nquite doubtful whether our space belongs to one of these kinds or not.\nThus Euclid fails entirely to prove his point in the very first\nproposition. As he is certainly not an easy author, and is terribly\nlong-winded, he has no longer any but an historical interest. Under\nthese circumstances, it is nothing less than a scandal that he should\nstill be taught to boys in England.[17] A book should have either\nintelligibility or correctness; to combine the two is impossible, but\nto lack both is to be unworthy of such a place as Euclid has occupied\nin education.\nThe most remarkable result of modern methods in mathematics is the\nimportance of symbolic logic and of rigid formalism. Mathematicians,\nunder the influence of Weierstrass, have shown in modern times a care\nfor accuracy, and an aversion to slipshod reasoning, such as had not\nbeen known among them previously since the time of the Greeks. The\ngreat inventions of the seventeenth century--Analytical Geometry and\nthe Infinitesimal Calculus--were so fruitful in new results that\nmathematicians had neither time nor inclination to examine their\nfoundations. Philosophers, who should have taken up the task, had too\nlittle mathematical ability to invent the new branches of mathematics\nwhich have now been found necessary for any adequate discussion. Thus\nmathematicians were only awakened from their \"dogmatic slumbers\" when\nWeierstrass and his followers showed that many of their most cherished\npropositions are in general false. Macaulay, contrasting the certainty\nof mathematics with the uncertainty of philosophy, asks who ever heard\nof a reaction against Taylor's theorem? If he had lived now, he\nhimself might have heard of such a reaction, for this is precisely one\nof the theorems which modern investigations have overthrown. Such rude\nshocks to mathematical faith have produced that love of formalism\nwhich appears, to those who are ignorant of its motive, to be mere\noutrageous pedantry.\nThe proof that all pure mathematics, including Geometry, is nothing\nbut formal logic, is a fatal blow to the Kantian philosophy. Kant,\nrightly perceiving that Euclid's propositions could not be deduced\nfrom Euclid's axioms without the help of the figures, invented a\ntheory of knowledge to account for this fact; and it accounted so\nsuccessfully that, when the fact is shown to be a mere defect in\nEuclid, and not a result of the nature of geometrical reasoning,\nKant's theory also has to be abandoned. The whole doctrine of _a\npriori_ intuitions, by which Kant explained the possibility of pure\nmathematics, is wholly inapplicable to mathematics in its present\nform. The Aristotelian doctrines of the schoolmen come nearer in\nspirit to the doctrines which modern mathematics inspire; but the\nschoolmen were hampered by the fact that their formal logic was very\ndefective, and that the philosophical logic based upon the syllogism\nshowed a corresponding narrowness. What is now required is to give the\ngreatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the\nfull the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure\nbasis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the\nexactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. If this can\nbe successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the\nnear future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the\nimmediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. Great\ntriumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our\ngeneration, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a\nlevel with the greatest age of Greece.[18]\nFOOTNOTES:\n[11] This subject is due in the main to Mr. C.S.

[Note added in 1917.]\nVI\nON SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY\nWhen we try to ascertain the motives which have led men to the\ninvestigation of philosophical questions, we find that, broadly\nspeaking, they can be divided into two groups, often antagonistic, and\nleading to very divergent systems. These two groups of motives are, on\nthe one hand, those derived from religion and ethics, and, on the\nother hand, those derived from science. Plato, Spinoza, and Hegel may\nbe taken as typical of the philosophers whose interests are mainly\nreligious and ethical, while Leibniz, Locke, and Hume may be taken as\nrepresentatives of the scientific wing. In Aristotle, Descartes,\nBerkeley, and Kant we find both groups of motives strongly present.\nHerbert Spencer, in whose honour we are assembled to-day, would\nnaturally be classed among scientific philosophers: it was mainly from\nscience that he drew his data, his formulation of problems, and his\nconception of method. But his strong religious sense is obvious in\nmuch of his writing, and his ethical pre-occupations are what make him\nvalue the conception of evolution--that conception in which, as a\nwhole generation has believed, science and morals are to be united in\nfruitful and indissoluble marriage.\nIt is my belief that the ethical and religious motives in spite of\nthe splendidly imaginative systems to which they have given rise, have\nbeen on the whole a hindrance to the progress of philosophy, and ought\nnow to be consciously thrust aside by those who wish to discover\nphilosophical truth. Science, originally, was entangled in similar\nmotives, and was thereby hindered in its advances. It is, I maintain,\nfrom science, rather than from ethics and religion, that philosophy\nshould draw its inspiration.\nBut there are two different ways in which a philosophy may seek to\nbase itself upon science. It may emphasise the most general _results_\nof science, and seek to give even greater generality and unity to\nthese results. Or it may study the _methods_ of science, and seek to\napply these methods, with the necessary adaptations, to its own\npeculiar province. Much philosophy inspired by science has gone astray\nthrough preoccupation with the _results_ momentarily supposed to have\nbeen achieved. It is not results, but _methods_ that can be\ntransferred with profit from the sphere of the special sciences to the\nsphere of philosophy. What I wish to bring to your notice is the\npossibility and importance of applying to philosophical problems\ncertain broad principles of method which have been found successful in\nthe study of scientific questions.\nThe opposition between a philosophy guided by scientific method and a\nphilosophy dominated by religious and ethical ideas may be illustrated\nby two notions which are very prevalent in the works of philosophers,\nnamely the notion of _the universe_, and the notion of _good and\nevil_. A philosopher is expected to tell us something about the nature\nof the universe as a whole, and to give grounds for either optimism or\npessimism. Both these expectations seem to me mistaken. I believe the\nconception of \"the universe\" to be, as its etymology indicates, a\nmere relic of pre-Copernican astronomy: and I believe the question of\noptimism and pessimism to be one which the philosopher will regard as\noutside his scope, except, possibly, to the extent of maintaining that\nit is insoluble.\nIn the days before Copernicus, the conception of the \"universe\" was\ndefensible on scientific grounds: the diurnal revolution of the\nheavenly bodies bound them together as all parts of one system, of\nwhich the earth was the centre. Round this apparent scientific fact,\nmany human desires rallied: the wish to believe Man important in the\nscheme of things, the theoretical desire for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the Whole, the hope that the course of nature might\nbe guided by some sympathy with our wishes. In this way, an ethically\ninspired system of metaphysics grew up, whose anthropocentrism was\napparently warranted by the geocentrism of astronomy. When Copernicus\nswept away the astronomical basis of this system of thought, it had\ngrown so familiar, and had associated itself so intimately with men's\naspirations, that it survived with scarcely diminished force--survived\neven Kant's \"Copernican revolution,\" and is still now the unconscious\npremiss of most metaphysical systems.\nThe oneness of the world is an almost undiscussed postulate of most\nmetaphysics. \"Reality is not merely one and self-consistent, but is a\nsystem of reciprocally determinate parts\"[19]--such a statement would\npass almost unnoticed as a mere truism. Yet I believe that it embodies\na failure to effect thoroughly the \"Copernican revolution,\" and that\nthe apparent oneness of the world is merely the oneness of what is\nseen by a single spectator or apprehended by a single mind. The\nCritical Philosophy, although it intended to emphasise the subjective\nelement in many apparent characteristics of the world, yet, by\nregarding the world in itself as unknowable, so concentrated attention\nupon the subjective representation that its subjectivity was soon\nforgotten. Having recognised the categories as the work of the mind,\nit was paralysed by its own recognition, and abandoned in despair the\nattempt to undo the work of subjective falsification. In part, no\ndoubt, its despair was well founded, but not, I think, in any absolute\nor ultimate sense. Still less was it a ground for rejoicing, or for\nsupposing that the nescience to which it ought to have given rise\ncould be legitimately exchanged for a metaphysical dogmatism.\nI\nAs regards our present question, namely, the question of the unity of\nthe world, the right method, as I think, has been indicated by William\nJames.[20] \"Let us now turn our backs upon ineffable or unintelligible\nways of accounting for the world's oneness, and inquire whether,\ninstead of being a principle, the 'oneness' affirmed may not merely be\na name like 'substance' descriptive of the fact that certain _specific\nand verifiable connections_ are found among the parts of the\nexperiential flux.... We can easily conceive of things that shall have\nno connection whatever with each other. We may assume them to inhabit\ndifferent times and spaces, as the dreams of different persons do even\nnow. They may be so unlike and incommensurable, and so inert towards\none another, as never to jostle or interfere. Even now there may\nactually be whole universes so disparate from ours that we who know\nours have no means of perceiving that they exist. We conceive their\ndiversity, however; and by that fact the whole lot of them form what\nis known in logic as 'a universe of discourse.' To form a universe of\ndiscourse argues, as this example shows, no further kind of connexion.\nThe importance attached by certain monistic writers to the fact that\nany chaos may become a universe by merely being named, is to me\nincomprehensible.\" We are thus left with two kinds of unity in the\nexperienced world; the one what we may call the epistemological unity,\ndue merely to the fact that my experienced world is what _one_\nexperience selects from the sum total of existence: the other that\ntentative and partial unity exhibited in the prevalence of scientific\nlaws in those portions of the world which science has hitherto\nmastered. Now a generalisation based upon either of these kinds of\nunity would be fallacious. That the things which we experience have\nthe common property of being experienced by us is a truism from which\nobviously nothing of importance can be deducible: it is clearly\nfallacious to draw from the fact that whatever we experience is\nexperienced the conclusion that therefore everything must be\nexperienced. The generalisation of the second kind of unity, namely,\nthat derived from scientific laws, would be equally fallacious, though\nthe fallacy is a trifle less elementary. In order to explain it let us\nconsider for a moment what is called the reign of law. People often\nspeak as though it were a remarkable fact that the physical world is\nsubject to invariable laws. In fact, however, it is not easy to see\nhow such a world could fail to obey general laws. Taking any arbitrary\nset of points in space, there is a function of the time corresponding\nto these points, i.e. expressing the motion of a particle which\ntraverses these points: this function may be regarded as a general law\nto which the behaviour of such a particle is subject. Taking all such\nfunctions for all the particles in the universe, there will be\ntheoretically some one formula embracing them all, and this formula\nmay be regarded as the single and supreme law of the spatio-temporal\nworld. Thus what is surprising in physics is not the existence of\ngeneral laws, but their extreme simplicity. It is not the uniformity\nof nature that should surprise us, for, by sufficient analytic\ningenuity, any conceivable course of nature might be shown to exhibit\nuniformity. What should surprise us is the fact that the uniformity is\nsimple enough for us to be able to discover it. But it is just this\ncharacteristic of simplicity in the laws of nature hitherto discovered\nwhich it would be fallacious to generalise, for it is obvious that\nsimplicity has been a part cause of their discovery, and can,\ntherefore, give no ground for the supposition that other undiscovered\nlaws are equally simple.\nThe fallacies to which these two kinds of unity have given rise\nsuggest a caution as regards all use in philosophy of general\n_results_ that science is supposed to have achieved. In the first\nplace, in generalising these results beyond past experience, it is\nnecessary to examine very carefully whether there is not some reason\nmaking it more probable that these results should hold of all that has\nbeen experienced than that they should hold of things universally. The\nsum total of what is experienced by mankind is a selection from the\nsum total of what exists, and any general character exhibited by this\nselection may be due to the manner of selecting rather than to the\ngeneral character of that from which experience selects. In the second\nplace, the most general results of science are the least certain and\nthe most liable to be upset by subsequent research. In utilizing these\nresults as the basis of a philosophy, we sacrifice the most valuable\nand remarkable characteristic of scientific method, namely, that,\nalthough almost everything in science is found sooner or later to\nrequire some correction, yet this correction is almost always such as\nto leave untouched, or only slightly modified, the greater part of the\nresults which have been deduced from the premiss subsequently\ndiscovered to be faulty. The prudent man of science acquires a certain\ninstinct as to the kind of uses which may be made of present\nscientific beliefs without incurring the danger of complete and utter\nrefutation from the modifications likely to be introduced by\nsubsequent discoveries. Unfortunately the use of scientific\ngeneralisations of a sweeping kind as the basis of philosophy is just\nthat kind of use which an instinct of scientific caution would avoid,\nsince, as a rule, it would only lead to true results if the\ngeneralisation upon which it is based stood in _no_ need of\ncorrection.\nWe may illustrate these general considerations by means of two\nexamples, namely, the conservation of energy and the principle of\nevolution.\n(1) Let us begin with the conservation of energy, or, as Herbert\nSpencer used to call it, the persistence of force. He says:[21]\n\"Before taking a first step in the rational interpretation of\nEvolution, it is needful to recognise, not only the facts that\nMatter is indestructible and Motion continuous, but also the fact\nthat Force persists. An attempt to assign the _causes_ of\nEvolution would manifestly be absurd if that agency to which the\nmetamorphosis in general and in detail is due, could either come\ninto existence or cease to exist. The succession of phenomena\nwould in such case be altogether arbitrary, and deductive Science\nimpossible.\"\nThis paragraph illustrates the kind of way in which the philosopher is\ntempted to give an air of absoluteness and necessity to empirical\ngeneralisations, of which only the approximate truth in the regions\nhitherto investigated can be guaranteed by the unaided methods of\nscience. It is very often said that the persistence of something or\nother is a necessary presupposition of all scientific investigation,\nand this presupposition is then thought to be exemplified in some\nquantity which physics declares to be constant. There are here, as it\nseems to me, three distinct errors. First, the detailed scientific\ninvestigation of nature does not _presuppose_ any such general laws as\nits results are found to verify. Apart from particular observations,\nscience need presuppose nothing except the general principles of\nlogic, and these principles are not laws of nature, for they are\nmerely hypothetical, and apply not only to the actual world but to\nwhatever is _possible_. The second error consists in the\nidentification of a constant quantity with a persistent entity. Energy\nis a certain function of a physical system, but is not a thing or\nsubstance persisting throughout the changes of the system. The same is\ntrue of mass, in spite of the fact that mass has often been defined as\n_quantity of matter_. The whole conception of quantity, involving, as\nit does, numerical measurement based largely upon conventions, is far\nmore artificial, far more an embodiment of mathematical convenience,\nthan is commonly believed by those who philosophise on physics. Thus\neven if (which I cannot for a moment admit) the persistence of some\nentity were among the necessary postulates of science, it would be a\nsheer error to infer from this the constancy of any physical quantity,\nor the _a priori_ necessity of any such constancy which may be\nempirically discovered. In the third place, it has become more and\nmore evident with the progress of physics that large generalisations,\nsuch as the conservation of energy or mass, are far from certain and\nare very likely only approximate. Mass, which used to be regarded as\nthe most indubitable of physical quantities, is now generally believed\nto vary according to velocity, and to be, in fact, a vector quantity\nwhich at a given moment is different in different directions. The\ndetailed conclusions deduced from the supposed constancy of mass for\nsuch motions as used to be studied in physics will remain very nearly\nexact, and therefore over the field of the older investigations very\nlittle modification of the older results is required. But as soon as\nsuch a principle as the conservation of mass or of energy is erected\ninto a universal _a priori_ law, the slightest failure in absolute\nexactness is fatal, and the whole philosophic structure raised upon\nthis foundation is necessarily ruined. The prudent philosopher,\ntherefore, though he may with advantage study the methods of physics,\nwill be very chary of basing anything upon what happen at the moment\nto be the most general results apparently obtained by those methods.\n(2) The philosophy of evolution, which was to be our second example,\nillustrates the same tendency to hasty generalisation, and also\nanother sort, namely, the undue preoccupation with ethical notions.\nThere are two kinds of evolutionist philosophy, of which both Hegel\nand Spencer represent the older and less radical kind, while\nPragmatism and Bergson represent the more modern and revolutionary\nvariety. But both these sorts of evolutionism have in common the\nemphasis on _progress_, that is, upon a continual change from the\nworse to the better, or from the simpler to the more complex. It\nwould be unfair to attribute to Hegel any scientific motive or\nfoundation, but all the other evolutionists, including Hegel's modern\ndisciples, have derived their impetus very largely from the history of\nbiological development. To a philosophy which derives a law of\nuniversal progress from this history there are two objections. First,\nthat this history itself is concerned with a very small selection of\nfacts confined to an infinitesimal fragment of space and time, and\neven on scientific grounds probably not an average sample of events in\nthe world at large. For we know that decay as well as growth is a\nnormal occurrence in the world. An extra-terrestrial philosopher, who\nhad watched a single youth up to the age of twenty-one and had never\ncome across any other human being, might conclude that it is the\nnature of human beings to grow continually taller and wiser in an\nindefinite progress towards perfection; and this generalisation would\nbe just as well founded as the generalisation which evolutionists base\nupon the previous history of this planet. Apart, however, from this\nscientific objection to evolutionism, there is another, derived from\nthe undue admixture of ethical notions in the very idea of progress\nfrom which evolutionism derives its charm. Organic life, we are told,\nhas developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher, and\nthis development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance.\nUnfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us\nthis assurance, and we can have no security that the impartial\noutsider would agree with the philosopher's self-complacent\nassumption. This point has been illustrated by the philosopher Chuang\nTz[)u] in the following instructive anecdote:\n\"The Grand Augur, in his ceremonial robes, approached the shambles\nand thus addressed the pigs: 'How can you object to die? I shall\nfatten you for three months. I shall discipline myself for ten\ndays and fast for three. I shall strew fine grass, and place you\nbodily upon a carved sacrificial dish. Does not this satisfy you?'\nThen, speaking from the pigs' point of view, he continued: 'It is\nbetter, perhaps, after all, to live on bran and escape the\nshambles....'\n'But then,' added he, speaking from his own point of view, 'to\nenjoy honour when alive one would readily die on a war-shield or\nin the headsman's basket.'\nSo he rejected the pigs' point of view and adopted his own point\nof view. In what sense, then, was he different from the pigs?\"\nI much fear that the evolutionists too often resemble the Grand Augur\nand the pigs.\nThe ethical element which has been prominent in many of the most\nfamous systems of philosophy is, in my opinion, one of the most\nserious obstacles to the victory of scientific method in the\ninvestigation of philosophical questions. Human ethical notions, as\nChuang Tz[)u] perceived, are essentially anthropocentric, and involve,\nwhen used in metaphysics, an attempt, however veiled, to legislate for\nthe universe on the basis of the present desires of men. In this way\nthey interfere with that receptivity to fact which is the essence of\nthe scientific attitude towards the world. To regard ethical notions\nas a key to the understanding of the world is essentially\npre-Copernican. It is to make man, with the hopes and ideals which he\nhappens to have at the present moment, the centre of the universe and\nthe interpreter of its supposed aims and purposes. Ethical metaphysics\nis fundamentally an attempt, however disguised, to give legislative\nforce to our own wishes. This may, of course, be questioned, but I\nthink that it is confirmed by a consideration of the way in which\nethical notions arise. Ethics is essentially a product of the\ngregarious instinct, that is to say, of the instinct to co-operate\nwith those who are to form our own group against those who belong to\nother groups. Those who belong to our own group are good; those who\nbelong to hostile groups are wicked. The ends which are pursued by our\nown group are desirable ends, the ends pursued by hostile groups are\nnefarious. The subjectivity of this situation is not apparent to the\ngregarious animal, which feels that the general principles of justice\nare on the side of its own herd. When the animal has arrived at the\ndignity of the metaphysician, it invents ethics as the embodiment of\nits belief in the justice of its own herd. So the Grand Augur invokes\nethics as the justification of Augurs in their conflicts with pigs.\nBut, it may be said, this view of ethics takes no account of such\ntruly ethical notions as that of self-sacrifice. This, however, would\nbe a mistake. The success of gregarious animals in the struggle for\nexistence depends upon co-operation within the herd, and co-operation\nrequires sacrifice, to some extent, of what would otherwise be the\ninterest of the individual. Hence arises a conflict of desires and\ninstincts, since both self-preservation and the preservation of the\nherd are biological ends to the individual. Ethics is in origin the\nart of recommending to others the sacrifices required for co-operation\nwith oneself. Hence, by reflexion, it comes, through the operation of\nsocial justice, to recommend sacrifices by oneself, but all ethics,\nhowever refined, remains more or less subjective. Even vegetarians do\nnot hesitate, for example, to save the life of a man in a fever,\nalthough in doing so they destroy the lives of many millions of\nmicrobes. The view of the world taken by the philosophy derived from\nethical notions is thus never impartial and therefore never fully\nscientific. As compared with science, it fails to achieve the\nimaginative liberation from self which is necessary to such\nunderstanding of the world as man can hope to achieve, and the\nphilosophy which it inspires is always more or less parochial, more or\nless infected with the prejudices of a time and a place.\nI do not deny the importance or value, within its own sphere, of the\nkind of philosophy which is inspired by ethical notions. The ethical\nwork of Spinoza, for example, appears to me of the very highest\nsignificance, but what is valuable in such work is not any\nmetaphysical theory as to the nature of the world to which it may give\nrise, nor indeed anything which can be proved or disproved by\nargument. What is valuable is the indication of some new way of\nfeeling towards life and the world, some way of feeling by which our\nown existence can acquire more of the characteristics which we must\ndeeply desire. The value of such work, however immeasurable it is,\nbelongs with practice and not with theory. Such theoretic importance\nas it may possess is only in relation to human nature, not in relation\nto the world at large. The scientific philosophy, therefore, which\naims only at understanding the world and not directly at any other\nimprovement of human life, cannot take account of ethical notions\nwithout being turned aside from that submission to fact which is the\nessence of the scientific temper.\nII\nIf the notion of the universe and the notion of good and evil are\nextruded from scientific philosophy, it may be asked what specific\nproblems remain for the philosopher as opposed to the man of science?\nIt would be difficult to give a precise answer to this question, but\ncertain characteristics may be noted as distinguishing the province of\nphilosophy from that of the special sciences.\nIn the first place a philosophical proposition must be general. It\nmust not deal specially with things on the surface of the earth, or\nwith the solar system, or with any other portion of space and time. It\nis this need of generality which has led to the belief that philosophy\ndeals with the universe as a whole. I do not believe that this belief\nis justified, but I do believe that a philosophical proposition must\nbe applicable to everything that exists or may exist. It might be\nsupposed that this admission would be scarcely distinguishable from\nthe view which I wish to reject. This, however, would be an error, and\nan important one. The traditional view would make the universe itself\nthe subject of various predicates which could not be applied to any\nparticular thing in the universe, and the ascription of such peculiar\npredicates to the universe would be the special business of\nphilosophy. I maintain, on the contrary, that there are no\npropositions of which the \"universe\" is the subject; in other words,\nthat there is no such thing as the \"universe.\" What I do maintain is\nthat there are general propositions which may be asserted of each\nindividual thing, such as the propositions of logic. This does not\ninvolve that all the things there are form a whole which could be\nregarded as another thing and be made the subject of predicates. It\ninvolves only the assertion that there are properties which belong to\neach separate thing, not that there are properties belonging to the\nwhole of things collectively. The philosophy which I wish to advocate\nmay be called logical atomism or absolute pluralism, because, while\nmaintaining that there are many things, it denies that there is a\nwhole composed of those things. We shall see, therefore, that\nphilosophical propositions, instead of being concerned with the whole\nof things collectively, are concerned with all things distributively;\nand not only must they be concerned with all things, but they must be\nconcerned with such properties of all things as do not depend upon the\naccidental nature of the things that there happen to be, but are true\nof any possible world, independently of such facts as can only be\ndiscovered by our senses.\nThis brings us to a second characteristic of philosophical\npropositions, namely, that they must be _a priori_. A philosophical\nproposition must be such as can be neither proved nor disproved by\nempirical evidence. Too often we find in philosophical books arguments\nbased upon the course of history, or the convolutions of the brain, or\nthe eyes of shell-fish. Special and accidental facts of this kind are\nirrelevant to philosophy, which must make only such assertions as\nwould be equally true however the actual world were constituted.\nWe may sum up these two characteristics of philosophical propositions\nby saying that _philosophy is the science of the possible_. But this\nstatement unexplained is liable to be misleading, since it may be\nthought that the possible is something other than the general, whereas\nin fact the two are indistinguishable.\nPhilosophy, if what has been said is correct, becomes\nindistinguishable from logic as that word has now come to be used.\nThe study of logic consists, broadly speaking, of two not very sharply\ndistinguished portions. On the one hand it is concerned with those\ngeneral statements which can be made concerning everything without\nmentioning any one thing or predicate or relation, such for example as\n\"if _x_ is a member of the class [alpha] and every member of [alpha]\nis a member of [beta], then _x_ is a member of the class [beta],\nwhatever _x_, [alpha], and [beta] may be.\" On the other hand, it is\nconcerned with the analysis and enumeration of logical _forms_, i.e.\nwith the kinds of propositions that may occur, with the various types\nof facts, and with the classification of the constituents of facts. In\nthis way logic provides an inventory of possibilities, a repertory of\nabstractly tenable hypotheses.\nIt might be thought that such a study would be too vague and too\ngeneral to be of any very great importance, and that, if its problems\nbecame at any point sufficiently definite, they would be merged in the\nproblems of some special science. It appears, however, that this is\nnot the case. In some problems, for example, the analysis of space and\ntime, the nature of perception, or the theory of judgment, the\ndiscovery of the logical form of the facts involved is the hardest\npart of the work and the part whose performance has been most lacking\nhitherto. It is chiefly for want of the right logical hypothesis that\nsuch problems have hitherto been treated in such an unsatisfactory\nmanner, and have given rise to those contradictions or antinomies in\nwhich the enemies of reason among philosophers have at all times\ndelighted.\nBy concentrating attention upon the investigation of logical forms, it\nbecomes possible at last for philosophy to deal with its problems\npiecemeal, and to obtain, as the sciences do, such partial and\nprobably not wholly correct results as subsequent investigation can\nutilise even while it supplements and improves them. Most\nphilosophies hitherto have been constructed all in one block, in such\na way that, if they were not wholly correct, they were wholly\nincorrect, and could not be used as a basis for further\ninvestigations. It is chiefly owing to this fact that philosophy,\nunlike science, has hitherto been unprogressive, because each original\nphilosopher has had to begin the work again from the beginning,\nwithout being able to accept anything definite from the work of his\npredecessors. A scientific philosophy such as I wish to recommend will\nbe piecemeal and tentative like other sciences; above all, it will be\nable to invent hypotheses which, even if they are not wholly true,\nwill yet remain fruitful after the necessary corrections have been\nmade. This possibility of successive approximations to the truth is,\nmore than anything else, the source of the triumphs of science, and to\ntransfer this possibility to philosophy is to ensure a progress in\nmethod whose importance it would be almost impossible to exaggerate.\nThe essence of philosophy as thus conceived is analysis, not\nsynthesis. To build up systems of the world, like Heine's German\nprofessor who knit together fragments of life and made an intelligible\nsystem out of them, is not, I believe, any more feasible than the\ndiscovery of the philosopher's stone. What is feasible is the\nunderstanding of general forms, and the division of traditional\nproblems into a number of separate and less baffling questions.\n\"Divide and conquer\" is the maxim of success here as elsewhere.\nLet us illustrate these somewhat general maxims by examining their\napplication to the philosophy of space, for it is only in application\nthat the meaning or importance of a method can be understood. Suppose\nwe are confronted with the problem of space as presented in Kant's\nTranscendental \u00c6sthetic, and suppose we wish to discover what are the\nelements of the problem and what hope there is of obtaining a solution\nof them. It will soon appear that three entirely distinct problems,\nbelonging to different studies, and requiring different methods for\ntheir solution, have been confusedly combined in the supposed single\nproblem with which Kant is concerned. There is a problem of logic, a\nproblem of physics, and a problem of theory of knowledge. Of these\nthree, the problem of logic can be solved exactly and perfectly; the\nproblem of physics can probably be solved with as great a degree of\ncertainty and as great an approach to exactness as can be hoped in an\nempirical region; the problem of theory of knowledge, however, remains\nvery obscure and very difficult to deal with. Let us see how these\nthree problems arise.\n(1) The logical problem has arisen through the suggestions of\nnon-Euclidean geometry. Given a body of geometrical propositions, it\nis not difficult to find a minimum statement of the axioms from which\nthis body of propositions can be deduced. It is also not difficult, by\ndropping or altering some of these axioms, to obtain a more general or\na different geometry, having, from the point of view of pure\nmathematics, the same logical coherence and the same title to respect\nas the more familiar Euclidean geometry. The Euclidean geometry itself\nis true perhaps of actual space (though this is doubtful), but\ncertainly of an infinite number of purely arithmetical systems, each\nof which, from the point of view of abstract logic, has an equal and\nindefeasible right to be called a Euclidean space. Thus space as an\nobject of logical or mathematical study loses its uniqueness; not only\nare there many kinds of spaces, but there are an infinity of examples\nof each kind, though it is difficult to find any kind of which the\nspace of physics may be an example, and it is impossible to find any\nkind of which the space of physics is certainly an example. As an\nillustration of one possible logical system of geometry we may\nconsider all relations of three terms which are analogous in certain\nformal respects to the relation \"between\" as it appears to be in\nactual space. A space is then defined by means of one such three-term\nrelation. The points of the space are all the terms which have this\nrelation to something or other, and their order in the space in\nquestion is determined by this relation. The points of one space are\nnecessarily also points of other spaces, since there are necessarily\nother three-term relations having those same points for their field.\nThe space in fact is not determined by the class of its points, but by\nthe ordering three-term relation. When enough abstract logical\nproperties of such relations have been enumerated to determine the\nresulting kind of geometry, say, for example, Euclidean geometry, it\nbecomes unnecessary for the pure geometer in his abstract capacity to\ndistinguish between the various relations which have all these\nproperties. He considers the whole class of such relations, not any\nsingle one among them. Thus in studying a given kind of geometry the\npure mathematician is studying a certain class of relations defined by\nmeans of certain abstract logical properties which take the place of\nwhat used to be called axioms. The nature of geometrical _reasoning_\ntherefore is purely deductive and purely logical; if any special\nepistemological peculiarities are to be found in geometry, it must not\nbe in the reasoning, but in our knowledge concerning the axioms in\nsome given space.\n(2) The physical problem of space is both more interesting and more\ndifficult than the logical problem. The physical problem may be\nstated as follows: to find in the physical world, or to construct from\nphysical materials, a space of one of the kinds enumerated by the\nlogical treatment of geometry. This problem derives its difficulty\nfrom the attempt to accommodate to the roughness and vagueness of the\nreal world some system possessing the logical clearness and exactitude\nof pure mathematics. That this can be done with a certain degree of\napproximation is fairly evident If I see three people _A_, _B_, and\n_C_ sitting in a row, I become aware of the fact which may be\nexpressed by saying that _B_ is between _A_ and _C_ rather than that\n_A_ is between _B_ and _C_, or _C_ is between _A_ and _B_. This\nrelation of \"between\" which is thus perceived to hold has some of the\nabstract logical properties of those three-term relations which, we\nsaw, give rise to a geometry, but its properties fail to be exact, and\nare not, as empirically given, amenable to the kind of treatment at\nwhich geometry aims. In abstract geometry we deal with points,\nstraight lines, and planes; but the three people _A_, _B_, and _C_\nwhom I see sitting in a row are not exactly points, nor is the row\nexactly a straight line. Nevertheless physics, which formally assumes\na space containing points, straight lines, and planes, is found\nempirically to give results applicable to the sensible world. It must\ntherefore be possible to find an interpretation of the points,\nstraight lines, and planes of physics in terms of physical data, or at\nany rate in terms of data together with such hypothetical additions as\nseem least open to question. Since all data suffer from a lack of\nmathematical precision through being of a certain size and somewhat\nvague in outline, it is plain that if such a notion as that of a point\nis to find any application to empirical material, the point must be\nneither a datum nor a hypothetical addition to data, but a\n_construction_ by means of data with their hypothetical additions. It\nis obvious that any hypothetical filling out of data is less dubious\nand unsatisfactory when the additions are closely analogous to data\nthan when they are of a radically different sort. To assume, for\nexample, that objects which we see continue, after we have turned away\nour eyes, to be more or less analogous to what they were while we were\nlooking, is a less violent assumption than to assume that such objects\nare composed of an infinite number of mathematical points. Hence in\nthe physical study of the geometry of physical space, points must not\nbe assumed _ab initio_ as they are in the logical treatment of\ngeometry, but must be constructed as systems composed of data and\nhypothetical analogues of data. We are thus led naturally to define a\nphysical point as a certain class of those objects which are the\nultimate constituents of the physical world. It will be the class of\nall those objects which, as one would naturally say, _contain_ the\npoint. To secure a definition giving this result, without previously\nassuming that physical objects are composed of points, is an agreeable\nproblem in mathematical logic. The solution of this problem and the\nperception of its importance are due to my friend Dr. Whitehead. The\noddity of regarding a point as a class of physical entities wears off\nwith familiarity, and ought in any case not to be felt by those who\nmaintain, as practically every one does, that points are mathematical\nfictions. The word \"fiction\" is used glibly in such connexions by many\nmen who seem not to feel the necessity of explaining how it can come\nabout that a fiction can be so useful in the study of the actual world\nas the points of mathematical physics have been found to be. By our\ndefinition, which regards a point as a class of physical objects, it\nis explained both how the use of points can lead to important\nphysical results, and how we can nevertheless avoid the assumption\nthat points are themselves entities in the physical world.\nMany of the mathematically convenient properties of abstract logical\nspaces cannot be either known to belong or known not to belong to the\nspace of physics. Such are all the properties connected with continuity.\nFor to know that actual space has these properties would require an\ninfinite exactness of sense-perception. If actual space is continuous,\nthere are nevertheless many possible non-continuous spaces which will be\nempirically indistinguishable from it; and, conversely, actual space may\nbe non-continuous and yet empirically indistinguishable from a possible\ncontinuous space. Continuity, therefore, though obtainable in the _a\npriori_ region of arithmetic, is not with certainty obtainable in the\nspace or time of the physical world: whether these are continuous or not\nwould seem to be a question not only unanswered but for ever\nunanswerable. From the point of view of philosophy, however, the\ndiscovery that a question is unanswerable is as complete an answer as\nany that could possibly be obtained. And from the point of view of\nphysics, where no empirical means of distinction can be found, there can\nbe no empirical objection to the mathematically simplest assumption,\nwhich is that of continuity.\nThe subject of the physical theory of space is a very large one,\nhitherto little explored. It is associated with a similar theory of\ntime, and both have been forced upon the attention of philosophically\nminded physicists by the discussions which have raged concerning the\ntheory of relativity.\n(3) The problem with which Kant is concerned in the Transcendental\n\u00c6sthetic is primarily the epistemological problem: \"How do we come to\nhave knowledge of geometry _a priori_?\" By the distinction between the\nlogical and physical problems of geometry, the bearing and scope of\nthis question are greatly altered. Our knowledge of pure geometry is\n_a priori_ but is wholly logical. Our knowledge of physical geometry\nis synthetic, but is not _a priori_. Our knowledge of pure geometry is\nhypothetical, and does not enable us to assert, for example, that the\naxiom of parallels is true in the physical world. Our knowledge of\nphysical geometry, while it does enable us to assert that this axiom\nis approximately verified, does not, owing to the inevitable\ninexactitude of observation, enable us to assert that it is verified\n_exactly_. Thus, with the separation which we have made between pure\ngeometry and the geometry of physics, the Kantian problem collapses.\nTo the question, \"How is synthetic _a priori_ knowledge possible?\" we\ncan now reply, at any rate so far as geometry is concerned, \"It is not\npossible,\" if \"synthetic\" means \"not deducible from logic alone.\" Our\nknowledge of geometry, like the rest of our knowledge, is derived\npartly from logic, partly from sense, and the peculiar position which\nin Kant's day geometry appeared to occupy is seen now to be a\ndelusion. There are still some philosophers, it is true, who maintain\nthat our knowledge that the axiom of parallels, for example, is true\nof actual space, is not to be accounted for empirically, but is as\nKant maintained derived from an _a priori_ intuition. This position is\nnot logically refutable, but I think it loses all plausibility as soon\nas we realise how complicated and derivative is the notion of physical\nspace. As we have seen, the application of geometry to the physical\nworld in no way demands that there should really be points and\nstraight lines among physical entities. The principle of economy,\ntherefore, demands that we should abstain from assuming the existence\nof points and straight lines. As soon, however, as we accept the view\nthat points and straight lines are complicated constructions by means\nof classes of physical entities, the hypothesis that we have an _a\npriori_ intuition enabling us to know what happens to straight lines\nwhen they are produced indefinitely becomes extremely strained and\nharsh; nor do I think that such an hypothesis would ever have arisen\nin the mind of a philosopher who had grasped the nature of physical\nspace. Kant, under the influence of Newton, adopted, though with some\nvacillation, the hypothesis of absolute space, and this hypothesis,\nthough logically unobjectionable, is removed by Occam's razor, since\nabsolute space is an unnecessary entity in the explanation of the\nphysical world. Although, therefore, we cannot refute the Kantian\ntheory of an _a priori_ intuition, we can remove its grounds one by\none through an analysis of the problem. Thus, here as in many other\nphilosophical questions, the analytic method, while not capable of\narriving at a demonstrative result, is nevertheless capable of showing\nthat all the positive grounds in favour of a certain theory are\nfallacious and that a less unnatural theory is capable of accounting\nfor the facts.\nAnother question by which the capacity of the analytic method can be\nshown is the question of realism. Both those who advocate and those\nwho combat realism seem to me to be far from clear as to the nature of\nthe problem which they are discussing. If we ask: \"Are our objects of\nperception _real_ and are they _independent_ of the percipient?\" it\nmust be supposed that we attach some meaning to the words \"real\" and\n\"independent,\" and yet, if either side in the controversy of realism\nis asked to define these two words, their answer is pretty sure to\nembody confusions such as logical analysis will reveal.\nLet us begin with the word \"real.\" There certainly are objects of\nperception, and therefore, if the question whether these objects are\nreal is to be a substantial question, there must be in the world two\nsorts of objects, namely, the real and the unreal, and yet the unreal\nis supposed to be essentially what there is not. The question what\nproperties must belong to an object in order to make it real is one to\nwhich an adequate answer is seldom if ever forthcoming. There is of\ncourse the Hegelian answer, that the real is the self-consistent and\nthat nothing is self-consistent except the Whole; but this answer,\ntrue or false, is not relevant in our present discussion, which moves\non a lower plane and is concerned with the status of objects of\nperception among other objects of equal fragmentariness. Objects of\nperception are contrasted, in the discussions concerning realism,\nrather with psychical states on the one hand and matter on the other\nhand than with the all-inclusive whole of things. The question we have\ntherefore to consider is the question as to what can be meant by\nassigning \"reality\" to some but not all of the entities that make up\nthe world. Two elements, I think, make up what is felt rather than\nthought when the word \"reality\" is used in this sense. A thing is real\nif it persists at times when it is not perceived; or again, a thing is\nreal when it is correlated with other things in a way which experience\nhas led us to expect. It will be seen that reality in either of these\nsenses is by no means necessary to a thing, and that in fact there\nmight be a whole world in which nothing was real in either of these\nsenses. It might turn out that the objects of perception failed of\nreality in one or both of these respects, without its being in any way\ndeducible that they are not parts of the external world with which\nphysics deals. Similar remarks will apply to the word \"independent.\"\nMost of the associations of this word are bound up with ideas as to\ncausation which it is not now possible to maintain. _A_ is independent\nof _B_ when _B_ is not an indispensable part of the _cause_ of _A_.\nBut when it is recognised that causation is nothing more than\ncorrelation, and that there are correlations of simultaneity as well\nas of succession, it becomes evident that there is no uniqueness in a\nseries of casual antecedents of a given event, but that, at any point\nwhere there is a correlation of simultaneity, we can pass from one\nline of antecedents to another in order to obtain a new series of\ncausal antecedents. It will be necessary to specify the causal law\naccording to which the antecedents are to be considered. I received a\nletter the other day from a correspondent who had been puzzled by\nvarious philosophical questions. After enumerating them he says:\n\"These questions led me from Bonn to Strassburg, where I found\nProfessor Simmel.\" Now, it would be absurd to deny that these\nquestions caused his body to move from Bonn to Strassburg, and yet it\nmust be supposed that a set of purely mechanical antecedents could\nalso be found which would account for this transfer of matter from one\nplace to another. Owing to this plurality of causal series antecedent\nto a given event, the notion of _the_ cause becomes indefinite, and\nthe question of independence becomes correspondingly ambiguous. Thus,\ninstead of asking simply whether _A_ is independent of _B_, we ought\nto ask whether there is a series determined by such and such causal\nlaws leading from _B_ to _A_. This point is important in connexion\nwith the particular question of objects of perception. It may be that\nno objects quite like those which we perceive ever exist unperceived;\nin this case there will be a causal law according to which objects of\nperception are not independent of being perceived. But even if this be\nthe case, it may nevertheless also happen that there are purely\nphysical causal laws determining the occurrence of objects which are\nperceived by means of other objects which perhaps are not perceived.\nIn that case, in regard to such causal laws objects of perception will\nbe independent of being perceived. Thus the question whether objects\nof perception are independent of being perceived is, as it stands,\nindeterminate, and the answer will be yes or no according to the\nmethod adopted of making it determinate. I believe that this confusion\nhas borne a very large part in prolonging the controversies on this\nsubject, which might well have seemed capable of remaining for ever\nundecided. The view which I should wish to advocate is that objects of\nperception do not persist unchanged at times when they are not\nperceived, although probably objects more or less resembling them do\nexist at such times; that objects of perception are part, and the only\nempirically knowable part, of the actual subject-matter of physics,\nand are themselves properly to be called physical; that purely\nphysical laws exist determining the character and duration of objects\nof perception without any reference to the fact that they are\nperceived; and that in the establishment of such laws the propositions\nof physics do not presuppose any propositions of psychology or even\nthe existence of mind. I do not know whether realists would recognise\nsuch a view as realism. All that I should claim for it is, that it\navoids difficulties which seem to me to beset both realism and\nidealism as hitherto advocated, and that it avoids the appeal which\nthey have made to ideas which logical analysis shows to be ambiguous.\nA further defence and elaboration of the positions which I advocate,\nbut for which time is lacking now, will be found indicated in my book\non _Our Knowledge of the External World_.[22]\nThe adoption of scientific method in philosophy, if I am not mistaken,\ncompels us to abandon the hope of solving many of the more ambitious\nand humanly interesting problems of traditional philosophy. Some of\nthese it relegates, though with little expectation of a successful\nsolution, to special sciences, others it shows to be such as our\ncapacities are essentially incapable of solving. But there remain a\nlarge number of the recognised problems of philosophy in regard to\nwhich the method advocated gives all those advantages of division into\ndistinct questions, of tentative, partial, and progressive advance,\nand of appeal to principles with which, independently of temperament,\nall competent students must agree. The failure of philosophy hitherto\nhas been due in the main to haste and ambition: patience and modesty,\nhere as in other sciences, will open the road to solid and durable\nprogress.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[19] Bosanquet, _Logic_, ii, p. 211.\n[20] _Some Problems of Philosophy_, p 124.\n[21] _First Principles_ (1862), Part II, beginning of chap. viii.\n[22] Open Court Company, 1914.\nVII\nTHE ULTIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF MATTER[23]\nI wish to discuss in this article no less a question than the ancient\nmetaphysical query, \"What is matter?\" The question, \"What is matter?\"\nin so far as it concerns philosophy, is, I think, already capable of\nan answer which in principle will be as complete as an answer can hope\nto be; that is to say, we can separate the problem into an essentially\nsoluble and an essentially insoluble portion, and we can now see how\nto solve the essentially soluble portion, at least as regards its main\noutlines. It is these outlines which I wish to suggest in the present\narticle. My main position, which is realistic, is, I hope and believe,\nnot remote from that of Professor Alexander, by whose writings on this\nsubject I have profited greatly.[24] It is also in close accord with\nthat of Dr. Nunn.[25]\nCommon sense is accustomed to the division of the world into mind and\nmatter. It is supposed by all who have never studied philosophy that\nthe distinction between mind and matter is perfectly clear and easy,\nthat the two do not at any point overlap, and that only a fool or a\nphilosopher could be in doubt as to whether any given entity is mental\nor material. This simple faith survives in Descartes and in a\nsomewhat modified form in Spinoza, but with Leibniz it begins to\ndisappear, and from his day to our own almost every philosopher of\nnote has criticised and rejected the dualism of common sense. It is my\nintention in this article to defend this dualism; but before defending\nit we must spend a few moments on the reasons which have prompted its\nrejection.\nOur knowledge of the material world is obtained by means of the\nsenses, of sight and touch and so on. At first it is supposed that\nthings are just as they seem, but two opposite sophistications soon\ndestroy this na\u00efve belief. On the one hand the physicists cut up\nmatter into molecules, atoms, corpuscles, and as many more such\nsubdivisions as their future needs may make them postulate, and the\nunits at which they arrive are uncommonly different from the visible,\ntangible objects of daily life. A unit of matter tends more and more\nto be something like an electromagnetic field filling all space,\nthough having its greatest intensity in a small region. Matter\nconsisting of such elements is as remote from daily life as any\nmetaphysical theory. It differs from the theories of metaphysicians\nonly in the fact that its practical efficacy proves that it contains\nsome measure of truth and induces business men to invest money on the\nstrength of it; but, in spite of its connection with the money market,\nit remains a metaphysical theory none the less.\nThe second kind of sophistication to which the world of common sense\nhas been subjected is derived from the psychologists and\nphysiologists. The physiologists point out that what we see depends\nupon the eye, that what we hear depends upon the ear, and that all our\nsenses are liable to be affected by anything which affects the brain,\nlike alcohol or hasheesh. Psychologists point out how much of what we\nthink we see is supplied by association or unconscious inference, how\nmuch is mental interpretation, and how doubtful is the residuum which\ncan be regarded as crude datum. From these facts it is argued by the\npsychologists that the notion of a datum passively received by the\nmind is a delusion, and it is argued by the physiologists that even if\na pure datum of sense could be obtained by the analysis of experience,\nstill this datum could not belong, as common sense supposes, to the\nouter world, since its whole nature is conditioned by our nerves and\nsense organs, changing as they change in ways which it is thought\nimpossible to connect with any change in the matter supposed to be\nperceived. This physiologist's argument is exposed to the rejoinder,\nmore specious than solid, that our knowledge of the existence of the\nsense organs and nerves is obtained by that very process which the\nphysiologist has been engaged in discrediting, since the existence of\nthe nerves and sense organs is only known through the evidence of the\nsenses themselves. This argument may prove that some reinterpretation\nof the results of physiology is necessary before they can acquire\nmetaphysical validity. But it does not upset the physiological\nargument in so far as this constitutes merely a _reductio ad absurdum_\nof na\u00efve realism.\nThese various lines of argument prove, I think, that some part of the\nbeliefs of common sense must be abandoned. They prove that, if we take\nthese beliefs as a whole, we are forced into conclusions which are in\npart self-contradictory; but such arguments cannot of themselves\ndecide what portion of our common-sense beliefs is in need of\ncorrection. Common sense believes that what we see is physical,\noutside the mind, and continuing to exist if we shut our eyes or turn\nthem in another direction. I believe that common sense is right in\nregarding what we see as physical and (in one of several possible\nsenses) outside the mind, but is probably wrong in supposing that it\ncontinues to exist when we are no longer looking at it. It seems to me\nthat the whole discussion of matter has been obscured by two errors\nwhich support each other. The first of these is the error that what we\nsee, or perceive through any of our other senses, is subjective: the\nsecond is the belief that what is physical must be persistent.\nWhatever physics may regard as the ultimate constituents of matter, it\nalways supposes these constituents to be indestructible. Since the\nimmediate data of sense are not indestructible but in a state of\nperpetual flux, it is argued that these data themselves cannot be\namong the ultimate constituents of matter. I believe this to be a\nsheer mistake. The persistent particles of mathematical physics I\nregard as logical constructions, symbolic fictions enabling us to\nexpress compendiously very complicated assemblages of facts; and, on\nthe other hand, I believe that the actual data in sensation, the\nimmediate objects of sight or touch or hearing, are extra-mental,\npurely physical, and among the ultimate constituents of matter.\nMy meaning in regard to the impermanence of physical entities may\nperhaps be made clearer by the use of Bergson's favourite illustration\nof the cinematograph. When I first read Bergson's statement that the\nmathematician conceives the world after the analogy of a\ncinematograph, I had never seen a cinematograph, and my first visit to\none was determined by the desire to verify Bergson's statement, which\nI found to be completely true, at least so far as I am concerned.\nWhen, in a picture palace, we see a man rolling down hill, or running\naway from the police, or falling into a river, or doing any of those\nother things to which men in such places are addicted, we know that\nthere is not really only one man moving, but a succession of films,\neach with a different momentary man. The illusion of persistence\narises only through the approach to continuity in the series of\nmomentary men. Now what I wish to suggest is that in this respect the\ncinema is a better metaphysician than common sense, physics, or\nphilosophy. The real man too, I believe, however the police may swear\nto his identity, is really a series of momentary men, each different\none from the other, and bound together, not by a numerical identity,\nbut by continuity and certain intrinsic causal laws. And what applies\nto men applies equally to tables and chairs, the sun, moon and stars.\nEach of these is to be regarded, not as one single persistent entity,\nbut as a series of entities succeeding each other in time, each\nlasting for a very brief period, though probably not for a mere\nmathematical instant. In saying this I am only urging the same kind of\ndivision in time as we are accustomed to acknowledge in the case of\nspace. A body which fills a cubic foot will be admitted to consist of\nmany smaller bodies, each occupying only a very tiny volume; similarly\na thing which persists for an hour is to be regarded as composed of\nmany things of less duration. A true theory of matter requires a\ndivision of things into time-corpuscles as well as into\nspace-corpuscles.\nThe world may be conceived as consisting of a multitude of entities\narranged in a certain pattern. The entities which are arranged I shall\ncall \"particulars.\" The arrangement or pattern results from relations\namong particulars. Classes or series of particulars, collected\ntogether on account of some property which makes it convenient to be\nable to speak of them as wholes, are what I call logical constructions\nor symbolic fictions. The particulars are to be conceived, not on the\nanalogy of bricks in a building, but rather on the analogy of notes\nin a symphony. The ultimate constituents of a symphony (apart from\nrelations) are the notes, each of which lasts only for a very short\ntime. We may collect together all the notes played by one instrument:\nthese may be regarded as the analogues of the successive particulars\nwhich common sense would regard as successive states of one \"thing.\"\nBut the \"thing\" ought to be regarded as no more \"real\" or\n\"substantial\" than, for example, the r\u00f4le of the trombone. As soon as\n\"things\" are conceived in this manner it will be found that the\ndifficulties in the way of regarding immediate objects of sense as\nphysical have largely disappeared.\nWhen people ask, \"Is the object of sense mental or physical?\" they\nseldom have any clear idea either what is meant by \"mental\" or\n\"physical,\" or what criteria are to be applied for deciding whether a\ngiven entity belongs to one class or the other. I do not know how to\ngive a sharp definition of the word \"mental,\" but something may be\ndone by enumerating occurrences which are indubitably mental:\nbelieving, doubting, wishing, willing, being pleased or pained, are\ncertainly mental occurrences; so are what we may call experiences,\nseeing, hearing, smelling, perceiving generally. But it does not\nfollow from this that what is seen, what is heard, what is smelt, what\nis perceived, must be mental. When I see a flash of lightning, my\nseeing of it is mental, but what I see, although it is not quite the\nsame as what anybody else sees at the same moment, and although it\nseems very unlike what the physicist would describe as a flash of\nlightning, is not mental. I maintain, in fact, that if the physicist\ncould describe truly and fully all that occurs in the physical world\nwhen there is a flash of lightning, it would contain as a constituent\nwhat I see, and also what is seen by anybody else who would commonly\nbe said to see the same flash. What I mean may perhaps be made plainer\nby saying that if my body could remain in exactly the same state in\nwhich it is, although my mind had ceased to exist, precisely that\nobject which I now see when I see the flash would exist, although of\ncourse I should not see it, since my seeing is mental. The principal\nreasons which have led people to reject this view have, I think, been\ntwo: first, that they did not adequately distinguish between my seeing\nand what I see; secondly, that the causal dependence of what I see\nupon my body has made people suppose that what I see cannot be\n\"outside\" me. The first of these reasons need not detain us, since the\nconfusion only needs to be pointed out in order to be obviated; but\nthe second requires some discussion, since it can only be answered by\nremoving current misconceptions, on the one hand as to the nature of\nspace, and on the other, as to the meaning of causal dependence.\nWhen people ask whether colours, for example, or other secondary\nqualities are inside or outside the mind, they seem to suppose that\ntheir meaning must be clear, and that it ought to be possible to say\nyes or no without any further discussion of the terms involved. In\nfact, however, such terms as \"inside\" or \"outside\" are very ambiguous.\nWhat is meant by asking whether this or that is \"in\" the mind? The\nmind is not like a bag or a pie; it does not occupy a certain region\nin space, or, if (in a sense) it does, what is in that region is\npresumably part of the brain, which would not be said to be in the\nmind. When people say that sensible qualities are in the mind, they do\nnot mean \"spatially contained in\" in the sense in which the blackbirds\nwere in the pie. We might regard the mind as an assemblage of\nparticulars, namely, what would be called \"states of mind,\" which\nwould belong together in virtue of some specific common quality. The\ncommon quality of all states of mind would be the quality designated\nby the word \"mental\"; and besides this we should have to suppose that\neach separate person's states of mind have some common characteristic\ndistinguishing them from the states of mind of other people. Ignoring\nthis latter point, let us ask ourselves whether the quality designated\nby the word \"mental\" does, as a matter of observation, actually belong\nto objects of sense, such as colours or noises. I think any candid\nperson must reply that, however difficult it may be to know what we\nmean by \"mental,\" it is not difficult to see that colours and noises\nare not mental in the sense of having that intrinsic peculiarity which\nbelongs to beliefs and wishes and volitions, but not to the physical\nworld. Berkeley advances on this subject a plausible argument[26]\nwhich seems to me to rest upon an ambiguity in the word \"pain.\" He\nargues that the realist supposes the heat which he feels in\napproaching a fire to be something outside his mind, but that as he\napproaches nearer and nearer to the fire the sensation of heat passes\nimperceptibly into pain, and that no one could regard pain as\nsomething outside the mind. In reply to this argument, it should be\nobserved in the first place that the heat of which we are immediately\naware is not in the fire but in our own body. It is only by inference\nthat the fire is judged to be the cause of the heat which we feel in\nour body. In the second place (and this is the more important point),\nwhen we speak of pain we may mean one of two things: we may mean the\nobject of the sensation or other experience which has the quality of\nbeing painful, or we may mean the quality of painfulness itself. When\na man says he has a pain in his great toe, what he means is that he\nhas a sensation associated with his great toe and having the quality\nof painfulness. The sensation itself, like every sensation, consists\nin experiencing a sensible object, and the experiencing has that\nquality of painfulness which only mental occurrences can have, but\nwhich may belong to thoughts or desires, as well as to sensations. But\nin common language we speak of the sensible object experienced in a\npainful sensation as a pain, and it is this way of speaking which\ncauses the confusion upon which the plausibility of Berkeley's\nargument depends. It would be absurd to attribute the quality of\npainfulness to anything non-mental, and hence it comes to be thought\nthat what we call a pain in the toe must be mental. In fact, however,\nit is not the sensible object in such a case which is painful, but the\nsensation, that is to say, the experience of the sensible object. As\nthe heat which we experience from the fire grows greater, the\nexperience passes gradually from being pleasant to being painful, but\nneither the pleasure nor the pain is a quality of the object\nexperienced as opposed to the experience, and it is therefore a\nfallacy to argue that this object must be mental on the ground that\npainfulness can only be attributed to what is mental.\nIf, then, when we say that something is in the mind we mean that it\nhas a certain recognisable intrinsic characteristic such as belongs to\nthoughts and desires, it must be maintained on grounds of immediate\ninspection that objects of sense are not in any mind.\nA different meaning of \"in the mind\" is, however, to be inferred from\nthe arguments advanced by those who regard sensible objects as being\nin the mind. The arguments used are, in the main, such as would prove\nthe causal dependence of objects of sense upon the percipient. Now\nthe notion of causal dependence is very obscure and difficult, much\nmore so in fact than is generally realised by philosophers. I shall\nreturn to this point in a moment. For the present, however, accepting\nthe notion of causal dependence without criticism, I wish to urge that\nthe dependence in question is rather upon our bodies than upon our\nminds. The visual appearance of an object is altered if we shut one\neye, or squint, or look previously at something dazzling; but all\nthese are bodily acts, and the alterations which they effect are to be\nexplained by physiology and optics, not by psychology.[27] They are in\nfact of exactly the same kind as the alterations effected by\nspectacles or a microscope. They belong therefore to the theory of the\nphysical world, and can have no bearing upon the question whether what\nwe see is causally dependent upon the mind. What they do tend to\nprove, and what I for my part have no wish to deny, is that what we\nsee is causally dependent upon our body and is not, as crude common\nsense would suppose, something which would exist equally if our eyes\nand nerves and brain were absent, any more than the visual appearance\npresented by an object seen through a microscope would remain if the\nmicroscope were removed. So long as it is supposed that the physical\nworld is composed of stable and more or less permanent constituents,\nthe fact that what we see is changed by changes in our body appears to\nafford reason for regarding what we see as not an ultimate constituent\nof matter. But if it is recognised that the ultimate constituents of\nmatter are as circumscribed in duration as in spatial extent, the\nwhole of this difficulty vanishes.\nThere remains, however, another difficulty, connected with space. When\nwe look at the sun we wish to know something about the sun itself,\nwhich is ninety-three million miles away; but what we see is dependent\nupon our eyes, and it is difficult to suppose that our eyes can affect\nwhat happens at a distance of ninety-three million miles. Physics\ntells us that certain electromagnetic waves start from the sun, and\nreach our eyes after about eight minutes. They there produce\ndisturbances in the rods and cones, thence in the optic nerve, thence\nin the brain. At the end of this purely physical series, by some odd\nmiracle, comes the experience which we call \"seeing the sun,\" and it\nis such experiences which form the whole and sole reason for our\nbelief in the optic nerve, the rods and cones, the ninety-three\nmillion miles, the electromagnetic waves, and the sun itself. It is\nthis curious oppositeness of direction between the order of causation\nas affirmed by physics, and the order of evidence as revealed by\ntheory of knowledge, that causes the most serious perplexities in\nregard to the nature of physical reality. Anything that invalidates\nour seeing, as a source of knowledge concerning physical reality,\ninvalidates also the whole of physics and physiology. And yet,\nstarting from a common-sense acceptance of our seeing, physics has\nbeen led step by step to the construction of the causal chain in which\nour seeing is the last link, and the immediate object which we see\ncannot be regarded as that initial cause which we believe to be\nninety-three million miles away, and which we are inclined to regard\nas the \"real\" sun.\nI have stated this difficulty as forcibly as I can, because I believe\nthat it can only be answered by a radical analysis and reconstruction\nof all the conceptions upon whose employment it depends.\nSpace, time, matter and cause, are the chief of these conceptions. Let\nus begin with the conception of cause.\nCausal dependence, as I observed a moment ago, is a conception which\nit is very dangerous to accept at its face value. There exists a\nnotion that in regard to any event there is something which may be\ncalled _the_ cause of that event--some one definite occurrence,\nwithout which the event would have been impossible and with which it\nbecomes necessary. An event is supposed to be dependent upon its cause\nin some way which in it is not dependent upon other things. Thus men\nwill urge that the mind is dependent upon the brain, or, with equal\nplausibility, that the brain is dependent upon the mind. It seems not\nimprobable that if we had sufficient knowledge we could infer the\nstate of a man's mind from the state of his brain, or the state of his\nbrain from the state of his mind. So long as the usual conception of\ncausal dependence is retained, this state of affairs can be used by\nthe materialist to urge that the state of our brain causes our\nthoughts, and by the idealist to urge that our thoughts cause the\nstate of our brain. Either contention is equally valid or equally\ninvalid. The fact seems to be that there are many correlations of the\nsort which may be called causal, and that, for example, either a\nphysical or a mental event can be predicted, theoretically, either\nfrom a sufficient number of physical antecedents or from a sufficient\nnumber of mental antecedents. To speak of _the_ cause of an event is\ntherefore misleading. Any set of antecedents from which the event can\ntheoretically be inferred by means of correlations might be called a\ncause of the event. But to speak of _the_ cause is to imply a\nuniqueness which does not exist.\nThe relevance of this to the experience which we call \"seeing the sun\"\nis obvious. The fact that there exists a chain of antecedents which\nmakes our seeing dependent upon the eyes and nerves and brain does not\neven tend to show that there is not another chain of antecedents in\nwhich the eyes and nerves and brain as physical things are ignored. If\nwe are to escape from the dilemma which seemed to arise out of the\nphysiological causation of what we see when we say we see the sun, we\nmust find, at least in theory, a way of stating causal laws for the\nphysical world, in which the units are not material things, such as\nthe eyes and nerves and brain, but momentary particulars of the same\nsort as our momentary visual object when we look at the sun. The sun\nitself and the eyes and nerves and brain must be regarded as\nassemblages of momentary particulars. Instead of supposing, as we\nnaturally do when we start from an uncritical acceptance of the\napparent dicta of physics, that _matter_ is what is \"really real\" in\nthe physical world, and that the immediate objects of sense are mere\nphantasms, we must regard matter as a logical construction, of which\nthe constituents will be just such evanescent particulars as may, when\nan observer happens to be present, become data of sense to that\nobserver. What physics regards as the sun of eight minutes ago will be\na whole assemblage of particulars, existing at different times,\nspreading out from a centre with the velocity of light, and containing\namong their number all those visual data which are seen by people who\nare now looking at the sun. Thus the sun of eight minutes ago is a\nclass of particulars, and what I see when I now look at the sun is one\nmember of this class. The various particulars constituting this class\nwill be correlated with each other by a certain continuity and certain\nintrinsic laws of variation as we pass outwards from the centre,\ntogether with certain modifications correlated extrinsically with\nother particulars which are not members of this class. It is these\nextrinsic modifications which represent the sort of facts that, in our\nformer account, appeared as the influence of the eyes and nerves in\nmodifying the appearance of the sun.[28]\nThe _prima facie_ difficulties in the way of this view are chiefly\nderived from an unduly conventional theory of space. It might seem at\nfirst sight as if we had packed the world much fuller than it could\npossibly hold. At every place between us and the sun, we said, there\nis to be a particular which is to be a member of the sun as it was a\nfew minutes ago. There will also, of course, have to be a particular\nwhich is a member of any planet or fixed star that may happen to be\nvisible from that place. At the place where I am, there will be\nparticulars which will be members severally of all the \"things\" I am\nnow said to be perceiving. Thus throughout the world, everywhere,\nthere will be an enormous number of particulars coexisting in the same\nplace. But these troubles result from contenting ourselves too readily\nwith the merely three-dimensional space to which schoolmasters have\naccustomed us. The space of the real world is a space of six\ndimensions, and as soon as we realise this we see that there is plenty\nof room for all the particulars for which we want to find positions.\nIn order to realise this we have only to return for a moment from the\npolished space of physics to the rough and untidy space of our\nimmediate sensible experience. The space of one man's sensible objects\nis a three-dimensional space. It does not appear probable that two men\never both perceive at the same time any one sensible object; when they\nare said to see the same thing or hear the same noise, there will\nalways be some difference, however slight, between the actual shapes\nseen or the actual sounds heard. If this is so, and if, as is\ngenerally assumed, position in space is purely relative, it follows\nthat the space of one man's objects and the space of another man's\nobjects have no place in common, that they are in fact different\nspaces, and not merely different parts of one space. I mean by this\nthat such immediate spatial relations as are perceived to hold\nbetween the different parts of the sensible space perceived by one\nman, do not hold between parts of sensible spaces perceived by\ndifferent men. There are therefore a multitude of three-dimensional\nspaces in the world: there are all those perceived by observers, and\npresumably also those which are not perceived, merely because no\nobserver is suitably situated for perceiving them.\nBut although these spaces do not have to one another the same kind of\nspatial relations as obtain between the parts of one of them, it is\nnevertheless possible to arrange these spaces themselves in a\nthree-dimensional order. This is done by means of the correlated\nparticulars which we regard as members (or aspects) of one physical\nthing. When a number of people are said to see the same object, those\nwho would be said to be near to the object see a particular occupying\na larger part of their field of vision than is occupied by the\ncorresponding particular seen by people who would be said to be\nfarther from the thing. By means of such considerations it is\npossible, in ways which need not now be further specified, to arrange\nall the different spaces in a three-dimensional series. Since each of\nthe spaces is itself three-dimensional, the whole world of particulars\nis thus arranged in a six-dimensional space, that is to say, six\nco-ordinates will be required to assign completely the position of any\ngiven particular, namely, three to assign its position in its own\nspace and three more to assign the position of its space among the\nother spaces.\nThere are two ways of classifying particulars: we may take together\nall those that belong to a given \"perspective,\" or all those that are,\nas common sense would say, different \"aspects\" of the same \"thing.\"\nFor example, if I am (as is said) seeing the sun, what I see belongs\nto two assemblages: (1) the assemblage of all my present objects of\nsense, which is what I call a \"perspective\"; (2) the assemblage of\nall the different particulars which would be called aspects of the sun\nof eight minutes ago--this assemblage is what I define as _being_ the\nsun of eight minutes ago. Thus \"perspectives\" and \"things\" are merely\ntwo different ways of classifying particulars. It is to be observed\nthat there is no _a priori_ necessity for particulars to be\nsusceptible of this double classification. There may be what might be\ncalled \"wild\" particulars, not having the usual relations by which the\nclassification is effected; perhaps dreams and hallucinations are\ncomposed of particulars which are \"wild\" in this sense.\nThe exact definition of what is meant by a perspective is not quite\neasy. So long as we confine ourselves to visible objects or to objects\nof touch we might define the perspective of a given particular as \"all\nparticulars which have a simple (direct) spatial relation to the given\nparticular.\" Between two patches of colour which I see now, there is a\ndirect spatial relation which I equally see. But between patches of\ncolour seen by different men there is only an indirect constructed\nspatial relation by means of the placing of \"things\" in physical space\n(which is the same as the space composed of perspectives). Those\nparticulars which have direct spatial relations to a given particular\nwill belong to the same perspective. But if, for example, the sounds\nwhich I hear are to belong to the same perspective with the patches of\ncolour which I see, there must be particulars which have no direct\nspatial relation and yet belong to the same perspective. We cannot\ndefine a perspective as all the data of one percipient at one time,\nbecause we wish to allow the possibility of perspectives which are not\nperceived by any one. There will be need, therefore, in defining a\nperspective, of some principle derived neither from psychology nor\nfrom space.\nSuch a principle may be obtained from the consideration of _time_.\nThe one all-embracing time, like the one all-embracing space, is a\nconstruction; there is no _direct_ time-relation between particulars\nbelonging to my perspective and particulars belonging to another\nman's. On the other hand, any two particulars of which I am aware are\neither simultaneous or successive, and their simultaneity or\nsuccessiveness is sometimes itself a datum to me. We may therefore\ndefine the perspective to which a given particular belongs as \"all\nparticulars simultaneous with the given particular,\" where\n\"simultaneous\" is to be understood as a direct simple relation, not\nthe derivative constructed relation of physics. It may be observed\nthat the introduction of \"local time\" suggested by the principle of\nrelativity has effected, for purely scientific reasons, much the same\nmultiplication of times as we have just been advocating.\nThe sum-total of all the particulars that are (directly) either\nsimultaneous with or before or after a given particular may be defined\nas the \"biography\" to which that particular belongs. It will be\nobserved that, just as a perspective need not be actually perceived by\nany one, so a biography need not be actually lived by any one. Those\nbiographies that are lived by no one are called \"official.\"\nThe definition of a \"thing\" is effected by means of continuity and of\ncorrelations which have a certain differential independence of other\n\"things.\" That is to say, given a particular in one perspective, there\nwill usually in a neighbouring perspective be a very similar\nparticular, differing from the given particular, to the first order of\nsmall quantities, according to a law involving only the difference of\nposition of the two perspectives in perspective space, and not any of\nthe other \"things\" in the universe. It is this continuity and\ndifferential independence in the law of change as we pass from one\nperspective to another that defines the class of particulars which is\nto be called \"one thing.\"\nBroadly speaking, we may say that the physicist finds it convenient to\nclassify particulars into \"things,\" while the psychologist finds it\nconvenient to classify them into \"perspectives\" and \"biographies,\"\nsince one perspective _may_ constitute the momentary data of one\npercipient, and one biography _may_ constitute the whole of the data\nof one percipient throughout his life.\nWe may now sum up our discussion. Our object has been to discover as\nfar as possible the nature of the ultimate constituents of the\nphysical world. When I speak of the \"physical world,\" I mean, to begin\nwith, the world dealt with by physics. It is obvious that physics is\nan empirical science, giving us a certain amount of knowledge and\nbased upon evidence obtained through the senses. But partly through\nthe development of physics itself, partly through arguments derived\nfrom physiology, psychology or metaphysics, it has come to be thought\nthat the immediate data of sense could not themselves form part of the\nultimate constituents of the physical world, but were in some sense\n\"mental,\" \"in the mind,\" or \"subjective.\" The grounds for this view,\nin so far as they depend upon physics, can only be adequately dealt\nwith by rather elaborate constructions depending upon symbolic logic,\nshowing that out of such materials as are provided by the senses it is\npossible to construct classes and series having the properties which\nphysics assigns to matter. Since this argument is difficult and\ntechnical, I have not embarked upon it in this article. But in so far\nas the view that sense-data are \"mental\" rests upon physiology,\npsychology, or metaphysics, I have tried to show that it rests upon\nconfusions and prejudices--prejudices in favour of permanence in the\nultimate constituents of matter, and confusions derived from unduly\nsimple notions as to space, from the causal correlation of sense-data\nwith sense-organs, and from failure to distinguish between sense-data\nand sensations. If what we have said on these subjects is valid, the\nexistence of sense-data is logically independent of the existence of\nmind, and is causally dependent upon the _body_ of the percipient\nrather than upon his mind. The causal dependence upon the body of the\npercipient, we found, is a more complicated matter than it appears to\nbe, and, like all causal dependence, is apt to give rise to erroneous\nbeliefs through misconceptions as to the nature of causal correlation.\nIf we have been right in our contentions, sense-data are merely those\namong the ultimate constituents of the physical world, of which we\nhappen to be immediately aware; they themselves are purely physical,\nand all that is mental in connection with them is our awareness of\nthem, which is irrelevant to their nature and to their place in\nphysics.\nUnduly simple notions as to space have been a great stumbling-block to\nrealists. When two men look at the same table, it is supposed that\nwhat the one sees and what the other sees are in the same place. Since\nthe shape and colour are not quite the same for the two men, this\nraises a difficulty, hastily solved, or rather covered up, by\ndeclaring what each sees to be purely \"subjective\"--though it would\npuzzle those who use this glib word to say what they mean by it. The\ntruth seems to be that space--and time also--is much more complicated\nthan it would appear to be from the finished structure of physics, and\nthat the one all-embracing three-dimensional space is a logical\nconstruction, obtained by means of correlations from a crude space of\nsix dimensions. The particulars occupying this six-dimensional space,\nclassified in one way, form \"things,\" from which with certain further\nmanipulations we can obtain what physics can regard as matter;\nclassified in another way, they form \"perspectives\" and \"biographies,\"\nwhich may, if a suitable percipient happens to exist, form\nrespectively the sense-data of a momentary or of a total experience.\nIt is only when physical \"things\" have been dissected into series of\nclasses of particulars, as we have done, that the conflict between the\npoint of view of physics and the point of view of psychology can be\novercome. This conflict, if what has been said is not mistaken, flows\nfrom different methods of classification, and vanishes as soon as its\nsource is discovered.\nIn favour of the theory which I have briefly outlined, I do not claim\nthat it is _certainly_ true. Apart from the likelihood of mistakes,\nmuch of it is avowedly hypothetical. What I do claim for the theory is\nthat it _may_ be true, and that this is more than can be said for any\nother theory except the closely analogous theory of Leibniz. The\ndifficulties besetting realism, the confusions obstructing any\nphilosophical account of physics, the dilemma resulting from\ndiscrediting sense-data, which yet remain the sole source of our\nknowledge of the outer world--all these are avoided by the theory\nwhich I advocate. This does not prove the theory to be true, since\nprobably many other theories might be invented which would have the\nsame merits. But it does prove that the theory has a better chance of\nbeing true than any of its present competitors, and it suggests that\nwhat can be known with certainty is likely to be discoverable by\ntaking our theory as a starting-point, and gradually freeing it from\nall such assumptions as seem irrelevant, unnecessary, or unfounded. On\nthese grounds, I recommend it to attention as a hypothesis and a basis\nfor further work, though not as itself a finished or adequate solution\nof the problem with which it deals.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[23] An address delivered to the Philosophical Society of Manchester\nin February, 1915.

THE PROBLEM STATED\nPhysics is said to be an empirical science, based upon observation and\nexperiment.\nIt is supposed to be verifiable, i.e. capable of calculating\nbeforehand results subsequently confirmed by observation and\nexperiment.\nWhat can we learn by observation and experiment?\nNothing, so far as physics is concerned, except immediate data of\nsense: certain patches of colour, sounds, tastes, smells, etc., with\ncertain spatio-temporal relations.\nThe supposed contents of the physical world are _prima facie_ very\ndifferent from these: molecules have no colour, atoms make no noise,\nelectrons have no taste, and corpuscles do not even smell.\nIf such objects are to be verified, it must be solely through their\nrelation to sense-data: they must have some kind of correlation with\nsense-data, and must be verifiable through their correlation _alone_.\nBut how is the correlation itself ascertained? A correlation can only\nbe ascertained empirically by the correlated objects being constantly\n_found_ together. But in our case, only one term of the correlation,\nnamely, the sensible term, is ever _found_: the other term seems\nessentially incapable of being found. Therefore, it would seem, the\ncorrelation with objects of sense, by which physics was to be\nverified, is itself utterly and for ever unverifiable.\nThere are two ways of avoiding this result.\n(1) We may say that we know some principle _a priori_, without the\nneed of empirical verification, e.g. that our sense-data have _causes_\nother than themselves, and that something can be known about these\ncauses by inference from their effects. This way has been often\nadopted by philosophers. It may be necessary to adopt this way to some\nextent, but in so far as it is adopted physics ceases to be empirical\nor based upon experiment and observation alone. Therefore this way is\nto be avoided as much as possible.\n(2) We may succeed in actually defining the objects of physics as\nfunctions of sense-data. Just in so far as physics leads to\nexpectations, this _must_ be possible, since we can only _expect_ what\ncan be experienced. And in so far as the physical state of affairs is\ninferred from sense-data, it must be capable of expression as a\nfunction of sense-data. The problem of accomplishing this expression\nleads to much interesting logico-mathematical work.\nIn physics as commonly set forth, sense-data appear as functions of\nphysical objects: when such-and-such waves impinge upon the eye, we\nsee such-and-such colours, and so on. But the waves are in fact\ninferred from the colours, not vice versa. Physics cannot be regarded\nas validly based upon empirical data until the waves have been\nexpressed as functions of the colours and other sense-data.\nThus if physics is to be verifiable we are faced with the following\nproblem: Physics exhibits sense-data as functions of physical objects,\nbut verification is only possible if physical objects can be exhibited\nas functions of sense-data. We have therefore to solve the equations\ngiving sense-data in terms of physical objects, so as to make them\ninstead give physical objects in terms of sense-data.\nII. CHARACTERISTICS OF SENSE-DATA\nWhen I speak of a \"sense-datum,\" I do not mean the whole of what is\ngiven in sense at one time. I mean rather such a part of the whole as\nmight be singled out by attention: particular patches of colour,\nparticular noises, and so on. There is some difficulty in deciding\nwhat is to be considered _one_ sense-datum: often attention causes\ndivisions to appear where, so far as can be discovered, there were no\ndivisions before. An observed complex fact, such as that this patch of\nred is to the left of that patch of blue, is also to be regarded as a\ndatum from our present point of view: epistemologically, it does not\ndiffer greatly from a simple sense-datum as regards its function in\ngiving knowledge. Its _logical_ structure is very different, however,\nfrom that of sense: _sense_ gives acquaintance with particulars, and\nis thus a two-term relation in which the object can be _named_ but not\n_asserted_, and is inherently incapable of truth or falsehood, whereas\nthe observation of a complex fact, which may be suitably called\nperception, is not a two-term relation, but involves the propositional\nform on the object-side, and gives knowledge of a truth, not mere\nacquaintance with a particular. This logical difference, important as\nit is, is not very relevant to our present problem; and it will be\nconvenient to regard data of perception as included among sense-data\nfor the purposes of this paper. It is to be observed that the\nparticulars which are constituents of a datum of perception are always\nsense-data in the strict sense.\nConcerning sense-data, we know that they are there while they are\ndata, and this is the epistemological basis of all our knowledge of\nexternal particulars. (The meaning of the word \"external\" of course\nraises problems which will concern us later.) We do not know, except\nby means of more or less precarious inferences, whether the objects\nwhich are at one time sense-data continue to exist at times when they\nare not data. Sense-data at the times when they are data are all that\nwe directly and primitively know of the external world; hence in\nepistemology the fact that they are _data_ is all-important. But the\nfact that they are all that we directly know gives, of course, no\npresumption that they are all that there is. If we could construct an\nimpersonal metaphysic, independent of the accidents of our knowledge\nand ignorance, the privileged position of the actual data would\nprobably disappear, and they would probably appear as a rather\nhaphazard selection from a mass of objects more or less like them. In\nsaying this, I assume only that it is probable that there are\nparticulars with which we are not acquainted. Thus the special\nimportance of sense-data is in relation to epistemology, not to\nmetaphysics. In this respect, physics is to be reckoned as\nmetaphysics: it is impersonal, and nominally pays no special attention\nto sense-data. It is only when we ask how physics can be _known_ that\nthe importance of sense-data re-emerges.\nIII. SENSIBILIA\nI shall give the name _sensibilia_ to those objects which have the\nsame metaphysical and physical status as sense-data, without\nnecessarily being data to any mind. Thus the relation of a _sensibile_\nto a sense-datum is like that of a man to a husband: a man becomes a\nhusband by entering into the relation of marriage, and similarly a\n_sensibile_ becomes a sense-datum by entering into the relation of\nacquaintance. It is important to have both terms; for we wish to\ndiscuss whether an object which is at one time a sense-datum can still\nexist at a time when it is not a sense-datum. We cannot ask \"Can\nsense-data exist without being given?\" for that is like asking \"Can\nhusbands exist without being married?\" We must ask \"Can _sensibilia_\nexist without being given?\" and also \"Can a particular _sensibile_ be\nat one time a sense-datum, and at another not?\" Unless we have the\nword _sensibile_ as well as the word \"sense-datum,\" such questions are\napt to entangle us in trivial logical puzzles.\nIt will be seen that all sense-data are _sensibilia_. It is a\nmetaphysical question whether all _sensibilia_ are sense-data, and an\nepistemological question whether there exist means of inferring\n_sensibilia_ which are not data from those that are.\nA few preliminary remarks, to be amplified as we proceed, will serve\nto elucidate the use which I propose to make of _sensibilia_.\nI regard sense-data as not mental, and as being, in fact, part of the\nactual subject-matter of physics. There are arguments, shortly to be\nexamined, for their subjectivity, but these arguments seem to me only\nto prove _physiological_ subjectivity, i.e. causal dependence on the\nsense-organs, nerves, and brain. The appearance which a thing presents\nto us is causally dependent upon these, in exactly the same way as it\nis dependent upon intervening fog or smoke or coloured glass. Both\ndependences are contained in the statement that the appearance which a\npiece of matter presents when viewed from a given place is a function\nnot only of the piece of matter, but also of the intervening medium.\n(The terms used in this statement--\"matter,\" \"view from a given\nplace,\" \"appearance,\" \"intervening medium\"--will all be defined in the\ncourse of the present paper.) We have not the means of ascertaining\nhow things appear from places not surrounded by brain and nerves and\nsense-organs, because we cannot leave the body; but continuity makes\nit not unreasonable to suppose that they present _some_ appearance at\nsuch places. Any such appearance would be included among _sensibilia_.\nIf--_per impossibile_--there were a complete human body with no mind\ninside it, all those _sensibilia_ would exist, in relation to that\nbody, which would be sense-data if there were a mind in the body. What\nthe mind adds to _sensibilia_, in fact, is _merely_ awareness:\neverything else is physical or physiological.\nIV. SENSE-DATA ARE PHYSICAL\nBefore discussing this question it will be well to define the sense in\nwhich the terms \"mental\" and \"physical\" are to be used. The word\n\"physical,\" in all preliminary discussions, is to be understood as\nmeaning \"what is dealt with by physics.\" Physics, it is plain, tells\nus something about some of the constituents of the actual world; what\nthese constituents are may be doubtful, but it is they that are to be\ncalled physical, whatever their nature may prove to be.\nThe definition of the term \"mental\" is more difficult, and can only be\nsatisfactorily given after many difficult controversies have been\ndiscussed and decided. For present purposes therefore I must content\nmyself with assuming a dogmatic answer to these controversies. I shall\ncall a particular \"mental\" when it is aware of something, and I shall\ncall a fact \"mental\" when it contains a mental particular as a\nconstituent.\nIt will be seen that the mental and the physical are not necessarily\nmutually exclusive, although I know of no reason to suppose that they\noverlap.\nThe doubt as to the correctness of our definition of the \"mental\" is\nof little importance in our present discussion. For what I am\nconcerned to maintain is that sense-data are physical, and this being\ngranted it is a matter of indifference in our present inquiry whether\nor not they are also mental. Although I do not hold, with Mach and\nJames and the \"new realists,\" that the difference between the mental\nand the physical is _merely_ one of arrangement, yet what I have to\nsay in the present paper is compatible with their doctrine and might\nhave been reached from their standpoint.\nIn discussions on sense-data, two questions are commonly confused,\nnamely:\n(1) Do sensible objects persist when we are not sensible of them? in\nother words, do _sensibilia_ which are data at a certain time\nsometimes continue to exist at times when they are not data? And (2)\nare sense-data mental or physical?\nI propose to assert that sense-data are physical, while yet\nmaintaining that they probably never persist unchanged after ceasing\nto be data. The view that they do not persist is often thought, quite\nerroneously in my opinion, to imply that they are mental; and this\nhas, I believe, been a potent source of confusion in regard to our\npresent problem. If there were, as some have held, a _logical\nimpossibility_ in sense-data persisting after ceasing to be data, that\ncertainly would tend to show that they were mental; but if, as I\ncontend, their non-persistence is merely a probable inference from\nempirically ascertained causal laws, then it carries no such\nimplication with it, and we are quite free to treat them as part of\nthe subject-matter of physics.\nLogically a sense-datum is an object, a particular of which the\nsubject is aware. It does not contain the subject as a part, as for\nexample beliefs and volitions do. The existence of the sense-datum is\ntherefore not logically dependent upon that of the subject; for the\nonly way, so far as I know, in which the existence of _A_ can be\n_logically_ dependent upon the existence of _B_ is when _B_ is part of\n_A_. There is therefore no _a priori_ reason why a particular which is\na sense-datum should not persist after it has ceased to be a datum,\nnor why other similar particulars should not exist without ever being\ndata. The view that sense-data are mental is derived, no doubt, in\npart from their physiological subjectivity, but in part also from a\nfailure to distinguish between sense-data and \"sensations.\" By a\nsensation I mean the fact consisting in the subject's awareness of the\nsense-datum. Thus a sensation is a complex of which the subject is a\nconstituent and which therefore is mental. The sense-datum, on the\nother hand, stands over against the subject as that external object of\nwhich in sensation the subject is aware. It is true that the\nsense-datum is in many cases in the subject's body, but the subject's\nbody is as distinct from the subject as tables and chairs are, and is\nin fact merely a part of the material world. So soon, therefore, as\nsense-data are clearly distinguished from sensations, and as their\nsubjectivity is recognised to be physiological not psychical, the\nchief obstacles in the way of regarding them as physical are removed.\nV. \"SENSIBILIA\" AND \"THINGS\"\nBut if \"sensibilia\" are to be recognised as the ultimate constituents\nof the physical world, a long and difficult journey is to be performed\nbefore we can arrive either at the \"thing\" of common sense or at the\n\"matter\" of physics. The supposed impossibility of combining the\ndifferent sense-data which are regarded as appearances of the same\n\"thing\" to different people has made it seem as though these\n\"sensibilia\" must be regarded as mere subjective phantasms. A given\ntable will present to one man a rectangular appearance, while to\nanother it appears to have two acute angles and two obtuse angles; to\none man it appears brown, while to another, towards whom it reflects\nthe light, it appears white and shiny. It is said, not wholly without\nplausibility, that these different shapes and different colours cannot\nco-exist simultaneously in the same place, and cannot therefore both\nbe constituents of the physical world. This argument I must confess\nappeared to me until recently to be irrefutable. The contrary opinion\nhas, however, been ably maintained by Dr. T.P. Nunn in an article\nentitled: \"Are Secondary Qualities Independent of Perception?\"[29] The\nsupposed impossibility derives its apparent force from the phrase:\n\"_in the same place_,\" and it is precisely in this phrase that its\nweakness lies. The conception of space is too often treated in\nphilosophy--even by those who on reflection would not defend such\ntreatment--as though it were as given, simple, and unambiguous as\nKant, in his psychological innocence, supposed. It is the unperceived\nambiguity of the word \"place\" which, as we shall shortly see, has\ncaused the difficulties to realists and given an undeserved advantage\nto their opponents. Two \"places\" of different kinds are involved in\nevery sense-datum, namely the place _at_ which it appears and the\nplace _from_ which it appears. These belong to different spaces,\nalthough, as we shall see, it is possible, with certain limitations,\nto establish a correlation between them. What we call the different\nappearances of the same thing to different observers are each in a\nspace private to the observer concerned. No place in the private world\nof one observer is identical with a place in the private world of\nanother observer. There is therefore no question of combining the\ndifferent appearances in the one place; and the fact that they cannot\nall exist in one place affords accordingly no ground whatever for\nquestioning their physical reality. The \"thing\" of common sense may in\nfact be identified with the whole class of its appearances--where,\nhowever, we must include among appearances not only those which are\nactual sense-data, but also those \"sensibilia,\" if any, which, on\ngrounds of continuity and resemblance, are to be regarded as belonging\nto the same system of appearances, although there happen to be no\nobservers to whom they are data.\nAn example may make this clearer. Suppose there are a number of people\nin a room, all seeing, as they say, the same tables and chairs, walls\nand pictures. No two of these people have exactly the same sense-data,\nyet there is sufficient similarity among their data to enable them to\ngroup together certain of these data as appearances of one \"thing\" to\nthe several spectators, and others as appearances of another \"thing.\"\nBesides the appearances which a given thing in the room presents to\nthe actual spectators, there are, we may suppose, other appearances\nwhich it would present to other possible spectators. If a man were to\nsit down between two others, the appearance which the room would\npresent to him would be intermediate between the appearances which it\npresents to the two others: and although this appearance would not\nexist as it is without the sense organs, nerves and brain, of the\nnewly arrived spectator, still it is not unnatural to suppose that,\nfrom the position which he now occupies, _some_ appearance of the\nroom existed before his arrival. This supposition, however, need\nmerely be noticed and not insisted upon.\nSince the \"thing\" cannot, without indefensible partiality, be\nidentified with any single one of its appearances, it came to be\nthought of as something distinct from all of them and underlying them.\nBut by the principle of Occam's razor, if the class of appearances\nwill fulfil the purposes for the sake of which the thing was invented\nby the prehistoric metaphysicians to whom common sense is due, economy\ndemands that we should identify the thing with the class of its\nappearances. It is not necessary to _deny_ a substance or substratum\nunderlying these appearances; it is merely expedient to abstain from\nasserting this unnecessary entity. Our procedure here is precisely\nanalogous to that which has swept away from the philosophy of\nmathematics the useless menagerie of metaphysical monsters with which\nit used to be infested.\nVI. CONSTRUCTIONS VERSUS INFERENCES\nBefore proceeding to analyse and explain the ambiguities of the word\n\"place,\" a few general remarks on method are desirable. The supreme\nmaxim in scientific philosophising is this:\n_Wherever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted\nfor inferred entities._\nSome examples of the substitution of construction for inference in the\nrealm of mathematical philosophy may serve to elucidate the uses of\nthis maxim. Take first the case of irrationals. In old days,\nirrationals were inferred as the supposed limits of series of\nrationals which had no rational limit; but the objection to this\nprocedure was that it left the existence of irrationals merely\noptative, and for this reason the stricter methods of the present day\nno longer tolerate such a definition. We now define an irrational\nnumber as a certain class of ratios, thus constructing it logically by\nmeans of ratios, instead of arriving at it by a doubtful inference\nfrom them. Take again the case of cardinal numbers. Two equally\nnumerous collections appear to have something in common: this\nsomething is supposed to be their cardinal number. But so long as the\ncardinal number is inferred from the collections, not constructed in\nterms of them, its existence must remain in doubt, unless in virtue of\na metaphysical postulate _ad hoc_. By defining the cardinal number of\na given collection as the class of all equally numerous collections,\nwe avoid the necessity of this metaphysical postulate, and thereby\nremove a needless element of doubt from the philosophy of arithmetic.\nA similar method, as I have shown elsewhere, can be applied to classes\nthemselves, which need not be supposed to have any metaphysical\nreality, but can be regarded as symbolically constructed fictions.\nThe method by which the construction proceeds is closely analogous in\nthese and all similar cases. Given a set of propositions nominally\ndealing with the supposed inferred entities, we observe the properties\nwhich are required of the supposed entities in order to make these\npropositions true. By dint of a little logical ingenuity, we then\nconstruct some logical function of less hypothetical entities which\nhas the requisite properties. This constructed function we substitute\nfor the supposed inferred entities, and thereby obtain a new and less\ndoubtful interpretation of the body of propositions in question. This\nmethod, so fruitful in the philosophy of mathematics, will be found\nequally applicable in the philosophy of physics, where, I do not\ndoubt, it would have been applied long ago but for the fact that all\nwho have studied this subject hitherto have been completely ignorant\nof mathematical logic. I myself cannot claim originality in the\napplication of this method to physics, since I owe the suggestion and\nthe stimulus for its application entirely to my friend and\ncollaborator Dr. Whitehead, who is engaged in applying it to the more\nmathematical portions of the region intermediate between sense-data\nand the points, instants and particles of physics.\nA complete application of the method which substitutes constructions\nfor inferences would exhibit matter wholly in terms of sense-data, and\neven, we may add, of the sense-data of a single person, since the\nsense-data of others cannot be known without some element of\ninference. This, however, must remain for the present an ideal, to be\napproached as nearly as possible, but to be reached, if at all, only\nafter a long preliminary labour of which as yet we can only see the\nvery beginning. The inferences which are unavoidable can, however, be\nsubjected to certain guiding principles. In the first place they\nshould always be made perfectly explicit, and should be formulated in\nthe most general manner possible. In the second place the inferred\nentities should, whenever this can be done, be similar to those whose\nexistence is given, rather than, like the Kantian _Ding an sich_,\nsomething wholly remote from the data which nominally support the\ninference. The inferred entities which I shall allow myself are of two\nkinds: (_a_) the sense-data of other people, in favour of which there\nis the evidence of testimony, resting ultimately upon the analogical\nargument in favour of minds other than my own; (_b_) the \"sensibilia\"\nwhich would appear from places where there happen to be no minds, and\nwhich I suppose to be real although they are no one's data. Of these\ntwo classes of inferred entities, the first will probably be allowed\nto pass unchallenged. It would give me the greatest satisfaction to be\nable to dispense with it, and thus establish physics upon a\nsolipsistic basis; but those--and I fear they are the majority--in\nwhom the human affections are stronger than the desire for logical\neconomy, will, no doubt, not share my desire to render solipsism\nscientifically satisfactory. The second class of inferred entities\nraises much more serious questions. It may be thought monstrous to\nmaintain that a thing can present any appearance at all in a place\nwhere no sense organs and nervous structure exist through which it\ncould appear. I do not myself feel the monstrosity; nevertheless I\nshould regard these supposed appearances only in the light of a\nhypothetical scaffolding, to be used while the edifice of physics is\nbeing raised, though possibly capable of being removed as soon as the\nedifice is completed. These \"sensibilia\" which are not data to anyone\nare therefore to be taken rather as an illustrative hypothesis and as\nan aid in preliminary statement than as a dogmatic part of the\nphilosophy of physics in its final form.\nVII. PRIVATE SPACE AND THE SPACE OF PERSPECTIVES\nWe have now to explain the ambiguity in the word \"place,\" and how it\ncomes that two places of different sorts are associated with every\nsense-datum, namely the place _at_ which it is and the place _from_\nwhich it is perceived. The theory to be advocated is closely analogous\nto Leibniz's monadology, from which it differs chiefly in being less\nsmooth and tidy.\nThe first fact to notice is that, so far as can be discovered, no\nsensibile is ever a datum to two people at once. The things seen by\ntwo different people are often closely similar, so similar that the\nsame _words_ can be used to denote them, without which communication\nwith others concerning sensible objects would be impossible. But, in\nspite of this similarity, it would seem that some difference always\narises from difference in the point of view. Thus each person, so far\nas his sense-data are concerned, lives in a private world. This\nprivate world contains its own space, or rather spaces, for it would\nseem that only experience teaches us to correlate the space of sight\nwith the space of touch and with the various other spaces of other\nsenses. This multiplicity of private spaces, however, though\ninteresting to the psychologist, is of no great importance in regard\nto our present problem, since a merely solipsistic experience enables\nus to correlate them into the one private space which embraces all our\nown sense-data. The place _at_ which a sense-datum is, is a place in\nprivate space. This place therefore is different from any place in the\nprivate space of another percipient. For if we assume, as logical\neconomy demands, that all position is relative, a place is only\ndefinable by the things in or around it, and therefore the same place\ncannot occur in two private worlds which have no common constituent.\nThe question, therefore, of combining what we call different\nappearances of the same thing in the same place does not arise, and\nthe fact that a given object appears to different spectators to have\ndifferent shapes and colours affords no argument against the physical\nreality of all these shapes and colours.\nIn addition to the private spaces belonging to the private worlds of\ndifferent percipients, there is, however, another space, in which one\nwhole private world counts as a point, or at least as a spatial unit.\nThis might be described as the space of points of view, since each\nprivate world may be regarded as the appearance which the universe\npresents from a certain point of view. I prefer, however, to speak of\nit as the space of _perspectives_, in order to obviate the suggestion\nthat a private world is only real when someone views it. And for the\nsame reason, when I wish to speak of a private world without assuming\na percipient, I shall call it a \"perspective.\"\nWe have now to explain how the different perspectives are ordered in\none space. This is effected by means of the correlated \"sensibilia\"\nwhich are regarded as the appearances, in different perspectives, of\none and the same thing. By moving, and by testimony, we discover that\ntwo different perspectives, though they cannot both contain the same\n\"sensibilia,\" may nevertheless contain very similar ones; and the\nspatial order of a certain group of \"sensibilia\" in a private space of\none perspective is found to be identical with, or very similar to, the\nspatial order of the correlated \"sensibilia\" in the private space of\nanother perspective. In this way one \"sensibile\" in one perspective is\ncorrelated with one \"sensibile\" in another. Such correlated\n\"sensibilia\" will be called \"appearances of one thing.\" In Leibniz's\nmonadology, since each monad mirrored the whole universe, there was in\neach perspective a \"sensibile\" which was an appearance of each thing.\nIn our system of perspectives, we make no such assumption of\ncompleteness. A given thing will have appearances in some\nperspectives, but presumably not in certain others. The \"thing\" being\ndefined as the class of its appearances, if [kappa] is the class of\nperspectives in which a certain thing [theta] appears, then [theta] is\na member of the multiplicative class of [kappa], [kappa] being a class\nof mutually exclusive classes of \"sensibilia.\" And similarly a\nperspective is a member of the multiplicative class of the things\nwhich appear in it.\nThe arrangement of perspectives in a space is effected by means of the\ndifferences between the appearances of a given thing in the various\nperspectives. Suppose, say, that a certain penny appears in a number\nof different perspectives; in some it looks larger and in some\nsmaller, in some it looks circular, in others it presents the\nappearance of an ellipse of varying eccentricity. We may collect\ntogether all those perspectives in which the appearance of the penny\nis circular. These we will place on one straight line, ordering them\nin a series by the variations in the apparent size of the penny. Those\nperspectives in which the penny appears as a straight line of a\ncertain thickness will similarly be placed upon a plane (though in\nthis case there will be many different perspectives in which the penny\nis of the same size; when one arrangement is completed these will form\na circle concentric with the penny), and ordered as before by the\napparent size of the penny. By such means, all those perspectives in\nwhich the penny presents a visual appearance can be arranged in a\nthree-dimensional spatial order. Experience shows that the same\nspatial order of perspectives would have resulted if, instead of the\npenny, we had chosen any other thing which appeared in all the\nperspectives in question, or any other method of utilising the\ndifferences between the appearances of the same things in different\nperspectives. It is this empirical fact which has made it possible to\nconstruct the one all-embracing space of physics.\nThe space whose construction has just been explained, and whose\nelements are whole perspectives, will be called \"perspective-space.\"\nVIII. THE PLACING OF \"THINGS\" AND \"SENSIBILIA\" IN PERSPECTIVE SPACE\nThe world which we have so far constructed is a world of six\ndimensions, since it is a three-dimensional series of perspectives,\neach of which is itself three-dimensional. We have now to explain the\ncorrelation between the perspective space and the various private\nspaces contained within the various perspectives severally. It is by\nmeans of this correlation that the one three-dimensional space of\nphysics is constructed; and it is because of the unconscious\nperformance of this correlation that the distinction between\nperspective space and the percipient's private space has been blurred,\nwith disastrous results for the philosophy of physics. Let us revert\nto our penny: the perspectives in which the penny appears larger are\nregarded as being nearer to the penny than those in which it appears\nsmaller, but as far as experience goes the apparent size of the penny\nwill not grow beyond a certain limit, namely, that where (as we say)\nthe penny is so near the eye that if it were any nearer it could not\nbe seen. By touch we may prolong the series until the penny touches\nthe eye, but no further. If we have been travelling along a line of\nperspectives in the previously defined sense, we may, however, by\nimagining the penny removed, prolong the line of perspectives by\nmeans, say, of another penny; and the same may be done with any other\nline of perspectives defined by means of the penny. All these lines\nmeet in a certain place, that is, in a certain perspective. This\nperspective will be defined as \"the place where the penny is.\"\nIt is now evident in what sense two places in constructed physical\nspace are associated with a given \"sensibile.\" There is first the\nplace which is the perspective of which the \"sensibile\" is a member.\nThis is the place _from_ which the \"sensibile\" appears. Secondly there\nis the place where the thing is of which the \"sensibile\" is a member,\nin other words an appearance; this is the place _at_ which the\n\"sensibile\" appears. The \"sensibile\" which is a member of one\nperspective is correlated with another perspective, namely, that which\nis the place where the thing is of which the \"sensibile\" is an\nappearance. To the psychologist the \"place from which\" is the more\ninteresting, and the \"sensibile\" accordingly appears to him subjective\nand where the percipient is. To the physicist the \"place at which\" is\nthe more interesting, and the \"sensibile\" accordingly appears to him\nphysical and external. The causes, limits and partial justification of\neach of these two apparently incompatible views are evident from the\nabove duplicity of places associated with a given \"sensibile.\"\nWe have seen that we can assign to a physical thing a place in the\nperspective space. In this way different parts of our body acquire\npositions in perspective space, and therefore there is a meaning\n(whether true or false need not much concern us) in saying that the\nperspective to which our sense-data belong is inside our head. Since\nour mind is correlated with the perspective to which our sense-data\nbelong, we may regard this perspective as being the position of our\nmind in perspective space. If, therefore, this perspective is, in the\nabove defined sense, inside our head, there is a good meaning for the\nstatement that the mind is in the head. We can now say of the various\nappearances of a given thing that some of them are nearer to the thing\nthan others; those are nearer which belong to perspectives that are\nnearer to \"the place where the thing is.\" We can thus find a meaning,\ntrue or false, for the statement that more is to be learnt about a\nthing by examining it close to than by viewing it from a distance. We\ncan also find a meaning for the phrase \"the things which intervene\nbetween the subject and a thing of which an appearance is a datum to\nhim.\" One reason often alleged for the subjectivity of sense-data is\nthat the appearance of a thing may change when we find it hard to\nsuppose that the thing itself has changed--for example, when the\nchange is due to our shutting our eyes, or to our screwing them up so\nas to make the thing look double. If the thing is defined as the class\nof its appearances (which is the definition adopted above), there is\nof course necessarily _some_ change in the thing whenever any one of\nits appearances changes. Nevertheless there is a very important\ndistinction between two different ways in which the appearances may\nchange. If after looking at a thing I shut my eyes, the appearance of\nmy eyes changes in every perspective in which there is such an\nappearance, whereas most of the appearances of the thing will remain\nunchanged. We may say, as a matter of definition, that a thing changes\nwhen, however near to the thing an appearance of it may be, there are\nchanges in appearances as near as, or still nearer to, the thing. On\nthe other hand we shall say that the change is in some other thing if\nall appearances of the thing which are at not more than a certain\ndistance from the thing remain unchanged, while only comparatively\ndistant appearances of the thing are altered. From this consideration\nwe are naturally led to the consideration of _matter_, which must be\nour next topic.\nIX. THE DEFINITION OF MATTER\nWe defined the \"physical thing\" as the class of its appearances, but\nthis can hardly be taken as a definition of matter. We want to be able\nto express the fact that the appearance of a thing in a given\nperspective is causally affected by the matter between the thing and\nthe perspective. We have found a meaning for \"between a thing and a\nperspective.\" But we want matter to be something other than the whole\nclass of appearances of a thing, in order to state the influence of\nmatter on appearances.\nWe commonly assume that the information we get about a thing is more\naccurate when the thing is nearer. Far off, we see it is a man; then\nwe see it is Jones; then we see he is smiling. Complete accuracy would\nonly be attainable as a limit: if the appearances of Jones as we\napproach him tend towards a limit, that limit may be taken to be what\nJones really is. It is obvious that from the point of view of physics\nthe appearances of a thing close to \"count\" more than the appearances\nfar off. We may therefore set up the following tentative definition:\nThe _matter_ of a given thing is the limit of its appearances as their\ndistance from the thing diminishes.\nIt seems probable that there is something in this definition, but it\nis not quite satisfactory, because empirically there is no such limit\nto be obtained from sense-data. The definition will have to be eked\nout by constructions and definitions. But probably it suggests the\nright direction in which to look.\nWe are now in a position to understand in outline the reverse journey\nfrom matter to sense-data which is performed by physics. The\nappearance of a thing in a given perspective is a function of the\nmatter composing the thing and of the intervening matter. The\nappearance of a thing is altered by intervening smoke or mist, by blue\nspectacles or by alterations in the sense-organs or nerves of the\npercipient (which also must be reckoned as part of the intervening\nmedium). The nearer we approach to the thing, the less its appearance\nis affected by the intervening matter. As we travel further and\nfurther from the thing, its appearances diverge more and more from\ntheir initial character; and the causal laws of their divergence are\nto be stated in terms of the matter which lies between them and the\nthing. Since the appearances at very small distances are less affected\nby causes other than the thing itself, we come to think that the limit\ntowards which these appearances tend as the distance diminishes is\nwhat the thing \"really is,\" as opposed to what it merely seems to be.\nThis, together with its necessity for the statement of causal laws,\nseems to be the source of the entirely erroneous feeling that matter\nis more \"real\" than sense-data.\nConsider for example the infinite divisibility of matter. In looking\nat a given thing and approaching it, one sense-datum will become\nseveral, and each of these will again divide. Thus _one_ appearance\nmay represent _many_ things, and to this process there seems no end.\nHence in the limit, when we approach indefinitely near to the thing\nthere will be an indefinite number of units of matter corresponding to\nwhat, at a finite distance, is only one appearance. This is how\ninfinite divisibility arises.\nThe whole causal efficacy of a thing resides in its matter. This is in\nsome sense an empirical fact, but it would be hard to state it\nprecisely, because \"causal efficacy\" is difficult to define.\nWhat can be known empirically about the matter of a thing is only\napproximate, because we cannot get to know the appearances of the\nthing from very small distances, and cannot accurately infer the limit\nof these appearances. But it _is_ inferred _approximately_ by means of\nthe appearances we can observe. It then turns out that these\nappearances can be exhibited by physics as a function of the matter\nin our immediate neighbourhood; e.g. the visual appearance of a\ndistant object is a function of the light-waves that reach the eyes.\nThis leads to confusions of thought, but offers no real difficulty.\nOne appearance, of a visible object for example, is not sufficient to\ndetermine its other simultaneous appearances, although it goes a\ncertain distance towards determining them. The determination of the\nhidden structure of a thing, so far as it is possible at all, can only\nbe effected by means of elaborate dynamical inferences.\nX. TIME[30]\nIt seems that the one all-embracing time is a construction, like the\none all-embracing space. Physics itself has become conscious of this\nfact through the discussions connected with relativity.\nBetween two perspectives which both belong to one person's experience,\nthere will be a direct time-relation of before and after. This\nsuggests a way of dividing history in the same sort of way as it is\ndivided by different experiences, but without introducing experience\nor anything mental: we may define a \"biography\" as everything that is\n(directly) earlier or later than, or simultaneous with, a given\n\"sensibile.\" This will give a series of perspectives, which _might_\nall form parts of one person's experience, though it is not necessary\nthat all or any of them should actually do so. By this means, the\nhistory of the world is divided into a number of mutually exclusive\nbiographies.\nWe have now to correlate the times in the different biographies. The\nnatural thing would be to say that the appearances of a given\n(momentary) thing in two different perspectives belonging to different\nbiographies are to be taken as simultaneous; but this is not\nconvenient. Suppose _A_ shouts to _B_, and _B_ replies as soon as he\nhears _A's_ shout. Then between _A's_ hearing of his own shout and his\nhearing of _B's_ there is an interval; thus if we made _A's_ and _B's_\nhearing of the same shout exactly simultaneous with each other, we\nshould have events exactly simultaneous with a given event but not\nwith each other. To obviate this, we assume a \"velocity of sound.\"\nThat is, we assume that the time when _B_ hears _A's_ shout is\nhalf-way between the time when _A_ hears his own shout and the time\nwhen he hears _B's_. In this way the correlation is effected.\nWhat has been said about sound applies of course equally to light. The\ngeneral principle is that the appearances, in different perspectives,\nwhich are to be grouped together as constituting what a certain thing\nis at a certain moment, are not to be all regarded as being at that\nmoment. On the contrary they spread outward from the thing with\nvarious velocities according to the nature of the appearances. Since\nno _direct_ means exist of correlating the time in one biography with\nthe time in another, this temporal grouping of the appearances\nbelonging to a given thing at a given moment is in part conventional.\nIts motive is partly to secure the verification of such maxims as that\nevents which are exactly simultaneous with the same event are exactly\nsimultaneous with one another, partly to secure convenience in the\nformulation of causal laws.\nXI. THE PERSISTENCE OF THINGS AND MATTER\nApart from any of the fluctuating hypotheses of physics, three main\nproblems arise in connecting the world of physics with the world of\nsense, namely:\n1. the construction of a single space;\n2. the construction of a single time;\n3. the construction of permanent things or matter.\nWe have already considered the first and second of these problems; it\nremains to consider the third.\nWe have seen how correlated appearances in different perspectives are\ncombined to form one \"thing\" at one moment in the all-embracing time\nof physics. We have now to consider how appearances at different times\nare combined as belonging to one \"thing,\" and how we arrive at the\npersistent \"matter\" of physics. The assumption of permanent substance,\nwhich technically underlies the procedure of physics, cannot of course\nbe regarded as metaphysically legitimate: just as the one thing\nsimultaneously seen by many people is a construction, so the one thing\nseen at different times by the same or different people must be a\nconstruction, being in fact nothing but a certain grouping of certain\n\"sensibilia.\"\nWe have seen that the momentary state of a \"thing\" is an assemblage of\n\"sensibilia,\" in different perspectives, not all simultaneous in the\none constructed time, but spreading out from \"the place where the\nthing is\" with velocities depending upon the nature of the\n\"sensibilia.\" The time _at_ which the \"thing\" is in this state is the\nlower limit of the times at which these appearances occur. We have now\nto consider what leads us to speak of another set of appearances as\nbelonging to the same \"thing\" at a different time.\nFor this purpose, we may, at least to begin with, confine ourselves\nwithin a single biography. If we can always say when two \"sensibilia\"\nin a given biography are appearances of one thing, then, since we have\nseen how to connect \"sensibilia\" in different biographies as\nappearances of the same momentary state of a thing, we shall have all\nthat is necessary for the complete construction of the history of a\nthing.\nIt is to be observed, to begin with, that the identity of a thing for\ncommon sense is not always correlated with the identity of matter for\nphysics. A human body is one persisting thing for common sense, but\nfor physics its matter is constantly changing. We may say, broadly,\nthat the common-sense conception is based upon continuity in\nappearances at the ordinary distances of sense-data, while the\nphysical conception is based upon the continuity of appearances at\nvery small distances from the thing. It is probable that the\ncommon-sense conception is not capable of complete precision. Let us\ntherefore concentrate our attention upon the conception of the\npersistence of matter in physics.\nThe first characteristic of two appearances of the same piece of\nmatter at different times is _continuity_. The two appearances must be\nconnected by a series of intermediaries, which, if time and space form\ncompact series, must themselves form a compact series. The colour of\nthe leaves is different in autumn from what it is in summer; but we\nbelieve that the change occurs gradually, and that, if the colours are\ndifferent at two given times, there are intermediate times at which\nthe colours are intermediate between those at the given times.\nBut there are two considerations that are important as regards\ncontinuity.\nFirst, it is largely hypothetical. We do not observe any one thing\ncontinuously, and it is merely a hypothesis to assume that, while we\nare not observing it, it passes through conditions intermediate\nbetween those in which it is perceived. During uninterrupted\nobservation, it is true, continuity is nearly verified; but even here,\nwhen motions are very rapid, as in the case of explosions, the\ncontinuity is not actually capable of direct verification. Thus we can\nonly say that the sense-data are found to _permit_ a hypothetical\ncomplement of \"sensibilia\" such as will preserve continuity, and that\ntherefore there _may_ be such a complement. Since, however, we have\nalready made such use of hypothetical \"sensibilia,\" we will let this\npoint pass, and admit such \"sensibilia\" as are required to preserve\ncontinuity.\nSecondly, continuity is not a sufficient criterion of material\nidentity. It is true that in many cases, such as rocks, mountains,\ntables, chairs, etc., where the appearances change slowly, continuity\nis sufficient, but in other cases, such as the parts of an\napproximately homogeneous fluid, it fails us utterly. We can travel by\nsensibly continuous gradations from any one drop of the sea at any one\ntime to any other drop at any other time. We infer the motions of\nsea-water from the effects of the current, but they cannot be inferred\nfrom direct sensible observation together with the assumption of\ncontinuity.\nThe characteristic required in addition to continuity is conformity\nwith the laws of dynamics. Starting from what common sense regards as\npersistent things, and making only such modifications as from time to\ntime seem reasonable, we arrive at assemblages of \"sensibilia\" which\nare found to obey certain simple laws, namely those of dynamics. By\nregarding \"sensibilia\" at different times as belonging to the same\npiece of matter, we are able to define _motion_, which presupposes the\nassumption or construction of something persisting throughout the\ntime of the motion. The motions which are regarded as occurring,\nduring a period in which all the \"sensibilia\" and the times of their\nappearance are given, will be different according to the manner in\nwhich we combine \"sensibilia\" at different times as belonging to the\nsame piece of matter. Thus even when the whole history of the world is\ngiven in every particular, the question what motions take place is\nstill to a certain extent arbitrary even after the assumption of\ncontinuity. Experience shows that it is possible to determine motions\nin such a way as to satisfy the laws of dynamics, and that this\ndetermination, roughly and on the whole, is fairly in agreement with\nthe common-sense opinions about persistent things. This determination,\ntherefore, is adopted, and leads to a criterion by which we can\ndetermine, sometimes practically, sometimes only theoretically,\nwhether two appearances at different times are to be regarded as\nbelonging to the same piece of matter. The persistence of all matter\nthroughout all time can, I imagine, be secured by definition.\nTo recommend this conclusion, we must consider what it is that is\nproved by the empirical success of physics. What is proved is that its\nhypotheses, though unverifiable where they go beyond sense-data, are\nat no point in contradiction with sense-data, but, on the contrary,\nare ideally such as to render all sense-data calculable when a\nsufficient collection of \"sensibilia\" is given. Now physics has found\nit empirically possible to collect sense-data into series, each series\nbeing regarded as belonging to one \"thing,\" and behaving, with regard\nto the laws of physics, in a way in which series not belonging to one\nthing would in general not behave. If it is to be unambiguous whether\ntwo appearances belong to the same thing or not, there must be only\none way of grouping appearances so that the resulting things obey the\nlaws of physics. It would be very difficult to prove that this is the\ncase, but for our present purposes we may let this point pass, and\nassume that there is only one way. Thus we may lay down the following\ndefinition: _Physical things are those series of appearances whose\nmatter obeys the laws of physics_. That such series exist is an\nempirical fact, which constitutes the verifiability of physics.\nXII. ILLUSIONS, HALLUCINATIONS, AND DREAMS\nIt remains to ask how, in our system, we are to find a place for\nsense-data which apparently fail to have the usual connection with the\nworld of physics. Such sense-data are of various kinds, requiring\nsomewhat different treatment. But all are of the sort that would be\ncalled \"unreal,\" and therefore, before embarking upon the discussion,\ncertain logical remarks must be made upon the conceptions of reality\nand unreality.\nMr. A. Wolf[31] says:\n\"The conception of mind as a system of transparent activities is,\nI think, also untenable because of its failure to account for the\nvery possibility of dreams and hallucinations. It seems impossible\nto realise how a bare, transparent activity can be directed to\nwhat is not there, to apprehend what is not given.\"\nThis statement is one which, probably, most people would endorse. But\nit is open to two objections. First it is difficult to see how an\nactivity, however un-\"transparent,\" can be directed towards a nothing:\na term of a relation cannot be a mere nonentity. Secondly, no reason\nis given, and I am convinced that none can be given, for the assertion\nthat dream-objects are not \"there\" and not \"given.\" Let us take the\nsecond point first.\n(1) The belief that dream-objects are not given comes, I think, from\nfailure to distinguish, as regards waking life, between the\nsense-datum and the corresponding \"thing.\" In dreams, there is no such\ncorresponding \"thing\" as the dreamer supposes; if, therefore, the\n\"thing\" were given in waking life, as e.g. Meinong maintains,[32] then\nthere would be a difference in respect of givenness between dreams and\nwaking life. But if, as we have maintained, what is given is never the\nthing, but merely one of the \"sensibilia\" which compose the thing,\nthen what we apprehend in a dream is just as much given as what we\napprehend in waking life.\nExactly the same argument applies as to the dream-objects being\n\"there.\" They have their position in the private space of the\nperspective of the dreamer; where they fail is in their correlation\nwith other private spaces and therefore with perspective space. But in\nthe only sense in which \"there\" can be a datum, they are \"there\" just\nas truly as any of the sense-data of waking life.\n(2) The conception of \"illusion\" or \"unreality,\" and the correlative\nconception of \"reality,\" are generally used in a way which embodies\nprofound logical confusions. Words that go in pairs, such as \"real\"\nand \"unreal,\" \"existent\" and \"non-existent,\" \"valid\" and \"invalid,\"\netc., are all derived from the one fundamental pair, \"true\" and\n\"false.\" Now \"true\" and \"false\" are applicable only--except in\nderivative significations--to _propositions_. Thus wherever the above\npairs can be significantly applied, we must be dealing either with\npropositions or with such incomplete phrases as only acquire meaning\nwhen put into a context which, with them, forms a proposition. Thus\nsuch pairs of words can be applied to _descriptions_,[33] but not to\nproper names: in other words, they have no application whatever to\ndata, but only to entities or non-entities described in terms of data.\nLet us illustrate by the terms \"existence\" and \"non-existence.\" Given\nany datum _x_, it is meaningless either to assert or to deny that _x_\n\"exists.\" We might be tempted to say: \"Of course _x_ exists, for\notherwise it could not be a datum.\" But such a statement is really\nmeaningless, although it is significant and true to say \"My present\nsense-datum exists,\" and it may also be true that \"_x_ is my present\nsense-datum.\" The inference from these two propositions to \"_x_\nexists\" is one which seems irresistible to people unaccustomed to\nlogic; yet the apparent proposition inferred is not merely false, but\nstrictly meaningless. To say \"My present sense-datum exists\" is to say\n(roughly): \"There is an object of which 'my present sense-datum' is a\ndescription.\" But we cannot say: \"There is an object of which '_x_' is\na description,\" because '_x_' is (in the case we are supposing) a\nname, not a description. Dr. Whitehead and I have explained this point\nfully elsewhere (_loc. cit._) with the help of symbols, without which\nit is hard to understand; I shall not therefore here repeat the\ndemonstration of the above propositions, but shall proceed with their\napplication to our present problem.\nThe fact that \"existence\" is only applicable to descriptions is\nconcealed by the use of what are grammatically proper names in a way\nwhich really transforms them into descriptions. It is, for example, a\nlegitimate question whether Homer existed; but here \"Homer\" means\n\"the author of the Homeric poems,\" and is a description. Similarly we\nmay ask whether God exists; but then \"God\" means \"the Supreme Being\"\nor \"the _ens realissimum_\" or whatever other description we may\nprefer. If \"God\" were a proper name, God would have to be a datum; and\nthen no question could arise as to His existence. The distinction\nbetween existence and other predicates, which Kant obscurely felt, is\nbrought to light by the theory of descriptions, and is seen to remove\n\"existence\" altogether from the fundamental notions of metaphysics.\nWhat has been said about \"existence\" applies equally to \"reality,\"\nwhich may, in fact, be taken as synonymous with \"existence.\"\nConcerning the immediate objects in illusions, hallucinations, and\ndreams, it is meaningless to ask whether they \"exist\" or are \"real.\"\nThere they are, and that ends the matter. But we may legitimately\ninquire as to the existence or reality of \"things\" or other\n\"sensibilia\" inferred from such objects. It is the unreality of these\n\"things\" and other \"sensibilia,\" together with a failure to notice\nthat they are not data, which has led to the view that the objects of\ndreams are unreal.\nWe may now apply these considerations in detail to the stock arguments\nagainst realism, though what is to be said will be mainly a repetition\nof what others have said before.\n(1) We have first the variety of normal appearances, supposed to be\nincompatible. This is the case of the different shapes and colours\nwhich a given thing presents to different spectators. Locke's water\nwhich seems both hot and cold belongs to this class of cases. Our\nsystem of different perspectives fully accounts for these cases, and\nshows that they afford no argument against realism.\n(2) We have cases where the correlation between different senses is\nunusual. The bent stick in water belongs here. People say it looks\nbent but is straight: this only means that it is straight to the\ntouch, though bent to sight. There is no \"illusion,\" but only a false\ninference, if we think that the stick would feel bent to the touch.\nThe stick would look just as bent in a photograph, and, as Mr.\nGladstone used to say, \"the photograph cannot lie.\"[34] The case of\nseeing double also belongs here, though in this case the cause of the\nunusual correlation is physiological, and would therefore not operate\nin a photograph. It is a mistake to ask whether the \"thing\" is\nduplicated when we see it double. The \"thing\" is a whole system of\n\"sensibilia,\" and it is only those visual \"sensibilia\" which are data\nto the percipient that are duplicated. The phenomenon has a purely\nphysiological explanation; indeed, in view of our having two eyes, it\nis in less need of explanation than the single visual sense-datum\nwhich we normally obtain from the things on which we focus.\n(3) We come now to cases like dreams, which may, at the moment of\ndreaming, contain nothing to arouse suspicion, but are condemned on the\nground of their supposed incompatibility with earlier and later data. Of\ncourse it often happens that dream-objects fail to behave in the\naccustomed manner: heavy objects fly, solid objects melt, babies turn\ninto pigs or undergo even greater changes. But none of these unusual\noccurrences _need_ happen in a dream, and it is not on account of such\noccurrences that dream-objects are called \"unreal.\" It is their lack of\ncontinuity with the dreamer's past and future that makes him, when he\nwakes, condemn them; and it is their lack of correlation with other\nprivate worlds that makes others condemn them. Omitting the latter\nground, our reason for condemning them is that the \"things\" which we\ninfer from them cannot be combined according to the laws of physics with\nthe \"things\" inferred from waking sense-data. This might be used to\ncondemn the \"things\" inferred from the data of dreams. Dream-data are no\ndoubt appearances of \"things,\" but not of such \"things\" as the dreamer\nsupposes. I have no wish to combat psychological theories of dreams,\nsuch as those of the psycho-analysts. But there certainly are cases\nwhere (whatever psychological causes may contribute) the presence of\nphysical causes also is very evident. For instance, a door banging may\nproduce a dream of a naval engagement, with images of battleships and\nsea and smoke. The whole dream will be an appearance of the door\nbanging, but owing to the peculiar condition of the body (especially the\nbrain) during sleep, this appearance is not that expected to be produced\nby a door banging, and thus the dreamer is led to entertain false\nbeliefs. But his sense-data are still physical, and are such as a\ncompleted physics would include and calculate.\n(4) The last class of illusions are those which cannot be discovered\nwithin one person's experience, except through the discovery of\ndiscrepancies with the experiences of others. Dreams might conceivably\nbelong to this class, if they were jointed sufficiently neatly into\nwaking life; but the chief instances are recurrent sensory\nhallucinations of the kind that lead to insanity. What makes the\npatient, in such cases, become what others call insane is the fact\nthat, within his own experience, there is nothing to show that the\nhallucinatory sense-data do not have the usual kind of connection with\n\"sensibilia\" in other perspectives. Of course he may learn this\nthrough testimony, but he probably finds it simpler to suppose that\nthe testimony is untrue and that he is being wilfully deceived. There\nis, so far as I can see, no theoretical criterion by which the patient\ncan decide, in such a case, between the two equally satisfactory\nhypotheses of his madness and of his friends' mendacity.\nFrom the above instances it would appear that abnormal sense-data, of\nthe kind which we regard as deceptive, have intrinsically just the\nsame status as any others, but differ as regards their correlations or\ncausal connections with other \"sensibilia\" and with \"things.\" Since\nthe usual correlations and connections become part of our unreflective\nexpectations, and even seem, except to the psychologist, to form part\nof our data, it comes to be thought, mistakenly, that in such cases\nthe data are unreal, whereas they are merely the causes of false\ninferences. The fact that correlations and connections of unusual\nkinds occur adds to the difficulty of inferring things from sense and\nof expressing physics in terms of sense-data. But the unusualness\nwould seem to be always physically or physiologically explicable, and\ntherefore raises only a complication, not a philosophical objection.\nI conclude, therefore, that no valid objection exists to the view\nwhich regards sense-data as part of the actual substance of the\nphysical world, and that, on the other hand, this view is the only one\nwhich accounts for the empirical verifiability of physics. In the\npresent paper, I have given only a rough preliminary sketch. In\nparticular, the part played by _time_ in the construction of the\nphysical world is, I think, more fundamental than would appear from\nthe above account. I should hope that, with further elaboration, the\npart played by unperceived \"sensibilia\" could be indefinitely\ndiminished, probably by invoking the history of a \"thing\" to eke out\nthe inferences derivable from its momentary appearance.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[29] _Proc.

Dr. James Ward, in his _Naturalism and Agnosticism_,\nmakes this a ground of complaint against physics: the business of\nthose who wish to ascertain the ultimate truth about the world, he\napparently thinks, should be the discovery of causes, yet physics\nnever even seeks them. To me it seems that philosophy ought not to\nassume such legislative functions, and that the reason why physics has\nceased to look for causes is that, in fact, there are no such things.\nThe law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among\nphilosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the\nmonarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm. In\norder to find out what philosophers commonly understand by \"cause,\" I\nconsulted Baldwin's _Dictionary_, and was rewarded beyond my\nexpectations, for I found the following three mutually incompatible\ndefinitions:--\n\"CAUSALITY. (1) The necessary connection of events in the\ntime-series....\n\"CAUSE (notion of). Whatever may be included in the thought or\nperception of a process as taking place in consequence of\nanother process....\n\"CAUSE AND EFFECT. (1) Cause and effect ... are correlative terms\ndenoting any two distinguishable things, phases, or aspects of\nreality, which are so related to each other that whenever the\nfirst ceases to exist the second comes into existence\nimmediately after, and whenever the second comes into existence\nthe first has ceased to exist immediately before.\"\nLet us consider these three definitions in turn. The first, obviously,\nis unintelligible without a definition of \"necessary.\" Under this\nhead, Baldwin's _Dictionary_ gives the following:--\n\"NECESSARY. That is necessary which not only is true, but would\nbe true under all circumstances. Something more than brute\ncompulsion is, therefore, involved in the conception; there is\na general law under which the thing takes place.\"\nThe notion of cause is so intimately connected with that of necessity\nthat it will be no digression to linger over the above definition,\nwith a view to discovering, if possible, _some_ meaning of which it is\ncapable; for, as it stands, it is very far from having any definite\nsignification.\nThe first point to notice is that, if any meaning is to be given to\nthe phrase \"would be true under all circumstances,\" the subject of it\nmust be a propositional function, not a proposition.[35] A\nproposition is simply true or false, and that ends the matter: there\ncan be no question of \"circumstances.\" \"Charles I's head was cut off\"\nis just as true in summer as in winter, on Sundays as on Mondays. Thus\nwhen it is worth saying that something \"would be true under all\ncircumstances,\" the something in question must be a propositional\nfunction, i.e. an expression containing a variable, and becoming a\nproposition when a value is assigned to the variable; the varying\n\"circumstances\" alluded to are then the different values of which the\nvariable is capable. Thus if \"necessary\" means \"what is true under all\ncircumstances,\" then \"if _x_ is a man, _x_ is mortal\" is necessary,\nbecause it is true for any possible value of _x_. Thus we should be\nled to the following definition:--\n\"NECESSARY is a predicate of a propositional function, meaning\nthat it is true for all possible values of its argument or\narguments.\"\nUnfortunately, however, the definition in Baldwin's _Dictionary_ says\nthat what is necessary is not only \"true under all circumstances\" but\nis also \"true.\" Now these two are incompatible. Only propositions can\nbe \"true,\" and only propositional functions can be \"true under all\ncircumstances.\" Hence the definition as it stands is nonsense. What is\nmeant seems to be this: \"A proposition is necessary when it is a value\nof a propositional function which is true under all circumstances,\ni.e. for all values of its argument or arguments.\" But if we adopt\nthis definition, the same proposition will be necessary or contingent\naccording as we choose one or other of its terms as the argument to\nour propositional function. For example, \"if Socrates is a man,\nSocrates is mortal,\" is necessary if Socrates is chosen as argument,\nbut not if _man_ or _mortal_ is chosen. Again, \"if Socrates is a man,\nPlato is mortal,\" will be necessary if either Socrates or _man_ is\nchosen as argument, but not if Plato or _mortal_ is chosen. However,\nthis difficulty can be overcome by specifying the constituent which is\nto be regarded as argument, and we thus arrive at the following\ndefinition:\n\"A proposition is _necessary_ with respect to a given constituent if\nit remains true when that constituent is altered in any way compatible\nwith the proposition remaining significant.\"\nWe may now apply this definition to the definition of causality quoted\nabove. It is obvious that the argument must be the time at which the\nearlier event occurs. Thus an instance of causality will be such as:\n\"If the event [Math: e_{1}] occurs at the time [Math: t_{1}], it will\nbe followed by the event [Math: e_{2}].\" This proposition is intended\nto be necessary with respect to [Math: t_{1}], i.e. to remain true\nhowever [Math: t_{1}] may be varied. Causality, as a universal law,\nwill then be the following: \"Given any event [Math: t_{1}], there is\nan event [Math: e_{2}] such that, whenever [Math: t_{1}] occurs,\n[Math: e_{2}] occurs later.\" But before this can be considered\nprecise, we must specify how much later [Math: e_{2}] is to occur.\nThus the principle becomes:--\n\"Given any event [Math: e_{1}], there is an event [Math: e_{2}] and a\ntime-interval [tau] such that, whenever [Math: e_{1}] occurs, [Math:\ne_{2}] follows after an interval [tau].\"\nI am not concerned as yet to consider whether this law is true or\nfalse. For the present, I am merely concerned to discover what the law\nof causality is supposed to be. I pass, therefore, to the other\ndefinitions quoted above.\nThe second definition need not detain us long, for two reasons. First,\nbecause it is psychological: not the \"thought or perception\" of a\nprocess, but the process itself, must be what concerns us in\nconsidering causality. Secondly, because it is circular: in speaking\nof a process as \"taking place in consequence of\" another process, it\nintroduces the very notion of cause which was to be defined.\nThe third definition is by far the most precise; indeed as regards\nclearness it leaves nothing to be desired. But a great difficulty is\ncaused by the temporal contiguity of cause and effect which the\ndefinition asserts. No two instants are contiguous, since the\ntime-series is compact; hence either the cause or the effect or both\nmust, if the definition is correct, endure for a finite time; indeed,\nby the wording of the definition it is plain that both are assumed to\nendure for a finite time. But then we are faced with a dilemma: if the\ncause is a process involving change within itself, we shall require\n(if causality is universal) causal relations between its earlier and\nlater parts; moreover, it would seem that only the later parts can be\nrelevant to the effect, since the earlier parts are not contiguous to\nthe effect, and therefore (by the definition) cannot influence the\neffect. Thus we shall be led to diminish the duration of the cause\nwithout limit, and however much we may diminish it, there will still\nremain an earlier part which might be altered without altering the\neffect, so that the true cause, as defined, will not have been\nreached, for it will be observed that the definition excludes\nplurality of causes. If, on the other hand, the cause is purely\nstatic, involving no change within itself, then, in the first place,\nno such cause is to be found in nature, and in the second place, it\nseems strange--too strange to be accepted, in spite of bare logical\npossibility--that the cause, after existing placidly for some time,\nshould suddenly explode into the effect, when it might just as well\nhave done so at any earlier time, or have gone on unchanged without\nproducing its effect. This dilemma, therefore, is fatal to the view\nthat cause and effect can be contiguous in time; if there are causes\nand effects, they must be separated by a finite time-interval [tau],\nas was assumed in the above interpretation of the first definition.\nWhat is essentially the same statement of the law of causality as the\none elicited above from the first of Baldwin's definitions is given by\nother philosophers. Thus John Stuart Mill says:--\n\"The Law of Causation, the recognition of which is the main pillar of\ninductive science, is but the familiar truth, that invariability of\nsuccession is found by observation to obtain between every fact in\nnature and some other fact which has preceded it.\"[36]\nAnd Bergson, who has rightly perceived that the law as stated by\nphilosophers is worthless, nevertheless continues to suppose that it\nis used in science. Thus he says:--\n\"Now, it is argued, this law [the law of causality] means that every\nphenomenon is determined by its conditions, or, in other words, that\nthe same causes produce the same effects.\"[37]\nAnd again:--\n\"We perceive physical phenomena, and these phenomena obey laws. This\nmeans: (1) That phenomena _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, previously perceived,\ncan occur again in the same shape; (2) that a certain phenomenon P,\nwhich appeared after the conditions _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and after\nthese conditions only, will not fail to recur as soon as the same\nconditions are again present.\"[38]\nA great part of Bergson's attack on science rests on the assumption\nthat it employs this principle. In fact, it employs no such principle,\nbut philosophers--even Bergson--are too apt to take their views on\nscience from each other, not from science. As to what the principle\nis, there is a fair consensus among philosophers of different schools.\nThere are, however, a number of difficulties which at once arise. I\nomit the question of plurality of causes for the present, since other\ngraver questions have to be considered. Two of these, which are forced\non our attention by the above statement of the law, are the\nfollowing:--\n(1) What is meant by an \"event\"?\n(2) How long may the time-interval be between cause and effect?\n(1) An \"event,\" in the statement of the law, is obviously intended to\nbe something that is likely to recur since otherwise the law becomes\ntrivial. It follows that an \"event\" is not a particular, but some\nuniversal of which there may be many instances. It follows also that\nan \"event\" must be something short of the whole state of the universe,\nsince it is highly improbable that this will recur. What is meant by\nan \"event\" is something like striking a match, or dropping a penny\ninto the slot of an automatic machine. If such an event is to recur,\nit must not be defined too narrowly: we must not state with what\ndegree of force the match is to be struck, nor what is to be the\ntemperature of the penny. For if such considerations were relevant,\nour \"event\" would occur at most once, and the law would cease to give\ninformation. An \"event,\" then, is a universal defined sufficiently\nwidely to admit of many particular occurrences in time being instances\nof it.\n(2) The next question concerns the time-interval. Philosophers, no\ndoubt, think of cause and effect as contiguous in time, but this, for\nreasons already given, is impossible. Hence, since there are no\ninfinitesimal time-intervals, there must be some finite lapse of time\n[tau] between cause and effect. This, however, at once raises\ninsuperable difficulties. However short we make the interval [tau],\nsomething may happen during this interval which prevents the expected\nresult. I put my penny in the slot, but before I can draw out my\nticket there is an earthquake which upsets the machine and my\ncalculations. In order to be sure of the expected effect, we must know\nthat there is nothing in the environment to interfere with it. But\nthis means that the supposed cause is not, by itself, adequate to\ninsure the effect. And as soon as we include the environment, the\nprobability of repetition is diminished, until at last, when the whole\nenvironment is included, the probability of repetition becomes almost\n_nil_.\nIn spite of these difficulties, it must, of course, be admitted that\nmany fairly dependable regularities of sequence occur in daily life.\nIt is these regularities that have suggested the supposed law of\ncausality; where they are found to fail, it is thought that a better\nformulation could have been found which would have never failed. I am\nfar from denying that there may be such sequences which in fact never\ndo fail. It may be that there will never be an exception to the rule\nthat when a stone of more than a certain mass, moving with more than a\ncertain velocity, comes in contact with a pane of glass of less than\na certain thickness, the glass breaks. I also do not deny that the\nobservation of such regularities, even when they are not without\nexceptions, is useful in the infancy of a science: the observation\nthat unsupported bodies in air usually fall was a stage on the way to\nthe law of gravitation. What I deny is that science assumes the\nexistence of invariable uniformities of sequence of this kind, or that\nit aims at discovering them. All such uniformities, as we saw, depend\nupon a certain vagueness in the definition of the \"events.\" That\nbodies fall is a vague qualitative statement; science wishes to know\nhow fast they fall. This depends upon the shape of the bodies and the\ndensity of the air. It is true that there is more nearly uniformity\nwhen they fall in a vacuum; so far as Galileo could observe, the\nuniformity is then complete. But later it appeared that even there the\nlatitude made a difference, and the altitude. Theoretically, the\nposition of the sun and moon must make a difference. In short, every\nadvance in a science takes us farther away from the crude uniformities\nwhich are first observed, into greater differentiation of antecedent\nand consequent, and into a continually wider circle of antecedents\nrecognised as relevant.\nThe principle \"same cause, same effect,\" which philosophers imagine to\nbe vital to science, is therefore utterly otiose. As soon as the\nantecedents have been given sufficiently fully to enable the\nconsequent to be calculated with some exactitude, the antecedents have\nbecome so complicated that it is very unlikely they will ever recur.\nHence, if this were the principle involved, science would remain\nutterly sterile.\nThe importance of these considerations lies partly in the fact that\nthey lead to a more correct account of scientific procedure, partly in\nthe fact that they remove the analogy with human volition which makes\nthe conception of cause such a fruitful source of fallacies. The\nlatter point will become clearer by the help of some illustrations.\nFor this purpose I shall consider a few maxims which have played a\ngreat part in the history of philosophy.\n(1) \"Cause and effect must more or less resemble each other.\" This\nprinciple was prominent in the philosophy of occasionalism, and is\nstill by no means extinct. It is still often thought, for example,\nthat mind could not have grown up in a universe which previously\ncontained nothing mental, and one ground for this belief is that\nmatter is too dissimilar from mind to have been able to cause it. Or,\nmore particularly, what are termed the nobler parts of our nature are\nsupposed to be inexplicable, unless the universe always contained\nsomething at least equally noble which could cause them. All such\nviews seem to depend upon assuming some unduly simplified law of\ncausality; for, in any legitimate sense of \"cause\" and \"effect,\"\nscience seems to show that they are usually very widely dissimilar,\nthe \"cause\" being, in fact, two states of the whole universe, and the\n\"effect\" some particular event.\n(2) \"Cause is analogous to volition, since there must be an\nintelligible _nexus_ between cause and effect.\" This maxim is, I\nthink, often unconsciously in the imaginations of philosophers who\nwould reject it when explicitly stated. It is probably operative in\nthe view we have just been considering, that mind could not have\nresulted from a purely material world. I do not profess to know what\nis meant by \"intelligible\"; it seems to mean \"familiar to\nimagination.\" Nothing is less \"intelligible,\" in any other sense, than\nthe connection between an act of will and its fulfilment. But\nobviously the sort of nexus desired between cause and effect is such\nas could only hold between the \"events\" which the supposed law of\ncausality contemplates; the laws which replace causality in such a\nscience as physics leave no room for any two events between which a\nnexus could be sought.\n(3) \"The cause _compels_ the effect in some sense in which the effect\ndoes not compel the cause.\" This belief seems largely operative in the\ndislike of determinism; but, as a matter of fact, it is connected with\nour second maxim, and falls as soon as that is abandoned. We may\ndefine \"compulsion\" as follows: \"Any set of circumstances is said to\ncompel A when A desires to do something which the circumstances\nprevent, or to abstain from something which the circumstances cause.\"\nThis presupposes that some meaning has been found for the word\n\"cause\"--a point to which I shall return later. What I want to make\nclear at present is that compulsion is a very complex notion,\ninvolving thwarted desire. So long as a person does what he wishes to\ndo, there is no compulsion, however much his wishes may be calculable\nby the help of earlier events. And where desire does not come in,\nthere can be no question of compulsion. Hence it is, in general,\nmisleading to regard the cause as compelling the effect.\nA vaguer form of the same maxim substitutes the word \"determine\" for\nthe word \"compel\"; we are told that the cause _determines_ the effect\nin a sense in which the effect does not _determine_ the cause. It is\nnot quite clear what is meant by \"determining\"; the only precise\nsense, so far as I know, is that of a function or one-many relation.\nIf we admit plurality of causes, but not of effects, that is, if we\nsuppose that, given the cause, the effect must be such and such, but,\ngiven the effect, the cause may have been one of many alternatives,\nthen we may say that the cause determines the effect, but not the\neffect the cause. Plurality of causes, however, results only from\nconceiving the effect vaguely and narrowly and the cause precisely and\nwidely. Many antecedents may \"cause\" a man's death, because his death\nis vague and narrow. But if we adopt the opposite course, taking as\nthe \"cause\" the drinking of a dose of arsenic, and as the \"effect\" the\nwhole state of the world five minutes later, we shall have plurality\nof effects instead of plurality of causes. Thus the supposed lack of\nsymmetry between \"cause\" and \"effect\" is illusory.\n(4) \"A cause cannot operate when it has ceased to exist, because what\nhas ceased to exist is nothing.\" This is a common maxim, and a still\nmore common unexpressed prejudice. It has, I fancy, a good deal to do\nwith the attractiveness of Bergson's \"_dur\u00e9e_\": since the past has\neffects now, it must still exist in some sense. The mistake in this\nmaxim consists in the supposition that causes \"operate\" at all. A\nvolition \"operates\" when what it wills takes place; but nothing can\noperate except a volition. The belief that causes \"operate\" results\nfrom assimilating them, consciously or unconsciously, to volitions. We\nhave already seen that, if there are causes at all, they must be\nseparated by a finite interval of time from their effects, and thus\ncause their effects after they have ceased to exist.\nIt may be objected to the above definition of a volition \"operating\"\nthat it only operates when it \"causes\" what it wills, not when it\nmerely happens to be followed by what it wills. This certainly\nrepresents the usual view of what is meant by a volition \"operating,\"\nbut as it involves the very view of causation which we are engaged in\ncombating, it is not open to us as a definition. We may say that a\nvolition \"operates\" when there is some law in virtue of which a\nsimilar volition in rather similar circumstances will usually be\nfollowed by what it wills. But this is a vague conception, and\nintroduces ideas which we have not yet considered. What is chiefly\nimportant to notice is that the usual notion of \"operating\" is not\nopen to us if we reject, as I contend that we should, the usual notion\nof causation.\n(5) \"A cause cannot operate except where it is.\" This maxim is very\nwidespread; it was urged against Newton, and has remained a source of\nprejudice against \"action at a distance.\" In philosophy it has led to\na denial of transient action, and thence to monism or Leibnizian\nmonadism. Like the analogous maxim concerning temporal contiguity, it\nrests upon the assumption that causes \"operate,\" i.e. that they are in\nsome obscure way analogous to volitions. And, as in the case of\ntemporal contiguity, the inferences drawn from this maxim are wholly\ngroundless.\nI return now to the question, What law or laws can be found to take\nthe place of the supposed law of causality?\nFirst, without passing beyond such uniformities of sequence as are\ncontemplated by the traditional law, we may admit that, if any such\nsequence has been observed in a great many cases, and has never been\nfound to fail, there is an inductive probability that it will be found\nto hold in future cases. If stones have hitherto been found to break\nwindows, it is probable that they will continue to do so. This, of\ncourse, assumes the inductive principle, of which the truth may\nreasonably be questioned; but as this principle is not our present\nconcern, I shall in this discussion treat it as indubitable. We may\nthen say, in the case of any such frequently observed sequence, that\nthe earlier event is the _cause_ and the later event the _effect_.\nSeveral considerations, however, make such special sequences very\ndifferent from the traditional relation of cause and effect. In the\nfirst place, the sequence, in any hitherto unobserved instance, is no\nmore than probable, whereas the relation of cause and effect was\nsupposed to be necessary. I do not mean by this merely that we are not\nsure of having discovered a true case of cause and effect; I mean\nthat, even when we have a case of cause and effect in our present\nsense, all that is meant is that on grounds of observation, it is\nprobable that when one occurs the other will also occur. Thus in our\npresent sense, A may be the cause of B even if there actually are\ncases where B does not follow A. Striking a match will be the cause of\nits igniting, in spite of the fact that some matches are damp and fail\nto ignite.\nIn the second place, it will not be assumed that _every_ event has\nsome antecedent which is its cause in this sense; we shall only\nbelieve in causal sequences where we find them, without any\npresumption that they always are to be found.\nIn the third place, _any_ case of sufficiently frequent sequence will\nbe causal in our present sense; for example, we shall not refuse to\nsay that night is the cause of day. Our repugnance to saying this\narises from the ease with which we can imagine the sequence to fail,\nbut owing to the fact that cause and effect must be separated by a\nfinite interval of time, _any_ such sequence _might_ fail through the\ninterposition of other circumstances in the interval. Mill, discussing\nthis instance of night and day, says:--\n\"It is necessary to our using the word cause, that we should believe\nnot only that the antecedent always _has_ been followed by the\nconsequent, but that as long as the present constitution of things\nendures, it always _will_ be so.\"[39]\nIn this sense, we shall have to give up the hope of finding causal\nlaws such as Mill contemplated; any causal sequence which we have\nobserved may at any moment be falsified without a falsification of any\nlaws of the kind that the more advanced sciences aim at establishing.\nIn the fourth place, such laws of probable sequence, though useful in\ndaily life and in the infancy of a science, tend to be displaced by\nquite different laws as soon as a science is successful. The law of\ngravitation will illustrate what occurs in any advanced science. In\nthe motions of mutually gravitating bodies, there is nothing that can\nbe called a cause, and nothing that can be called an effect; there is\nmerely a formula. Certain differential equations can be found, which\nhold at every instant for every particle of the system, and which,\ngiven the configuration and velocities at one instant, or the\nconfigurations at two instants, render the configuration at any other\nearlier or later instant theoretically calculable. That is to say, the\nconfiguration at any instant is a function of that instant and the\nconfigurations at two given instants. This statement holds throughout\nphysics, and not only in the special case of gravitation. But there is\nnothing that could be properly called \"cause\" and nothing that could\nbe properly called \"effect\" in such a system.\nNo doubt the reason why the old \"law of causality\" has so long\ncontinued to pervade the books of philosophers is simply that the idea\nof a function is unfamiliar to most of them, and therefore they seek\nan unduly simplified statement. There is no question of repetitions of\nthe \"same\" cause producing the \"same\" effect; it is not in any\nsameness of causes and effects that the constancy of scientific law\nconsists, but in sameness of relations. And even \"sameness of\nrelations\" is too simple a phrase; \"sameness of differential\nequations\" is the only correct phrase. It is impossible to state this\naccurately in non-mathematical language; the nearest approach would be\nas follows: \"There is a constant relation between the state of the\nuniverse at any instant and the rate of change in the rate at which\nany part of the universe is changing at that instant, and this\nrelation is many-one, i.e. such that the rate of change in the rate of\nchange is determinate when the state of the universe is given.\" If the\n\"law of causality\" is to be something actually discoverable in the\npractice of science, the above proposition has a better right to the\nname than any \"law of causality\" to be found in the books of\nphilosophers.\nIn regard to the above principle, several observations must be made--\n(1) No one can pretend that the above principle is _a priori_ or\nself-evident or a \"necessity of thought.\" Nor is it, in any sense, a\npremiss of science: it is an empirical generalisation from a number of\nlaws which are themselves empirical generalisations.\n(2) The law makes no difference between past and future: the future\n\"determines\" the past in exactly the same sense in which the past\n\"determines\" the future. The word \"determine,\" here, has a purely\nlogical significance: a certain number of variables \"determine\"\nanother variable if that other variable is a function of them.\n(3) The law will not be empirically verifiable unless the course of\nevents within some sufficiently small volume will be approximately\nthe same in any two states of the universe which only differ in regard\nto what is at a considerable distance from the small volume in\nquestion. For example, motions of planets in the solar system must be\napproximately the same however the fixed stars may be distributed,\nprovided that all the fixed stars are very much farther from the sun\nthan the planets are. If gravitation varied directly as the distance,\nso that the most remote stars made the most difference to the motions\nof the planets, the world might be just as regular and just as much\nsubject to mathematical laws as it is at present, but we could never\ndiscover the fact.\n(4) Although the old \"law of causality\" is not assumed by science,\nsomething which we may call the \"uniformity of nature\" is assumed, or\nrather is accepted on inductive grounds. The uniformity of nature does\nnot assert the trivial principle \"same cause, same effect,\" but the\nprinciple of the permanence of laws. That is to say, when a law\nexhibiting, e.g. an acceleration as a function of the configuration\nhas been found to hold throughout the observable past, it is expected\nthat it will continue to hold in the future, or that, if it does not\nitself hold, there is some other law, agreeing with the supposed law\nas regards the past, which will hold for the future. The ground of\nthis principle is simply the inductive ground that it has been found\nto be true in very many instances; hence the principle cannot be\nconsidered certain, but only probable to a degree which cannot be\naccurately estimated.\nThe uniformity of nature, in the above sense, although it is assumed\nin the practice of science, must not, in its generality, be regarded\nas a kind of major premiss, without which all scientific reasoning\nwould be in error. The assumption that _all_ laws of nature are\npermanent has, of course, less probability than the assumption that\nthis or that particular law is permanent; and the assumption that a\nparticular law is permanent for all time has less probability than the\nassumption that it will be valid up to such and such a date. Science,\nin any given case, will assume what the case requires, but no more. In\nconstructing the _Nautical Almanac_ for 1915 it will assume that the\nlaw of gravitation will remain true up to the end of that year; but it\nwill make no assumption as to 1916 until it comes to the next volume\nof the almanac. This procedure is, of course, dictated by the fact\nthat the uniformity of nature is not known _a priori_, but is an\nempirical generalisation, like \"all men are mortal.\" In all such\ncases, it is better to argue immediately from the given particular\ninstances to the new instance, than to argue by way of a major\npremiss; the conclusion is only probable in either case, but acquires\na higher probability by the former method than by the latter.\nIn all science we have to distinguish two sorts of laws: first, those\nthat are empirically verifiable but probably only approximate;\nsecondly, those that are not verifiable, but may be exact. The law of\ngravitation, for example, in its applications to the solar system, is\nonly empirically verifiable when it is assumed that matter outside the\nsolar system may be ignored for such purposes; we believe this to be\nonly approximately true, but we cannot empirically verify the law of\nuniversal gravitation which we believe to be exact. This point is very\nimportant in connection with what we may call \"relatively isolated\nsystems.\" These may be defined as follows:--\nA system relatively isolated during a given period is one which,\nwithin some assignable margin of error, will behave in the same way\nthroughout that period, however the rest of the universe may be\nconstituted.\nA system may be called \"practically isolated\" during a given period\nif, although there _might_ be states of the rest of the universe which\nwould produce more than the assigned margin of error, there is reason\nto believe that such states do not in fact occur.\nStrictly speaking, we ought to specify the respect in which the system\nis relatively isolated. For example, the earth is relatively isolated\nas regards falling bodies, but not as regards tides; it is\n_practically_ isolated as regards economic phenomena, although, if\nJevons' sunspot theory of commercial crises had been true, it would\nnot have been even practically isolated in this respect.\nIt will be observed that we cannot prove in advance that a system is\nisolated. This will be inferred from the observed fact that\napproximate uniformities can be stated for this system alone. If the\ncomplete laws for the whole universe were known, the isolation of a\nsystem could be deduced from them; assuming, for example, the law of\nuniversal gravitation, the practical isolation of the solar system in\nthis respect can be deduced by the help of the fact that there is very\nlittle matter in its neighbourhood. But it should be observed that\nisolated systems are only important as providing a possibility of\n_discovering_ scientific laws; they have no theoretical importance in\nthe finished structure of a science.\nThe case where one event A is said to \"cause\" another event B, which\nphilosophers take as fundamental, is really only the most simplified\ninstance of a practically isolated system. It may happen that, as a\nresult of general scientific laws, whenever A occurs throughout a\ncertain period, it is followed by B; in that case, A and B form a\nsystem which is practically isolated throughout that period. It is,\nhowever, to be regarded as a piece of good fortune if this occurs; it\nwill always be due to special circumstances, and would not have been\ntrue if the rest of the universe had been different though subject to\nthe same laws.\nThe essential function which causality has been supposed to perform is\nthe possibility of inferring the future from the past, or, more\ngenerally, events at any time from events at certain assigned times.\nAny system in which such inference is possible may be called a\n\"deterministic\" system. We may define a deterministic system as\nfollows:--\nA system is said to be \"deterministic\" when, given certain data,\n[Math: e_{1}, e_{2}, ..., e_{n}, at times t_{1}, t_{2}, ...,\nt_{n}] respectively, concerning this system, if [Math: E_{t}] is\nthe state of the system at any time _t_, there is a functional\nrelation of the form\n[Math: E_{t} = f (e_{1}, t_{1}, e_{2}, t_{2}, ..., e_{n}, t_{n}, t)]. (A)\nThe system will be \"deterministic throughout a given period\" if\n_t_, in the above formula, may be any time within that period,\nthough outside that period the formula may be no longer true. If\nthe universe, as a whole, is such a system, determinism is true of\nthe universe; if not, not. A system which is part of a\ndeterministic system I shall call \"determined\"; one which is not\npart of any such system I shall call \"capricious.\"\nThe events [Math: e_{1}, e_{2}, ..., e_{n}] I shall call \"determinants\"\nof the system. It is to be observed that a system which has one set of\ndeterminants will in general have many. In the case of the motions of\nthe planets, for example, the configurations of the solar system at any\ntwo given times will be determinants.\nWe may take another illustration from the hypothesis of\npsycho-physical parallelism. Let us assume, for the purposes of this\nillustration, that to a given state of brain a given state of mind\nalways corresponds, and vice versa, i.e. that there is a one-one\nrelation between them, so that each is a function of the other. We may\nalso assume, what is practically certain, that to a given state of a\ncertain brain a given state of the whole material universe\ncorresponds, since it is highly improbable that a given brain is ever\ntwice in exactly the same state. Hence there will be a one-one\nrelation between the state of a given person's mind and the state of\nthe whole material universe. It follows that, if _n_ states of the\nmaterial universe are determinants of the material universe, then _n_\nstates of a given man's mind are determinants of the whole material\nand mental universe--assuming, that is to say, that psycho-physical\nparallelism is true.\nThe above illustration is important in connection with a certain\nconfusion which seems to have beset those who have philosophised on\nthe relation of mind and matter. It is often thought that, if the\nstate of the mind is determinate when the state of the brain is given,\nand if the material world forms a deterministic system, then mind is\n\"subject\" to matter in some sense in which matter is not \"subject\" to\nmind. But if the state of the brain is also determinate when the state\nof the mind is given, it must be exactly as true to regard matter as\nsubject to mind as it would be to regard mind as subject to matter. We\ncould, theoretically, work out the history of mind without ever\nmentioning matter, and then, at the end, deduce that matter must\nmeanwhile have gone through the corresponding history. It is true that\nif the relation of brain to mind were many-one, not one-one, there\nwould be a one-sided dependence of mind on brain, while conversely, if\nthe relation were one-many, as Bergson supposes, there would be a\none-aided dependence of brain on mind. But the dependence involved is,\nin any case, only logical; it does not mean that we shall be\ncompelled to do things we desire not to do, which is what people\ninstinctively imagine it to mean.\nAs another illustration we may take the case of mechanism and\nteleology. A system may be defined as \"mechanical\" when it has a set\nof determinants that are purely material, such as the positions of\ncertain pieces of matter at certain times. It is an open question\nwhether the world of mind and matter, as we know it, is a mechanical\nsystem or not; let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that it is a\nmechanical system. This supposition--so I contend--throws no light\nwhatever on the question whether the universe is or is not a\n\"teleological\" system. It is difficult to define accurately what is\nmeant by a \"teleological\" system, but the argument is not much\naffected by the particular definition we adopt. Broadly, a\nteleological system is one in which purposes are realised, i.e. in\nwhich certain desires--those that are deeper or nobler or more\nfundamental or more universal or what not--are followed by their\nrealisation. Now the fact--if it be a fact--that the universe is\nmechanical has no bearing whatever on the question whether it is\nteleological in the above sense. There might be a mechanical system in\nwhich all wishes were realised, and there might be one in which all\nwishes were thwarted. The question whether, or how far, our actual\nworld is teleological, cannot, therefore, be settled by proving that\nit is mechanical, and the desire that it should be teleological is no\nground for wishing it to be not mechanical.\nThere is, in all these questions, a very great difficulty in avoiding\nconfusion between what we can infer and what is in fact determined.\nLet us consider, for a moment, the various senses in which the future\nmay be \"determined.\" There is one sense--and a very important one--in\nwhich it is determined quite independently of scientific laws, namely,\nthe sense that it will be what it will be. We all regard the past as\ndetermined simply by the fact that it has happened; but for the\naccident that memory works backward and not forward, we should regard\nthe future as equally determined by the fact that it will happen.\n\"But,\" we are told, \"you cannot alter the past, while you can to some\nextent alter the future.\" This view seems to me to rest upon just\nthose errors in regard to causation which it has been my object to\nremove. You cannot make the past other than it was--true, but this is\na mere application of the law of contradiction. If you already know\nwhat the past was, obviously it is useless to wish it different. But\nalso you cannot make the future other than it will be; this again is\nan application of the law of contradiction. And if you happen to know\nthe future--e.g. in the case of a forthcoming eclipse--it is just as\nuseless to wish it different as to wish the past different. \"But,\" it\nwill be rejoined, \"our wishes can _cause_ the future, sometimes, to be\ndifferent from what it would be if they did not exist, and they can\nhave no such effect upon the past.\" This, again, is a mere tautology.\nAn effect being _defined_ as something subsequent to its cause,\nobviously we can have no _effect_ upon the past. But that does not\nmean that the past would not have been different if our present wishes\nhad been different. Obviously, our present wishes are conditioned by\nthe past, and therefore could not have been different unless the past\nhad been different; therefore, if our present wishes were different,\nthe past would be different. Of course, the past cannot be different\nfrom what it was, but no more can our present wishes be different from\nwhat they are; this again is merely the law of contradiction. The\nfacts seem to be merely (1) that wishing generally depends upon\nignorance, and is therefore commoner in regard to the future than in\nregard to the past; (2) that where a wish concerns the future, it and\nits realisation very often form a \"practically independent system,\"\ni.e. many wishes regarding the future are realised. But there seems no\ndoubt that the main difference in our feelings arises from the\naccidental fact that the past but not the future can be known by\nmemory.\nAlthough the sense of \"determined\" in which the future is determined\nby the mere fact that it will be what it will be is sufficient (at\nleast so it seems to me) to refute some opponents of determinism,\nnotably M. Bergson and the pragmatists, yet it is not what most people\nhave in mind when they speak of the future as determined. What they\nhave in mind is a formula by means of which the future can be\nexhibited, and at least theoretically calculated, as a function of the\npast. But at this point we meet with a great difficulty, which besets\nwhat has been said above about deterministic systems, as well as what\nis said by others.\nIf formul\u00e6 of any degree of complexity, however great, are admitted,\nit would seem that any system, whose state at a given moment is a\nfunction of certain measurable quantities, must be a deterministic\nsystem. Let us consider, in illustration, a single material particle,\nwhose co-ordinates at time _t_ are [Math: x_{t}, y_{t}, z_{t}]. Then,\nhowever, the particle moves, there must be, theoretically, functions\n[Math: f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}], such that\n[Math: x_{t} = f_{t}(t), y_{t} = f_{2}(t), z_{t} = f_{3}(t).]\nIt follows that, theoretically, the whole state of the material\nuniverse at time _t_ must be capable of being exhibited as a function\nof _t_. Hence our universe will be deterministic in the sense defined\nabove. But if this be true, no information is conveyed about the\nuniverse in stating that it is deterministic. It is true that the\nformul\u00e6 involved may be of strictly infinite complexity, and therefore\nnot practically capable of being written down or apprehended. But\nexcept from the point of view of our knowledge, this might seem to be\na detail: in itself, if the above considerations are sound, the\nmaterial universe _must_ be deterministic, _must_ be subject to laws.\nThis, however, is plainly not what was intended. The difference\nbetween this view and the view intended may be seen as follows. Given\nsome formula which fits the facts hitherto--say the law of\ngravitation--there will be an infinite number of other formul\u00e6, not\nempirically distinguishable from it in the past, but diverging from it\nmore and more in the future. Hence, even assuming that there are\npersistent laws, we shall have no reason for assuming that the law of\nthe inverse square will hold in future; it may be some other hitherto\nindistinguishable law that will hold. We cannot say that _every_ law\nwhich has held hitherto must hold in the future, because past facts\nwhich obey one law will also obey others, hitherto indistinguishable\nbut diverging in future. Hence there must, at every moment, be laws\nhitherto unbroken which are now broken for the first time. What\nscience does, in fact, is to select the _simplest_ formula that will\nfit the facts. But this, quite obviously, is merely a methodological\nprecept, not a law of Nature. If the simplest formula ceases, after a\ntime, to be applicable, the simplest formula that remains applicable\nis selected, and science has no sense that an axiom has been\nfalsified. We are thus left with the brute fact that, in many\ndepartments of science, quite simple laws have hitherto been found to\nhold. This fact cannot be regarded as having any _a priori_ ground,\nnor can it be used to support inductively the opinion that the same\nlaws will continue; for at every moment laws hitherto true are being\nfalsified, though in the advanced sciences these laws are less simple\nthan those that have remained true. Moreover it would be fallacious to\nargue inductively from the state of the advanced sciences to the\nfuture state of the others, for it may well be that the advanced\nsciences are advanced simply because, hitherto, their subject-matter\nhas obeyed simple and easily ascertainable laws, while the\nsubject-matter of other sciences has not done so.\nThe difficulty we have been considering seems to be met partly, if not\nwholly, by the principle that the _time_ must not enter explicitly\ninto our formul\u00e6. All mechanical laws exhibit acceleration as a\nfunction of configuration, not of configuration and time jointly; and\nthis principle of the irrelevance of the time may be extended to all\nscientific laws. In fact we might interpret the \"uniformity of nature\"\nas meaning just this, that no scientific law involves the time as an\nargument, unless, of course, it is given in an integrated form, in\nwhich case _lapse_ of time, though not absolute time, may appear in\nour formul\u00e6. Whether this consideration suffices to overcome our\ndifficulty completely, I do not know; but in any case it does much to\ndiminish it.\nIt will serve to illustrate what has been said if we apply it to the\nquestion of free will.\n(1) Determinism in regard to the will is the doctrine that our\nvolitions belong to some deterministic system, i.e. are \"determined\"\nin the sense defined above. Whether this doctrine is true or false, is\na mere question of fact; no _a priori_ considerations (if our previous\ndiscussions have been correct) can exist on either side. On the one\nhand, there is no _a priori_ category of causality, but merely certain\nobserved uniformities. As a matter of fact, there are observed\nuniformities in regard to volitions; thus there is some empirical\nevidence that volitions are determined. But it would be very rash to\nmaintain that the evidence is overwhelming, and it is quite possible\nthat some volitions, as well as some other things, are not determined,\nexcept in the sense in which we found that everything must be\ndetermined.\n(2) But, on the other hand, the subjective sense of freedom, sometimes\nalleged against determinism, has no bearing on the question whatever.\nThe view that it has a bearing rests upon the belief that causes\ncompel their effects, or that nature enforces obedience to its laws as\ngovernments do. These are mere anthropomorphic superstitions, due to\nassimilation of causes with volitions and of natural laws with human\nedicts. We feel that our will is not compelled, but that only means\nthat it is not other than we choose it to be. It is one of the\ndemerits of the traditional theory of causality that it has created an\nartificial opposition between determinism and the freedom of which we\nare introspectively conscious.\n(3) Besides the general question whether volitions are determined,\nthere is the further question whether they are _mechanically_\ndetermined, i.e. whether they are part of what was above defined as a\nmechanical system. This is the question whether they form part of a\nsystem with purely material determinants, i.e. whether there are laws\nwhich, given certain material data, make all volitions functions of\nthose data. Here again, there is empirical evidence up to a point, but\nit is not conclusive in regard to all volitions. It is important to\nobserve, however that even if volitions are part of a mechanical\nsystem, this by no means implies any supremacy of matter over mind. It\nmay well be that the same system which is susceptible of material\ndeterminants is also susceptible of mental determinants; thus a\nmechanical system may be determined by sets of volitions, as well as\nby sets of material facts. It would seem, therefore, that the reasons\nwhich make people dislike the view that volitions are mechanically\ndetermined are fallacious.\n(4) The notion of _necessity_, which is often associated with\ndeterminism, is a confused notion not legitimately deducible from\ndeterminism. Three meanings are commonly confounded when necessity is\nspoken of:--\n([alpha]) An _action_ is necessary when it will be performed\nhowever much the agent may wish to do otherwise. Determinism does not\nimply that actions are necessary in this sense.\n([beta]) A _propositional function_ is necessary when all its\nvalues are true. This sense is not relevant to our present discussion.\n([gamma]) A _proposition_ is necessary with respect to a given\nconstituent when it is the value, with that constituent as argument,\nof a necessary propositional function, in other words, when it remains\ntrue however that constituent may be varied. In this sense, in a\ndeterministic system, the connection of a volition with its\ndeterminants is necessary, if the time at which the determinants occur\nbe taken as the constituent to be varied, the time-interval between\nthe determinants and the volition being kept constant. But this sense\nof necessity is purely logical, and has no emotional importance.\nWe may now sum up our discussion of causality. We found first that the\nlaw of causality, as usually stated by philosophers, is false, and is\nnot employed in science. We then considered the nature of scientific\nlaws, and found that, instead of stating that one event A is always\nfollowed by another event B, they stated functional relations between\ncertain events at certain times, which we called determinants, and\nother events at earlier or later times or at the same time. We were\nunable to find any _a priori_ category involved: the existence of\nscientific laws appeared as a purely empirical fact, not necessarily\nuniversal, except in a trivial and scientifically useless form. We\nfound that a system with one set of determinants may very likely have\nother sets of a quite different kind, that, for example, a\nmechanically determined system may also be teleologically or\nvolitionally determined. Finally we considered the problem of free\nwill: here we found that the reasons for supposing volitions to be\ndetermined are strong but not conclusive, and we decided that even if\nvolitions are mechanically determined, that is no reason for denying\nfreedom in the sense revealed by introspection, or for supposing that\nmechanical events are not determined by volitions. The problem of free\nwill _versus_ determinism is therefore, if we were right, mainly\nillusory, but in part not yet capable of being decisively solved.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[35] A propositional function is an expression containing a variable,\nor undetermined constituent, and becoming a proposition as soon as a\ndefinite value is assigned to the variable. Examples are: \"A is A,\"\n\"_x_ is a number.\" The variable is called the _argument_ of the\nfunction.\n[36] _Logic_, Bk. III, Chap. V, \u00a7 2.\n[37] _Time and Free Will_, p. 199.\n[38] _Time and Free Will._ p. 202.\n[39] _Loc. cit._, \u00a7 6\nX\nKNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION\nThe object of the following paper is to consider what it is that we\nknow in cases where we know propositions about \"the so-and-so\" without\nknowing who or what the so-and-so is. For example, I know that the\ncandidate who gets most votes will be elected, though I do not know\nwho is the candidate who will get most votes. The problem I wish to\nconsider is: What do we know in these cases, where the subject is\nmerely described? I have considered this problem elsewhere[40] from a\npurely logical point of view; but in what follows I wish to consider\nthe question in relation to theory of knowledge as well as in relation\nto logic, and in view of the above-mentioned logical discussions, I\nshall in this paper make the logical portion as brief as possible.\nIn order to make clear the antithesis between \"acquaintance\" and\n\"description,\" I shall first of all try to explain what I mean by\n\"acquaintance.\" I say that I am _acquainted_ with an object when I\nhave a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when I am\ndirectly aware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive\nrelation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes\njudgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation. In fact, I\nthink the relation of subject and object which I call acquaintance is\nsimply the converse of the relation of object and subject which\nconstitutes presentation. That is, to say that S has acquaintance with\nO is essentially the same thing as to say that O is presented to S.\nBut the associations and natural extensions of the word _acquaintance_\nare different from those of the word _presentation_. To begin with, as\nin most cognitive words, it is natural to say that I am acquainted\nwith an object even at moments when it is not actually before my mind,\nprovided it has been before my mind, and will be again whenever\noccasion arises. This is the same sense in which I am said to know\nthat 2+2=4 even when I am thinking of something else. In the second\nplace, the word _acquaintance_ is designed to emphasise, more than the\nword _presentation_, the relational character of the fact with which\nwe are concerned. There is, to my mind, a danger that, in speaking of\npresentation, we may so emphasise the object as to lose sight of the\nsubject. The result of this is either to lead to the view that there\nis no subject, whence we arrive at materialism; or to lead to the view\nthat what is presented is part of the subject, whence we arrive at\nidealism, and should arrive at solipsism but for the most desperate\ncontortions. Now I wish to preserve the dualism of subject and object\nin my terminology, because this dualism seems to me a fundamental fact\nconcerning cognition. Hence I prefer the word _acquaintance_ because\nit emphasises the need of a subject which is acquainted.\nWhen we ask what are the kinds of objects with which we are\nacquainted, the first and most obvious example is _sense-data_. When I\nsee a colour or hear a noise, I have direct acquaintance with the\ncolour or the noise. The sense-datum with which I am acquainted in\nthese cases is generally, if not always, complex. This is\nparticularly obvious in the case of sight. I do not mean, of course,\nmerely that the supposed physical object is complex, but that the\ndirect sensible object is complex and contains parts with spatial\nrelations. Whether it is possible to be aware of a complex without\nbeing aware of its constituents is not an easy question, but on the\nwhole it would seem that there is no reason why it should not be\npossible. This question arises in an acute form in connection with\nself-consciousness, which we must now briefly consider.\nIn introspection, we seem to be immediately aware of varying\ncomplexes, consisting of objects in various cognitive and conative\nrelations to ourselves. When I see the sun, it often happens that I\nam aware of my seeing the sun, in addition to being aware of the sun;\nand when I desire food, it often happens that I am aware of my desire\nfor food. But it is hard to discover any state of mind in which I am\naware of myself alone, as opposed to a complex of which I am a\nconstituent. The question of the nature of self-consciousness is too\nlarge and too slightly connected with our subject, to be argued at\nlength here. It is difficult, but probably not impossible, to account\nfor plain facts if we assume that we do not have acquaintance with\nourselves. It is plain that we are not only _acquainted_ with the\ncomplex \"Self-acquainted-with-A,\" but we also _know_ the proposition\n\"I am acquainted with A.\" Now here the complex has been analysed, and\nif \"I\" does not stand for something which is a direct object of\nacquaintance, we shall have to suppose that \"I\" is something known by\ndescription. If we wished to maintain the view that there is no\nacquaintance with Self, we might argue as follows: We are acquainted\nwith _acquaintance_, and we know that it is a relation. Also we are\nacquainted with a complex in which we perceive that acquaintance is\nthe relating relation. Hence we know that this complex must have a\nconstituent which is that which is acquainted, i.e. must have a\nsubject-term as well as an object-term. This subject-term we define\nas \"I.\" Thus \"I\" means \"the subject-term in awarenesses of which _I_\nam aware.\" But as a definition this cannot be regarded as a happy\neffort. It would seem necessary, therefore, either to suppose that I\nam acquainted with myself, and that \"I,\" therefore, requires no\ndefinition, being merely the proper name of a certain object, or to\nfind some other analysis of self-consciousness. Thus self-consciousness\ncannot be regarded as throwing light on the question whether we can\nknow a complex without knowing its constituents. This question,\nhowever, is not important for our present purposes, and I shall\ntherefore not discuss it further.\nThe awarenesses we have considered so far have all been awarenesses of\nparticular existents, and might all in a large sense be called\nsense-data. For, from the point of view of theory of knowledge,\nintrospective knowledge is exactly on a level with knowledge derived\nfrom sight or hearing. But, in addition to awareness of the above kind\nof objects, which may be called awareness of _particulars_; we have\nalso (though not quite in the same sense) what may be called awareness\nof _universals_. Awareness of universals is called _conceiving_, and a\nuniversal of which we are aware is called a _concept_. Not only are we\naware of particular yellows, but if we have seen a sufficient number\nof yellows and have sufficient intelligence, we are aware of the\nuniversal _yellow_; this universal is the subject in such judgments as\n\"yellow differs from blue\" or \"yellow resembles blue less than green\ndoes.\" And the universal yellow is the predicate in such judgments as\n\"this is yellow,\" where \"this\" is a particular sense-datum. And\nuniversal relations, too, are objects of awarenesses; up and down,\nbefore and after, resemblance, desire, awareness itself, and so on,\nwould seem to be all of them objects of which we can be aware.\nIn regard to relations, it might be urged that we are never aware of\nthe universal relation itself, but only of complexes in which it is a\nconstituent. For example, it may be said that we do not know directly\nsuch a relation as _before_, though we understand such a proposition\nas \"this is before that,\" and may be directly aware of such a complex\nas \"this being before that.\" This view, however, is difficult to\nreconcile with the fact that we often know propositions in which the\nrelation is the subject, or in which the relata are not definite given\nobjects, but \"anything.\" For example, we know that if one thing is\nbefore another, and the other before a third, then the first is before\nthe third; and here the things concerned are not definite things, but\n\"anything.\" It is hard to see how we could know such a fact about\n\"before\" unless we were acquainted with \"before,\" and not merely with\nactual particular cases of one given object being before another given\nobject. And more directly: A judgment such as \"this is before that,\"\nwhere this judgment is derived from awareness of a complex,\nconstitutes an analysis, and we should not understand the analysis if\nwe were not acquainted with the meaning of the terms employed. Thus we\nmust suppose that we are acquainted with the meaning of \"before,\" and\nnot merely with instances of it.\nThere are thus at least two sorts of objects of which we are aware,\nnamely, particulars and universals. Among particulars I include all\nexistents, and all complexes of which one or more constituents are\nexistents, such as this-before-that, this-above-that,\nthe-yellowness-of-this. Among universals I include all objects of\nwhich no particular is a constituent. Thus the disjunction\n\"universal-particular\" includes all objects. We might also call it the\ndisjunction \"abstract-concrete.\" It is not quite parallel with the\nopposition \"concept-percept,\" because things remembered or imagined\nbelong with particulars, but can hardly be called percepts. (On the\nother hand, universals with which we are acquainted may be identified\nwith concepts.)\nIt will be seen that among the objects with which we are acquainted\nare not included physical objects (as opposed to sense-data), nor\nother people's minds. These things are known to us by what I call\n\"knowledge by description,\" which we must now consider.\nBy a \"description\" I mean any phrase of the form \"a so-and-so\" or \"the\nso-and-so.\" A phrase of the form \"a so-and-so\" I shall call an\n\"ambiguous\" description; a phrase of the form \"the so-and-so\" (in the\nsingular) I shall call a \"definite\" description. Thus \"a man\" is an\nambiguous description, and \"the man with the iron mask\" is a definite\ndescription. There are various problems connected with ambiguous\ndescriptions, but I pass them by, since they do not directly concern\nthe matter I wish to discuss. What I wish to discuss is the nature of\nour knowledge concerning objects in cases where we know that there is\nan object answering to a definite description, though we are not\n_acquainted_ with any such object. This is a matter which is concerned\nexclusively with _definite_ descriptions. I shall, therefore, in the\nsequel, speak simply of \"descriptions\" when I mean \"definite\ndescriptions.\" Thus a description will mean any phrase of the form\n\"the so-and-so\" in the singular.\nI shall say that an object is \"known by description\" when we know that\nit is \"_the_ so-and-so,\" i.e. when we know that there is one object,\nand no more, having a certain property; and it will generally be\nimplied that we do not have knowledge of the same object by\nacquaintance. We know that the man with the iron mask existed, and\nmany propositions are known about him; but we do not know who he was.\nWe know that the candidate who gets most votes will be elected, and in\nthis case we are very likely also acquainted (in the only sense in\nwhich one can be acquainted with some one else) with the man who is,\nin fact, the candidate who will get most votes, but we do not know\nwhich of the candidates he is, i.e. we do not know any proposition of\nthe form \"A is the candidate who will get most votes\" where A is one\nof the candidates by name. We shall say that we have \"_merely_\ndescriptive knowledge\" of the so-and-so when, although we know that\nthe so-and-so exists, and although we may possibly be acquainted with\nthe object which is, in fact, the so-and-so, yet we do not know any\nproposition \"_a_ is the so-and-so,\" where _a_ is something with which\nwe are acquainted.\nWhen we say \"the so-and-so exists,\" we mean that there is just one\nobject which is the so-and-so. The proposition \"_a_ is the so-and-so\"\nmeans that _a_ has the property so-and-so, and nothing else has. \"Sir\nJoseph Larmor is the Unionist candidate\" means \"Sir Joseph Larmor is a\nUnionist candidate, and no one else is.\" \"The Unionist candidate\nexists\" means \"some one is a Unionist candidate, and no one else is.\"\nThus, when we are acquainted with an object which we know to be the\nso-and-so, we know that the so-and-so exists but we may know that the\nso-and-so exists when we are not acquainted with any object which we\nknow to be the so-and-so, and even when we are not acquainted with any\nobject which, in fact, is the so-and-so.\nCommon words, even proper names, are usually really descriptions. That\nis to say, the thought in the mind of a person using a proper name\ncorrectly can generally only be expressed explicitly if we replace the\nproper name by a description. Moreover, the description required to\nexpress the thought will vary for different people, or for the same\nperson at different times. The only thing constant (so long as the\nname is rightly used) is the object to which the name applies. But so\nlong as this remains constant, the particular description involved\nusually makes no difference to the truth or falsehood of the\nproposition in which the name appears.\nLet us take some illustrations. Suppose some statement made about\nBismarck. Assuming that there is such a thing as direct acquaintance\nwith oneself, Bismarck himself might have used his name directly to\ndesignate the particular person with whom he was acquainted. In this\ncase, if he made a judgment about himself, he himself might be a\nconstituent of the judgment. Here the proper name has the direct use\nwhich it always wishes to have, as simply standing for a certain\nobject, and not for a description of the object. But if a person who\nknew Bismarck made a judgment about him, the case is different. What\nthis person was acquainted with were certain sense-data which he\nconnected (rightly, we will suppose) with Bismarck's body. His body as\na physical object, and still more his mind, were only known as the\nbody and the mind connected with these sense-data. That is, they were\nknown by description. It is, of course, very much a matter of chance\nwhich characteristics of a man's appearance will come into a friend's\nmind when he thinks of him; thus the description actually in the\nfriend's mind is accidental. The essential point is that he knows that\nthe various descriptions all apply to the same entity, in spite of\nnot being acquainted with the entity in question.\nWhen we, who did not know Bismarck, make a judgment about him, the\ndescription in our minds will probably be some more or less vague mass\nof historical knowledge--far more, in most cases, than is required to\nidentify him. But, for the sake of illustration, let us assume that we\nthink of him as \"the first Chancellor of the German Empire.\" Here all\nthe words are abstract except \"German.\" The word \"German\" will again\nhave different meanings for different people. To some it will recall\ntravels in Germany, to some the look of Germany on the map, and so on.\nBut if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable,\nwe shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a\nparticular with which we are acquainted. Such reference is involved in\nany mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite\ndates), or of here and there, or of what others have told us. Thus it\nwould seem that, in some way or other, a description known to be\napplicable to a particular must involve some reference to a particular\nwith which we are acquainted, if our knowledge about the thing\ndescribed is not to be merely what follows logically from the\ndescription. For example, \"the most long-lived of men\" is a\ndescription which must apply to some man, but we can make no judgments\nconcerning this man which involve knowledge about him beyond what the\ndescription gives. If, however, we say, \"the first Chancellor of the\nGerman Empire was an astute diplomatist,\" we can only be assured of\nthe truth of our judgment in virtue of something with which we are\nacquainted--usually a testimony heard or read. Considered\npsychologically, apart from the information we convey to others, apart\nfrom the fact about the actual Bismarck, which gives importance to\nour judgment, the thought we really have contains the one or more\nparticulars involved, and otherwise consists wholly of concepts. All\nnames of places--London, England, Europe, the earth, the Solar\nSystem--similarly involve, when used, descriptions which start from\nsome one or more particulars with which we are acquainted. I suspect\nthat even the Universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a\nconnection with particulars. In logic, on the contrary, where we are\nconcerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or\ncould exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.\nIt would seem that, when we make a statement about something only\nknown by description, we often _intend_ to make our statement, not in\nthe form involving the description, but about the actual thing\ndescribed. That is to say, when we say anything about Bismarck, we\nshould like, if we could, to make the judgment which Bismarck alone\ncan make, namely, the judgment of which he himself is a constituent.\nIn this we are necessarily defeated, since the actual Bismarck is\nunknown to us. But we know that there is an object B called Bismarck,\nand that B was an astute diplomatist. We can thus _describe_ the\nproposition we should like to affirm, namely, \"B was an astute\ndiplomatist,\" where B is the object which was Bismarck. What enables\nus to communicate in spite of the varying descriptions we employ is\nthat we know there is a true proposition concerning the actual\nBismarck, and that, however we may vary the description (so long as\nthe description is correct), the proposition described is still the\nsame. This proposition, which is described and is known to be true, is\nwhat interests us; but we are not acquainted with the proposition\nitself, and do not know _it_, though we know it is true.\nIt will be seen that there are various stages in the removal from\nacquaintance with particulars: there is Bismarck to people who knew\nhim, Bismarck to those who only know of him through history, the man\nwith the iron mask, the longest-lived of men. These are progressively\nfurther removed from acquaintance with particulars, and there is a\nsimilar hierarchy in the region of universals. Many universals, like\nmany particulars, are only known to us by description. But here, as in\nthe case of particulars, knowledge concerning what is known by\ndescription is ultimately reducible to knowledge concerning what is\nknown by acquaintance.\nThe fundamental epistemological principle in the analysis of\npropositions containing descriptions is this: _Every proposition which\nwe can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which\nwe are acquainted._ From what has been said already, it will be plain\nwhy I advocate this principle, and how I propose to meet the case of\npropositions which at first sight contravene it. Let us begin with the\nreasons for supposing the principle true.\nThe chief reason for supposing the principle true is that it seems\nscarcely possible to believe that we can make a judgment or entertain\na supposition without knowing what it is that we are judging or\nsupposing about. If we make a judgment about (say) Julius C\u00e6sar, it is\nplain that the actual person who was Julius C\u00e6sar is not a constituent\nof the judgment. But before going further, it may be well to explain\nwhat I mean when I say that this or that is a constituent of a\njudgment, or of a proposition which we understand. To begin with\njudgments: a judgment, as an occurrence, I take to be a relation of a\nmind to several entities, namely, the entities which compose what is\njudged. If, e.g. I judge that A loves B, the judgment as an event\nconsists in the existence, at a certain moment, of a specific\nfour-term relation, called _judging_, between me and A and love and B.\nThat is to say, at the time when I judge, there is a certain complex\nwhose terms are myself and A and love and B, and whose relating\nrelation is _judging_. My reasons for this view have been set forth\nelsewhere,[41] and I shall not repeat them here. Assuming this view of\njudgment, the constituents of the judgment are simply the constituents\nof the complex which is the judgment. Thus, in the above case, the\nconstituents are myself and A and love and B and judging. But myself\nand judging are constituents shared by all my judgments; thus the\n_distinctive_ constituents of the particular judgment in question are\nA and love and B. Coming now to what is meant by \"understanding a\nproposition,\" I should say that there is another relation possible\nbetween me and A and love and B, which is called my _supposing_ that A\nloves B.[42] When we can _suppose_ that A loves B, we \"understand the\nproposition\" _A loves B_. Thus we often understand a proposition in\ncases where we have not enough knowledge to make a judgment.\nSupposing, like judging, is a many-term relation, of which a mind is\none term. The other terms of the relation are called the constituents\nof the proposition supposed. Thus the principle which I enunciated may\nbe re-stated as follows: _Whenever a relation of supposing or judging\noccurs, the terms to which the supposing or judging mind is related by\nthe relation of supposing or judging must be terms with which the mind\nin question is acquainted._ This is merely to say that we cannot make\na judgment or a supposition without knowing what it is that we are\nmaking our judgment or supposition about. It seems to me that the\ntruth of this principle is evident as soon as the principle is\nunderstood; I shall, therefore, in what follows, assume the principle,\nand use it as a guide in analysing judgments that contain\ndescriptions.\nReturning now to Julius C\u00e6sar, I assume that it will be admitted that\nhe himself is not a constituent of any judgment which I can make. But\nat this point it is necessary to examine the view that judgments are\ncomposed of something called \"ideas,\" and that it is the \"idea\" of\nJulius C\u00e6sar that is a constituent of my judgment. I believe the\nplausibility of this view rests upon a failure to form a right theory\nof descriptions. We may mean by my \"idea\" of Julius C\u00e6sar the things\nthat I know about him, e.g. that he conquered Gaul, was assassinated\non the Ides of March, and is a plague to schoolboys. Now I am\nadmitting, and indeed contending, that in order to discover what is\nactually in my mind when I judge about Julius C\u00e6sar, we must\nsubstitute for the proper name a description made up of some of the\nthings I know about him. (A description which will often serve to\nexpress my thought is \"the man whose name was _Julius C\u00e6sar_.\" For\nwhatever else I may have forgotten about him, it is plain that when I\nmention him I have not forgotten that that was his name.) But although\nI think the theory that judgments consist of ideas may have been\nsuggested in some such way, yet I think the theory itself is\nfundamentally mistaken. The view seems to be that there is some\nmental existent which may be called the \"idea\" of something outside\nthe mind of the person who has the idea, and that, since judgment is a\nmental event, its constituents must be constituents of the mind of the\nperson judging. But in this view ideas become a veil between us and\noutside things--we never really, in knowledge, attain to the things we\nare supposed to be knowing about, but only to the ideas of those\nthings. The relation of mind, idea, and object, on this view, is\nutterly obscure, and, so far as I can see, nothing discoverable by\ninspection warrants the intrusion of the idea between the mind and the\nobject. I suspect that the view is fostered by the dislike of\nrelations, and that it is felt the mind could not know objects unless\nthere were something \"in\" the mind which could be called the state of\nknowing the object. Such a view, however, leads at once to a vicious\nendless regress, since the relation of idea to object will have to be\nexplained by supposing that the idea itself has an idea of the object,\nand so on _ad infinitum_. I therefore see no reason to believe that,\nwhen we are acquainted with an object, there is in us something which\ncan be called the \"idea\" of the object. On the contrary, I hold that\nacquaintance is wholly a relation, not demanding any such constituent\nof the mind as is supposed by advocates of \"ideas.\" This is, of\ncourse, a large question, and one which would take us far from our\nsubject if it were adequately discussed. I therefore content myself\nwith the above indications, and with the corollary that, in judging,\nthe actual objects concerning which we judge, rather than any supposed\npurely mental entities, are constituents of the complex which is the\njudgment.\nWhen, therefore, I say that we must substitute for \"Julius C\u00e6sar\" some\ndescription of Julius C\u00e6sar, in order to discover the meaning of a\njudgment nominally about him, I am not saying that we must substitute\nan idea. Suppose our description is \"the man whose name was _Julius\nC\u00e6sar_.\" Let our judgment be \"Julius C\u00e6sar was assassinated.\" Then it\nbecomes \"the man whose name was _Julius C\u00e6sar_ was assassinated.\" Here\n_Julius C\u00e6sar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted, and\nall the other constituents of the judgment (neglecting the tense in\n\"was\") are _concepts_ with which we are acquainted. Thus our judgment\nis wholly reduced to constituents with which we are acquainted, but\nJulius C\u00e6sar himself has ceased to be a constituent of our judgment.\nThis, however, requires a proviso, to be further explained shortly,\nnamely that \"the man whose name was _Julius C\u00e6sar_\" must not, as a\nwhole, be a constituent of our judgment, that is to say, this phrase\nmust not, as a whole, have a meaning which enters into the judgment.\nAny right analysis of the judgment, therefore, must break up this\nphrase, and not treat it as a subordinate complex which is part of the\njudgment. The judgment \"the man whose name was _Julius C\u00e6sar_ was\nassassinated\" may be interpreted as meaning \"one and only one man was\ncalled _Julius C\u00e6sar_, and that one was assassinated.\" Here it is\nplain that there is no constituent corresponding to the phrase \"the\nman whose name was _Julius C\u00e6sar_.\" Thus there is no reason to regard\nthis phrase as expressing a constituent of the judgment, and we have\nseen that this phrase must be broken up if we are to be acquainted\nwith all the constituents of the judgment. This conclusion, which we\nhave reached from considerations concerned with the theory of\nknowledge, is also forced upon us by logical considerations, which\nmust now be briefly reviewed.\nIt is common to distinguish two aspects, _meaning_ and _denotation_,\nsuch phrases as \"the author of Waverley.\" The meaning will be a\ncertain complex, consisting (at least) of authorship and Waverley with\nsome relation; the denotation will be Scott. Similarly \"featherless\nbipeds\" will have a complex meaning, containing as constituents the\npresence of two feet and the absence of feathers, while its denotation\nwill be the class of men. Thus when we say \"Scott is the author of\nWaverley\" or \"men are the same as featherless bipeds,\" we are\nasserting an identity of denotation, and this assertion is worth\nmaking because of the diversity of meaning.[43] I believe that the\nduality of meaning and denotation, though capable of a true\ninterpretation, is misleading if taken as fundamental. The denotation,\nI believe, is not a constituent of the proposition, except in the case\nof proper names, i.e. of words which do not assign a property to an\nobject, but merely and solely name it. And I should hold further that,\nin this sense, there are only two words which are strictly proper\nnames of particulars, namely, \"I\" and \"this.\"[44]\nOne reason for not believing the denotation to be a constituent of the\nproposition is that we may know the proposition even when we are not\nacquainted with the denotation. The proposition \"the author of\nWaverley is a novelist\" was known to people who did not know that \"the\nauthor of Waverley\" denoted Scott. This reason has been already\nsufficiently emphasised.\nA second reason is that propositions concerning \"the so-and-so\" are\npossible even when \"the so-and-so\" has no denotation. Take, e.g. \"the\ngolden mountain does not exist\" or \"the round square is\nself-contradictory.\" If we are to preserve the duality of meaning and\ndenotation, we have to say, with Meinong, that there are such objects\nas the golden mountain and the round square, although these objects do\nnot have being. We even have to admit that the existent round square\nis existent, but does not exist.[45] Meinong does not regard this as a\ncontradiction, but I fail to see that it is not one. Indeed, it seems\nto me evident that the judgment \"there is no such object as the round\nsquare\" does not presuppose that there is such an object. If this is\nadmitted, however, we are led to the conclusion that, by parity of\nform, no judgment concerning \"the so-and-so\" actually involves the\nso-and-so as a constituent.\nMiss Jones[46] contends that there is no difficulty in admitting\ncontradictory predicates concerning such an object as \"the present\nKing of France,\" on the ground that this object is in itself\ncontradictory. Now it might, of course, be argued that this object,\nunlike the round square, is not self-contradictory, but merely\nnon-existent. This, however, would not go to the root of the matter.\nThe real objection to such an argument is that the law of\ncontradiction ought not to be stated in the traditional form \"A is not\nboth B and not B,\" but in the form \"no proposition is both true and\nfalse.\" The traditional form only applies to certain propositions,\nnamely, to those which attribute a predicate to a subject. When the\nlaw is stated of propositions, instead of being stated concerning\nsubjects and predicates, it is at once evident that propositions about\nthe present King of France or the round square can form no exception,\nbut are just as incapable of being both true and false as other\npropositions. Miss Jones[47] argues that \"Scott is the author of\nWaverley\" asserts identity of denotation between _Scott_ and _the\nauthor of Waverley_. But there is some difficulty in choosing among\nalternative meanings of this contention. In the first place, it should\nbe observed that _the author of Waverley_ is not a _mere_ name, like\n_Scott_. _Scott_ is merely a noise or shape conventionally used to\ndesignate a certain person; it gives us no information about that\nperson, and has nothing that can be called meaning as opposed to\ndenotation. (I neglect the fact, considered above, that even proper\nnames, as a rule, really stand for descriptions.) But _the author of\nWaverley_ is not merely conventionally a name for Scott; the element\nof mere convention belongs here to the separate words, _the_ and\n_author_ and _of_ and _Waverley_. Given what these words stand for,\n_the author of Waverley_ is no longer arbitrary. When it is said that\nScott is the author of Waverley, we are not stating that these are two\n_names_ for one man, as we should be if we said \"Scott is Sir Walter.\"\nA man's name is what he is called, but however much Scott had been\ncalled the author of Waverley, that would not have made him be the\nauthor; it was necessary for him actually to write Waverley, which was\na fact having nothing to do with names.\nIf, then, we are asserting identity of denotation, we must not mean by\n_denotation_ the mere relation of a name to the thing named. In fact,\nit would be nearer to the truth to say that the _meaning_ of \"Scott\"\nis the _denotation_ of \"the author of Waverley.\" The relation of\n\"Scott\" to Scott is that \"Scott\" means Scott, just as the relation of\n\"author\" to the concept which is so called is that \"author\" means this\nconcept. Thus if we distinguish meaning and denotation in \"the author\nof Waverley,\" we shall have to say that \"Scott\" has meaning but not\ndenotation. Also when we say \"Scott is the author of Waverley,\" the\n_meaning_ of \"the author of Waverley\" is relevant to our assertion.\nFor if the denotation alone were relevant, any other phrase with the\nsame denotation would give the same proposition. Thus \"Scott is the\nauthor of Marmion\" would be the same proposition as \"Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley.\" But this is plainly not the case, since from the\nfirst we learn that Scott wrote Marmion and from the second we learn\nthat he wrote Waverley, but the first tells us nothing about Waverley\nand the second nothing about Marmion. Hence the meaning of \"the author\nof Waverley,\" as opposed to the denotation, is certainly relevant to\n\"Scott is the author of Waverley.\"\nWe have thus agreed that \"the author of Waverley\" is not a mere name,\nand that its meaning is relevant in propositions in which it occurs.\nThus if we are to say, as Miss Jones does, that \"Scott is the author\nof Waverley\" asserts an identity of denotation, we must regard the\ndenotation of \"the author of Waverley\" as the denotation of what is\n_meant_ by \"the author of Waverley.\" Let us call the meaning of \"the\nauthor of Waverley\" M. Thus M is what \"the author of Waverley\" means.\nThen we are to suppose that \"Scott is the author of Waverley\" means\n\"Scott is the denotation of M.\" But here we are explaining our\nproposition by another of the same form, and thus we have made no\nprogress towards a real explanation. \"The denotation of M,\" like \"the\nauthor of Waverley,\" has both meaning and denotation, on the theory we\nare examining. If we call its meaning M', our proposition becomes\n\"Scott is the denotation of M'.\" But this leads at once to an endless\nregress. Thus the attempt to regard our proposition as asserting\nidentity of denotation breaks down, and it becomes imperative to find\nsome other analysis. When this analysis has been completed, we shall\nbe able to reinterpret the phrase \"identity of denotation,\" which\nremains obscure so long as it is taken as fundamental.\nThe first point to observe is that, in any proposition about \"the\nauthor of Waverley,\" provided Scott is not explicitly mentioned, the\ndenotation itself, i.e. Scott, does not occur, but only the concept of\ndenotation, which will be represented by a variable. Suppose we say\n\"the author of Waverley was the author of Marmion,\" we are certainly\nnot saying that both were Scott--we may have forgotten that there was\nsuch a person as Scott. We are saying that there is some man who was\nthe author of Waverley and the author of Marmion. That is to say,\nthere is some one who wrote Waverley and Marmion, and no one else\nwrote them. Thus the identity is that of a variable, i.e. of an\nindefinite subject, \"some one.\" This is why we can understand\npropositions about \"the author of Waverley,\" without knowing who he\nwas. When we say \"the author of Waverley was a poet,\" we mean \"one and\nonly one man wrote Waverley, and he was a poet\"; when we say \"the\nauthor of Waverley was Scott\" we mean \"one and only one man wrote\nWaverley, and he was Scott.\" Here the identity is between a variable,\ni.e. an indeterminate subject (\"he\"), and Scott; \"the author of\nWaverley\" has been analysed away, and no longer appears as a\nconstituent of the proposition.[48]\nThe reason why it is imperative to analyse away the phrase \"the author\nof Waverley\" may be stated as follows. It is plain that when we say\n\"the author of Waverley is the author of Marmion,\" the _is_ expresses\nidentity. We have seen also that the common _denotation_, namely\nScott, is not a constituent of this proposition, while the _meanings_\n(if any) of \"the author of Waverley\" and \"the author of Marmion\" are\nnot identical. We have seen also that, in any sense in which the\nmeaning of a word is a constituent of a proposition in whose verbal\nexpression the word occurs, \"Scott\" means the actual man Scott, in the\nsame sense (so far as concerns our present discussion) in which\n\"author\" means a certain universal. Thus, if \"the author of Waverley\"\nwere a subordinate complex in the above proposition, its _meaning_\nwould have to be what was said to be identical with the _meaning_ of\n\"the author of Marmion.\" This is plainly not the case; and the only\nescape is to say that \"the author of Waverley\" does not, by itself,\nhave a meaning, though phrases of which it is part do have a meaning.\nThat is, in a right analysis of the above proposition, \"the author of\nWaverley\" must disappear. This is effected when the above proposition\nis analysed as meaning: \"Some one wrote Waverley and no one else did,\nand that some one also wrote Marmion and no one else did.\" This may be\nmore simply expressed by saying that the propositional function \"_x_\nwrote Waverley and Marmion, and no one else did\" is capable of truth,\ni.e. some value of _x_ makes it true, but no other value does. Thus\nthe true subject of our judgment is a propositional function, i.e. a\ncomplex containing an undetermined constituent, and becoming a\nproposition as soon as this constituent is determined.\nWe may now define the denotation of a phrase. If we know that the\nproposition \"_a_ is the so-and-so\" is true, i.e. that _a_ is so-and-so\nand nothing else is, we call _a_ the denotation of the phrase \"the\nso-and-so.\" A very great many of the propositions we naturally make\nabout \"the so-and-so\" will remain true or remain false if we\nsubstitute _a_ for \"the so-and-so,\" where _a_ is the denotation of\n\"the so-and-so.\" Such propositions will also remain true or remain\nfalse if we substitute for \"the so-and-so\" any other phrase having the\nsame denotation. Hence, as practical men, we become interested in the\ndenotation more than in the description, since the denotation decides\nas to the truth or falsehood of so many statements in which the\ndescription occurs. Moreover, as we saw earlier in considering the\nrelations of description and acquaintance, we often wish to reach the\ndenotation, and are only hindered by lack of acquaintance: in such\ncases the description is merely the means we employ to get as near as\npossible to the denotation. Hence it naturally comes to be supposed\nthat the denotation is part of the proposition in which the\ndescription occurs. But we have seen, both on logical and on\nepistemological grounds, that this is an error. The actual object (if\nany) which is the denotation is not (unless it is explicitly\nmentioned) a constituent of propositions in which descriptions occur;\nand this is the reason why, in order to understand such propositions,\nwe need acquaintance with the constituents of the description, but do\nnot need acquaintance with its denotation. The first result of\nanalysis, when applied to propositions whose grammatical subject is\n\"the so-and-so,\" is to substitute a variable as subject; i.e. we\nobtain a proposition of the form: \"There is _something_ which alone is\nso-and-so, and that _something_ is such-and-such.\" The further\nanalysis of propositions concerning \"the so-and-so\" is thus merged in\nthe problem of the nature of the variable, i.e. of the meanings of\n_some_, _any_, and _all_. This is a difficult problem, concerning\nwhich I do not intend to say anything at present.\nTo sum up our whole discussion. We began by distinguishing two sorts\nof knowledge of objects, namely, knowledge by _acquaintance_ and\nknowledge by _description_. Of these it is only the former that brings\nthe object itself before the mind. We have acquaintance with\nsense-data, with many universals, and possibly with ourselves, but not\nwith physical objects or other minds. We have _descriptive_ knowledge\nof an object when we know that it is _the_ object having some property\nor properties with which we are acquainted; that is to say, when we\nknow that the property or properties in question belong to one object\nand no more, we are said to have knowledge of that one object by\ndescription, whether or not we are acquainted with the object. Our\nknowledge of physical objects and of other minds is only knowledge by\ndescription, the descriptions involved being usually such as involve\nsense-data. All propositions intelligible to us, whether or not they\nprimarily concern things only known to us by description, are composed\nwholly of constituents with which we are acquainted, for a constituent\nwith which we are not acquainted is unintelligible to us. A judgment,\nwe found, is not composed of mental constituents called \"ideas,\" but\nconsists of an occurrence whose constituents are a mind[49] and\ncertain objects, particulars or universals. (One at least must be a\nuniversal.) When a judgment is rightly analysed, the objects which are\nconstituents of it must all be objects with which the mind which is a\nconstituent of it is acquainted. This conclusion forces us to analyse\ndescriptive phrases occurring in propositions, and to say that the\nobjects denoted by such phrases are not constituents of judgments in\nwhich such phrases occur (unless these objects are explicitly\nmentioned). This leads us to the view (recommended also on purely\nlogical grounds) that when we say \"the author of Marmion was the\nauthor of Waverley,\" Scott himself is not a constituent of our\njudgment, and that the judgment cannot be explained by saying that it\naffirms identity of denotation with diversity of meaning. It also,\nplainly, does not assert identity of meaning. Such judgments,\ntherefore, can only be analysed by breaking up the descriptive\nphrases, introducing a variable, and making propositional functions\nthe ultimate subjects. In fact, \"the so-and-so is such-and-such\" will\nmean that \"_x_ is so-and-so and nothing else is, and _x_ is\nsuch-and-such\" is capable of truth. The analysis of such judgments\ninvolves many fresh problems, but the discussion of these problems is\nnot undertaken in the present paper.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[40] See references later.\n[41] _Philosophical Essays_, \"The Nature of Truth.\" I have been\npersuaded by Mr. Wittgenstein that this theory is somewhat unduly\nsimple, but the modification which I believe it to require does not\naffect the above argument [1917].\n[42] Cf. Meinong, _Ueber Annahmen_, _passim_. I formerly supposed,\ncontrary to Meinong's view, that the relationship of supposing might\nbe merely that of presentation. In this view I now think I was\nmistaken, and Meinong is right. But my present view depends upon the\ntheory that both in judgment and in assumption there is no single\nObjective, but the several constituents of the judgment or assumption\nare in a many-term relation to the mind.\n[43] This view has been recently advocated by Miss E.E.C.

SCIENCE AND ART UNDER SOCIALISM\nVIII.THE WORLD AS IT COULD BE MADE\nINTRODUCTION\nTHE attempt to conceive imaginatively a better\nordering of human society than the destructive and\ncruel chaos in which mankind has hitherto existed\nis by no means modern: it is at least as old as Plato,\nwhose ``Republic'' set the model for the Utopias of\nsubsequent philosophers. Whoever contemplates the\nworld in the light of an ideal--whether what he seeks\nbe intellect, or art, or love, or simple happiness, or\nall together--must feel a great sorrow in the evils\nthat men needlessly allow to continue, and--if he be\na man of force and vital energy--an urgent desire to\nlead men to the realization of the good which inspires\nhis creative vision. It is this desire which has been\nthe primary force moving the pioneers of Socialism\nand Anarchism, as it moved the inventors of ideal\ncommonwealths in the past. In this there is nothing\nnew. What is new in Socialism and Anarchism, is\nthat close relation of the ideal to the present\nsufferings of men, which has enabled powerful political\nmovements to grow out of the hopes of solitary thinkers.\nIt is this that makes Socialism and Anarchism\nimportant, and it is this that makes them dangerous\nto those who batten, consciously or unconsciously\nupon the evils of our present order of society.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary\ntimes, pass through life without ever contemplating\nor criticising, as a whole, either their own\nconditions or those of the world at large. They find\nthemselves born into a certain place in society, and\nthey accept what each day brings forth, without any\neffort of thought beyond what the immediate present\nrequires. Almost as instinctively as the beasts of\nthe field, they seek the satisfaction of the needs of\nthe moment, without much forethought, and without\nconsidering that by sufficient effort the whole\nconditions of their lives could be changed. A certain\npercentage, guided by personal ambition, make the effort\nof thought and will which is necessary to place\nthemselves among the more fortunate members of the\ncommunity; but very few among these are seriously\nconcerned to secure for all the advantages which they\nseek for themselves. It is only a few rare and exceptional\nmen who have that kind of love toward mankind\nat large that makes them unable to endure\npatiently the general mass of evil and suffering,\nregardless of any relation it may have to their own\nlives. These few, driven by sympathetic pain, will\nseek, first in thought and then in action, for some\nway of escape, some new system of society by which\nlife may become richer, more full of joy and less\nfull of preventable evils than it is at present. But\nin the past such men have, as a rule, failed to interest\nthe very victims of the injustices which they wished\nto remedy. The more unfortunate sections of the\npopulation have been ignorant, apathetic from excess\nof toil and weariness, timorous through the imminent\ndanger of immediate punishment by the holders of\npower, and morally unreliable owing to the loss of\nself-respect resulting from their degradation. To\ncreate among such classes any conscious, deliberate\neffort after general amelioration might have seemed\na hopeless task, and indeed in the past it has\ngenerally proved so. But the modern world, by the\nincrease of education and the rise in the standard of\ncomfort among wage-earners, has produced new\nconditions, more favorable than ever before to the\ndemand for radical reconstruction. It is above all\nthe Socialists, and in a lesser degree the Anarchists\n(chiefly as the inspirers of Syndicalism), who have\nbecome the exponents of this demand.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable in regard to\nboth Socialism and Anarchism is the association of a\nwidespread popular movement with ideals for a better\nworld. The ideals have been elaborated, in the\nfirst instance, by solitary writers of books, and yet\npowerful sections of the wage-earning classes have\naccepted them as their guide in the practical affairs\nof the world. In regard to Socialism this is evident;\nbut in regard to Anarchism it is only true with some\nqualification. Anarchism as such has never been a\nwidespread creed, it is only in the modified form of\nSyndicalism that it has achieved popularity. Unlike\nSocialism and Anarchism, Syndicalism is primarily\nthe outcome, not of an idea, but of an organization:\nthe fact of Trade Union organization came first, and\nthe ideas of Syndicalism are those which seemed\nappropriate to this organization in the opinion of\nthe more advanced French Trade Unions. But the\nideas are, in the main, derived from Anarchism, and\nthe men who gained acceptance for them were, for\nthe most part, Anarchists. Thus we may regard\nSyndicalism as the Anarchism of the market-place\nas opposed to the Anarchism of isolated individuals\nwhich had preserved a precarious life throughout the\nprevious decades. Taking this view, we find in\nAnarchist-Syndicalism the same combination of ideal\nand organization as we find in Socialist political\nparties. It is from this standpoint that our study\nof these movements will be undertaken.\nSocialism and Anarchism, in their modern form,\nspring respectively from two protagonists, Marx and\nBakunin, who fought a lifelong battle, culminating\nin a split in the first International. We shall begin\nour study with these two men--first their teaching,\nand then the organizations which they founded or\ninspired. This will lead us to the spread of Socialism\nin more recent years, and thence to the Syndicalist\nrevolt against Socialist emphasis on the State\nand political action, and to certain movements outside\nFrance which have some affinity with Syndicalism--\nnotably the I. W. W. in America and Guild\nSocialism in England. From this historical survey\nwe shall pass to the consideration of some of the\nmore pressing problems of the future, and shall try\nto decide in what respects the world would be happier\nif the aims of Socialists or Syndicalists were\nachieved.\nMy own opinion--which I may as well indicate\nat the outset--is that pure Anarchism, though it\nshould be the ultimate ideal, to which society should\ncontinually approximate, is for the present impossible,\nand would not survive more than a year or two\nat most if it were adopted. On the other hand, both\nMarxian Socialism and Syndicalism, in spite of many\ndrawbacks, seem to me calculated to give rise to a\nhappier and better world than that in which we live.\nI do not, however, regard either of them as the best\npracticable system. Marxian Socialism, I fear,\nwould give far too much power to the State, while\nSyndicalism, which aims at abolishing the State,\nwould, I believe, find itself forced to reconstruct a\ncentral authority in order to put an end to the\nrivalries of different groups of producers. The BEST\npracticable system, to my mind, is that of Guild\nSocialism, which concedes what is valid both in the\nclaims of the State Socialists and in the Syndicalist\nfear of the State, by adopting a system of federalism\namong trades for reasons similar to those which\nare recommending federalism among nations. The\ngrounds for these conclusions will appear as we\nproceed.\nBefore embarking upon the history of recent\nmovements In favor of radical reconstruction, it will\nbe worth while to consider some traits of character\nwhich distinguish most political idealists, and are\nmuch misunderstood by the general public for other\nreasons besides mere prejudice. I wish to do full\njustice to these reasons, in order to show the more\neffectually why they ought not to be operative.\nThe leaders of the more advanced movements\nare, in general, men of quite unusual disinterestedness,\nas is evident from a consideration of their careers.\nAlthough they have obviously quite as much ability\nas many men who rise to positions of great power,\nthey do not themselves become the arbiters of\ncontemporary events, nor do they achieve wealth or the\napplause of the mass of their contemporaries. Men\nwho have the capacity for winning these prizes, and\nwho work at least as hard as those who win them,\nbut deliberately adopt a line which makes the winning\nof them impossible, must be judged to have an\naim in life other than personal advancement;\nwhatever admixture of self-seeking may enter into the\ndetail of their lives, their fundamental motive must\nbe outside Self. The pioneers of Socialism, Anarchism,\nand Syndicalism have, for the most part,\nexperienced prison, exile, and poverty, deliberately\nincurred because they would not abandon their\npropaganda; and by this conduct they have shown that\nthe hope which inspired them was not for themselves,\nbut for mankind.\nNevertheless, though the desire for human welfare\nis what at bottom determines the broad lines of such\nmen's lives, it often happens that, in the detail of\ntheir speech and writing, hatred is far more visible\nthan love. The impatient idealist--and without some\nimpatience a man will hardly prove effective--is\nalmost sure to be led into hatred by the oppositions\nand disappointments which he encounters in his\nendeavors to bring happiness to the world. The more\ncertain he is of the purity of his motives and the truth\nof his gospel, the more indignant he will become when\nhis teaching is rejected. Often he will successfully\nachieve an attitude of philosophic tolerance as\nregards the apathy of the masses, and even as regards\nthe whole-hearted opposition of professed defenders\nof the status quo. But the men whom he finds it\nimpossible to forgive are those who profess the same desire\nfor the amelioration of society as he feels himself,\nbut who do not accept his method of achieving this\nend. The intense faith which enables him to withstand\npersecution for the sake of his beliefs makes\nhim consider these beliefs so luminously obvious that\nany thinking man who rejects them must be dishonest,\nand must be actuated by some sinister motive\nof treachery to the cause. Hence arises the spirit of\nthe sect, that bitter, narrow orthodoxy which is the\nbane of those who hold strongly to an unpopular\ncreed. So many real temptations to treachery exist\nthat suspicion is natural. And among leaders,\nambition, which they mortify in their choice of a\ncareer, is sure to return in a new form: in the desire\nfor intellectual mastery and for despotic power\nwithin their own sect. From these causes it results\nthat the advocates of drastic reform divide\nthemselves into opposing schools, hating each other with\na bitter hatred, accusing each other often of such\ncrimes as being in the pay of the police, and demanding,\nof any speaker or writer whom they are to\nadmire, that he shall conform exactly to their\nprejudices, and make all his teaching minister to their\nbelief that the exact truth is to be found within the\nlimits of their creed. The result of this state of\nmind is that, to a casual and unimaginative attention,\nthe men who have sacrificed most through the\nwish to benefit mankind APPEAR to be actuated far\nmore by hatred than by love. And the demand for\northodoxy is stifling to any free exercise of intellect.\nThis cause, as well as economic prejudice, has made\nit difficult for the ``intellectuals'' to co-operate prac-\ntically with the more extreme reformers, however they\nmay sympathize with their main purposes and even\nwith nine-tenths of their program.\nAnother reason why radical reformers are\nmisjudged by ordinary men is that they view existing\nsociety from outside, with hostility towards its\ninstitutions. Although, for the most part, they have\nmore belief than their neighbors in human nature's\ninherent capacity for a good life, they are so\nconscious of the cruelty and oppression resulting from\nexisting institutions that they make a wholly\nmisleading impression of cynicism. Most men have\ninstinctively two entirely different codes of behavior:\none toward those whom they regard as companions or\ncolleagues or friends, or in some way members of the\nsame ``herd''; the other toward those whom they\nregard as enemies or outcasts or a danger to society.\nRadical reformers are apt to concentrate their\nattention upon the behavior of society toward the\nlatter class, the class of those toward whom the\n``herd'' feels ill-will. This class includes, of course,\nenemies in war, and criminals; in the minds of those\nwho consider the preservation of the existing order\nessential to their own safety or privileges, it includes\nall who advocate any great political or economic\nchange, and all classes which, through their poverty\nor through any other cause, are likely to feel a\ndangerous degree of discontent. The ordinary citizen\nprobably seldom thinks about such individuals or\nclasses, and goes through life believing that he and\nhis friends are kindly people, because they have no\nwish to injure those toward whom they entertain no\ngroup-hostility. But the man whose attention is\nfastened upon the relations of a group with those\nwhom it hates or fears will judge quite differently.\nIn these relations a surprising ferocity is apt to be\ndeveloped, and a very ugly side of human nature\ncomes to the fore. The opponents of capitalism\nhave learned, through the study of certain historical\nfacts, that this ferocity has often been shown by the\ncapitalists and by the State toward the wage-earning\nclasses, particularly when they have ventured to\nprotest against the unspeakable suffering to which\nindustrialism has usually condemned them. Hence\narises a quite different attitude toward existing\nsociety from that of the ordinary well-to-do citizen:\nan attitude as true as his, perhaps also as untrue,\nbut equally based on facts, facts concerning his\nrelations to his enemies instead of to his friends.\nThe class-war, like wars between nations,\nproduces two opposing views, each equally true and\nequally untrue. The citizen of a nation at war,\nwhen he thinks of his own countrymen, thinks of them\nprimarily as he has experienced them, in dealings\nwith their friends, in their family relations, and so\non. They seem to him on the whole kindly, decent\nfolk. But a nation with which his country is at\nwar views his compatriots through the medium of a\nquite different set of experiences: as they appear\nin the ferocity of battle, in the invasion and subjugation\nof a hostile territory, or in the chicanery of a\njuggling diplomacy. The men of whom these facts\nare true are the very same as the men whom their\ncompatriots know as husbands or fathers or friends,\nbut they are judged differently because they are\njudged on different data. And so it is with those who\nview the capitalist from the standpoint of the\nrevolutionary wage-earner: they appear inconceivably\ncynical and misjudging to the capitalist, because the\nfacts upon which their view is based are facts which\nhe either does not know or habitually ignores. Yet\nthe view from the outside is just as true as the view\nfrom the inside. Both are necessary to the complete\ntruth; and the Socialist, who emphasizes the outside\nview, is not a cynic, but merely the friend of the\nwage-earners, maddened by the spectacle of the needless\nmisery which capitalism inflicts upon them.\nI have placed these general reflections at the\nbeginning of our study, in order to make it clear to\nthe reader that, whatever bitterness and hate may\nbe found in the movements which we are to examine,\nit is not bitterness or hate, but love, that is their\nmainspring. It is difficult not to hate those who\ntorture the objects of our love. Though difficult, it\nis not impossible; but it requires a breadth of\noutlook and a comprehensiveness of understanding which\nare not easy to preserve amid a desperate contest.\nIf ultimate wisdom has not always been preserved by\nSocialists and Anarchists, they have not differed in\nthis from their opponents; and in the source of their\ninspiration they have shown themselves superior to\nthose who acquiesce ignorantly or supinely in the\ninjustices and oppressions by which the existing\nsystem is preserved.\nPROPOSED ROADS\nTO FREEDOM\nSOCIALISM, ANARCHISM AND SYNDICALISM\nPART I\nHISTORICAL\nCHAPTER I\nMARX AND SOCIALIST DOCTRINE\nSOCIALISM, like everything else that is vital, is\nrather a tendency than a strictly definable body of\ndoctrine. A definition of Socialism is sure either to\ninclude some views which many would regard as not\nSocialistic, or to exclude others which claim to be\nincluded. But I think we shall come nearest to the\nessence of Socialism by defining it as the advocacy\nof communal ownership of land and capital. Communal\nownership may mean ownership by a democratic\nState, but cannot be held to include ownership\nby any State which is not democratic. Communal\nownership may also be understood, as Anarchist\nCommunism understands it, in the sense of\nownership by the free association of the men and\nwomen in a community without those compulsory\npowers which are necessary to constitute a State.\nSome Socialists expect communal ownership to arrive\nsuddenly and completely by a catastrophic revolution,\nwhile others expect it to come gradually, first\nin one industry, then in another. Some insist upon\nthe necessity of completeness in the acquisition of\nland and capital by the public, while others would\nbe content to see lingering islands of private ownership,\nprovided they were not too extensive or powerful.\nWhat all forms have in common is democracy\nand the abolition, virtual or complete, of the present\ncapitalistic system. The distinction between Socialists,\nAnarchists and Syndicalists turns largely upon\nthe kind of democracy which they desire. Orthodox\nSocialists are content with parliamentary democracy\nin the sphere of government, holding that the evils\napparent in this form of constitution at present\nwould disappear with the disappearance of capitalism.\nAnarchists and Syndicalists, on the other\nhand, object to the whole parliamentary machinery,\nand aim at a different method of regulating the political\naffairs of the community. But all alike are\ndemocratic in the sense that they aim at abolishing\nevery kind of privilege and every kind of artificial\ninequality: all alike are champions of the wage-\nearner in existing society. All three also have much\nin common in their economic doctrine. All three\nregard capital and the wages system as a means of\nexploiting the laborer in the interests of the possessing\nclasses, and hold that communal ownership, in one\nform or another, is the only means of bringing freedom\nto the producers. But within the framework\nof this common doctrine there are many divergences,\nand even among those who are strictly to be called\nSocialists, there is a very considerable diversity of\nschools.\nSocialism as a power in Europe may be said\nto begin with Marx. It is true that before his time\nthere were Socialist theories, both in England and in\nFrance. It is also true that in France, during the\nrevolution of 1848, Socialism for a brief period\nacquired considerable influence in the State. But\nthe Socialists who preceded Marx tended to indulge\nin Utopian dreams and failed to found any strong or\nstable political party. To Marx, in collaboration\nwith Engels, are due both the formulation of a coherent\nbody of Socialist doctrine, sufficiently true or\nplausible to dominate the minds of vast numbers of\nmen, and the formation of the International Socialist\nmovement, which has continued to grow in all\nEuropean countries throughout the last fifty years.\nIn order to understand Marx's doctrine, it is\nnecessary to know something of the influences which\nformed his outlook. He was born in 1818 at Treves\nin the Rhine Provinces, his father being a legal\nofficial, a Jew who had nominally accepted\nChristianity. Marx studied jurisprudence, philosophy,\npolitical economy and history at various German\nuniversities. In philosophy he imbibed the doctrines\nof Hegel, who was then at the height of his fame,\nand something of these doctrines dominated his\nthought throughout his life. Like Hegel, he saw in\nhistory the development of an Idea. He conceived\nthe changes in the world as forming a logical development,\nin which one phase passes by revolution into\nanother, which is its antithesis--a conception which\ngave to his views a certain hard abstractness, and a\nbelief in revolution rather than evolution. But of\nHegel's more definite doctrines Marx retained nothing\nafter his youth. He was recognized as a brilliant\nstudent, and might have had a prosperous career as\na professor or an official, but his interest in politics\nand his Radical views led him into more arduous\npaths. Already in 1842 he became editor of a newspaper,\nwhich was suppressed by the Prussian Government\nearly in the following year on account of\nits advanced opinions. This led Marx to go to Paris,\nwhere he became known as a Socialist and acquired\na knowledge of his French predecessors.[1] Here in the\nyear 1844 began his lifelong friendship with Engels,\nwho had been hitherto in business in Manchester,\nwhere he had become acquainted with English Socialism\nand had in the main adopted its doctrines.[2] In\n1845 Marx was expelled from Paris and went with\nEngels to live in Brussels. There he formed a German\nWorking Men's Association and edited a paper\nwhich was their organ. Through his activities in\nBrussels he became known to the German Communist\nLeague in Paris, who, at the end of 1847, invited him\nand Engels to draw up for them a manifesto, which\nappeared in January, 1848. This is the famous\n``Communist Manifesto,'' in which for the first time\nMarx's system is set forth. It appeared at a fortunate\nmoment. In the following month, February,\nthe revolution broke out in Paris, and in March it\nspread to Germany. Fear of the revolution led the\nBrussels Government to expel Marx from Belgium,\nbut the German revolution made it possible for him\nto return to his own country. In Germany he again\nedited a paper, which again led him into a conflict\nwith the authorities, increasing in severity as the\nreaction gathered force. In June, 1849, his paper\nwas suppressed, and he was expelled from Prussia.\nHe returned to Paris, but was expelled from there\nalso. This led him to settle in England--at that\ntime an asylum for friends of freedom--and in England,\nwith only brief intervals for purposes of agitation,\nhe continued to live until his death in 1883.\n[1] Chief among these were Fourier and Saint-Simon, who\nconstructed somewhat fantastic Socialistic ideal commonwealths.\nProudhon, with whom Marx had some not wholly friendly relations,\nis to be regarded as a forerunner of the Anarchists rather\nthan of orthodox Socialism.\n[2] Marx mentions the English Socialists with praise in ``The\nPoverty of Philosophy'' (1847). They, like him, tend to base\ntheir arguments upon a Ricardian theory of value, but they\nhave not his scope or erudition or scientific breadth. Among\nthem may be mentioned Thomas Hodgskin (1787-1869), originally\nan officer in the Navy, but dismissed for a pamphlet critical\nof the methods of naval discipline, author of ``Labour Defended\nAgainst the Claims of Capital'' (1825) and other works;\nWilliam Thompson (1785-1833), author of ``Inquiry into the\nPrinciples of Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human\nHappiness'' (1824), and ``Labour Rewarded'' (1825); and\nPiercy Ravenstone, from whom Hodgskin's ideas are largely\nderived. Perhaps more important than any of these was Robert\nOwen.\nThe bulk of his time was occupied in the composition\nof his great book, ``Capital.''[3] His other\nimportant work during his later years was the formation\nand spread of the International Working Men's\nAssociation. From 1849 onward the greater part\nof his time was spent in the British Museum, accumulating,\nwith German patience, the materials for his\nterrific indictment of capitalist society, but he\nretained his hold on the International Socialist movement.\nIn several countries he had sons-in-law as\nlieutenants, like Napoleon's brothers, and in the\nvarious internal contests that arose his will generally\nprevailed.\n[3] The first and most important volume appeared in 1867;\nthe other two volumes were published posthumously (1885 and\n1894).\nThe most essential of Marx's doctrines may be\nreduced to three: first, what is called the material-\nistic interpretation of history; second, the law of the\nconcentration of capital; and, third, the class-war.\n1. The Materialistic Interpretation of History.--\nMarx holds that in the main all the phenomena of\nhuman society have their origin in material conditions,\nand these he takes to be embodied in economic\nsystems. Political constitutions, laws, religions,\nphilosophies--all these he regards as, in their broad\noutlines, expressions of the economic regime in the\nsociety that gives rise to them. It would be unfair\nto represent him as maintaining that the conscious\neconomic motive is the only one of importance; it\nis rather that economics molds character and opinion,\nand is thus the prime source of much that appears\nin consciousness to have no connection with them.\nHe applies his doctrine in particular to two revolutions,\none in the past, the other in the future. The\nrevolution in the past is that of the bourgeoisie\nagainst feudalism, which finds its expression, according\nto him, particularly in the French Revolution.\nThe one in the future is the revolution of the wage-\nearners, or proletariat, against the bourgeoisie,\nwhich is to establish the Socialist Commonwealth.\nThe whole movement of history is viewed by him as\nnecessary, as the effect of material causes operating\nupon human beings. He does not so much advocate\nthe Socialist revolution as predict it. He holds, it\nis true, that it will be beneficent, but he is much more\nconcerned to prove that it must inevitably come.\nThe same sense of necessity is visible in his exposition\nof the evils of the capitalist system. He does\nnot blame capitalists for the cruelties of which he\nshows them to have been guilty; he merely points out\nthat they are under an inherent necessity to behave\ncruelly so long as private ownership of land and\ncapital continues. But their tyranny will not last\nforever, for it generates the forces that must in the\nend overthrow it.\n2. The Law of the Concentration of Capital.--\nMarx pointed out that capitalist undertakings tend\nto grow larger and larger. He foresaw the substitution\nof trusts for free competition, and predicted\nthat the number of capitalist enterprises must diminish\nas the magnitude of single enterprises increased.\nHe supposed that this process must involve a diminution,\nnot only in the number of businesses, but also\nin the number of capitalists. Indeed, he usually\nspoke as though each business were owned by a single\nman. Accordingly, he expected that men would be\ncontinually driven from the ranks of the capitalists\ninto those of the proletariat, and that the capitalists,\nin the course of time, would grow numerically weaker\nand weaker. He applied this principle not only to\nindustry but also to agriculture. He expected to\nfind the landowners growing fewer and fewer while\ntheir estates grew larger and larger. This process\nwas to make more and more glaring the evils and\ninjustices of the capitalist system, and to stimulate\nmore and more the forces of opposition.\n3. The Class War.--Marx conceives the wage-\nearner and the capitalist in a sharp antithesis. He\nimagines that every man is, or must soon become,\nwholly the one or wholly the other. The wage-\nearner, who possesses nothing, is exploited by the\ncapitalists, who possess everything. As the capitalist\nsystem works itself out and its nature becomes more\nclear, the opposition of bourgeoisie and proletariat\nbecomes more and more marked. The two classes,\nsince they have antagonistic interests, are forced\ninto a class war which generates within the capitalist\nregime internal forces of disruption. The working\nmen learn gradually to combine against their\nexploiters, first locally, then nationally, and at last\ninternationally. When they have learned to combine\ninternationally they must be victorious. They\nwill then decree that all land and capital shall be\nowned in common; exploitation will cease; the tyranny\nof the owners of wealth will no longer be\npossible; there will no longer be any division of\nsociety into classes, and all men will be free.\nAll these ideas are already contained in the\n``Communist Manifesto,'' a work of the most amazing\nvigor and force, setting forth with terse compression\nthe titanic forces of the world, their epic battle, and\nthe inevitable consummation. This work is of such\nimportance in the development of Socialism and\ngives such an admirable statement of the doctrines\nset forth at greater length and with more pedantry\nin ``Capital,'' that its salient passages must be\nknown by anyone who wishes to understand the hold\nwhich Marxian Socialism has acquired over the intellect\nand imagination of a large proportion of working-class\nleaders.\n``A spectre is haunting Europe,'' it begins, ``the\nspectre of Communism. All the Powers of old\nEurope have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise\nthis spectre--Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot,\nFrench Radicals and German police-spies. Where\nis the party in opposition that has not been decried\nas communistic by its opponents in power? Where\nthe Opposition that has not hurled back the branding\nreproach of Communism against the more\nadvanced opposition parties, as well as against its\nre-actionary adversaries?''\nThe existence of a class war is nothing new:\n``The history of all hitherto existing society is the\nhistory of class struggles.'' In these struggles the\nfight ``each time ended, either in a revolutionary\nre-constitution of society at large, or in the common\nruin of the contending classes.''\n``Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie . . .\nhas simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a\nwhole is more and more splitting up into two great\nhostile camps, into two great classes directly facing\neach other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.'' Then follows\na history of the fall of feudalism, leading to a\ndescription of the bourgeoisie as a revolutionary\nforce. ``The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a\nmost revolutionary part.'' ``For exploitation, veiled\nby religious and political illusions, it has substituted\nnaked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.'' ``The\nneed of a constantly expanding market for its products\nchases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface\nof the globe.'' ``The bourgeoisie, during its rule of\nscarce one hundred years, has created more massive\nand more colossal productive forces than have all\npreceding generations together.'' Feudal relations\nbecame fetters: ``They had to be burst asunder;\nthey were burst asunder. . . . A similar movement\nis going on before our own eyes.'' ``The weapons\nwith which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the\nground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.\nBut not only has the bourgoisie forged the weapons\nthat bring death to itself; it has also called into\nexistence the men who are to wield those weapons--\nthe modern working class--the proletarians.''\nThe cause of the destitution of the proletariat\nare then set forth. ``The cost of production of a\nworkman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means\nof subsistence that he requires for his maintenance\nand for the propagation of his race. But the price\nof a commodity, and therefore also of labor, is equal\nto its cost of production. In proportion, therefore,\nas the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage\ndecreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of\nmachinery and diversion of labor increases, in the\nsame proportion the burden of toil also increases.''\n``Modern industry has converted the little workshop\nof the patriarchal master into the great factory\nof the industrial capitalist. Masses of laborers,\ncrowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers.\nAs privates of the industrial army they are placed\nunder the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers\nand sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois\nclass, and of the bourgeois State, they are\ndaily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the\nover-looker, and, above all, by the individual\nbourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this\ndespotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the\nmore petty, the more hateful, and the more embittering\nit is.''\nThe Manifesto tells next the manner of growth\nof the class struggle. ``The proletariat goes\nthrough various stages of development. With its\nbirth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At\nfirst the contest is carried on by individual laborers,\nthen by the workpeople of a factory, then by the\noperatives of one trade, in one locality, against the\nindividual bourgeois who directly exploits them.\nThey direct their attacks not against the bourgeois\nconditions of production, but against the instruments\nof production themselves.''\n``At this stage the laborers still form an incoherent\nmass scattered over the whole country, and broken\nup by their mutual competition. If anywhere they\nunite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet\nthe consequence of their own active union, but of\nthe union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to\nattain its own political ends, is compelled to set the\nwhole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for\na time, able to do so.''\n``The collisions between individual workmen and\nindividual bourgeois take more and more the character\nof collisions between two classes. Thereupon\nthe workers begin to form combinations (Trades\nUnions) against the bourgeois; they club together\nin order to keep up the rate of wages; they found\npermanent associations in order to make provision\nbeforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and\nthere the contest breaks out into riots. Now and\nthen the workers are victorious, but only for a time.\nThe real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate\nresult, but in the ever-expanding union of\nthe workers. This union is helped on by the im-\nproved means of communication that are created\nby modern industry, and that place the workers\nof different localities in contact with one another.\nIt was just this contact that was needed to centralize\nthe numerous local struggles, all of the same character,\ninto one national struggle between classes.\nBut every class struggle is a political struggle. And\nthat union, to attain which the burghers of the\nMiddle Ages, with their miserable highways, required\ncenturies, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways,\nachieve in a few years. This organization of\nthe proletarians into a class, and consequently into\na political party, is continually being upset again by\nthe competition between the workers themselves. But\nit ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It\ncompels legislative recognition of particular interests\nof the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions\namong the bourgeoisie itself.''\n``In the conditions of the proletariat, those of\nold society at large are already virtually swamped.\nThe proletarian is without property; his relation\nto his wife and children has no longer anything in\ncommon with the bourgeois family-relations; modern\nindustrial labor, modern subjection to capital, the\nsame in England as in France, in America as in\nGermany, has stripped him of every trace of national\ncharacter. Law, morality, religion, are to him so\nmany bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in\nambush just as many bourgeois interests. All the\npreceding classes that got the upper hand, sought\nto fortify their already acquired status by subjecting\nsociety at large to their conditions of appropriation.\nThe proletarians cannot become masters\nof the productive forces of society, except by abolishing\ntheir own previous mode of appropriation, and\nthereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.\nThey have nothing of their own to secure and to\nfortify; their mission is to destroy all previous\nsecurities for, and insurances of, individual property.\nAll previous historical movements were movements\nof minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The\nproletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent\nmovement of the immense majority, in the\ninterest of the immense majority. The proletariat,\nthe lowest stratum of our present society, cannot\nstir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole super-\nincumbent strata of official society being sprung\ninto the air.''\nThe Communists, says Marx, stand for the proletariat\nas a whole. They are international. ``The\nCommunists are further reproached with desiring\nto abolish countries and nationality. The working\nmen have no country. We cannot take from them\nwhat they have not got.''\nThe immediate aim of the Communists is the conquests\nof political power by the proletariat. ``The\ntheory of the Communists may be summed up in the\nsingle sentence: Abolition of private property.''\nThe materialistic interpretation of history is\nused to answer such charges as that Communism is\nanti-Christian. ``The charges against Communism\nmade from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally,\nfrom an ideological standpoint, are not deserving\nof serious examination. Does it require deep\nintuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views and\nconceptions, in one word, man's consciousness,\nchanges with every change in the conditions of his\nmaterial existence, in his social relations, and in his\nsocial life?''\nThe attitude of the Manifesto to the State is not\naltogether easy to grasp. ``The executive of the\nmodern State,'' we are told, ``is but a Committee for\nmanaging the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.''\nNevertheless, the first step for the proletariat\nmust be to acquire control of the State. ``We have\nseen above, that the first step in the revolution by the\nworking class, is to raise the proletariat to the position\nof ruling class, to win the battle of democracy.\nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to\nwrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie,\nto centralize all instruments of production in the\nhands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized\nas the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive\nforces as rapidly as possible.''\nThe Manifesto passes on to an immediate program\nof reforms, which would in the first instance\nmuch increase the power of the existing State, but\nit is contended that when the Socialist revolution is\naccomplished, the State, as we know it, will have\nceased to exist. As Engels says elsewhere, when the\nproletariat seizes the power of the State ``it puts an\nend to all differences of class and antagonisms of\nclass, and consequently also puts an end to the State\nas a State.'' Thus, although State Socialism might,\nin fact, be the outcome of the proposals of Marx and\nEngels, they cannot themselves be accused of any\nglorification of the State.\nThe Manifesto ends with an appeal to the wage-\nearners of the world to rise on behalf of Communism.\n``The Communists disdain to conceal their views and\naims. They openly declare that their ends can be\nattained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing\nsocial conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble\nat a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have\nnothing to lose but their chains. They have a world\nto win. Working men of all countries, unite!''\nIn all the great countries of the Continent,\nexcept Russia, a revolution followed quickly on the\npublication of the Communist Manifesto, but the\nrevolution was not economic or international, except\nat first in France. Everywhere else it was inspired\nby the ideas of nationalism. Accordingly, the rulers\nof the world, momentarily terrified, were able to\nrecover power by fomenting the enmities inherent\nin the nationalist idea, and everywhere, after a very\nbrief triumph, the revolution ended in war and\nreaction. The ideas of the Communist Manifesto\nappeared before the world was ready for them, but\nits authors lived to see the beginnings of the growth\nof that Socialist movement in every country, which\nhas pressed on with increasing force, influencing\nGovernments more and more, dominating the Russian\nRevolution, and perhaps capable of achieving\nat no very distant date that international triumph to\nwhich the last sentences of the Manifesto summon\nthe wage-earners of the world.\nMarx's magnum opus, ``Capital,'' added bulk\nand substance to the theses of the Communist Manifesto.\nIt contributed the theory of surplus value,\nwhich professed to explain the actual mechanism\nof capitalist exploitation. This doctrine is very\ncomplicated and is scarcely tenable as a contribution\nto pure theory. It is rather to be viewed as a translation\ninto abstract terms of the hatred with which\nMarx regarded the system that coins wealth out of\nhuman lives, and it is in this spirit, rather than in\nthat of disinterested analysis, that it has been read\nby its admirers. A critical examination of the theory\nof surplus value would require much difficult and\nabstract discussion of pure economic theory without\nhaving much bearing upon the practical truth or\nfalsehood of Socialism; it has therefore seemed impossible\nwithin the limits of the present volume. To\nmy mind the best parts of the book are those which\ndeal with economic facts, of which Marx's knowledge\nwas encyclopaedic. It was by these facts that\nhe hoped to instil into his disciples that firm and\nundying hatred that should make them soldiers to\nthe death in the class war. The facts which he\naccumulates are such as are practically unknown to\nthe vast majority of those who live comfortable lives.\nThey are very terrible facts, and the economic system\nwhich generates them must be acknowledged to be\na very terrible system. A few examples of his choice\nof facts will serve to explain the bitterness of many\nSocialists:--\nMr. Broughton Charlton, county magistrate, declared,\nas chairman of a meeting held at the Assembly Rooms,\nNottingham, on the 14th January, 1860, ``that there was\nan amount of privation and suffering among that portion\nof the population connected with the lace trade, unknown\nin other parts of the kingdom, indeed, in the civilized\nworld. . . . Children of nine or ten years are dragged\nfrom their squalid beds at two, three, or four o clock in\nthe morning and compelled to work for a bare subsistence\nuntil ten, eleven, or twelve at night, their limbs wearing\naway, their frames dwindling, their faces whitening,\nand their humanity absolutely sinking into a stone-like\ntorpor, utterly horrible to contemplate.''[4]\n[4] Vol. i, p. 227.\nThree railway men are standing before a London coroner's\njury--a guard, an engine-driver, a signalman.\nA tremendous railway accident has hurried hundreds of\npassengers into another world. The negligence of the\nemployes is the cause of the misfortune. They declare\nwith one voice before the jury that ten or twelve years\nbefore, their labor only lasted eight hours a day. During\nthe last five or six years it had been screwed up to\n14, 18, and 20 hours, and under a specially severe pressure\nof holiday-makers, at times of excursion trains, it\noften lasted 40 or 50 hours without a break. They\nwere ordinary men, not Cyclops. At a certain point their\nlabor-power failed. Torpor seized them. Their brain\nceased to think, their eyes to see. The thoroughly\n``respectable'' British jurymen answered by a verdict that\nsent them to the next assizes on a charge of manslaughter,\nand, in a gentle ``rider'' to their verdict, expressed the\npious hope that the capitalistic magnates of the railways\nwould, in future, be more extravagant in the purchase of\na sufficient quantity of labor-power, and more ``abstemious,''\nmore ``self-denying,'' more ``thrifty,'' in the\ndraining of paid labor-power.[5]\n[5] Vol. i, pp. 237, 238.\nIn the last week of June, 1863, all the London daily\npapers published a paragraph with the ``sensational''\nheading, ``Death from simple over-work.'' It dealt with\nthe death of the milliner, Mary Anne Walkley, 20 years\nof age, employed in a highly respectable dressmaking\nestablishment, exploited by a lady with the pleasant name\nof Elise. The old, often-told story was once more recounted.\nThis girl worked, on an average, 16 1/2 hours,\nduring the season often 30 hours, without a break, whilst\nher failing labor-power was revived by occasional supplies\nof sherry, port, or coffee. It was just now the\nheight of the season. It was necessary to conjure up\nin the twinkling of an eye the gorgeous dresses for the\nnoble ladies bidden to the ball in honor of the newly-\nimported Princess of Wales. Mary Anne Walkley had\nworked without intermission for 26 1/2 hours, with 60\nother girls, 30 in one room, that only afforded 1/3 of\nthe cubic feet of air required for them. At night, they\nslept in pairs in one of the stifling holes into which the\nbedroom was divided by partitions of board. And this\nwas one of the best millinery establishments in London.\nMary Anne Walkley fell ill on the Friday, died on Sunday,\nwithout, to the astonishment of Madame Elise,\nhaving previously completed the work in hand. The doctor,\nMr. Keys, called too late to the death bed, duly bore\nwitness before the coroner's jury that ``Mary Anne\nWalkley had died from long hours of work in an over-\ncrowded workroom, and a too small and badly ventilated\nbedroom.'' In order to give the doctor a lesson in good\nmanners, the coroner's jury thereupon brought in a verdict\nthat ``the deceased had died of apoplexy, but there\nwas reason to fear that her death had been accelerated\nby over-work in an over-crowded workroom, &c.'' ``Our\nwhite slaves,'' cried the ``Morning Star,'' the organ of the\nfree-traders, Cobden and Bright, ``our white slaves, who\nare toiled into the grave, for the most part silently pine\nand die.''[6]\n[6] Vol. i, pp. 239, 240.\nEdward VI: A statue of the first year of his reign,\n1547, ordains that if anyone refuses to work, he shall be\ncondemned as a slave to the person who has denounced\nhim as an idler. The master shall feed his slave on bread\nand water, weak broth and such refuse meat as he thinks\nfit. He has the right to force him to do any work, no\nmatter how disgusting, with whip and chains. If the\nslave is absent a fortnight, he is condemned to slavery for\nlife and is to be branded on forehead or back with the\nletter S; if he runs away thrice, he is to be executed as\na felon. The master can sell him, bequeath him, let him\nout on hire as a slave, just as any other personal chattel\nor cattle. If the slaves attempt anything against the\nmasters, they are also to be executed. Justices of the\npeace, on information, are to hunt the rascals down. If it\nhappens that a vagabond has been idling about for three\ndays, he is to be taken to his birthplace, branded with a\nredhot iron with the letter V on the breast and be set\nto work, in chains, in the streets or at some other labor.\nIf the vagabond gives a false birthplace, he is then to\nbecome the slave for life of this place, of its inhabitants,\nor its corporation, and to be branded with an S. All persons\nhave the right to take away the children of the\nvagabonds and to keep them as apprentices, the young\nmen until the 24th year, the girls until the 20th. If\nthey run away, they are to become up to this age the\nslaves of their masters, who can put them in irons, whip\nthem, &c., if they like. Every master may put an iron\nring around the neck, arms or legs of his slave, by which\nto know him more easily and to be more certain of him.\nThe last part of this statute provides that certain poor\npeople may be employed by a place or by persons, who\nare willing to give them food and drink and to find them\nwork. This kind of parish-slaves was kept up in England\nuntil far into the 19th century under the name of\n``roundsmen.''[7]\n[7] Vol. i, pp. 758, 759.\nPage after page and chapter after chapter of\nfacts of this nature, each brought up to illustrate\nsome fatalistic theory which Marx professes to have\nproved by exact reasoning, cannot but stir into fury\nany passionate working-class reader, and into\nunbearable shame any possessor of capital in whom\ngenerosity and justice are not wholly extinct.\nAlmost at the end of the volume, in a very brief\nchapter, called ``Historical Tendency of Capitalist\nAccumulation,'' Marx allows one moment's glimpse\nof the hope that lies beyond the present horror:--\nAs soon as this process of transformation has\nsufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom,\nas soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their\nmeans of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist\nmode of production stands on its own feet, then the\nfurther socialization of labor and further transformation\nof the land and other means of production into so-\ncially exploited and, therefore, common means of production,\nas well as the further expropriation of private proprietors,\ntakes a new form. That which is now to be\nexpropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself,\nbut the capitalist exploiting many laborers. This\nexpropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent\nlaws of capitalistic production itself, by the\ncentralization of capital. One capitalist always kills\nmany, and in hand with this centralization, or this\nexpropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on\nan ever extending scale, the co-operative form of the\nlabor-process, the conscious technical application of\nscience, the methodical cultivation of the soil, the\ntransformation of the instruments of labor into instruments\nof labor only usable in common, the economizing of all\nmeans of production by their use as the means of production\nof combined, socialized labor, the entanglement\nof all peoples in the net of the world-market, and with\nthis, the international character of the capitalistic regime.\nAlong with the constantly diminishing number of the\nmagnates of capital, who usurp and monopolize all\nadvantages of this process of transformation, grows the\nmass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation;\nbut with this, too, grows the revolt of the working-\nclass, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined,\nunited, organized by the very mechanism of the\nprocess of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of\ncapital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production,\nwhich has sprung up and flourished along with, and\nunder it. Centralization of the means of production and\nsocialization of labor at last reach a point where they\nbecome incompatible with their capitalist integument.\nThis integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist\nprivate property sounds. The expropriators are\nexpropriated,[8]\n[8] Vol. i pp. 788, 789.\nThat is all. Hardly another word from beginning\nto end is allowed to relieve the gloom, and in this\nrelentless pressure upon the mind of the reader lies\na great part of the power which this book has\nacquired.\nTwo questions are raised by Marx's work: First,\nAre his laws of historical development true? Second,\nIs Socialism desirable? The second of these questions\nis quite independent of the first. Marx professes\nto prove that Socialism must come, but scarcely concerns\nhimself to argue that when it comes it will be\na good thing. It may be, however, that if it comes,\nit will be a good thing, even though all Marx's arguments\nto prove that it must come should be at fault.\nIn actual fact, time has shown many flaws in Marx's\ntheories. The development of the world has been\nsufficiently like his prophecy to prove him a man of\nvery unusual penetration, but has not been sufficiently\nlike to make either political or economic history\nexactly such as he predicted that it would be.\nNationalism, so far from diminishing, has increased,\nand has failed to be conquered by the cosmopolitan\ntendencies which Marx rightly discerned in finance.\nAlthough big businesses have grown bigger and have\nover a great area reached the stage of monopoly,\nyet the number of shareholders in such enterprises\nis so large that the actual number of individuals\ninterested in the capitalist system has continually\nincreased. Moreover, though large firms have grown\nlarger, there has been a simultaneous increase in\nfirms of medium size. Meanwhile the wage-earners,\nwho were, according to Marx, to have remained at\nthe bare level of subsistence at which they were in\nthe England of the first half of the nineteenth century,\nhave instead profited by the general increase\nof wealth, though in a lesser degree than the capitalists.\nThe supposed iron law of wages has been\nproved untrue, so far as labor in civilized countries\nis concerned. If we wish now to find examples of\ncapitalist cruelty analogous to those with which\nMarx's book is filled, we shall have to go for most\nof our material to the Tropics, or at any rate to\nregions where there are men of inferior races to\nexploit. Again: the skilled worker of the present day\nis an aristocrat in the world of labor. It is a question\nwith him whether he shall ally himself with the\nunskilled worker against the capitalist, or with the\ncapitalist against the unskilled worker. Very often\nhe is himself a capitalist in a small way, and if he\nis not so individually, his trade union or his friendly\nsociety is pretty sure to be so. Hence the sharpness\nof the class war has not been maintained. There\nare gradations, intermediate ranks between rich and\npoor, instead of the clear-cut logical antithesis\nbetween the workers who have nothing and the capitalists\nwho have all. Even in Germany, which\nbecame the home of orthodox Marxianism and developed\na powerful Social-Democratic party, nominally\naccepting the doctrine of ``Das Kapital'' as all but\nverbally inspired, even there the enormous increase\nof wealth in all classes in the years preceding the\nwar led Socialists to revise their beliefs and to adopt\nan evolutionary rather than a revolutionary attitude.\nBernstein, a German Socialist who lived long in\nEngland, inaugurated the ``Revisionist'' movement\nwhich at last conquered the bulk of the party. His\ncriticisms of Marxian orthodoxy are set forth in\nhis ``Evolutionary Socialism.''[9] Bernstein's work,\nas is common in Broad Church writers, consists\nlargely in showing that the Founders did not hold\ntheir doctrines so rigidly as their followers have\ndone. There is much in the writings of Marx and\nEngels that cannot be fitted into the rigid orthodoxy\nwhich grew up among their disciples. Bernstein's\nmain criticisms of these disciples, apart from such as\nwe have already mentioned, consist in a defense of\npiecemeal action as against revolution. He protests\nagainst the attitude of undue hostility to Liberalism\nwhich is common among Socialists, and he blunts the\nedge of the Internationalism which undoubtedly is\npart of the teachings of Marx. The workers, he\nsays, have a Fatherland as soon as they become\ncitizens, and on this basis he defends that degree of\nnationalism which the war has since shown to be\nprevalent in the ranks of Socialists. He even goes\nso far as to maintain that European nations have a\nright to tropical territory owing to their higher\ncivilization. Such doctrines diminish revolutionary\nardor and tend to transform Socialists into a left\nwing of the Liberal Party. But the increasing prosperity\nof wage-earners before the war made these\ndevelopments inevitable. Whether the war will have\naltered conditions in this respect, it is as yet\nimpossible to know. Bernstein concludes with the wise\nremark that: ``We have to take working men as they\nare. And they are neither so universally paupers as\nwas set out in the Communist Manifesto, nor so free\nfrom prejudices and weaknesses as their courtiers\nwish to make us believe.''\n[9] Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben\nder Sozial-Demokratie.''\nIn March, 1914, Bernstein delivered a lecture in Budapest\nin which he withdrew from several of the positions he had taken\nup (vide Budapest ``Volkstimme,'' March 19, 1914).\nBerstein represents the decay of Marxian orthodoxy\nfrom within. Syndicalism represents an attack\nagainst it from without, from the standpoint of a\ndoctrine which professes to be even more radical and\nmore revolutionary than that of Marx and Engels.\nThe attitude of Syndicalists to Marx may be seen in\nSorel's little book, ``La Decomposition du Marxisme,''\nand in his larger work, ``Reflections on\nViolence,'' authorized translation by T. E. Hulme\n(Allen & Unwin, 1915). After quoting Bernstein,\nwith approval in so far as he criticises Marx, Sorel\nproceeds to other criticisms of a different order. He\npoints out (what is true) that Marx's theoretical\neconomics remain very near to Manchesterism: the\northodox political economy of his youth was accepted\nby him on many points on which it is now known to\nbe wrong. According to Sorel, the really essential\nthing in Marx's teaching is the class war. Whoever\nkeeps this alive is keeping alive the spirit of Socialism\nmuch more truly than those who adhere to the\nletter of Social-Democratic orthodoxy. On the basis\nof the class war, French Syndicalists developed a\ncriticism of Marx which goes much deeper than those\nthat we have been hitherto considering. Marx's\nviews on historical development may have been in a\ngreater or less degree mistaken in fact, and yet the\neconomic and political system which he sought to\ncreate might be just as desirable as his followers\nsuppose. Syndicalism, however, criticises, not only\nMarx's views of fact, but also the goal at which he\naims and the general nature of the means which he\nrecommends. Marx's ideas were formed at a time\nwhen democracy did not yet exist. It was in the\nvery year in which ``Das Kapital'' appeared that\nurban working men first got the vote in England and\nuniversal suffrage was granted by Bismarck in\nNorthern Germany. It was natural that great hopes\nshould be entertained as to what democracy would\nachieve. Marx, like the orthodox economists,\nimagined that men's opinions are guided by a more\nor less enlightened view of economic self-interest, or\nrather of economic class interest. A long experience\nof the workings of political democracy has shown\nthat in this respect Disraeli and Bismarck were\nshrewder judges of human nature than either Liberals\nor Socialists. It has become increasingly difficult\nto put trust in the State as a means to liberty,\nor in political parties as instruments sufficiently\npowerful to force the State into the service of the\npeople. The modern State, says Sorel, ``is a body of\nintellectuals, which is invested with privileges, and\nwhich possesses means of the kind called political for\ndefending itself against the attacks made on it by\nother groups of intellectuals, eager to possess the\nprofits of public employment. Parties are constituted\nin order to acquire the conquest of these\nemployments, and they are analogous to the State.''[10]\n[10] La Decomposition du Marxisme,'' p. 53.\nSyndicalists aim at organizing men, not by party,\nbut by occupation. This, they say, alone represents\nthe true conception and method of the class war.\nAccordingly they despise all POLITICAL action through\nthe medium of Parliament and elections: the kind of\naction that they recommend is direct action by the\nrevolutionary syndicate or trade union. The battle-\ncry of industrial versus political action has spread\nfar beyond the ranks of French Syndicalism. It is\nto be found in the I. W. W. in America, and among\nIndustrial Unionists and Guild Socialists in Great\nBritain. Those who advocate it, for the most part,\naim also at a different goal from that of Marx. They\nbelieve that there can be no adequate individual\nfreedom where the State is all-powerful, even if the\nState be a Socialist one. Some of them are out-and-\nout Anarchists, who wish to see the State wholly\nabolished; others only wish to curtail its authority.\nOwing to this movement, opposition to Marx, which\nfrom the Anarchist side existed from the first, has\ngrown very strong. It is this opposition in its older\nform that will occupy us in our next chapter.\nCHAPTER II\nBAKUNIN AND ANARCHISM\nIN the popular mind, an Anarchist is a person\nwho throws bombs and commits other outrages,\neither because he is more or less insane, or because\nhe uses the pretense of extreme political opinions as\na cloak for criminal proclivities. This view is, of\ncourse, in every way inadequate. Some Anarchists\nbelieve in throwing bombs; many do not. Men of\nalmost every other shade of opinion believe in throwing\nbombs in suitable circumstances: for example,\nthe men who threw the bomb at Sarajevo which\nstarted the present war were not Anarchists, but\nNationalists. And those Anarchists who are in\nfavor of bomb-throwing do not in this respect differ\non any vital principle from the rest of the community,\nwith the exception of that infinitesimal portion\nwho adopt the Tolstoyan attitude of non-resistance.\nAnarchists, like Socialists, usually believe\nin the doctrine of the class war, and if they use\nbombs, it is as Governments use bombs, for purposes\nof war: but for every bomb manufactured by an\nAnarchist, many millions are manufactured by Governments,\nand for every man killed by Anarchist\nviolence, many millions are killed by the violence of\nStates. We may, therefore, dismiss from our minds\nthe whole question of violence, which plays so large\na part in the popular imagination, since it is neither\nessential nor peculiar to those who adopt the Anarchist\nposition.\nAnarchism, as its derivation indicates, is the\ntheory which is opposed to every kind of forcible\ngovernment. It is opposed to the State as the\nembodiment of the force employed in the government\nof the community. Such government as Anarchism\ncan tolerate must be free government, not merely in\nthe sense that it is that of a majority, but in the sense\nthat it is that assented to by all. Anarchists object\nto such institutions as the police and the criminal\nlaw, by means of which the will of one part of the\ncommunity is forced upon another part. In their\nview, the democratic form of government is not very\nenormously preferable to other forms so long as\nminorities are compelled by force or its potentiality\nto submit to the will of majorities. Liberty is the\nsupreme good in the Anarchist creed, and liberty\nis sought by the direct road of abolishing all forcible\ncontrol over the individual by the community.\nAnarchism, in this sense, is no new doctrine. It\nis set forth admirably by Chuang Tzu, a Chinese philosopher,\nwho lived about the year 300 B. C.:--\nHorses have hoofs to carry them over frost and snow;\nhair, to protect them from wind and cold. They eat grass\nand drink water, and fling up their heels over the champaign.\nSuch is the real nature of horses. Palatial\ndwellings are of no use to them.\nOne day Po Lo appeared, saying: ``I understand the\nmanagement of horses.''\nSo he branded them, and clipped them, and pared\ntheir hoofs, and put halters on them, tying them up by\nthe head and shackling them by the feet, and disposing\nthem in stables, with the result that two or three in\nevery ten died. Then he kept them hungry and thirsty,\ntrotting them and galloping them, and grooming, and\ntrimming, with the misery of the tasselled bridle before\nand the fear of the knotted whip behind, until more than\nhalf of them were dead.\nThe potter says: ``I can do what I will with Clay.\nIf I want it round, I use compasses; if rectangular, a\nsquare.''\nThe carpenter says: ``I can do what I will with\nwood. If I want it curved, I use an arc; if straight, a\nline.''\nBut on what grounds can we think that the natures\nof clay and wood desire this application of compasses and\nsquare, of arc and line? Nevertheless, every age extols\nPo Lo for his skill in managing horses, and potters and\ncarpenters for their skill with clay and wood. Those\nwho govern the empire make the same mistake.\nNow I regard government of the empire from quite\na different point of view.\nThe people have certain natural instincts:--to weave\nand clothe themselves, to till and feed themselves. These\nare common to all humanity, and all are agreed thereon.\nSuch instincts are called ``Heaven-sent.''\nAnd so in the days when natural instincts prevailed,\nmen moved quietly and gazed steadily. At that time\nthere were no roads over mountains, nor boats, nor\nbridges over water. All things were produced, each for\nits own proper sphere. Birds and beasts multiplied,\ntrees and shrubs grew up. The former might be led by\nthe hand; you could climb up and peep into the raven's\nnest. For then man dwelt with birds and beasts, and\nall creation was one. There were no distinctions of good\nand bad men. Being all equally without knowledge,\ntheir virtue could not go astray. Being all equally\nwithout evil desires, they were in a state of natural\nintegrity, the perfection of human existence.\nBut when Sages appeared, tripping up people over\ncharity and fettering them with duty to their neighbor,\ndoubt found its way into the world. And then, with\ntheir gushing over music and fussing over ceremony, the\nempire became divided against itself.[11]\n[11] ``Musings of a Chinese Mystic.'' Selections from the Philosophy\nof Chuang Tzu. With an Introduction by Lionel Giles,\nM.A. (Oxon.). Wisdom of the East Series, John Murray, 1911.\nPages 66-68.\nThe modern Anarchism, in the sense in which we\nshall be concerned with it, is associated with belief\nin the communal ownership of land and capital, and\nis thus in an important respect akin to Socialism.\nThis doctrine is properly called Anarchist Com-\nmunism, but as it embraces practically all modern\nAnarchism, we may ignore individualist Anarchism\naltogether and concentrate attention upon the\ncommunistic form. Socialism and Anarchist Communism\nalike have arisen from the perception that private\ncapital is a source of tyranny by certain individuals\nover others. Orthodox Socialism believes that the\nindividual will become free if the State becomes the\nsole capitalist. Anarchism, on the contrary, fears\nthat in that case the State might merely inherit the\ntyrannical propensities of the private capitalist.\nAccordingly, it seeks for a means of reconciling communal\nownership with the utmost possible diminution\nin the powers of the State, and indeed ultimately with\nthe complete abolition of the State. It has arisen\nmainly within the Socialist movement as its extreme\nleft wing.\nIn the same sense in which Marx may be regarded\nas the founder of modern Socialism, Bakunin may\nbe regarded as the founder of Anarchist Communism.\nBut Bakunin did not produce, like Marx, a finished\nand systematic body of doctrine. The nearest\napproach to this will be found in the writings of his\nfollower, Kropotkin. In order to explain modern\nAnarchism we shall begin with the life of Bakunin[12]\nand the history of his conflicts with Marx, and shall\nthen give a brief account of Anarchist theory as set\nforth partly in his writings, but more in those of\nKropotkin.[13]\n[12] An account of the life of Bakunin from the Anarchist\nstandpoint will be found in vol. ii of the complete edition of\nhis works: ``Michel Bakounine, OEuvres,'' Tome II. Avec une\nnotice biographique, des avant-propos et des notes, par James\nGuillaume. Paris, P.-V, Stock, editeur, pp. v-lxiii.\n[13] Criticism of these theories will be reserved for Part II.\nMichel Bakunin was born in 1814 of a Russian\naristocratic family. His father was a diplomatist,\nwho at the time of Bakunin's birth had retired to his\ncountry estate in the Government of Tver. Bakunin\nentered the school of artillery in Petersburg at the\nage of fifteen, and at the age of eighteen was sent as\nan ensign to a regiment stationed in the Government\nof Minsk. The Polish insurrection of 1880 had just\nbeen crushed. ``The spectacle of terrorized Poland,''\nsays Guillaume, ``acted powerfully on the heart of\nthe young officer, and contributed to inspire in him\nthe horror of despotism.'' This led him to give up\nthe military career after two years' trial. In 1834\nhe resigned his commission and went to Moscow,\nwhere he spent six years studying philosophy. Like\nall philosophical students of that period, he became\na Hegelian, and in 1840 he went to Berlin to continue\nhis studies, in the hope of ultimately becoming a\nprofessor. But after this time his opinions underwent\na rapid change. He found it impossible to\naccept the Hegelian maxim that whatever is, is\nrational, and in 1842 he migrated to Dresden, where\nhe became associated with Arnold Ruge, the publisher\nof ``Deutsche Jahrbuecher.'' By this time he had\nbecome a revolutionary, and in the following year\nhe incurred the hostility of the Saxon Government.\nThis led him to go to Switzerland, where he came in\ncontact with a group of German Communists, but, as\nthe Swiss police importuned him and the Russian\nGovernment demanded his return, he removed to\nParis, where he remained from 1843 to 1847. These\nyears in Paris were important in the formation of his\noutlook and opinions. He became acquainted with\nProudhon, who exercised a considerable influence on\nhim; also with George Sand and many other well-\nknown people. It was in Paris that he first made\nthe acquaintance of Marx and Engels, with whom he\nwas to carry on a lifelong battle. At a much later\nperiod, in 1871, he gave the following account of his\nrelations with Marx at this time:--\nMarx was much more advanced than I was, as he\nremains to-day not more advanced but incomparably more\nlearned than I am. I knew then nothing of political\neconomy. I had not yet rid myself of metaphysical\nabstractions, and my Socialism was only instinctive. He,\nthough younger than I, was already an atheist, an\ninstructed materialist, a well-considered Socialist. It\nwas just at this time that he elaborated the first foundations\nof his present system. We saw each other fairly\noften, for I respected him much for his learning and his\npassionate and serious devotion (always mixed, however,\nwith personal vanity) to the cause of the proletariat,\nand I sought eagerly his conversation, which was always\ninstructive and clever, when it was not inspired by a\npaltry hate, which, alas! happened only too often. But\nthere was never any frank intimacy between as. Our\ntemperaments would not suffer it. He called me a\nsentimental idealist, and he was right; I called him a\nvain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.\nBakunin never succeeded in staying long in one\nplace without incurring the enmity of the authorities.\nIn November, 1847, as the result of a speech\npraising the Polish rising of 1830, he was expelled\nfrom France at the request of the Russian Embassy,\nwhich, in order to rob him of public sympathy, spread\nthe unfounded report that he had been an agent of\nthe Russian Government, but was no longer wanted\nbecause he had gone too far. The French Government,\nby calculated reticence, encouraged this story,\nwhich clung to him more or less throughout his life.\nBeing compelled to leave France, he went to\nBrussels, where he renewed acquaintance with Marx.\nA letter of his, written at this time, shows that he\nentertained already that bitter hatred for which\nafterward he had so much reason. ``The Germans,\nartisans, Bornstedt, Marx and Engels--and, above\nall, Marx--are here, doing their ordinary mischief.\nVanity, spite, gossip, theoretical overbearingness\nand practical pusillanimity--reflections on life, action\nand simplicity, and complete absence of life,\naction and simplicity--literary and argumentative\nartisans and repulsive coquetry with them: `Feuerbach\nis a bourgeois,' and the word `bourgeois' grown\ninto an epithet and repeated ad nauseum, but all of\nthem themselves from head to foot, through and\nthrough, provincial bourgeois. With one word, lying\nand stupidity, stupidity and lying. In this society\nthere is no possibility of drawing a free, full breath.\nI hold myself aloof from them, and have declared\nquite decidedly that I will not join their communistic\nunion of artisans, and will have nothing to do\nwith it.''\nThe Revolution of 1848 led him to return to Paris\nand thence to Germany. He had a quarrel with\nMarx over a matter in which he himself confessed\nlater that Marx was in the right. He became a member\nof the Slav Congress in Prague, where he vainly\nendeavored to promote a Slav insurrection. Toward\nthe end of 1848, he wrote an ``Appeal to Slavs,''\ncalling on them to combine with other revolutionaries\nto destroy the three oppressive monarchies, Russia,\nAustria and Prussia. Marx attacked him in print,\nsaying, in effect, that the movement for Bohemian\nindependence was futile because the Slavs had no\nfuture, at any rate in those regions where they hap-\npened to be subject to Germany and Austria.\nBakunin accused Mars of German patriotism in\nthis matter, and Marx accused him of Pan-Slavism,\nno doubt in both cases justly. Before this dispute,\nhowever, a much more serious quarrel had taken\nplace. Marx's paper, the ``Neue Rheinische Zeitung,''\nstated that George Sand had papers proving\nBakunin to be a Russian Government agent and one\nof those responsible for the recent arrest of Poles.\nBakunin, of course, repudiated the charge, and\nGeorge Sand wrote to the ``Neue Rheinische\nZeitung,'' denying this statement in toto. The denials\nwere published by Marx, and there was a nominal\nreconciliation, but from this time onward there was\nnever any real abatement of the hostility between\nthese rival leaders, who did not meet again until 1864.\nMeanwhile, the reaction had been everywhere\ngaining ground. In May, 1849, an insurrection in\nDresden for a moment made the revolutionaries masters\nof the town. They held it for five days and\nestablished a revolutionary government. Bakunin\nwas the soul of the defense which they made against\nthe Prussian troops. But they were overpowered,\nand at last Bakunin was captured while trying to\nescape with Heubner and Richard Wagner, the last\nof whom, fortunately for music, was not captured.\nNow began a long period of imprisonment in\nmany prisons and various countries. Bakunin was\nsentenced to death on the 14th of January, 1850, but\nhis sentence was commuted after five months, and he\nwas delivered over to Austria, which claimed the\nprivilege of punishing him. The Austrians, in their\nturn, condemned him to death in May, 1851, and\nagain his sentence was commuted to imprisonment for\nlife. In the Austrian prisons he had fetters on hands\nand feet, and in one of them he was even chained to the\nwall by the belt. There seems to have been some\npeculiar pleasure to be derived from the punishment\nof Bakunin, for the Russian Government in its turn\ndemanded him of the Austrians, who delivered him\nup. In Russia he was confined, first in the Peter and\nPaul fortress and then in the Schluesselburg. There\nbe suffered from scurvy and all his teeth fell out.\nHis health gave way completely, and he found almost\nall food impossible to assimilate. ``But, if his body\nbecame enfeebled, his spirit remained inflexible. He\nfeared one thing above all. It was to find himself\nsome day led, by the debilitating action of prison,\nto the condition of degradation of which Silvio Pellico\noffers a well-known type. He feared that he might\ncease to hate, that he might feel the sentiment of\nrevolt which upheld him becoming extinguished in\nhis hearts that he might come to pardon his persecutors\nand resign himself to his fate. But this fear\nwas superfluous; his energy did not abandon him a\nsingle day, and he emerged from his cell the same\nman as when he entered.''[14]\n[14] Ibid. p. xxvi.\nAfter the death of the Tsar Nicholas many political\nprisoners were amnested, but Alexander II with\nhis own hand erased Bakunin's name from the list.\nWhen Bakunin's mother succeeded in obtaining an\ninterview with the new Tsar, he said to her, ``Know,\nMadame, that so long as your son lives, he can never\nbe free.'' However, in 1857, after eight years of\ncaptivity, he was sent to the comparative freedom of\nSiberia. From there, in 1861, he succeeded in escaping\nto Japan, and thence through America to London.\nHe had been imprisoned for his hostility to\ngovernments, but, strange to say, his sufferings had\nnot had the intended effect of making him love those\nwho inflicted them. From this time onward, he\ndevoted himself to spreading the spirit of Anarchist\nrevolt, without, however, having to suffer any further\nterm of imprisonment. For some years he lived in\nItaly, where he founded in 1864 an ``International\nFraternity'' or ``Alliance of Socialist Revolutionaries.''\nThis contained men of many countries, but\napparently no Germans. It devoted itself largely to\ncombating Mazzini's nationalism. In 1867 he moved\nto Switzerland, where in the following year he\nhelped to found the ``International Alliance of So-\ncialist Democracy,'' of which he drew up the program.\nThis program gives a good succinct resume of\nhis opinions:--\nThe Alliance declares itself atheist; it desires the\ndefinitive and entire abolition of classes and the political\nequality and social equalization of individuals of both\nsexes. It desires that the earth, the instrument of labor,\nlike all other capital, becoming the collective property of\nsociety as a whole, shall be no longer able to be utilized\nexcept by the workers, that is to say, by agricultural and\nindustrial associations. It recognizes that all actually\nexisting political and authoritarian States, reducing\nthemselves more and more to the mere administrative functions\nof the public services in their respective countries,\nmust disappear in the universal union of free\nassociations, both agricultural and industrial.\nThe International Alliance of Socialist Democracy\ndesired to become a branch of the International\nWorking Men's Association, but was refused admission\non the ground that branches must be local, and\ncould not themselves be international. The Geneva\ngroup of the Alliance, however, was admitted later,\nin July, 1869.\nThe International Working Men's Association\nhad been founded in London in 1864, and its statutes\nand program were drawn up by Marx. Bakunin at\nfirst did not expect it to prove a success and refused\nto join it. But it spread with remarkable rapidity\nin many countries and soon became a great power\nfor the propagation of Socialist ideas. Originally\nit was by no means wholly Socialist, but in successive\nCongresses Marx won it over more and more to his\nviews. At its third Congress, in Brussels in September,\n1868, it became definitely Socialist. Meanwhile\nBakunin, regretting his earlier abstention, had\ndecided to join it, and he brought with him a\nconsiderable following in French-Switzerland, France,\nSpain and Italy. At the fourth Congress, held at\nBasle in September, 1869, two currents were strongly\nmarked. The Germans and English followed Marx\nin his belief in the State as it was to become after the\nabolition of private property; they followed him also\nin his desire to found Labor Parties in the various\ncountries, and to utilize the machinery of democracy\nfor the election of representatives of Labor to\nParliaments. On the other hand, the Latin nations in\nthe main followed Bakunin in opposing the State and\ndisbelieving in the machinery of representative\ngovernment. The conflict between these two groups grew\nmore and more bitter, and each accused the other\nof various offenses. The statement that Bakunin\nwas a spy was repeated, but was withdrawn after\ninvestigation. Marx wrote in a confidential\ncommunication to his German friends that Bakunin was\nan agent of the Pan-Slavist party and received from\nthem 25,000 francs a year. Meanwhile, Bakunin\nbecame for a time interested in the attempt to stir\nup an agrarian revolt in Russia, and this led him\nto neglect the contest in the International at a crucial\nmoment. During the Franco-Prussian war Bakunin\npassionately took the side of France, especially after\nthe fall of Napoleon III. He endeavored to rouse\nthe people to revolutionary resistance like that of\n1793, and became involved in an abortive attempt at\nrevolt in Lyons. The French Government accused\nhim of being a paid agent of Prussia, and it was\nwith difficulty that he escaped to Switzerland. The\ndispute with Marx and his followers had become\nexacerbated by the national dispute. Bakunin, like\nKropotkin after him, regarded the new power of\nGermany as the greatest menace to liberty in the\nworld. He hated the Germans with a bitter hatred,\npartly, no doubt, on account of Bismarck, but probably\nstill more on account of Marx. To this day,\nAnarchism has remained confined almost exclusively\nto the Latin countries, and has been associated with, a\nhatred of Germany, growing out of the contests\nbetween Marx and Bakunin in the International.\nThe final suppression of Bakunin's faction\noccurred at the General Congress of the International\nat the Hague in 1872. The meeting-place was\nchosen by the General Council (in which Marx was\nunopposed), with a view--so Bakunin's friends contend--\nto making access impossible for Bakunin (on\naccount of the hostility of the French and German\ngovernments) and difficult for his friends. Bakunin\nwas expelled from the International as the result of\na report accusing him inter alia of theft backed; up\nby intimidation.\nThe orthodoxy of the International was saved,\nbut at the cost of its vitality. From this time onward,\nit ceased to be itself a power, but both sections continued\nto work in their various groups, and the Socialist\ngroups in particular grew rapidly. Ultimately\na new International was formed (1889) which continued\ndown to the outbreak of the present war. As\nto the future of International Socialism it would be\nrash to prophesy, though it would seem that the\ninternational idea has acquired sufficient strength to\nneed again, after the war, some such means of expression\nas it found before in Socialist congresses.\nBy this time Bakunin's health was broken, and\nexcept for a few brief intervals, he lived in retirement\nuntil his death in 1876.\nBakunin's life, unlike Marx's, was a very stormy\none. Every kind of rebellion against authority\nalways aroused his sympathy, and in his support he\nnever paid the slightest attention to personal risk.\nHis influence, undoubtedly very great, arose chiefly\nthrough the influence of his personality upon important\nindividuals. His writings differ from Marx's as\nmuch as his life does, and in a similar way. They are\nchaotic, largely, aroused by some passing occasion,\nabstract and metaphysical, except when they deal\nwith current politics. He does not come to close\nquarters with economic facts, but dwells usually in\nthe regions of theory and metaphysics. When he\ndescends from these regions, he is much more at the\nmercy of current international politics than Marx,\nmuch less imbued with the consequences of the belief\nthat it is economic causes that are fundamental. He\npraised Marx for enunciating this doctrine,[15] but\nnevertheless continued to think in terms of nations.\nHis longest work, ``L'Empire Knouto-Germanique et\nla Revolution Sociale,'' is mainly concerned with the\nsituation in France during the later stages of the\nFranco-Prussian War, and with the means of resisting\nGerman imperialism. Most of his writing was\ndone in a hurry in the interval between two insurrections.\nThere is something of Anarchism in his lack\nof literary order. His best-known work is a fragment\nentitled by its editors ``God and the State.''[16]\nIn this work he represents belief in God and belief in\nthe State as the two great obstacles to human liberty.\nA typical passage will serve to illustrate its style.\n[15] ``Marx, as a thinker, is on the right road. He has established\nas a principle that all the evolutions, political, religious,\nand juridical, in history are, not the causes, but the effects of\neconomic evolutions. This is a great and fruitful thought, which\nhe has not absolutely invented; it has been glimpsed, expressed\nin part, by many others besides him; but in any case to him\nbelongs the honor of having solidly established it and of having\nenunciated it as the basis of his whole economic system. (1870;\nib. ii. p. xiii.)\n[16] This title is not Bakunin's, but was invented by Cafiero\nand Elisee Reclus, who edited it, not knowing that it was a\nfragment of what was intended to he the second version of\n``L'Empire Knouto-Germanique'' (see ib. ii. p 283).\nThe State is not society, it is only an historical form\nof it, as brutal as it is abstract. It was born historically\nin all countries of the marriage of violence, rapine, pillage,\nin a word, war and conquest, with the gods successively\ncreated by the theological fantasy of nations.\nIt has been from its origin, and it remains still at present,\nthe divine sanction of brutal force and triumphant\ninequality.\nThe State is authority; it is force; it is the ostentation\nand infatuation of force: it does not insinuate\nitself; it does not seek to convert. . . . Even when\nit commands what is good, it hinders and spoils it, just\nbecause it commands it, and because every command provokes\nand excites the legitimate revolts of liberty; and\nbecause the good, from the moment that it is commanded,\nbecomes evil from the point of view of true morality, of\nhuman morality (doubtless not of divine), from the point\nof view of human respect and of liberty. Liberty, morality,\nand the human dignity of man consist precisely\nin this, that he does good, not because it is commanded,\nbut because he conceives it, wills it and loves it.\nWe do not find in Bakunin's works a clear picture\nof the society at which he aimed, or any argument\nto prove that such a society could be stable.\nIf we wish to understand Anarchism we must turn\nto his followers, and especially to Kropotkin--like\nhim, a Russian aristocrat familiar with the prisons\nof Europe, and, like him, an Anarchist who, in spite\nof his internationalism, is imbued with a fiery hatred\nof the Germans.\nKropotkin has devoted much of his writing to\ntechnical questions of production. In ``Fields,\nFactories and Workshops'' and ``The Conquest of\nBread'' he has set himself to prove that, if production\nwere more scientific and better organized, a\ncomparatively small amount of quite agreeable work\nwould suffice to keep the whole population in comfort.\nEven assuming, as we probably must, that he\nsomewhat exaggerates what is possible with our\npresent scientific knowledge, it must nevertheless be\nconceded that his contentions contain a very large\nmeasure of truth. In attacking the subject of production\nhe has shown that he knows what is the really\ncrucial question. If civilization and progress are to\nbe compatible with equality, it is necessary that\nequality should not involve long hours of painful\ntoil for little more than the necessaries of life, since,\nwhere there is no leisure, art and science will die and\nall progress will become impossible. The objection\nwhich some feel to Socialism and Anarchism alike on\nthis ground cannot be upheld in view of the possible\nproductivity of labor.\nThe system at which Kropotkin aims, whether or\nnot it be possible, is certainly one which demands a\nvery great improvement in the methods of production\nabove what is common at present. He desires\nto abolish wholly the system of wages, not only, as\nmost Socialists do, in the sense that a man is to be\npaid rather for his willingness to work than for the\nactual work demanded of him, but in a more fundamental\nsense: there is to be no obligation to work,\nand all things are to be shared in equal proportions\namong the whole population. Kropotkin relies upon\nthe possibility of making work pleasant: he holds\nthat, in such a community as he foresees, practically\neveryone will prefer work to idleness, because work will\nnot involve overwork or slavery, or that excessive\nspecialization that industrialism has brought about,\nbut will be merely a pleasant activity for certain\nhours of the day, giving a man an outlet for his\nspontaneous constructive impulses. There is to be no\ncompulsion, no law, no government exercising force;\nthere will still be acts of the community, but these\nare to spring from universal consent, not from any\nenforced submission of even the smallest minority.\nWe shall examine in a later chapter how far such\nan ideal is realizable, but it cannot be denied that\nKropotkin presents it with extraordinary persuasiveness\nand charm.\nWe should be doing more than justice to Anarchism\nif we did not say something of its darker side,\nthe side which has brought it into conflict with the\npolice and made it a word of terror to ordinary citizens.\nIn its general doctrines there is nothing essentially\ninvolving violent methods or a virulent hatred\nof the rich, and many who adopt these general doctrines\nare personally gentle and temperamentally\naverse from violence. But the general tone of the\nAnarchist press and public is bitter to a degree that\nseems scarcely sane, and the appeal, especially in\nLatin countries, is rather to envy of the fortunate\nthan to pity for the unfortunate. A vivid and readable,\nthough not wholly reliable, account, from a\nhostile point of view, is given in a book called ``Le\nPeril Anarchiste,'' by Felix Dubois,[17] which\nincidentally reproduces a number of cartoons from anarchist\njournals. The revolt against law naturally leads,\nexcept in those who are controlled by a real passion\nfor humanity, to a relaxation of all the usually\naccepted moral rules, and to a bitter spirit of\nretaliatory cruelty out of which good can hardly come.\n[17] Paris, 1894.\nOne of the most curious features of popular\nAnarchism is its martyrology, aping Christian forms,\nwith the guillotine (in France) in place of the cross.\nMany who have suffered death at the hands of the\nauthorities on account of acts of violence were no\ndoubt genuine sufferers for their belief in a cause,\nbut others, equally honored, are more questionable.\nOne of the most curious examples of this outlet for\nthe repressed religious impulse is the cult of Ravachol,\nwho was guillotined in 1892 on account of\nvarious dynamite outrages. His past was dubious,\nbut he died defiantly; his last words were three lines\nfrom a well-known Anarchist song, the ``Chant du\nPere Duchesne'':--\nSi tu veux etre heureux,\nNom de Dieu!\nPends ton proprietaire.\nAs was natural, the leading Anarchists took no part\nin the canonization of his memory; nevertheless it\nproceeded, with the most amazing extravagances.\nIt would be wholly unfair to judge Anarchist\ndoctrine, or the views of its leading exponents, by\nsuch phenomena; but it remains a fact that Anarchism\nattracts to itself much that lies on the borderland\nof insanity and common crime.[18] This must be\nremembered in exculpation of the authorities and\nthe thoughtless public, who often confound in a common\ndetestation the parasites of the movement and\nthe truly heroic and high-minded men who have elaborated\nits theories and sacrificed comfort and success\nto their propagation.\n[18] The attitude of all the better Anarchists is that expressed\nby L. S. Bevington in the words: ``Of course we know that\namong those who call themselves Anarchists there are a minority\nof unbalanced enthusiasts who look upon every illegal and sensational\nact of violence as a matter for hysterical jubilation.\nVery useful to the police and the press, unsteady in intellect\nand of weak moral principle, they have repeatedly shown themselves\naccessible to venal considerations. They, and their violence,\nand their professed Anarchism are purchasable, and in\nthe last resort they are welcome and efficient partisans of the\nbourgeoisie in its remorseless war against the deliverers of the\npeople.'' His conclusion is a very wise one: ``Let us leave\nindiscriminate killing and injuring to the Government--to its\nStatesmen, its Stockbrokers, its Officers, and its Law.'' (``Anarchism\nand Violence,'' pp. 9-10.  Liberty Press, Chiswick, 1896.)\nThe terrorist campaign in which such men as\nRavachol were active practically came to an end in\n1894. After that time, under the influence of Pelloutier,\nthe better sort of Anarchists found a less\nharmful outlet by advocating Revolutionary Syndicalism\nin the Trade Unions and Bourses du Travail.[19]\n[19] See next Chapter.\nThe ECONOMIC organization of society, as conceived\nby Anarchist Communists, does not differ\ngreatly from that which is sought by Socialists.\nTheir difference from Socialists is in the matter of\ngovernment: they demand that government shall\nrequire the consent of all the governed, and not only\nof a majority. It is undeniable that the rule of a\nmajority may be almost as hostile to freedom as the\nrule of a minority: the divine right of majorities is a\ndogma as little possessed of absolute truth as any\nother. A strong democratic State may easily be led\ninto oppression of its best citizens, namely, those\nthose independence of mind would make them a force\nfor progress. Experience of democratic parliamentary\ngovernment has shown that it falls very far\nshort of what was expected of it by early Socialists,\nand the Anarchist revolt against it is not surprising.\nBut in the form of pure Anarchism, this revolt has\nremained weak and sporadic. It is Syndicalism, and\nthe movements to which Syndicalism has given rise,\nthat have popularized the revolt against parliamentary\ngovernment and purely political means of emancipating\nthe wage earner. But this movement must\nbe dealt with in a separate chapter.\nCHAPTER III\nTHE SYNDICALIST REVOLT\nSYNDICALISM arose in France as a revolt against\npolitical Socialism, and in order to understand it\nwe must trace in brief outline the positions attained\nby Socialist parties in the various countries.\nAfter a severe setback, caused by the Franco-\nPrussian war, Socialism gradually revived, and in all\nthe countries of Western Europe Socialist parties\nhave increased their numerical strength almost\ncontinuously during the last forty years; but, as is\ninvariably the case with a growing sect, the intensity\nof faith has diminished as the number of believers\nhas increased.\nIn Germany the Socialist party became the\nstrongest faction of the Reichstag, and, in spite of\ndifferences of opinion among its members, it preserved\nits formal unity with that instinct for military\ndiscipline which characterizes the German nation.\nIn the Reichstag election of 1912 it polled a third\nof the total number of votes cast, and returned 110\nmembers out of a total of 397. After the death of\nBebel, the Revisionists, who received their first\nimpulse from Bernstein, overcame the more strict\nMarxians, and the party became in effect merely one\nof advanced Radicalism. It is too soon to guess what\nwill be the effect of the split between Majority and\nMinority Socialists which has occurred during the\nwar. There is in Germany hardly a trace of Syndicalism;\nits characteristic doctrine, the preference of\nindustrial to political action, has found scarcely\nany support.\nIn England Marx has never had many followers.\nSocialism there has been inspired in the main by the\nFabians (founded in 1883), who threw over the\nadvocacy of revolution, the Marxian doctrine of\nvalue, and the class-war. What remained was State\nSocialism and a doctrine of ``permeation.'' Civil\nservants were to be permeated with the realization\nthat Socialism would enormously increase their\npower. Trade Unions were to be permeated with the\nbelief that the day for purely industrial action was\npast, and that they must look to government (inspired\nsecretly by sympathetic civil servants) to bring\nabout, bit by bit, such parts of the Socialist program\nas were not likely to rouse much hostility in the rich.\nThe Independent Labor Party (formed in 1893) was\nlargely inspired at first by the ideas of the Fabians,\nthough retaining to the present day, and especially\nsince the outbreak of the war, much more of the\noriginal Socialist ardor. It aimed always at\nco-operation with the industrial organizations of\nwage-earners, and, chiefly through its efforts, the\nLabor Party[20] was formed in 1900 out of a\ncombination of the Trade Unions and the political\nSocialists. To this party, since 1909, all the important\nUnions have belonged, but in spite of the fact\nthat its strength is derived from Trade Unions, it\nhas stood always for political rather than industrial\naction. Its Socialism has been of a theoretical and\nacademic order, and in practice, until the outbreak\nof war, the Labor members in Parliament (of whom\n30 were elected in 1906 and 42 in December, 1910)\nmight be reckoned almost as a part of the Liberal\nParty.\n[20] Of which the Independent Labor Party is only a section.\nFrance, unlike England and Germany, was not\ncontent merely to repeat the old shibboleths with\ncontinually diminishing conviction. In France[21] a new\nmovement, originally known as Revolutionary\nSyndicalism--and afterward simply as Syndicalism--\nkept alive the vigor of the original impulse, and\nremained true to the spirit of the older Socialists,\nwhile departing from the letter. Syndicalism, unlike\nSocialism and Anarchism, began from an existing\norganization and developed the ideas appropriate\nto it, whereas Socialism and Anarchism began with\nthe ideas and only afterward developed the organizations\nwhich were their vehicle. In order to understand\nSyndicalism, we have first to describe Trade\nUnion organization in France, and its political\nenvironment. The ideas of Syndicalism will then\nappear as the natural outcome of the political and\neconomic situation. Hardly any of these ideas are\nnew; almost all are derived from the Bakunist section\nof the old International.[21] The old International\nhad considerable success in France before the Franco-\nPrussian War; indeed, in 1869, it is estimated to\nhave had a French membership of a quarter of a million.\nWhat is practically the Syndicalist program\nwas advocated by a French delegate to the Congress\nof the International at Bale in that same year.[22]\n[20] And also in Italy. A good, short account of the Italian\nmovement is given by A. Lanzillo, ``Le Mouvement Ouvrier en\nItalie,'' Bibliotheque du Mouvement Proletarien. See also Paul\nLouis, ``Le Syndicalisme Europeen,'' chap. vi. On the other\nhand Cole (``World of Labour,'' chap. vi) considers the strength\nof genuine Syndicalism in Italy to be small.\n[21] This is often recognized by Syndicalists themselves. See,\ne.g., an article on ``The Old International'' in the Syndicalist\nof February, 1913, which, after giving an account of the struggle\nbetween Marx and Bakunin from the standpoint of a sympathizer\nwith the latter, says: ``Bakounin's ideas are now more alive\nthan ever.''\n[22] See pp. 42-43, and 160 of ``Syndicalism in France,'' Louis\nLevine, Ph.D. (Columbia University Studies in Political Science,\nvol. xlvi, No. 3.) This is a very objective and reliable account\nof the origin and progress of French Syndicalism. An admirable\nshort discussion of its ideas and its present position will be\nfound in Cole's ``World of Labour'' (G. Bell & Sons), especially\nchapters iii, iv, and xi.\nThe war of 1870 put an end for the time being\nto the Socialist Movement in France. Its revival\nwas begun by Jules Guesde in 1877. Unlike the Ger-\nman Socialists, the French have been split into many\ndifferent factions. In the early eighties there was a\nsplit between the Parliamentary Socialists and the\nCommunist Anarchists. The latter thought that the\nfirst act of the Social Revolution should be the\ndestruction of the State, and would therefore have\nnothing to do with Parliamentary politics. The\nAnarchists, from 1883 onward, had success in Paris\nand the South. The Socialists contended that the\nState will disappear after the Socialist society has\nbeen firmly established. In 1882 the Socialists split\nbetween the followers of Guesde, who claimed to represent\nthe revolutionary and scientific Socialism of\nMarx, and the followers of Paul Brousse, who were\nmore opportunist and were also called possibilists\nand cared little for the theories of Marx. In 1890\nthere was a secession from the Broussists, who followed\nAllemane and absorbed the more revolutionary\nelements of the party and became leading spirits in\nsome of the strongest syndicates. Another group\nwas the Independent Socialists, among whom were\nJaures, Millerand and Viviani.[23]\n[23] See Levine, op. cit., chap. ii.\nThe disputes between the various sections of\nSocialists caused difficulties in the Trade Unions and\nhelped to bring about the resolution to keep politics\nout of the Unions. From this to Syndicalism was\nan easy step.\nSince the year 1905, as the result of a union\nbetween the Parti Socialiste de France (Part; Ouvrier\nSocialiste Revolutionnaire Francais led by\nGuesde) and the Parti Socialiste Francais (Jaures),\nthere have been only two groups of Socialists, the\nUnited Socialist Party and the Independents, who\nare intellectuals or not willing to be tied to a party.\nAt the General Election of 1914 the former secured\n102 members and the latter 30, out of a total of 590.\nTendencies toward a rapprochement between the\nvarious groups were seriously interfered with by an\nevent which had considerable importance for the\nwhole development of advanced political ideas in\nFrance, namely, the acceptance of office in the Waldeck-\nRousseau Ministry by the Socialist Millerand\nin 1899. Millerand, as was to be expected, soon\nceased to be a Socialist, and the opponents of political\naction pointed to his development as showing\nthe vanity of political triumphs. Very many French\npoliticians who have risen to power have begun their\npolitical career as Socialists, and have ended it not\ninfrequently by employing the army to oppress\nstrikers. Millerand's action was the most notable\nand dramatic among a number of others of a similar\nkind. Their cumulative effect has been to produce a\ncertain cynicism in regard to politics among the more\nclass-conscious of French wage-earners, and this\nstate of mind greatly assisted the spread of Syndicalism.\nSyndicalism stands essentially for the point of\nview of the producer as opposed to that of the consumer;\nit is concerned with reforming actual work,\nand the organization of industry, not MERELY with\nsecuring greater rewards for work. From this point\nof view its vigor and its distinctive character are\nderived. It aims at substituting industrial for political\naction, and at using Trade Union organization\nfor purposes for which orthodox Socialism would\nlook to Parliament. ``Syndicalism'' was originally\nonly the French name for Trade Unionism, but the\nTrade Unionists of France became divided into two\nsections, the Reformist and the Revolutionary, of\nwhom the latter only professed the ideas which we\nnow associate with the term ``Syndicalism.'' It is\nquite impossible to guess how far either the organization\nor the ideas of the Syndicalists will remain intact\nat the end of the war, and everything that we shall say\nis to be taken as applying only to the years before\nthe war. It may be that French Syndicalism as a\ndistinctive movement will be dead, but even in that\ncase it will not have lost its importance, since it has\ngiven a new impulse and direction to the more vigorous\npart of the labor movement in all civilized countries,\nwith the possible exception of Germany.\nThe organization upon which Syndicalism de-\npended was the Confederation Generale du Travail,\ncommonly known as the C. G. T., which was founded\nin 1895, but only achieved its final form in 1902. It\nhas never been numerically very powerful, but has\nderived its influence from the fact that in moments\nof crisis many who were not members were willing\nto follow its guidance. Its membership in the year\nbefore the war is estimated by Mr. Cole at somewhat\nmore than half a million. Trade Unions (Syndicats)\nwere legalized by Waldeck-Rousseau in 1884,\nand the C. G. T., on its inauguration in 1895, was\nformed by the Federation of 700 Syndicats. Alongside\nof this organization there existed another, the\nFederation des Bourses du Travail, formed in 1893.\nA Bourse du Travail is a local organization, not of\nany one trade, but of local labor in general, intended\nto serve as a Labor Exchange and to perform such\nfunctions for labor as Chambers of Commerce perform\nfor the employer.[24] A Syndicat is in general\na local organization of a single industry, and is thus\na smaller unit than the Bourse du Travail.[25] Under\nthe able leadership of Pelloutier, the Federation des\nBourses prospered more than the C. G. T., and at\nlast, in 1902, coalesced with it. The result was an\norganization in which the local Syndicat was fed-\nerated twice over, once with the other Syndicat in\nits locality, forming together the local Bourse du\nTravail, and again with the Syndicats in the same\nindustry in other places. ``It was the purpose of the\nnew organization to secure twice over the membership\nof every syndicat, to get it to join both its local\nBourse du Travail and the Federation of its industry.\nThe Statutes of the C. G. T. (I. 3) put this point\nplainly: `No Syndicat will be able to form a part of\nthe C. G. T. if it is not federated nationally and an\nadherent of a Bourse du Travail or a local or departmental\nUnion of Syndicats grouping different associations.'\nThus, M. Lagardelle explains, the two sections\nwill correct each other's point of view: national\nfederation of industries will prevent parochialism\n(localisme), and local organization will check the\ncorporate or `Trade Union' spirit. The workers will\nlearn at once the solidarity of all workers in a locality\nand that of all workers in a trade, and, in learning\nthis, they will learn at the same time the complete\nsolidarity of the whole working-class.''[26]\n[24] Cole, ib., p. 65.\n[25] ``Syndicat in France still means a local union--there are\nat the present day only four national syndicats'' (ib., p. 66).\n[26] Cole, ib. p. 69.\nThis organization was largely the work of Pellouties,\nwho was Secretary of the Federation des Bourses\nfrom 1894 until his death in 1901. He was an Anarchist\nCommunist and impressed his ideas upon the\nFederation and thence posthumously on the C. G. T.\nafter its combination with the Federation des\nBourses. He even carried his principles into the\ngovernment of the Federation; the Committee had\nno chairman and votes very rarely took place. He\nstated that ``the task of the revolution is to free\nmankind, not only from all authority, but also from\nevery institution which has not for its essential purpose\nthe development of production.''\nThe C. G. T. allows much autonomy to each unit\nin the organization. Each Syndicat counts for one,\nwhether it be large or small. There are not the\nfriendly society activities which form so large a part\nof the work of English Unions. It gives no orders,\nbut is purely advisory. It does not allow politics\nto be introduced into the Unions. This decision was\noriginally based upon the fact that the divisions\namong Socialists disrupted the Unions, but it is now\nreinforced in the minds of an important section by\nthe general Anarchist dislike of politics. The C. G.\nT. is essentially a fighting organization; in strikes, it\nis the nucleus to which the other workers rally.\nThere is a Reformist section in the C. G. T., but\nit is practically always in a minority, and the C. G.\nT. is, to all intents and purposes, the organ of\nrevolutionary Syndicalism, which is simply the creed\nof its leaders.\nThe essential doctrine of Syndicalism is the class-\nwar, to be conducted by industrial rather than politi-\ncal methods. The chief industrial methods advocated\nare the strike, the boycott, the label and sabotage.\nThe boycott, in various forms, and the label,\nshowing that the work has been done under trade-\nunion conditions, have played a considerable part\nin American labor struggles.\nSabotage is the practice of doing bad work, or\nspoiling machinery or work which has already been\ndone, as a method of dealing with employers in a\ndispute when a strike appears for some reason\nundesirable or impossible. It has many forms, some\nclearly innocent, some open to grave objections. One\nform of sabotage which has been adopted by shop\nassistants is to tell customers the truth about the\narticles they are buying; this form, however it may\ndamage the shopkeeper's business, is not easy to\nobject to on moral grounds. A form which has been\nadopted on railways, particularly in Italian strikes,\nis that of obeying all rules literally and exactly, in\nsuch a way as to make the running of trains practically\nimpossible. Another form is to do all the\nwork with minute care, so that in the end it is better\ndone, but the output is small. From these innocent\nforms there is a continual progression, until we come\nto such acts as all ordinary morality would consider\ncriminal; for example, causing railway accidents.\nAdvocates of sabotage justify it as part of\nwar, but in its more violent forms (in which it is\nseldom defended) it is cruel and probably inexpedient,\nwhile even in its milder forms it must tend to encourage\nslovenly habits of work, which might easily persist\nunder the new regime that the Syndicalists wish\nto introduce. At the same time, when capitalists\nexpress a moral horror of this method, it is worth\nwhile to observe that they themselves are the first\nto practice it when the occasion seems to them appropriate.\nIf report speaks truly, an example of this\non a very large scale has been seen during the Russian\nRevolution.\nBy far the most important of the Syndicalist\nmethods is the strike. Ordinary strikes, for specific\nobjects, are regarded as rehearsals, as a means of\nperfecting organization and promoting enthusiasm,\nbut even when they are victorious so far as concerns\nthe specific point in dispute, they are not regarded\nby Syndicalists as affording any ground for industrial\npeace. Syndicalists aim at using the strike,\nnot to secure such improvements of detail as employers\nmay grant, but to destroy the whole system of\nemployer and employed and win the complete emancipation\nof the worker. For this purpose what is\nwanted is the General Strike, the complete cessation\nof work by a sufficient proportion of the wage-earners\nto secure the paralysis of capitalism. Sorel, who\nrepresents Syndicalism too much in the minds of the\nreading public, suggests that the General Strike is to\nbe regarded as a myth, like the Second Coming in\nChristian doctrine. But this view by no means suits\nthe active Syndicalists. If they were brought to\nbelieve that the General Strike is a mere myth, their\nenergy would flag, and their whole outlook would\nbecome disillusioned. It is the actual, vivid belief\nin its possibility which inspires them. They are much\ncriticised for this belief by the political Socialists\nwho consider that the battle is to be won by obtaining\na Parliamentary majority. But Syndicalists have\ntoo little faith in the honesty of politicians to place\nany reliance on such a method or to believe in the\nvalue of any revolution which leaves the power of the\nState intact.\nSyndicalist aims are somewhat less definite than\nSyndicalist methods. The intellectuals who endeavor\nto interpret them--not always very faithfully--\nrepresent them as a party of movement and change,\nfollowing a Bergsonian elan vital, without needing\nany very clear prevision of the goal to which it is to\ntake them. Nevertheless, the negative part, at any\nrate, of their objects is sufficiently clear.\nThey wish to destroy the State, which they\nregard as a capitalist institution, designed essentially\nto terrorize the workers. They refuse to\nbelieve that it would be any better under State Socialism.\nThey desire to see each industry self-governing,\nbut as to the means of adjusting the relations between\ndifferent industries, they are not very clear. They\nare anti-militarist because they are anti-State, and\nbecause French troops have often been employed\nagainst them in strikes; also because they are\ninternationalists, who believe that the sole interest of the\nworking man everywhere is to free himself from the\ntyranny of the capitalist. Their outlook on life is\nthe very reverse of pacifist, but they oppose wars\nbetween States on the ground that these are not\nfought for objects that in any way concern the\nworkers. Their anti-militarism, more than anything\nelse, brought them into conflict with the authorities\nin the years preceding the war. But, as was to be\nexpected, it did not survive the actual invasion of\nFrance.\nThe doctrines of Syndicalism may be illustrated\nby an article introducing it to English readers in\nthe first number of ``The Syndicalist Railwayman,''\nSeptember, 1911, from which the following is quoted:--\n``All Syndicalism, Collectivism, Anarchism aims at\nabolishing the present economic status and existing private\nownership of most things; but while Collectivism\nwould substitute ownership by everybody, and Anarchism\nownership by nobody, Syndicalism aims at ownership by\nOrganized Labor. It is thus a purely Trade Union\nreading of the economic doctrine and the class war\npreached by Socialism. It vehemently repudiates Parliamentary\naction on which Collectivism relies; and it is,\nin this respect, much more closely allied to Anarchism,\nfrom which, indeed, it differs in practice only in being\nmore limited in range of action.'' (Times, Aug. 25, 1911).\nIn truth, so thin is the partition between Syndicalism\nand Anarchism that the newer and less familiar ``ism''\nhas been shrewdly defined as ``Organized Anarchy.'' It\nhas been created by the Trade Unions of France; but it\nis obviously an international plant, whose roots have\nalready found the soil of Britain most congenial to its\ngrowth and fructification.\nCollectivist or Marxian Socialism would have us believe\nthat it is distinctly a LABOR Movement; but it is\nnot so. Neither is Anarchism. The one is substantially\nbourgeois; the other aristocratic, plus an abundant output\nof book-learning, in either case. Syndicalism, on the contrary,\nis indubitably laborist in origin and aim, owing\nnext to nothing to the ``Classes,'' and, indeed,, resolute to\nuproot them. The Times (Oct. 13, 1910), which almost\nsingle-handed in the British Press has kept creditably\nabreast of Continental Syndicalism, thus clearly set forth\nthe significance of the General Strike:\n``To understand what it means, we must remember\nthat there is in France a powerful Labor Organization\nwhich has for its open and avowed object a Revolution,\nin which not only the present order of Society, but the\nState itself, is to be swept away. This movement is called\nSyndicalism. It is not Socialism, but, on the contrary,\nradically opposed to Socialism, because the Syndicalists\nhold that the State is the great enemy and that the\nSocialists' ideal of State or Collectivist Ownership would\nmake the lot of the Workers much worse than it is now\nunder private employers. The means by which they hope\nto attain their end is the General Strike, an idea which\nwas invented by a French workman about twenty years\nago,[27] and was adopted by the French Labor Congress in\n1894, after a furious battle with the Socialists, in which\nthe latter were worsted. Since then the General Strike\nhas been the avowed policy of the Syndicalists, whose\norganization is the Confederation Generale du Travail.''\n[27] In fact the General Strike was invented by a Londoner\nWilliam Benbow, an Owenite, in 1831.\nOr, to put it otherwise, the intelligent French worker\nhas awakened, as he believes, to the fact that Society\n(Societas) and the State (Civitas) connote two separable\nspheres of human activity, between which there is no\nconnection, necessary or desirable. Without the one, man,\nbeing a gregarious animal, cannot subsist: while without\nthe other he would simply be in clover. The ``statesman''\nwhom office does not render positively nefarious\nis at best an expensive superfluity.\nSyndicalists have had many violent encounters\nwith the forces of government. In 1907 and 1908,\nprotesting against bloodshed which had occurred in\nthe suppression of strikes, the Committee of the C.\nG. T. issued manifestoes speaking of the Government\nas ``a Government of assassins'' and alluding\nto the Prime Minister as ``Clemenceau the murderer.''\nSimilar events in the strike at Villeneuve St. Georges\nin 1908 led to the arrest of all the leading members\nof the Committee. In the railway strike of October,\n1910, Monsieur Briand arrested the Strike Committee,\nmobilized the railway men and sent soldiers\nto replace strikers. As a result of these vigorous\nmeasures the strike was completely defeated, and\nafter this the chief energy of the C. G. T. was directed\nagainst militarism and nationalism.\nThe attitude of Anarchism to the Syndicalist\nmovement is sympathetic, with the reservation that\nsuch methods as the General Strike are not to be\nregarded as substitutes for the violent revolution\nwhich most Anarchists consider necessary. Their\nattitude in this matter was defined at the International\nAnarchist Congress held in Amsterdam in\nAugust, 1907. This Congress recommended ``comrades\nof all countries to actively participate in autonomous\nmovements of the working class, and to\ndevelop in Syndicalist organizations the ideas of\nrevolt, individual initiative and solidarity, which are\nthe essence of Anarchism.'' Comrades were to\n``propagate and support only those forms and manifestations\nof direct action which carry, in themselves,\na revolutionary character and lead to the\ntransformation of society.'' It was resolved that\n``the Anarchists think that the destruction of the\ncapitalist and authoritary society can only be realized\nby armed insurrection and violent expropriation,\nand that the use of the more or less General Strike\nand the Syndicalist movement must not make us\nforget the more direct means of struggle against\nthe military force of government.''\nSyndicalists might retort that when the movement\nis strong enough to win by armed insurrection\nit will be abundantly strong enough to win by the\nGeneral Strike. In Labor movements generally, success\nthrough violence can hardly be expected except\nin circumstances where success without violence is\nattainable. This argument alone, even if there were\nno other, would be a very powerful reason against\nthe methods advocated by the Anarchist Congress.\nSyndicalism stands for what is known as industrial\nunionism as opposed to craft unionism. In this\nrespect, as also in the preference of industrial to\npolitical methods, it is part of a movement which\nhas spread far beyond France. The distinction\nbetween industrial and craft unionism is much dwelt\non by Mr. Cole. Craft unionism ``unites in a single\nassociation those workers who are engaged on a single\nindustrial process, or on processes so nearly akin\nthat any one can do another's work.'' But ``organization\nmay follow the lines, not of the work done,\nbut of the actual structure of industry. All workers\nworking at producing a particular kind of commodity\nmay be organized in a single Union. . . .\nThe basis of organization would be neither the craft\nto which a man belonged nor the employer under\nwhom he worked, but the service on which he was\nengaged. This is Industrial Unionism properly\nso called.[28]\n[28] ``World of Labour,'' pp. 212, 213.\nIndustrial unionism is a product of America,\nand from America it has to some extent spread to\nGreat Britain. It is the natural form of fighting\norganization when the union is regarded as the means\nof carrying on the class war with a view, not to\nobtaining this or that minor amelioration, but to a\nradical revolution in the economic system. This is\nthe point of view adopted by the ``Industrial Workers\nof the World,'' commonly known as the I. W. W.\nThis organization more or less corresponds in America\nto what the C. G. T. was in France before the\nwar. The differences between the two are those due\nto the different economic circumstances of the two\ncountries, but their spirit is closely analogous. The\nI. W. W. is not united as to the ultimate form which\nit wishes society to take. There are Socialists,\nAnarchists and Syndicalists among its members. But it\nis clear on the immediate practical issue, that the\nclass war is the fundamental reality in the present\nrelations of labor and capital, and that it is by\nindustrial action, especially by the strike, that\nemancipation must be sought. The I. W. W., like the\nC. G. T., is not nearly so strong numerically as it is\nsupposed to be by those who fear it. Its influence\nis based, not upon its numbers, but upon its power\nof enlisting the sympathies of the workers in moments\nof crisis.\nThe labor movement in America has been characterized\non both sides by very great violence. Indeed,\nthe Secretary of the C. G. T., Monsieur Jouhaux,\nrecognizes that the C. G. T. is mild in comparison\nwith the I. W. W. ``The I. W. W.,'' he says,\n``preach a policy of militant action, very necessary\nin parts of America, which would not do in France.''[29]\nA very interesting account of it, from the point of\nview of an author who is neither wholly on the side\nof labor nor wholly on the side of the capitalist, but\ndisinterestedly anxious to find some solution of the\nsocial question short of violence and revolution, is\nthe work of Mr. John Graham Brooks, called ``American\nSyndicalism: the I. W. W.'' (Macmillan, 1913).\nAmerican labor conditions are very different from\nthose of Europe. In the first place, the power of the\ntrusts is enormous; the concentration of capital has\nin this respect proceeded more nearly on Marxian\nlines in America than anywhere else. In the second\nplace, the great influx of foreign labor makes the\nwhole problem quite different from any that arises\nin Europe. The older skilled workers, largely American\nborn, have long been organized in the American\nFederation of Labor under Mr. Gompers. These\nrepresent an aristocracy of labor. They tend to\nwork with the employers against the great mass of\nunskilled immigrants, and they cannot be regarded as\nforming part of anything that could be truly called\na labor movement. ``There are,'' says Mr. Cole,\n``now in America two working classes, with different\nstandards of life, and both are at present almost\nimpotent in the face of the employers. Nor is it possible\nfor these two classes to unite or to put forward\nany demands. . . . The American Federation\nof Labor and the Industrial Workers of the\nWorld represent two different principles of\ncombination; but they also represent two different\nclasses of labor.''[30] The I. W. W. stands for industrial\nunionism, whereas the American Federation of\nLabor stands for craft unionism. The I. W. W. were\nformed in 1905 by a union of organizations, chief\namong which was the Western Federation of Miners,\nwhich dated from 1892. They suffered a split by the\nloss of the followers of Deleon, who was the leader of\nthe ``Socialist Labor Party'' and advocated a\n``Don't vote'' policy, while reprobating violent\nmethods. The headquarters of the party which he\nformed are at Detroit, and those of the main body\nare at Chicago. The I. W. W., though it has a less\ndefinite philosophy than French Syndicalism, is quite\nequally determined to destroy the capitalist system.\nAs its secretary has said: ``There is but one bargain\nthe I. W. W. will make with the employing class--\ncomplete surrender of all control of industry to the\norganized workers.''[31] Mr. Haywood, of the Western\nFederation of Miners, is an out-and-out follower\nof Marx so far as concerns the class war and the\ndoctrine of surplus value. But, like all who are in\nthis movement, he attaches more importance to industrial\nas against political action than do the European\nfollowers of Marx. This is no doubt partly\nexplicable by the special circumstances of America,\nwhere the recent immigrants are apt to be voteless.\nThe fourth convention of the I. W. W. revised a\npreamble giving the general principles underlying\nits action. ``The working class and the employing\nclass,'' they say, ``have nothing in common. There\ncan be no peace so long as hunger and want are\nfound among millions of the working people and the\nfew, who make up the employing class, have all the\ngood things of life. Between these two classes, a\nstruggle must go on until the workers of the world\norganize as a class, take possession of the earth and\nthe machinery of production, and abolish the wage\nsystem. . . . Instead of the conservative motto,\n`A fair day's wages for a fair day's work,' we must\ninscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword,\n`Abolition of the wage system.' ''[32]\n[29] Quoted in Cole, ib. p. 128.\n[30] Ib., p. 135.\n[31] Brooks, op. cit., p. 79.\n[32] Brooks, op. cit., pp. 86-87.\nNumerous strikes have been conducted or encouraged\nby the I. W. W. and the Western Federation\nof Miners. These strikes illustrate the class-war\nin a more bitter and extreme form than is to be found\nin any other part of the world. Both sides are always\nready to resort to violence. The employers have\narmies of their own and are able to call upon the\nMilitia and even, in a crisis, upon the United States\nArmy. What French Syndicalists say about the\nState as a capitalist institution is peculiarly true in\nAmerica. In consequence of the scandals thus arising,\nthe Federal Government appointed a Commission\non Industrial Relations, whose Report, issued in 1915,\nreveals a state of affairs such as it would be difficult\nto imagine in Great Britain. The report states that\n``the greatest disorders and most of the outbreaks\nof violence in connection with industrial `disputes\narise from the violation of what are considered\nto be fundamental rights, and from the perversion\nor subversion of governmental institutions''\n(p. 146). It mentions, among such perversions,\nthe subservience of the judiciary to the mili-\ntary authorities,[33] the fact that during a labor\ndispute the life and liberty of every man within\nthe State would seem to be at the mercy of the\nGovernor (p. 72), and the use of State troops\nin policing strikes (p. 298). At Ludlow (Colorado)\nin 1914 (April 20) a battle of the militia and the\nminers took place, in which, as the result of the fire\nof the militia, a number of women and children were\nburned to death.[34] Many other instances of pitched\nbattles could be given, but enough has been said to\nshow the peculiar character of labor disputes in the\nUnited States. It may, I fear, be presumed that this\ncharacter will remain so long as a very large\nproportion of labor consists of recent immigrants.\nWhen these difficulties pass away, as they must\nsooner or later, labor will more and more find its\nplace in the community, and will tend to feel and\ninspire less of the bitter hostility which renders the\nmore extreme forms of class war possible. When\nthat time comes, the labor movement in America will\nprobably begin to take on forms similar to those of\nEurope.\n[33] Although uniformly held that the writ of habeas corpus\ncan only be suspended by the legislature, in these labor disturbances\nthe executive has in fact suspended or disregarded the\nwrit. . . . In cases arising from labor agitations, the judiciary\nhas uniformly upheld the power exercised by the military,\nand in no case has there been any protest against the use of\nsuch power or any attempt to curtail it, except in Montana,\nwhere the conviction of a civilian by military commission was\nannulled'' (``Final Report of the Commission on Industrial\nRelations'' (1915) appointed by the United States Congress,''\np. 58).\n[34] Literary Digest, May 2 and May 16, 1914.\nMeanwhile, though the forms are different, the\naims are very similar, and industrial unionism,\nspreading from America, has had a considerable\ninfluence in Great Britain--an influence naturally\nreinforced by that of French Syndicalism. It is\nclear, I think, that the adoption of industrial rather\nthan craft unionism is absolutely necessary if Trade\nUnionism is to succeed in playing that part in altering\nthe economic structure of society which its advocates\nclaim for it rather than for the political\nparties. Industrial unionism organizes men, as craft\nunionism does not, in accordance with the enemy\nwhom they have to fight. English unionism is still\nvery far removed from the industrial form, though\ncertain industries, especially the railway men, have\ngone very far in this direction, and it is notable that\nthe railway men are peculiarly sympathetic to Syndicalism\nand industrial unionism.\nPure Syndicalism, however, is not very likely to\nachieve wide popularity in Great Britain. Its spirit\nis too revolutionary and anarchistic for our temperament.\nIt is in the modified form of Guild Socialism\nthat the ideas derived from the C. G. T. and the I. W.\nW. are tending to bear fruit.[35] This movement is as\nyet in its infancy and has no great hold upon the rank\nand file, but it is being ably advocated by a group\nof young men, and is rapidly gaining ground among\nthose who will form Labor opinion in years to come.\nThe power of the State has been so much increased\nduring the war that those who naturally dislike\nthings as they are, find it more and more difficult to\nbelieve that State omnipotence can be the road to the\nmillennium. Guild Socialists aim at autonomy in\nindustry, with consequent curtailment, but not abolition,\nof the power of the State. The system which\nthey advocate is, I believe, the best hitherto proposed,\nand the one most likely to secure liberty without\nthe constant appeals to violence which are to be\nfeared under a purely Anarchist regime.\n[35] The ideas of Guild Socialism were first set forth in\n``National Guilds,'' edited by A. R. Orage (Bell & Sons, 1914),\nand in Cole's ``World of Labour'' (Bell & Sons), first published\nin 1913. Cole's ``Self-Government in Industry'' (Bell &\nSons, 1917) and Rickett & Bechhofer's ``The Meaning of\nNational Guilds'' (Palmer & Hayward, 1918) should also be\nread, as well as various pamphlets published by the National\nGuilds League. The attitude of the Syndicalists to Guild\nSocialism is far from sympathetic. An article in ``The\nSyndicalist'' for February, 1914, speaks of it in the following\nterms: a Middle-class of the middle-class, with all the shortcomings\n(we had almost said `stupidities') of the middle-\nclasses writ large across it, `Guild Socialism' stands forth\nas the latest lucubration of the middle-class mind. It is a\n`cool steal' of the leading ideas of Syndicalism and a deliberate\nperversion of them. . . . We do protest against the `State'\nidea . . . in Guild Socialism. Middle-class people, even\nwhen they become Socialists, cannot get rid of the idea that the\nworking-class is their `inferior'; that the workers need to be\n`educated,' drilled, disciplined, and generally nursed for a very\nlong time before they will be able to walk by themselves. The\nvery reverse is actually the truth. . . . It is just the plain\ntruth when we say that the ordinary wage-worker, of average\nintelligence, is better capable of taking care of himself than the\nhalf-educated middle-class man who wants to advise him. He\nknows how to make the wheels of the world go round.''\nThe first pamphlet of the ``National Guilds\nLeague'' sets forth their main principles. In industry\neach factory is to be free to control its own\nmethods of production by means of elected managers.\nThe different factories in a given industry are to be\nfederated into a National Guild which will deal with\nmarketing and the general interests of the industry\nas a whole. ``The State would own the means of\nproduction as trustee for the community; the Guilds\nwould manage them, also as trustees for the community,\nand would pay to the State a single tax or\nrent. Any Guild that chose to set its own interests\nabove those of the community would be violating\nits trust, and would have to bow to the judgment of\na tribunal equally representing the whole body of\nproducers and the whole body of consumers. This\nJoint Committee would be the ultimate sovereign\nbody, the ultimate appeal court of industry. It\nwould fix not only Guild taxation, but also standard\nprices, and both taxation and prices would be periodically\nreadjusted by it.'' Each Guild will be\nentirely free to apportion what it receives among its\nmembers as it chooses, its members being all those who\nwork in the industry which it covers. ``The distribution\nof this collective Guild income among the\nmembers seems to be a matter for each Guild to decide\nfor itself. Whether the Guilds would, sooner or later,\nadopt the principle of equal payment for every member,\nis open to discussion.'' Guild Socialism accepts\nfrom Syndicalism the view that liberty is not to be\nsecured by making the State the employer: ``The\nState and the Municipality as employers have turned\nout not to differ essentially from the private capitalist.''\nGuild Socialists regard the State as consisting\nof the community in their capacity as consumers,\nwhile the Guilds will represent them in their capacity\nas producers; thus Parliament and the Guild Congress\nwill be two co-equal powers representing consumers\nand producers respectively. Above both will\nbe the joint Committee of Parliament and the Guild\nCongress for deciding matters involving the interests\nof consumers and producers alike. The view of the\nGuild Socialists is that State Socialism takes account\nof men only as consumers, while Syndicalism takes\naccount of them only as producers. ``The problem,''\nsay the Guild Socialists, ``is to reconcile the two\npoints of view. That is what advocates of National\nGuilds set out to do. The Syndicalist has claimed\neverything for the industrial organizations of producers,\nthe Collectivist everything for the territorial\nor political organizations of consumers. Both are\nopen to the same criticism; you cannot reconcile two\npoints of view merely by denying one of them.''[36]\nBut although Guild Socialism represents an attempt\nat readjustment between two equally legitimate points\nof view, its impulse and force are derived from\nwhat it has taken over from Syndicalism. Like Syndicalism;\nit desires not primarily to make work better\npaid, but to secure this result along with others by\nmaking it in itself more interesting and more democratic\nin organization.\n[36] The above quotations are all from the first pamphlet of the\nNational Guilds League, ``National Guilds, an Appeal to Trade\nUnionists.''\nCapitalism has made of work a purely commercial\nactivity, a soulless and a joyless thing. But substitute\nthe national service of the Guilds for the profiteering of\nthe few; substitute responsible labor for a saleable commodity;\nsubstitute self-government and decentralization\nfor the bureaucracy and demoralizing hugeness of the\nmodern State and the modern joint stock company; and\nthen it may be just once more to speak of a ``joy in\nlabor,'' and once more to hope that men may be proud\nof quality and not only of quantity in their work. There\nis a cant of the Middle Ages, and a cant of ``joy in\nlabor,'' but it were better, perhaps, to risk that cant\nthan to reconcile ourselves forever to the philosophy of\nCapitalism and of Collectivism, which declares that work\nis a necessary evil never to be made pleasant, and that\nthe workers' only hope is a leisure which shall be longer,\nricher, and well adorned with municipal amenities.[37]\n[37] ``The Guild Idea,'' No. 2 of the Pamphlets of the National\nGuilds League, p. 17.\nWhatever may be thought of the practicability\nof Syndicalism, there is no doubt that the ideas which\nit has put into the world have done a great deal\nto revive the labor movement and to recall it to certain\nthings of fundamental importance which it had\nbeen in danger of forgetting. Syndicalists consider\nman as producer rather than consumer. They are\nmore concerned to procure freedom in work than to\nincrease material well-being. They have revived the\nquest for liberty, which was growing somewhat\ndimmed under the regime of Parliamentary Socialism,\nand they have reminded men that what our modern\nsociety needs is not a little tinkering here and there,\nnor the kind of minor readjustments to which the\nexisting holders of power may readily consent, but\na fundamental reconstruction, a sweeping away of\nall the sources of oppression, a liberation of men's\nconstructive energies, and a wholly new way of\nconceiving and regulating production and economic\nrelations. This merit is so great that, in view of it,\nall minor defects become insignificant, and this merit\nSyndicalism will continue to possess even if, as a\ndefinite movement, it should be found to have passed\naway with the war.\nPART II\nPROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE\nCHAPTER IV\nWORK AND PAY\nTHE man who seeks to create a better order of\nsociety has two resistances to contend with: one that\nof Nature, the other that of his fellow-men. Broadly\nspeaking, it is science that deals with the resistance\nof Nature, while politics and social organization are\nthe methods of overcoming the resistance of men.\nThe ultimate fact in economics is that Nature only\nyields commodities as the result of labor. The necessity\nof SOME labor for the satisfaction of our wants\nis not imposed by political systems or by the exploitation\nof the working classes; it is due to physical\nlaws, which the reformer, like everyone else, must\nadmit and study. Before any optimistic economic\nproject can be accepted as feasible, we must examine\nwhether the physical conditions of production impose\nan unalterable veto, or whether they are capable of\nbeing sufficiently modified by science and organization.\nTwo connected doctrines must be considered\nin examining this question: First, Malthus' doctrine\nof population; and second, the vaguer, but very\nprevalent, view that any surplus above the bare\nnecessaries of life can only be produced if most men\nwork long hours at monotonous or painful tasks,\nleaving little leisure for a civilized existence or\nrational enjoyment. I do not believe that either\nof these obstacles to optimism will survive a close\nscrutiny. The possibility of technical improvement\nin the methods of production is, I believe, so\ngreat that, at any rate for centuries to come, there\nwill be no inevitable barrier to progress in the general\nwell-being by the simultaneous increase of commodities\nand diminution of hours of labor.\nThis subject has been specially studied by Kropotkin,\nwho, whatever may be thought of his general\ntheories of politics, is remarkably instructive, concrete\nand convincing in all that he says about the\npossibilities of agriculture. Socialists and Anarchists\nin the main are products of industrial life, and\nfew among them have any practical knowledge on the\nsubject of food production. But Kropotkin is an\nexception. His two books, ``The Conquest of Bread''\nand ``Fields, Factories and Workshops,'' are very\nfull of detailed information, and, even making great\nallowances for an optimistic bias, I do not think it\ncan be denied that they demonstrate possibilities in\nwhich few of us would otherwise have believed.\nMalthus contended, in effect, that population\nalways tends to increase up to the limit of subsistence,\nthat the production of food becomes more expensive\nas its amount is increased, and that therefore, apart\nfrom short exceptional periods when new discoveries\nproduce temporary alleviations, the bulk of mankind\nmust always be at the lowest level consistent with\nsurvival and reproduction. As applied to the civilized\nraces of the world, this doctrine is becoming\nuntrue through the rapid decline in the birth-rate;\nbut, apart from this decline, there are many other\nreasons why the doctrine cannot be accepted, at any\nrate as regards the near future. The century which\nelapsed after Malthus wrote, saw a very great\nincrease in the standard of comfort throughout the\nwage-earning classes, and, owing to the enormous\nincrease in the productivity of labor, a far greater\nrise in the standard of comfort could have been\neffected if a more just system of distribution had\nbeen introduced. In former times, when one man's\nlabor produced not very much more than was needed\nfor one man's subsistence, it was impossible either\ngreatly to reduce the normal hours of labor, or\ngreatly to increase the proportion of the population\nwho enjoyed more than the bare necessaries of life.\nBut this state of affairs has been overcome by modern\nmethods of production. At the present moment,\nnot only do many people enjoy a comfortable income\nderived from rent or interest, but about half the\npopulation of most of the civilized countries in the\nworld is engaged, not in the production of commodities,\nbut in fighting or in manufacturing munitions\nof war. In a time of peace the whole of this\nhalf might be kept in idleness without making the\nother half poorer than they would have been if the\nwar had continued, and if, instead of being idle, they\nwere productively employed, the whole of what they\nwould produce would be a divisible surplus over and\nabove present wages. The present productivity of\nlabor in Great Britain would suffice to produce an\nincome of about 1 pound per day for each family, even\nwithout any of those improvements in methods which\nare obviously immediately possible.\nBut, it will be said, as population increases, the\nprice of food must ultimately increase also as\nthe sources of supply in Canada, the Argentine,\nAustralia and elsewhere are more and more used up.\nThere must come a time, so pessimists will urge, when\nfood becomes so dear that the ordinary wage-earner\nwill have little surplus for expenditure upon other\nthings. It may be admitted that this would be true\nin some very distant future if the population were to\ncontinue to increase without limit. If the whole\nsurface of the world were as densely populated as\nLondon is now, it would, no doubt, require almost\nthe whole labor of the population to produce the\nnecessary food from the few spaces remaining for\nagriculture. But there is no reason to suppose that\nthe population will continue to increase indefinitely,\nand in any case the prospect is so remote that it may\nbe ignored in all practical considerations.\nReturning from these dim speculations to the\nfacts set forth by Kropotkin, we find it proved in\nhis writings that, by methods of intensive cultivation,\nwhich are already in actual operation, the amount of\nfood produced on a given area can be increased far\nbeyond anything that most uninformed persons suppose\npossible. Speaking of the market-gardeners in\nGreat Britain, in the neighborhood of Paris, and in\nother places, he says:--\nThey have created a totally new agriculture. They\nsmile when we boast about the rotation system having\npermitted us to take from the field one crop every year,\nor four crops each three years, because their ambition is\nto have six and nine crops from the very same plot of\nland during the twelve months. They do not understand\nour talk about good and bad soils, because they make\nthe soil themselves, and make it in such quantities as to\nbe compelled yearly to sell some of it; otherwise it would\nraise up the level of their gardens by half an inch every\nyear. They aim at cropping, not five or six tons of\ngrass on the acre, as we do, but from 50 to 100 tons of\nvarious vegetables on the same space; not 5 pound sworth of\nhay, but 100 pounds worth of vegetables, of the plainest description,\ncabbage and carrots.[38]\n[38] Kropotkin, ``Fields, Factories and Workshops,'' p. 74.\nAs regards cattle, he mentions that Mr. Champion\nat Whitby grows on each acre the food of two or\nthree head of cattle, whereas under ordinary high\nfarming it takes two or three acres to keep each head\nof cattle in Great Britain. Even more astonishing\nare the achievements of the Culture Maraicheres\nround Paris. It is impossible to summarize these\nachievements, but we may note the general\nconclusion:--\nThere are now practical Maraichers who venture to\nmaintain that if all the food, animal and vegetable,\nnecessary for the 3,500,000 inhabitants of the Departments\nof Seine and Seine-et-Oise had to be grown on\ntheir own territory (3250 square miles), it could be\ngrown without resorting to any other methods of culture\nthan those already in use--methods already tested on a\nlarge scale and proved successful.[39]\n[39] Ib. p. 81.\nIt must be remembered that these two departments\ninclude the whole population of Paris.\nKropotkin proceeds to point out methods by\nwhich the same result could be achieved without long\nhours of labor. Indeed, he contends that the great\nbulk of agricultural work could be carried on by\npeople whose main occupations are sedentary, and\nwith only such a number of hours as would serve to\nkeep them in health and produce a pleasant diversification.\nHe protests against the theory of exces-\nsive division of labor. What he wants is INTEGRATION,\n``a society where each individual is a producer of\nboth manual and intellectual work; where each able-\nbodied human being is a worker, and where each\nworker works both in the field and in the industrial\nworkshop.''[40]\n[40] Kropotkin, ``Field, Factories, and Workshops,'' p. 6.\nThese views as to production have no essential\nconnection with Kropotkin's advocacy of Anarchism.\nThey would be equally possible under State\nSocialism, and under certain circumstances they\nmight even be carried out in a capitalistic regime.\nThey are important for our present purpose, not\nfrom any argument which they afford in favor of one\neconomic system as against another, but from the\nfact that they remove the veto upon our hopes which\nmight otherwise result from a doubt as to the productive\ncapacity of labor. I have dwelt upon agriculture\nrather than industry, since it is in regard\nto agriculture that the difficulties are chiefly supposed\nto arise. Broadly speaking, industrial production\ntends to be cheaper when it is carried on on\na large scale, and therefore there is no reason in\nindustry why an increase in the demand should lead\nto an increased cost of supply.\nPassing now from the purely technical and material\nside of the problem of production, we come\nto the human factor, the motives leading men to\nwork, the possibilities of efficient organization of\nproduction, and the connection of production with\ndistribution. Defenders of the existing system\nmaintain that efficient work would be impossible without\nthe economic stimulus, and that if the wage\nsystem were abolished men would cease to do enough\nwork to keep the community in tolerable comfort.\nThrough the alleged necessity of the economic motive,\nthe problems of production and distribution\nbecome intertwined. The desire for a more just\ndistribution of the world's goods is the main inspiration\nof most Socialism and Anarchism. We must,\ntherefore, consider whether the system of distribution\nwhich they propose would be likely to lead to\na diminished production.\nThere is a fundamental difference between Socialism\nand Anarchism as regards the question of distribution.\nSocialism, at any rate in most of its\nforms, would retain payment for work done or for\nwillingness to work, and, except in the case of persons\nincapacitated by age or infirmity, would make\nwillingness to work a condition of subsistence, or at\nany rate of subsistence above a certain very low\nminimum. Anarchism, on the other hand, aims at\ngranting to everyone, without any conditions whatever,\njust as much of all ordinary commodities as\nhe or she may care to consume, while the rarer com-\nmodities, of which the supply cannot easily be\nindefinitely increased, would be rationed and divided\nequally among the population. Thus Anarchism\nwould not impose any OBLIGATIONS of work, though\nAnarchists believe that the necessary work could be\nmade sufficiently agreeable for the vast majority of\nthe population to undertake it voluntarily. Socialists,\non the other hand, would exact work. Some of\nthem would make the incomes of all workers equal,\nwhile others would retain higher pay for the work\nwhich is considered more valuable. All these different\nsystems are compatible with the common ownership\nof land and capital, though they differ greatly\nas regards the kind of society which they would\nproduce.\nSocialism with inequality of income would not\ndiffer greatly as regards the economic stimulus to\nwork from the society in which we live. Such differences\nas it would entail would undoubtedly be to the\ngood from our present point of view. Under the\nexisting system many people enjoy idleness and\naffluence through the mere accident of inheriting land\nor capital. Many others, through their activities in\nindustry or finance, enjoy an income which is certainly\nvery far in excess of anything to which their\nsocial utility entitles them. On the other hand, it\noften happens that inventors and discoverers, whose\nwork has the very greatest social utility, are robbed\nof their reward either by capitalists or by the failure\nof the public to appreciate their work until too\nlate. The better paid work is only open to those who\nhave been able to afford an expensive training, and\nthese men are selected in the main not by merit but\nby luck. The wage earner is not paid for his willingness\nto work, but only for his utility to the employer.\nConsequently, he may be plunged into destitution by\ncauses over which he has no control. Such destitution\nis a constant fear, and when it occurs it produces\nundeserved suffering, and often deterioration\nin the social value of the sufferer. These are a few\namong the evils of our existing system from the\nstandpoint of production. All these evils we might\nexpect to see remedied under any system of Socialism.\nThere are two questions which need to be considered\nwhen we are discussing how far work requires\nthe economic motive. The first question is: Must\nsociety give higher pay for the more skilled or socially\nmore valuable work, if such work is to be done in\nsufficient quantities? The second question is: Could\nwork be made so attractive that enough of it would\nbe done even if idlers received just as much of the\nproduce of work? The first of these questions concerns\nthe division between two schools of Socialists:\nthe more moderate Socialists sometimes concede that\neven under Socialism it would be well to retain\nunequal pay for different kinds of work, while the\nmore thoroughgoing Socialists advocate equal\nincomes for all workers. The second question, on the\nother hand, forms a division between Socialists and\nAnarchists; the latter would not deprive a man of\ncommodities if he did not work, while the former in\ngeneral would.\nOur second question is so much more fundamental\nthan our first that it must be discussed at once, and\nin the course of this discussion what needs to be said\non our first question will find its place naturally.\nWages or Free Sharing?--``Abolition of the\nwages system'' is one of the watchwords common\nto Anarchists and advanced Socialists. But in its\nmost natural sense it is a watchword to which only\nthe Anarchists have a right. In the Anarchist conception\nof society all the commoner commodities will\nbe available to everyone without stint, in the kind\nof way in which water is available at present.[41] Advo-\ncates of this system point out that it applies already\nto many things which formerly had to be paid for,\ne.g., roads and bridges. They point out that it\nmight very easily be extended to trams and local\ntrains. They proceed to argue--as Kropotkin does\nby means of his proofs that the soil might be made\nindefinitely more productive--that all the commoner\nkinds of food could be given away to all who demanded\nthem, since it would be easy to produce them in quantities\nadequate to any possible demand. If this system\nwere extended to all the necessaries of life,\neveryone's bare livelihood would be secured, quite\nregardless of the way in which he might choose to\nspend his time. As for commodities which cannot\nbe produced in indefinite quantities, such as luxuries\nand delicacies, they also, according to the Anarchists,\nare to be distributed without payment, but on a system\nof rations, the amount available being divided\nequally among the population. No doubt, though\nthis is not said, something like a price will have\nto be put upon these luxuries, so that a man may\nbe free to choose how he will take his share: one man\nwill prefer good wine, another the finest Havana\ncigars, another pictures or beautiful furniture. Presumably,\nevery man will be allowed to take such luxuries\nas are his due in whatever form he prefers, the\nrelative prices being fixed so as to equalize the\ndemand. In such a world as this, the economic stimulus\nto production will have wholly disappeared, and\nif work is to continue it must be from other motives.[42]\n[41] ``Notwithstanding the egotistic turn given to the public\nmind by the merchant-production of our century, the Communist\ntendency is continually reasserting itself and trying to\nmake its way into public life. The penny bridge disappears before\nthe public bridge; and the turnpike road before the free\nroad. The same spirit pervades thousands of other institutions.\nMuseums, free libraries, and free public schools; parks and\npleasure grounds; paved and lighted streets, free for everybody's\nuse; water supplied to private dwellings, with a growing tendency\ntowards disregarding the exact amount of it used by the\nindividual, tramways and railways which have already begun to\nintroduce the season ticket or the uniform tax, and will surely\ngo much further on this line when they are no longer private\nproperty: all these are tokens showing in what direction further\nprogress is to be expected.''--Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism.''\n[42] An able discussion of this question, at of various others,\nfrom the standpoint of reasoned and temperate opposition to\nAnarchism, will be found in Alfred Naquet's ``L'Anarchie et le\nCollectivisme,'' Paris, 1904.\nIs such a system possible? First, is it technically\npossible to provide the necessaries of life in such\nlarge quantities as would be needed if every man and\nwoman could take as much of them from the public\nstores as he or she might desire?\nThe idea of purchase and payment is so familiar\nthat the proposal to do away with it must be thought\nat first fantastic. Yet I do not believe it is nearly\nso fantastic as it seems. Even if we could all have\nbread for nothing, we should not want more than\na quite limited amount. As things are, the cost of\nbread to the rich is so small a proportion of their\nincome as to afford practically no check upon their\nconsumption; yet the amount of bread that they consume\ncould easily be supplied to the whole population\nby improved methods of agriculture (I am not speaking\nof war-time). The amount of food that people\ndesire has natural limits, and the waste that would\nbe incurred would probably not be very great. As\nthe Anarchists point out, people at present enjoy\nan unlimited water supply but very few leave the\ntaps running when they are not using them. And\none may assume that public opinion would be opposed\nto excessive waste. We may lay it down, I think,\nthat the principle of unlimited supply could be\nadopted in regard to all commodities for which the\ndemand has limits that fall short of what can be\neasily produced. And this would be the case, if production\nwere efficiently organized, with the necessaries\nof life, including not only commodities, but also\nsuch things as education. Even if all education were\nfree up to the highest, young people, unless they were\nradically transformed by the Anarchist regime,\nwould not want more than a certain amount of it.\nAnd the same applies to plain foods, plain clothes,\nand the rest of the things that supply our elementary\nneeds.\nI think we may conclude that there is no technical\nimpossibility in the Anarchist plan of free\nsharing.\nBut would the necessary work be done if the individual\nwere assured of the general standard of comfort\neven though he did no work?\nMost people will answer this question unhesitatingly\nin the negative. Those employers in particular\nwho are in the habit of denouncing their\nemployes as a set of lazy, drunken louts, will feel quite\ncertain that no work could be got out of them except\nunder threat of dismissal and consequent starvation.\nBut is this as certain as people are inclined to sup-\npose at first sight? If work were to remain what\nmost work is now, no doubt it would be very hard to\ninduce people to undertake it except from fear of\ndestitution. But there is no reason why work should\nremain the dreary drudgery in horrible conditions\nthat most of it is now.[43] If men had to be tempted to\nwork instead of driven to it, the obvious interest of\nthe community would be to make work pleasant. So\nlong as work is not made on the whole pleasant, it\ncannot be said that anything like a good state of\nsociety has been reached. Is the painfulness of work\nunavoidable?\n[43] ``Overwork is repulsive to human nature--not work. Overwork\nfor supplying the few with luxury--not work for the well-\nbeing of all. Work, labor, is a physiological necessity, a necessity\nof spending accumulated bodily energy, a necessity which\nis health and life itself. If so many branches of useful work are\nso reluctantly done now, it is merely because they mean overwork,\nor they are improperly organized. But we know--old\nFranklin knew it--that four hours of useful work every day\nwould be more than sufficient for supplying everybody with the\ncomfort of a moderately well-to-do middle-class house, if we all\ngave ourselves to productive work, and if we did not waste our\nproductive powers as we do waste them now. As to the childish\nquestion, repeated for fifty years: `Who would do disagreeable\nwork?' frankly I regret that none of our savants has ever been\nbrought to do it, be it for only one day in his life. If there is\nstill work which is really disagreeable in itself, it is only\nbecause our scientific men have never cared to consider the\nmeans of rendering it less so: they have always known that there\nwere plenty of starving men who would do it for a few pence\na day.'' Kropotkin, ```Anarchist Communism.''\nAt present, the better paid work, that of the\nbusiness and professional classes, is for the most part\nenjoyable. I do not mean that every separate\nmoment is agreeable, but that the life of a man who\nhas work of this sort is on the whole happier than\nthat of a man who enjoys an equal income without\ndoing any work. A certain amount of effort, and\nsomething in the nature of a continuous career, are\nnecessary to vigorous men if they are to preserve\ntheir mental health and their zest for life. A considerable\namount of work is done without pay. People\nwho take a rosy view of human nature might have\nsupposed that the duties of a magistrate would be\namong disagreeable trades, like cleaning sewers; but\na cynic might contend that the pleasures of vindictiveness\nand moral superiority are so great that there is\nno difficulty in finding well-to-do elderly gentlemen\nwho are willing, without pay, to send helpless wretches\nto the torture of prison. And apart from enjoyment\nof the work itself, desire for the good opinion of\nneighbors and for the feeling of effectiveness is quite\nsufficient to keep many men active.\nBut, it will be said, the sort of work that a man\nwould voluntarily choose must always be exceptional:\nthe great bulk of necessary work can never be anything\nbut painful. Who would choose, if an easy life\nwere otherwise open to him, to be a coal-miner, or a\nstoker on an Atlantic liner? I think it must be conceded\nthat much necessary work must always remain\ndisagreeable or at least painfully monotonous, and\nthat special privileges will have to be accorded to\nthose who undertake it, if the Anarchist system is ever\nto be made workable. It is true that the introduction\nof such special privileges would somewhat mar the\nrounded logic of Anarchism, but it need not,\nI think, make any really vital breach in its system.\nMuch of the work that needs doing could be rendered\nagreeable, if thought and care were given\nto this object. Even now it is often only long hours\nthat make work irksome. If the normal hours of\nwork were reduced to, say, four, as they could be by\nbetter organization and more scientific methods, a\nvery great deal of work which is now felt as a burden\nwould quite cease to be so. If, as Kropotkin suggests,\nagricultural work, instead of being the lifelong\ndrudgery of an ignorant laborer living very\nnear the verge of abject poverty, were the occasional\noccupation of men and women normally employed in\nindustry or brain-work; if, instead of being conducted\nby ancient traditional methods, without any\npossibility of intelligent participation by the wage-\nearner, it were alive with the search for new methods\nand new inventions, filled with the spirit of freedom,\nand inviting the mental as well as the physical cooperation\nof those who do the work, it might become\na joy instead of a weariness, and a source of health\nand life to those engaged in it.\nWhat is true of agriculture is said by Anarchists\nto be equally true of industry. They maintain\nthat if the great economic organizations which\nare now managed by capitalists, without consideration\nfor the lives of the wage-earners beyond\nwhat Trade Unions are able to exact, were turned\ngradually into self-governing communities, in which\nthe producers could decide all questions of methods,\nconditions, hours of work, and so forth, there would\nbe an almost boundless change for the better: grime\nand noise might be nearly eliminated, the hideousness\nof industrial regions might be turned into beauty, the\ninterest in the scientific aspects of production might\nbecome diffused among all producers with any native\nintelligence, and something of the artist's joy in creation\nmight inspire the whole of the work. All this,\nwhich is at present utterly remote from the reality,\nmight be produced by economic self-government.\nWe may concede that by such means a very large\nproportion of the necessary work of the world could\nultimately be made sufficiently agreeable to be preferred\nbefore idleness even by men whose bare livelihood\nwould be assured whether they worked or not.\nAs to the residue let us admit that special rewards,\nwhether in goods or honors or privileges, would have\nto be given to those who undertook it. But this need\nnot cause any fundamental objection.\nThere would, of course, be a certain proportion\nof the population who would prefer idleness. Provided\nthe proportion were small, this need not matter.\nAnd among those who would be classed as idlers\nmight be included artists, writers of books, men\ndevoted to abstract intellectual pursuits--in short,\nall those whom society despises while they are alive\nand honors when they are dead. To such men, the\npossibility of pursuing their own work regardless\nof any public recognition of its utility would be\ninvaluable. Whoever will observe how many of our\npoets have been men of private means will realize how\nmuch poetic capacity must have remained undeveloped\nthrough poverty; for it would be absurd to\nsuppose that the rich are better endowed by nature\nwith the capacity for poetry. Freedom for such men,\nfew as they are, must be set against the waste of\nthe mere idlers.\nSo far, we have set forth the arguments in favor\nof the Anarchist plan. They are, to my mind, sufficient\nto make it seem possible that the plan might\nsucceed, but not sufficient to make it so probable that\nit would be wise to try it.\nThe question of the feasibility of the Anarchist\nproposals in regard to distribution is, like so many\nother questions, a quantitative one. The Anarchist\nproposals consist of two parts: (1) That all the common\ncommodities should be supplied ad lib. to all\napplicants; (2) That no obligation to work, or economic\nreward for work, should be imposed on anyone.\nThese two proposals are not necessarily inseparable,\nnor does either entail the whole system of Anarchism,\nthough without them Anarchism would hardly be\npossible. As regards the first of these proposals, it\ncan be carried out even now with regard to some\ncommodities, and it could be carried out in no very\ndistant future with regard to many more. It is a\nflexible plan, since this or that article of consumption\ncould be placed on the free list or taken of as\ncircumstances might dictate. Its advantages are\nmany and various, and the practice of the world tends\nto develop in this direction. I think we may conclude\nthat this part of the Anarchists' system might\nwell be adopted bit by bit, reaching gradually the\nfull extension that they desire.\nBut as regards the second proposal, that there\nshould be no obligation to work, and no economic\nreward for work, the matter is much more doubtful.\nAnarchists always assume that if their schemes were\nput into operation practically everyone would work;\nbut although there is very much more to be said\nfor this view than most people would concede at first\nsight, yet it is questionable whether there is enough\nto be said to make it true for practical purposes.\nPerhaps, in a community where industry had become\nhabitual through economic pressure, public opinion\nmight be sufficiently powerful to compel most men\nto work;[44] but it is always doubtful how far such\na state of things would be permanent. If public\nopinion is to be really effective, it will be necessary\nto have some method of dividing the community into\nsmall groups, and to allow each group to consume\nonly the equivalent of what it produces. This will\nmake the economic motive operative upon the group,\nwhich, since we are supposing it small, will feel that\nits collective share is appreciably diminished by each\nidle individual. Such a system might be feasible, but\nit would be contrary to the whole spirit of Anarchism\nand would destroy the main lines of its economic\nsystem.\n[44] ``As to the so-often repeated objection that nobody would\nlabor if he were not compelled to do so by sheer necessity, we\nheard enough of it before the emancipation of slaves in America,\nas well as before the emancipation of serfs in Russia; and we\nhave had the opportunity of appreciating it at its just value.\nSo we shall not try to convince those who can be convinced only\nby accomplished facts. As to those who reason, they ought to\nknow that, if it really was so with some parts of humanity at\nits lowest stages--and yet, what do we know about it?--or if\nit is so with some small communities, or separate individuals,\nbrought to sheer despair by ill-success in their struggle against\nunfavorable conditions, it is not so with the bulk of the civilized\nnations. With us, work is a habit, and idleness an artificial\ngrowth.'' Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism,'' p. 30.\nThe attitude of orthodox Socialism on this question\nis quite different from that of Anarchism.[45]\nAmong the more immediate measures advocated in the\n``Communist Manifesto'' is ``equal liability of all\nto labor. Establishment of industrial armies, especially\nfor agriculture.'' The Socialist theory is that,\nin general, work alone gives the right to the enjoyment\nof the produce of work. To this theory there\nwill, of course, be exceptions: the old and the very\nyoung, the infirm and those whose work is temporarily\nnot required through no fault of their own.\nBut the fundamental conception of Socialism, in regard\nto our present question, is that all who can\nshould be compelled to work, either by the threat\nof starvation or by the operation of the criminal\nlaw. And, of course, the only kind of work recognized\nwill be such as commends itself to the authorities.\nWriting books against Socialism, or against\nany theory embodied in the government of the day,\nwould certainly not be recognized as work. No more\nwould the painting of pictures in a different style\nfrom that of the Royal Academy, or producing plays\nunpleasing to the censor. Any new line of thought\nwould be banned, unless by influence or corruption\nthe thinker could crawl into the good graces of the\npundits. These results are not foreseen by Socialists,\nbecause they imagine that the Socialist State\nwill be governed by men like those who now advocate\nit. This is, of course, a delusion. The rulers of the\nState then will bear as little resemblance to the pres-\nent Socialists as the dignitaries of the Church after\nthe time of Constantine bore to the Apostles. The\nmen who advocate an unpopular reform are exceptional\nin disinterestedness and zeal for the public\ngood; but those who hold power after the reform\nhas been carried out are likely to belong, in the main,\nto the ambitious executive type which has in all ages\npossessed itself of the government of nations. And\nthis type has never shown itself tolerant of opposition\nor friendly to freedom.\n[45] ``While holding this synthetic view on production, the\nAnarchists cannot consider, like the Collectivists, that a\nremuneration which would be proportionate to the hours of labor\nspent by each person in the production of riches may be an\nideal, or even an approach to an ideal, society.'' Kropotkin,\n``Anarchist Communism,'' p. 20.\nIt would seem, then, that if the Anarchist plan\nhas its dangers, the Socialist plan has at least equal\ndangers. It is true that the evils we have been foreseeing\nunder Socialism exist at present, but the purpose\nof Socialists is to cure the evils of the world\nas it is; they cannot be content with the argument\nthat they would make things no worse.\nAnarchism has the advantage as regards liberty,\nSocialism as regards the inducements to work. Can\nwe not find a method of combining these two advantages?\nIt seems to me that we can.\nWe saw that, provided most people work in\nmoderation, and their work is rendered as productive\nas science and organization can make it, there is no\ngood reason why the necessaries of life should not be\nsupplied freely to all. Our only serious doubt was\nas to whether, in an Anarchist regime, the motives for\nwork would be sufficiently powerful to prevent a dan-\ngerously large amount of idleness. But it would be\neasy to decree that, though necessaries should be free\nto all, whatever went beyond necessaries should only\nbe given to those who were willing to work--not, as\nis usual at present, only to those in work at any\nmoment, but also to all those who, when they happened\nnot to be working, were idle through no fault\nof their own. We find at present that a man who\nhas a small income from investments, just sufficient\nto keep him from actual want, almost always prefers\nto find some paid work in order to be able to afford\nluxuries. So it would be, presumably, in such a\ncommunity as we are imagining. At the same time, the\nman who felt a vocation for some unrecognized work\nof art or science or thought would be free to follow his\ndesire, provided he were willing to ``scorn delights\nand live laborious days.'' And the comparatively\nsmall number of men with an invincible horror of\nwork--the sort of men who now become tramps--\nmight lead a harmless existence, without any grave\ndanger of their becoming sufficiently numerous to be\na serious burden upon the more industrious. In this\nways the claims of freedom could be combined with\nthe need of some economic stimulus to work. Such\na system, it seems to me, would have a far greater\nchance of success than either pure Anarchism or pure\northodox Socialism.\nStated in more familiar terms, the plan we are\nadvocating amounts essentially to this: that a certain\nsmall income, sufficient for necessaries, should be\nsecured to all, whether they work or not, and that a\nlarger income, as much larger as might be warranted\nby the total amount of commodities produced, should\nbe given to those who are willing to engage in some\nwork which the community recognizes as useful. On\nthis basis we may build further. I do not think it\nis always necessary to pay more highly work which\nis more skilled or regarded as socially more useful,\nsince such work is more interesting and more respected\nthan ordinary work, and will therefore often be\npreferred by those who are able to do it. But we\nmight, for instance, give an intermediate income to\nthose who are only willing to work half the usual\nnumber of hours, and an income above that of most\nworkers to those who choose a specially disagreeable\ntrade. Such a system is perfectly compatible with\nSocialism, though perhaps hardly with Anarchism.\nOf its advantages we shall have more to say at a\nlater stage. For the present I am content to urge\nthat it combines freedom with justice, and avoids\nthose dangers to the community which we have found\nto lurk both in the proposals of the Anarchists and\nin those of orthodox Socialists.\nCHAPTER V\nGOVERNMENT AND LAW\nGOVERNMENT and Law, in their very essence, consist\nof restrictions on freedom, and freedom is the\ngreatest of political goods.[46] A hasty reasoner might\nconclude without further ado that Law and government\nare evils which must be abolished if freedom\nis our goal. But this consequence, true or false, cannot\nbe proved so simply. In this chapter we shall\nexamine the arguments of Anarchists against law and\nthe State. We shall proceed on the assumption that\nfreedom is the supreme aim of a good social system;\nbut on this very basis we shall find the Anarchist\ncontentions very questionable.\n[46] I do not say freedom is the greatest of ALL goods: the best\nthings come from within--they are such things as creative art,\nand love, and thought. Such things can be helped or hindered\nby political conditions, but not actually produced by them; and\nfreedom is, both in itself and in its relation to these other goods\nthe best thing that political and economic conditions can secure.\nRespect for the liberty of others is not a natural\nimpulse with most men: envy and love of power lead\nordinary human nature to find pleasure in interferences\nwith the lives of others. If all men's actions\nwere wholly unchecked by external authority, we\nshould not obtain a world in which all men would be\nfree. The strong would oppress the weak, or the\nmajority would oppress the minority, or the lovers\nof violence would oppress the more peaceable people.\nI fear it cannot be said that these bad impulses are\nWHOLLY due to a bad social system, though it must\nbe conceded that the present competitive organization\nof society does a great deal to foster the worst\nelements in human nature. The love of power is an\nimpulse which, though innate in very ambitious men,\nis chiefly promoted as a rule by the actual experience\nof power. In a world where none could acquire\nmuch power, the desire to tyrannize would be much\nless strong than it is at present. Nevertheless, I\ncannot think that it would be wholly absent, and\nthose in whom it would exist would often be men of\nunusual energy and executive capacity. Such men,\nif they are not restrained by the organized will of\nthe community, may either succeed in establishing\na despotism, or, at any rate, make such a vigorous\nattempt as can only be defeated through a period\nof prolonged disturbance. And apart from the love\nor political power, there is the love of power over\nindividuals. If threats and terrorism were not prevented\nby law, it can hardly be doubted that cruelty would\nbe rife in the relations of men and women, and of\nparents and children. It is true that the habits of\na community can make such cruelty rare, but these\nhabits, I fear, are only to be produced through the\nprolonged reign of law. Experience of backwoods\ncommunities, mining camps and other such places\nseems to show that under new conditions men easily\nrevert to a more barbarous attitude and practice.\nIt would seem, therefore, that, while human nature\nremains as it is, there will be more liberty for all in a\ncommunity where some acts of tyranny by individuals\nare forbidden, than in a community where the law\nleaves each individual free to follow his every impulse.\nBut, although the necessity of some form of government\nand law must for the present be conceded, it is\nimportant to remember that all law and government\nis in itself in some degree an evil, only justifiable when\nit prevents other and greater evils. Every use of the\npower of the State needs, therefore, to be very closely\nscrutinized, and every possibility of diminishing its\npower is to be welcomed provided it does not lead to\na reign of private tyranny.\nThe power of the State is partly legal, partly\neconomic: acts of a kind which the State dislikes can\nbe punished by the criminal law, and individuals who\nincur the displeasure of the State may find it hard\nto earn a livelihood.\nThe views of Marx on the State are not very\nclear. On the one hand he seems willing,, like the\nmodern State Socialists, to allow great power to the\nState, but on the other hand he suggests that when\nthe Socialist revolution has been consummated, the\nState, as we know it, will disappear. Among the\nmeasures which are advocated in the Communist\nManifesto as immediately desirable, there are several\nwhich would very greatly increase the power of\nthe existing State. For example, ``Centralization\nof credit in the hands of the State, by means of a\nnational bank with State capital and an exclusive\nmonopoly;'' and again, ``Centralization of the\nmeans of communication and transport in the hands\nof the State.'' But the Manifesto goes on to say:\nWhen, in the course of development, class distinctions\nhave disappeared, and all production has been concentrated\nin the hands of a vast association of the whole\nnation, the public power will lose its political character.\nPolitical power, properly so called, is merely the organised\npower of one class for oppressing another. If the\nproletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is\ncompelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize\nitself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes\nitself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by\nforce the old conditions of production, then it will,\nalong with these conditions, have swept away the conditions\nfor the existence of class antagonisms, and of\nclasses generally, and will thereby have abolished its\nown supremacy as a class.\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes\nand class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in\nwhich; the free development of each is the condition for\nthe free development of all.[47]\n[47] Communist Manifesto, p. 22.\nThis attitude Marx preserved in essentials\nthroughout his life. Accordingly, it is not to be\nwondered at that his followers, so far as regards their\nimmediate aims, have in the main become out-and-out\nState Socialists. On the other hand, the Syndicalists,\nwho accept from Marx the doctrine of the class\nwar, which they regard as what is really vital in his\nteaching, reject the State with abhorrence and wish\nto abolish it wholly, in which respect they are at one\nwith the Anarchists. The Guild Socialists, though\nsome persons in this country regard them as extremists,\nreally represent the English love of compromise.\nThe Syndicalist arguments as to the dangers inherent\nin the power of the State have made them dissatisfied\nwith the old State Socialism, but they are\nunable to accept the Anarchist view that society can\ndispense altogether with a central authority.\nAccordingly they propose that there should be two\nco-equal instruments of Government in a community,\nthe one geographical, representing the consumers,\nand essentially the continuation of the democratic\nState; the other representing the producers, organized,\nnot geographically, but in guilds, after the\nmanner of industrial unionism. These two author-\nities will deal with different classes of questions.\nGuild Socialists do not regard the industrial authority\nas forming part of the State, for they contend\nthat it is the essence of the State to be geographical;\nbut the industrial authority will resemble the present\nState in the fact that it will have coercive powers,\nand that its decrees will be enforced, when necessary.\nIt is to be suspected that Syndicalists also, much as\nthey object to the existing State, would not object\nto coercion of individuals in an industry by the\nTrade Union in that industry. Government within\nthe Trade Union would probably be quite as strict\nas State government is now. In saying this we are\nassuming that the theoretical Anarchism of Syndicalist\nleaders would not survive accession to power,\nbut I am afraid experience shows that this is not a\nvery hazardous assumption.\nAmong all these different views, the one which\nraises the deepest issue is the Anarchist contention\nthat all coercion by the community is unnecessary.\nLike most of the things that Anarchists say, there\nis much more to be urged in support of this view\nthan most people would suppose at first sight. Kropotkin,\nwho is its ablest exponent, points out how\nmuch has been achieved already by the method of free\nagreement. He does not wish to abolish government\nin the sense of collective decisions: what he does wish\nto abolish is the system by which a decision is en-\nforced upon those who oppose it.[48] The whole system\nof representative government and majority rule is\nto him a bad thing.[49] He points to such instances\nas the agreements among the different railway systems\nof the Continent for the running of through\nexpresses and for co-operation generally. He points\nout that in such cases the different companies or\nauthorities concerned each appoint a delegate, and that\nthe delegates suggest a basis of agreement, which has\nto be subsequently ratified by each of the bodies ap-\npointing them. The assembly of delegates has no\ncoercive power whatever, and a majority can do\nnothing against a recalcitrant minority. Yet this has\nnot prevented the conclusion of very elaborate systems\nof agreements. By such methods, so Anarchists\ncontend, the USEFUL functions of government can be\ncarried out without any coercion. They maintain\nthat the usefulness of agreement is so patent as to\nmake co-operation certain if once the predatory\nmotives associated with the present system of private\nproperty were removed.\n[48] ``On the other hand, the STATE has also been confused with\nGOVERNMENT. As there can be no State without government, it\nhas been sometimes said that it is the absence of government,\nand not the abolition of the State, that should be the aim.\n``It seems to me, however, that State and government represent\ntwo ideas of a different kind. The State idea implies quite\nanother idea to that of government. It not only includes the\nexistence of a power placed above society, but also a territorial\nconcentration and a concentration of many functions of the life\nof society in the hands of a few or even of all. It implies new\nrelations among the members of society.\n``This characteristic distinction, which perhaps escapes\nnotice at first sight, appears clearly when the origin of the State\nis studied.'' Kropotkin, ``The State.'' p. 4.\n[49] Representative government has accomplished its historical\nmission; it has given a mortal blow to Court-rule; and by\nits debates it has awakened public interest in public questions.\nBut, to see in it the government of the future Socialist society,\nis to commit a gross error. Each economical phase of life\nimplies its own political phase; and it is impossible to touch the\nvery basis of the present economical life--private property--\nwithout a corresponding change in the very basis of the political\norganization. Life already shows in which direction the change\nwill be made. Not in increasing the powers of the State, but\nin resorting to free organization and free federation in all those\nbranches which are now considered as attributes of the State.''\nKropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism,'' pp. 28-29.\nAttractive as this view is, I cannot resist the\nconclusion that it results from impatience and\nrepresents the attempt to find a short-cut toward the\nideal which all humane people desire.\nLet us begin with the question of private crime.[50]\nAnarchists maintain that the criminal is manufactured\nby bad social conditions and would disappear\nin such a world as they aim at creating.[51] No doubt\nthere is a great measure of truth in this view. There\nwould be little motive to robbery, for example, in an\nAnarchist world, unless it were organized on a large\nscale by a body of men bent on upsetting the Anarchist\nregime. It may also be conceded that impulses\ntoward criminal violence could be very largely eliminated\nby a better education. But all such contentions,\nit seems to me, have their limitations. To take\nan extreme case, we cannot suppose that there would\nbe no lunatics in an Anarchist community, and some\nof these lunatics would, no doubt, be homicidal.\nProbably no one would argue that they ought to be\nleft at liberty. But there are no sharp lines in nature;\nfrom the homicidal lunatic to the sane man\nof violent passions there is a continuous gradation.\nEven in the most perfect community there will be\nmen and women, otherwise sane, who will feel an\nimpulse to commit murder from jealousy. These are\nnow usually restrained by the fear of punishment,\nbut if this fear were removed, such murders would\nprobably become much more common, as may be\nseen from the present behavior of certain soldiers\non leave. Moreover, certain kinds of conduct arouse\npublic hostility, and would almost inevitably lead to\nlynching, if no other recognized method of punishment\nexisted. There is in most men a certain natural\nvindictiveness, not always directed against the worst\nmembers of the community. For example, Spinoza\nwas very nearly murdered by the mob because he was\nsuspected of undue friendliness to France at a time\nwhen Holland was at war with that country. Apart\nfrom such cases, there would be the very real danger\nof an organized attempt to destroy Anarchism\nand revive ancient oppressions. Is it to be supposed,\nfor example, that Napoleon, if he had been born into\nsuch a community as Kropotkin advocates, would\nhave acquiesced tamely in a world where his genius\ncould find no scope? I cannot see what should prevent\na combination of ambitious men forming themselves\ninto a private army, manufacturing their own\nmunitions, and at last enslaving the defenseless citizens,\nwho had relied upon the inherent attractiveness\nof liberty. It would not be consistent with the principles\nof Anarchism for the community to interfere\nwith the drilling of a private army, no matter what\nits objects might be (though, of course, an opposing\nprivate army might be formed by men with different\nviews). Indeed, Kropotkin instances the old volunteers\nin Great Britain as an example of a movement\non Anarchist lines.[52] Even if a predatory army were\nnot formed from within, it might easily come from a\nneighboring nation, or from races on the borderland\nof civilization. So long as the love of power exists,\nI do not see how it can be prevented from finding an\noutlet in oppression except by means of the organized\nforce of the community.\n[50] On this subject there is an excellent discussion in the\nbefore-mentioned work of Monsieur Naquet.\n[51] ``As to the third--the chief--objection, which maintains\nthe necessity of a government for punishing those who break the\nlaw of society, there is so much to say about it that it hardly can\nbe touched incidentally. The more we study the question, the\nmore we are brought to the conclusion that society itself is\nresponsible for the anti-social deeds perpetrated in its midst, and\nthat no punishment, no prisons, and no hangmen can diminish\nthe numbers of such deeds; nothing short of a reorganization of\nsociety itself. Three-quarters of all the acts which are brought\nevery year before our courts have their origin, either directly or\nindirectly, in the present disorganized state of society with\nregard to the production and distribution of wealth--not in the\nperversity of human nature. As to the relatively few anti-social\ndeeds which result from anti-social inclinations of separate\nindividuals, it is not by prisons, nor even by resorting to the\nhangmen, that we can diminish their numbers. By our prisons,\nwe merely multiply them and render them worse. By our detectives,\nour `price of blood,' our executions, and our jails, we\nspread in society such a terrible flow of basest passions and\nhabits, that he who should realize the effects of these institutions\nto their full extent, would be frightened by what society is\ndoing under the pretext of maintaining morality. We must\nsearch for other remedies, and the remedies have been indicated\nlong since.'' Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism,'' pp. 31-32.\n[52] ``Anarchist Communism,'' p. 27.\nThe conclusion, which appears to be forced upon\nus, is that the Anarchist ideal of a community in\nwhich no acts are forbidden by law is not, at any\nrate for the present, compatible with the stability of\nsuch a world as the Anarchists desire. In order to\nobtain and preserve a world resembling as closely\nas possible that at which they aim, it will still be\nnecessary that some acts should be forbidden by\nlaw. We may put the chief of these under three\nheads:\n1. Theft.\n2. Crimes of violence.\n3. The creation of organizations intended to subvert\nthe Anarchist regime by force.\nWe will briefly recapitulate what has been said\nalready as to the necessity of these prohibitions.\n1. Theft.--It is true that in an Anarchist world\nthere will be no destitution, and therefore no thefts\nmotivated by starvation. But such thefts are at present\nby no means the most considerable or the most\nharmful. The system of rationing, which is to be\napplied to luxuries, will leave many men with fewer\nluxuries than they might desire. It will give\nopportunities for peculation by those who are in control\nof the public stores, and it will leave the possibility of\nappropriating such valuable objects of art as would\nnaturally be preserved in public museums. It may\nbe contended that such forms of theft would be prevented\nby public opinion. But public opinion is not\ngreatly operative upon an individual unless it is the\nopinion of his own group. A group of men combined\nfor purposes of theft might readily defy the public\nopinion of the majority unless that public opinion\nmade itself effective by the use of force against them.\nProbably, in fact, such force would be applied\nthrough popular indignation, but in that case we\nshould revive the evils of the criminal law with the\nadded evils of uncertainty, haste and passion, which\nare inseparable from the practice of lynching. If,\nas we have suggested, it were found necessary to provide\nan economic stimulus to work by allowing fewer\nluxuries to idlers, this would afford a new motive for\ntheft on their part and a new necessity for some form\nof criminal law.\n2. Crimes of Violence.--Cruelty to children,\ncrimes of jealousy, rape, and so forth, are almost\ncertain to occur in any society to some extent. The\nprevention of such acts is essential to the existence\nof freedom for the weak. If nothing were done to\nhinder them, it is to be feared that the customs of a\nsociety would gradually become rougher, and that\nacts which are now rare would cease to be so. If\nAnarchists are right in maintaining that the existence\nof such an economic system as they desire would\nprevent the commission of crimes of this kind, the\nlaws forbidding them would no longer come into\noperation, and would do no harm to liberty. If, on\nthe other hand, the impulse to such actions persisted,\nit would be necessary that steps should be taken to\nrestrain men from indulging it.\n3. The third class of difficulties is much the most\nserious and involves much the most drastic interference\nwith liberty. I do not see how a private army\ncould be tolerated within an Anarchist community,\nand I do not see how it could be prevented except by\na general prohibition of carrying arms. If there\nwere no such prohibition, rival parties would organize\nrival forces, and civil war would result. Yet, if there\nis such a prohibition, it cannot well be carried out\nwithout a very considerable interference with individual\nliberty. No doubt, after a time, the idea of\nusing violence to achieve a political object might die\ndown, as the practice of duelling has done. But such\nchanges of habit and outlook are facilitated by legal\nprohibition, and would hardly come about without\nit. I shall not speak yet of the international aspect\nof this same problem, for I propose to deal with that\nin the next chapter, but it is clear that the same\nconsiderations apply with even greater force to the\nrelations between nations.\nIf we admit, however reluctantly, that a criminal\nlaw is necessary and that the force of the community\nmust be brought to bear to prevent certain kinds of\nactions, a further question arises: How is crime to be\ntreated? What is the greatest measure of humanity\nand respect for freedom that is compatible with the\nrecognition of such a thing as crime? The first thing\nto recognize is that the whole conception of guilt or\nsin should be utterly swept away. At present, the\ncriminal is visited with the displeasure of the community:\nthe sole method applied to prevent the occurrence\nof crime is the infliction of pain upon the\ncriminal. Everything possible is done to break his\nspirit and destroy his self-respect. Even those\npleasures which would be most likely to have a civilizing\neffect are forbidden to him, merely on the ground\nthat they are pleasures, while much of the suffering\ninflicted is of a kind which can only brutalize and\ndegrade still further. I am not speaking, of course,\nof those few penal institutions which have made a\nserious study of reforming the criminal. Such\ninstitutions, especially in America, have been proved\ncapable of achieving the most remarkable results, but\nthey remain everywhere exceptional. The broad rule\nis still that the criminal is made to feel the displeasure\nof society. He must emerge from such a treatment\neither defiant and hostile, or submissive and cringing,\nwith a broken spirit and a loss of self-respect.\nNeither of these results is anything but evil. Nor\ncan any good result be achieved by a method of treatment\nwhich embodies reprobation.\nWhen a man is suffering from an infectious disease\nhe is a danger to the community, and it is necessary\nto restrict his liberty of movement. But no one\nassociates any idea of guilt with such a situation.\nOn the contrary, he is an object of commiseration to\nhis friends. Such steps as science recommends are\ntaken to cure him of his disease, and he submits as\na rule without reluctance to the curtailment of liberty\ninvolved meanwhile. The same method in spirit ought\nto be shown in the treatment of what is called\n``crime.'' It is supposed, of course, that the criminal\nis actuated by calculations of self-interest, and\nthat the fear of punishment, by supplying a contrary\nmotive of self-interest affords the best deterrent,\nThe dog, to gain some private end,\nWent mad and bit the man.\nThis is the popular view of crime; yet no dog goes\nmad from choice, and probably the same is true of the\ngreat majority of criminals, certainly in the case\nof crimes of passion. Even in cases where self-interest\nis the motive, the important thing is to prevent\nthe crime, not to make the criminal suffer. Any\nsuffering which may be entailed by the process of\nprevention ought to be regarded as regrettable, like the\npain involved in a surgical operation. The man who\ncommits a crime from an impulse to violence ought\nto be subjected to a scientific psychological treatment,\ndesigned to elicit more beneficial impulses. The\nman who commits a crime from calculations of self-\ninterest ought to be made to feel that self-interest\nitself, when it is fully understood, can be better served\nby a life which is useful to the community than by one\nwhich is harmful. For this purpose it is chiefly necessary\nto widen his outlook and increase the scope of his\ndesires. At present, when a man suffers from insufficient\nlove for his fellow-creatures, the method of\ncuring him which is commonly adopted seems scarcely\ndesigned to succeed, being, indeed, in essentials, the\nsame as his attitude toward them. The object of\nthe prison administration is to save trouble, not to\nstudy the individual case. He is kept in captivity in\na cell from which all sight of the earth is shut out: he\nis subjected to harshness by warders, who have too\noften become brutalized by their occupation.[53] He is\nsolemnly denounced as an enemy to society. He is\ncompelled to perform mechanical tasks, chosen for\ntheir wearisomeness. He is given no education and no\nincentive to self-improvement. Is it to be wondered\nat if, at the end of such a course of treatment, his\nfeelings toward the community are no more friendly\nthan they were at the beginning?\n[53] This was written before the author had any personal\nexperience of the prison system. He personally met with\nnothing but kindness at the hands of the prison officials.\nSeverity of punishment arose through vindictiveness\nand fear in an age when many criminals escaped\njustice altogether, and it was hoped that savage\nsentences would outweigh the chance of escape in the\nmind of the criminal. At present a very large part\nof the criminal law is concerned in safeguarding the\nrights of property, that is to say--as things are\nnow--the unjust privileges of the rich. Those whose\nprinciples lead them into conflict with government,\nlike Anarchists, bring a most formidable indictment\nagainst the law and the authorities for the unjust\nmanner in which they support the status quo. Many\nof the actions by which men have become rich are far\nmore harmful to the community than the obscure\ncrimes of poor men, yet they go unpunished because\nthey do not interfere with the existing order. If the\npower of the community is to be brought to bear to\nprevent certain classes of actions through the agency\nof the criminal law, it is as necessary that these\nactions should really be those which are harmful to\nthe community, as it is that the treatment of ``criminals''\nshould be freed from the conception of guilt\nand inspired by the same spirit as is shown in the\ntreatment of disease. But, if these two conditions\nwere fulfilled, I cannot help thinking that a society\nwhich preserved the existence of law would be preferable\nto one conducted on the unadulterated principles\nof Anarchism.\nSo far we have been considering the power which\nthe State derives from the criminal law. We have\nevery reason to think that this power cannot be\nentirely abolished, though it can be exercised in a\nwholly different spirit, without the vindictiveness and\nthe moral reprobation which now form its essence.\nWe come next to the consideration of the economic\npower of the State and the influence which it\ncan exert through its bureaucracy. State Socialists\nargue as if there would be no danger to liberty in a\nState not based upon capitalism. This seems to me an\nentire delusion. Given an official caste, however selected,\nthere are bound to be a set of men whose whole\ninstincts will drive them toward tyranny. Together\nwith the natural love of power, they will have a rooted\nconviction (visible now in the higher ranks of the\nCivil Service) that they alone know enough to be able\nto judge what is for the good of the community. Like\nall men who administer a system, they will come to\nfeel the system itself sacrosanct. The only changes\nthey will desire will be changes in the direction of\nfurther regulations as to how the people are to\nenjoy the good things kindly granted to them by their\nbenevolent despots. Whoever thinks this picture overdrawn\nmust have failed to study the influence and\nmethods of Civil Servants at present. On every matter\nthat arises, they know far more than the general\npublic about all the DEFINITE facts involved; the one\nthing they do not know is ``where the shoe pinches.''\nBut those who know this are probably not skilled in\nstating their case, not able to say off-hand exactly\nhow many shoes are pinching how many feet, or what\nis the precise remedy required. The answer prepared\nfor Ministers by the Civil Service is accepted by the\n``respectable'' public as impartial, and is regarded\nas disposing of the case of malcontents except on a\nfirst-class political question on which elections may\nbe won or lost. That at least is the way in which\nthings are managed in England. And there is every\nreason to fear that under State Socialism the power\nof officials would be vastly greater than it is at\npresent.\nThose who accept the orthodox doctrine of democracy\ncontend that, if ever the power of capital were\nremoved, representative institutions would suffice to\nundo the evils threatened by bureaucracy. Against\nthis view, Anarchists and Syndicalists have directed\na merciless criticism. French Syndicalists especially,\nliving, as they do, in a highly democratized country,\nhave had bitter experience of the way in which the\npower of the State can be employed against a\nprogressive minority. This experience has led them to\nabandon altogether the belief in the divine right of\nmajorities. The Constitution that they would desire\nwould be one which allowed scope for vigorous minorities,\nconscious of their aims and prepared to work\nfor them. It is undeniable that, to all who care for\nprogress, actual experience of democratic representative\nGovernment is very disillusioning. Admitting--\nas I think we must--that it is preferable to any\nPREVIOUS form of Government, we must yet acknowledge\nthat much of the criticism directed against it by\nAnarchists and Syndicalists is thoroughly justified.\nSuch criticism would have had more influence if\nany clear idea of an alternative to parliamentary\ndemocracy had been generally apprehended. But it\nmust be confessed that Syndicalists have not presented\ntheir case in a way which is likely to attract\nthe average citizen. Much of what they say amounts\nto this: that a minority, consisting of skilled workers\nin vital industries, can, by a strike, make the economic\nlife of the whole community impossible, and can in\nthis way force their will upon the nation. The action\naimed at is compared to the seizure of a power\nstation, by which a whole vast system can be paralyzed.\nSuch a doctrine is an appeal to force, and\nis naturally met by an appeal to force on the other\nside. It is useless for the Syndicalists to protest that\nthey only desire power in order to promote liberty:\nthe world which they are seeking to establish does not,\nas yet, appeal to the effective will of the community,\nand cannot be stably inaugurated until it does do so.\nPersuasion is a slow process, and may sometimes\nbe accelerated by violent methods; to this extent such\nmethods may be justified. But the ultimate goal of\nany reformer who aims at liberty can only be reached\nthrough persuasion. The attempt to thrust liberty\nby force upon those who do not desire what we consider\nliberty must always prove a failure; and Syndicalists,\nlike other reformers, must ultimately rely\nupon persuasion for success.\nBut it would be a mistake to confuse aims with\nmethods: however little we may agree with the proposal\nto force the millennium on a reluctant community\nby starvation, we may yet agree that much of\nwhat the Syndicalists desire to achieve is desirable.\nLet us dismiss from our minds such criticisms of\nparliamentary government as are bound up with the\npresent system of private property, and consider\nonly those which would remain true in a collectivist\ncommunity. Certain defects seem inherent in the\nvery nature of representative institutions. There is\na sense of self-importance, inseparable from success\nin a contest for popular favor. There is an all-but\nunavoidable habit of hypocrisy, since experience\nshows that the democracy does not detect insincerity\nin an orator, and will, on the other hand, be shocked\nby things which even the most sincere men may think\nnecessary. Hence arises a tone of cynicism among\nelected representatives, and a feeling that no man\ncan retain his position in politics without deceit.\nThis is as much the fault of the democracy as of the\nrepresentatives, but it seems unavoidable so long as\nthe main thing that all bodies of men demand of their\nchampions is flattery. However the blame may be\napportioned, the evil must be recognized as one which\nis bound to occur in the existing forms of democracy.\nAnother evil, which is especially noticeable in large\nStates, is the remoteness of the seat of government\nfrom many of the constituencies--a remoteness which\nis psychological even more than geographical. The\nlegislators live in comfort, protected by thick walls\nand innumerable policemen from the voice of the\nmob; as time goes on they remember only dimly the\npassions and promises of their electoral campaign;\nthey come to feel it an essential part of statesmanship\nto consider what are called the interests of the community\nas a whole, rather than those of some discontented\ngroup; but the interests of the community as\na whole are sufficiently vague to be easily seen to\ncoincide with self-interest. All these causes lead\nParliaments to betray the people, consciously or\nunconsciously; and it is no wonder if they have produced\na certain aloofness from democratic theory in the\nmore vigorous champions of labor.\nMajority rule, as it exists in large States, is\nsubject to the fatal defect that, in a very great number\nof questions, only a fraction of the nation have\nany direct interest or knowledge, yet the others have\nan equal voice in their settlement. When people have\nno direct interest in a question they are very apt\nto be influenced by irrelevant considerations; this is\nshown in the extraordinary reluctance to grant autonomy\nto subordinate nations or groups. For this\nreason, it is very dangerous to allow the nation as a\nwhole to decide on matters which concern only a small\nsection, whether that section be geographical or\nindustrial or defined in any other way. The best\ncure for this evil, so far as can be seen at present,\nlies in allowing self-government to every important\ngroup within a nation in all matters that affect that\ngroup much more than they affect the rest of the\ncommunity. The government of a group, chosen by\nthe group, will be far more in touch with its constituents,\nfar more conscious of their interests, than a\nremote Parliament nominally representing the whole\ncountry. The most original idea in Syndicalism--\nadopted and developed by the Guild Socialists--is the\nidea of making industries self-governing units so far\nas their internal affairs are concerned. By this\nmethod, extended also to such other groups as have\nclearly separable interests, the evils which have shown\nthemselves in representative democracy can, I believe,\nbe largely overcome.\nGuild Socialists, as we have seen, have another\nsuggestion, growing naturally out of the autonomy\nof industrial guilds, by which they hope to limit the\npower of the State and help to preserve individual\nliberty. They propose that, in addition to Parliament,\nelected (as at present) on a territorial basis\nand representing the community as consumers, there\nshall also be a ``Guild Congress,'' a glorified successor\nof the present Trade Union Congress, which\nshall consist of representatives chosen by the Guilds,\nand shall represent the community as producers.\nThis method of diminishing the excessive power\nof the State has been attractively set forth by Mr.\nG. D. H. Cole in his ``Self-Government in Industry.''[54]\n``Where now,'' he says, ``the State passes a Factory\nAct, or a Coal Mines Regulation Act, the Guild Congress\nof the future will pass such Acts, and its power\nof enforcing them will be the same as that of the\nState'' (p. 98). His ultimate ground for advocating\nthis system is that, in his opinion, it will tend to preserve\nindividual liberty: ``The fundamental reason\nfor the preservation, in a democratic Society, of both\nthe industrial and the political forms of Social organization\nis, it seems to me, that only by dividing the\nvast power now wielded by industrial capitalism can\nthe individual hope to be free'' (p. 91).\n[54] Bell, 1917.\nWill the system suggested by Mr. Cole have this\nresult? I think it is clear that it would, in this\nrespect, be an improvement on the existing system.\nRepresentative government cannot but be improved\nby any method which brings the representatives into\ncloser touch with the interests concerned in their\nlegislation; and this advantage probably would be\nsecured by handing over questions of production to\nthe Guild Congress. But if, in spite of the safeguards\nproposed by the Guild Socialists, the Guild Congress\nbecame all-powerful in such questions, if resistance\nto its will by a Guild which felt ill-used became practically\nhopeless, I fear that the evils now connected\nwith the omnipotence of the State would soon reappear.\nTrade Union officials, as soon as they become\npart of the governing forces in the country, tend to\nbecome autocratic and conservative; they lose touch\nwith their constituents and gravitate, by a psychological\nsympathy, into co-operation with the powers\nthat be. Their formal installation in authority\nthrough the Guilds Congress would accelerate this\nprocess. They would soon tend to combine, in effect\nif not obviously, with those who wield authority in\nParliament. Apart from occasional conflicts, comparable\nto the rivalry of opposing financiers which\nnow sometimes disturbs the harmony of the capitalist\nworld, there would, at most times, be agreement\nbetween the dominant personalities in the two\nHouses. And such harmony would filch away from\nthe individual the liberty which he had hoped to\nsecure by the quarrels of his masters.\nThere is no method, if we are not mistaken, by\nwhich a body representing the whole community,\nwhether as producers or consumers or both, can\nalone be a sufficient guardian of individual liberty.\nThe only way of preserving sufficient liberty (and\neven this will be inadequate in the case of very small\nminorities) is the organization of citizens with special\ninterests into groups, determined to preserve autonomy\nas regards their internal affairs, willing to\nresist interference by a strike if necessary, and\nsufficiently powerful (either in themselves or through\ntheir power of appealing to public sympathy) to be\nable to resist the organized forces of government\nsuccessfully when their cause is such as many men\nthink just. If this method is to be successful we\nmust have not only suitable organizations but also\na diffused respect for liberty, and an absence of\nsubmissiveness to government both in theory and practice.\nSome risk of disorder there must be in such a\nsociety, but this risk is as nothing compared to the\ndanger of stagnation which is inseparable from an\nall-powerful central authority.\nWe may now sum up our discussion of the powers\nof Government.\nThe State, in spite of what Anarchists urge, seems\na necessary institution for certain purposes. Peace\nand war, tariffs, regulation of sanitary conditions\nand of the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of\na just system of distribution: these, among others,\nare functions which could hardly be performed in\na community in which there was no central government.\nTake, for example, the liquor traffic, or\nthe opium traffic in China. If alcohol could be\nobtained at cost price without taxation, still more\nif it could be obtained for nothing, as Anarchists\npresumably desire, can we believe that there would not\nbe a great and disastrous increase of drunkenness?\nChina was brought to the verge of ruin by opium,\nand every patriotic Chinaman desired to see the traffic\nin opium restricted. In such matters freedom is\nnot a panacea, and some degree of legal restriction\nseems imperative for the national health.\nBut granting that the State, in some form, must\ncontinue, we must also grant, I think, that its powers\nought to be very strictly limited to what is absolutely\nnecessary. There is no way of limiting its\npowers except by means of groups which are jealous\nof their privileges and determined to preserve their\nautonomy, even if this should involve resistance to\nlaws decreed by the State, when these laws interfere in\nthe internal affairs of a group in ways not warranted\nby the public interest. The glorification of the State,\nand the doctrine that it is every citizen's duty to serve\nthe State, are radically against progress and against\nliberty. The State, though at present a source of\nmuch evil, is also a means to certain good things,\nand will be needed so long as violent and destructive\nimpulses remain common. But it is MERELY a means,\nand a means which needs to be very carefully and\nsparingly used if it is not to do more harm than good.\nIt is not the State, but the community, the worldwide\ncommunity of all human beings present and\nfuture, that we ought to serve. And a good community\ndoes not spring from the glory of the State,\nbut from the unfettered development of individuals:\nfrom happiness in daily life, from congenial work\ngiving opportunity for whatever constructiveness\neach man or woman may possess, from free personal\nrelations embodying love and taking away the roots\nof envy in thwarted capacity from affection, and\nabove all from the joy of life and its expression in\nthe spontaneous creations of art and science. It is\nthese things that make an age or a nation worthy\nof existence, and these things are not to be secured\nby bowing down before the State. It is the individual\nin whom all that is good must be realized, and the\nfree growth of the individual must be the supreme end\nof a political system which is to re-fashion the world.\nCHAPTER VI\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\nTHE main objects which should be served by international\nrelations may be taken to be two: First, the\navoidance of wars, and, second, the prevention of the\noppression of weak nations by strong ones. These\ntwo objects do not by any means necessarily lead in\nthe same direction, since one of the easiest ways of\nsecuring the world's peace would be by a combination\nof the most powerful States for the exploitation and\noppression of the remainder. This method, however,\nis not one which the lover of liberty can favor. We\nmust keep account of both aims and not be content\nwith either alone.\nOne of the commonplaces of both Socialism and\nAnarchism is that all modern wars are due to capitalism,\nand would cease if capitalism were abolished.\nThis view, to my mind, is only a half-truth; the half\nthat is true is important, but the half that is untrue\nis perhaps equally important when a fundamental\nreconstruction of society is being considered.\nSocialist and Anarchist critics of existing society\npoint, with perfect truth, to certain capitalistic factors\nwhich promote war. The first of these is the\ndesire of finance to find new fields of investment in\nundeveloped countries. Mr. J. A. Hobson, an author\nwho is by no means extreme in his views, has well\nstated this point in his book on ``The Evolution of\nModern Capitalism.''[55] He says:\n[55] Walter Scott Publishing Company, 1906, p. 262.\nThe economic tap-root, the chief directing motive of\nall the modern imperialistic expansion, is the pressure of\ncapitalist industries for markets, primarily markets for\ninvestment, secondarily markets for surplus products of\nhome industry. Where the concentration of capital has\ngone furthest, and where a rigorous protective system prevails,\nthis pressure is necessarily strongest. Not merely\ndo the trusts and other manufacturing trades that restrict\ntheir output for the home market more urgently require\nforeign markets, but they are also more anxious to secure\nprotected markets, and this can only be achieved by extending\nthe area of political rule. This is the essential\nsignificance of the recent change in American foreign\npolicy as illustrated by the Spanish War, the Philippine\nannexation, the Panama policy, and the new application\nof the Monroe doctrine to the South American States.\nSouth America is needed as a preferential market for\ninvestment of trust ``profits'' and surplus trust products:\nif in time these states can be brought within a Zollverein\nunder the suzerainty of the United States, the financial\narea of operations receives a notable accession. China\nas a field of railway enterprise and general industrial\ndevelopment already begins to loom large in the eyes of\nforesighted American business men; the growing trade\nin American cotton and other goods in that country will\nbe a subordinate consideration to the expansion of the\narea for American investments. Diplomatic pressure,\narmed force, and, where desirable, seizure of territory for\npolitical control, will be engineered by the financial magnates\nwho control the political destiny of America. The\nstrong and expensive American navy now beginning to\nbe built incidentally serves the purpose of affording\nprofitable contracts to the shipbuilding and metal industries:\nits real meaning and use is to forward the aggressive\npolitical policy imposed upon the nation by the economic\nneeds of the financial capitalists.\nIt should be clearly understood that this constant\npressure to extend the area of markets is not a necessary\nimplication of all forms of organized industry. If competition\nwas displaced by combinations of a genuinely\ncooperative character in which the whole gain of improved\neconomies passed, either to the workers in wages,\nor to large bodies of investors in dividends, the expansion\nof demand in the home markets would be so great\nas to give full employment to the productive powers of\nconcentrated capital, and there would be no self-accumulating\nmasses of profit expressing themselves in new\ncredit and demanding external employment. It is the\n``monopoly'' profits of trusts and combines, taken either\nin construction, financial operation, or industrial working,\nthat form a gathering fund of self-accumulating credit\nwhose possession by the financial class implies a contracted\ndemand for commodities and a correspondingly\nrestricted employment for capital in American industries.\nWithin certain limits relief can be found by stimulation\nof the export trade under cover of a high protective\ntariff which forbids all interference with monopoly of\nthe home markets. But it is extremely difficult for\ntrusts adapted to the requirements of a profitable tied\nmarket at home to adjust their methods of free competition\nin the world markets upon a profitable basis of\nsteady trading. Moreover, such a mode of expansion is\nonly appropriate to certain manufacturing trusts: the\nowners of railroad, financial and other trusts must look\nalways more to foreign investments for their surplus\nprofits. This ever-growing need for fresh fields of investment\nfor their profits is the great crux of the financial\nsystem, and threatens to dominate the future economics\nand the politics of the great Republic.\nThe financial economy of American capitalism exhibits\nin more dramatic shape a tendency common to the\nfinance of all developed industrial nations. The large,\neasy flow of capital from Great Britain, Germany, Austria,\nFrance, etc., into South African or Australian mines,\ninto Egyptian bonds, or the precarious securities of South\nAmerican republics, attests the same general pressure\nwhich increases with every development of financial machinery\nand the more profitable control of that machinery\nby the class of professional financiers\nThe kind of way in which such conditions tend\ntoward war might have been illustrated, if Mr. Hobson\nhad been writing at a later date, by various more\nrecent cases. A higher rate of interest is obtainable\non enterprises in an undeveloped country than in a\ndeveloped one, provided the risks connected with an\nunsettled government can be minimized. To minimize\nthese risks the financiers call in the assistance of the\nmilitary and naval forces of the country which they\nare momentarily asserting to be theirs. In order to\nhave the support of public opinion in this demand\nthey have recourse to the power of the Press.\nThe Press is the second great factor to which\ncritics of capitalism point when they wish to prove\nthat capitalism is the source of modern war. Since\nthe running of a big newspaper requires a large capital,\nthe proprietors of important organs necessarily\nbelong to the capitalist class, and it will be a rare\nand exceptional event if they do not sympathize with\ntheir own class in opinion and outlook. They are\nable to decide what news the great mass of newspaper\nreaders shall be allowed to have. They can\nactually falsify the news, or, without going so far\nas that, they can carefully select it, giving such items\nas will stimulate the passions which they desire to\nstimulate, and suppressing such items as would provide\nthe antidote. In this way the picture of the\nworld in the mind of the average newspaper reader\nis made to be not a true picture, but in the main\nthat which suits the interests of capitalists. This is\ntrue in many directions, but above all in what con-\ncerns the relations between nations. The mass of the\npopulation of a country can be led to love or hate\nany other country at the will of the newspaper proprietors,\nwhich is often, directly or indirectly, influenced\nby the will of the great financiers. So long as\nenmity between England and Russia was desired,\nour newspapers were full of the cruel treatment meted\nout to Russian political prisoners, the oppression of\nFinland and Russian Poland, and other such topics.\nAs soon as our foreign policy changed, these items\ndisappeared from the more important newspapers,\nand we heard instead of the misdeeds of Germany.\nMost men are not sufficiently critical to be on their\nguard against such influences, and until they are, the\npower of the Press will remain.\nBesides these two influences of capitalism in\npromoting war, there is another, much less emphasized\nby the critics of capitalism, but by no means less\nimportant: I mean the pugnacity which tends to be\ndeveloped in men who have the habit of command.\nSo long as capitalist society persists, an undue measure\nof power will be in the hands of those who have\nacquired wealth and influence through a great position\nin industry or finance. Such men are in the\nhabit, in private life, of finding their will seldom\nquestioned; they are surrounded by obsequious satellites\nand are not infrequently engaged in conflicts\nwith Trade Unions. Among their friends and\nacquaintances are included those who hold high positions\nin government or administration, and these men\nequally are liable to become autocratic through the\nhabit of giving orders. It used to be customary to\nspeak of the ``governing classes,'' but nominal democracy\nhas caused this phrase to go out of fashion.\nNevertheless, it still retains much truth; there are\nstill in any capitalist community those who command\nand those who as a rule obey. The outlook of these\ntwo classes is very different, though in a modern\nsociety there is a continuous gradation from the extreme\nof the one to the extreme of the other. The\nman who is accustomed to find submission to his will\nbecomes indignant on the occasions when he finds\nopposition. Instinctively he is convinced that opposition\nis wicked and must be crushed. He is therefore\nmuch more willing than the average citizen to resort\nto war against his rivals. Accordingly we find,\nthough, of course, with very notable exceptions,\nthat in the main those who have most power are\nmost warlike, and those who have least power are\nleast disposed to hatred of foreign nations. This is\none of the evils inseparable from the concentration\nof power. It will only be cured by the abolition of\ncapitalism if the new system is one which allows very\nmuch less power to single individuals. It will not be\ncured by a system which substitutes the power of\nMinisters or officials for the power of capitalists\nThis is one reason, additional to those mentioned in\nthe preceding chapter, for desiring to see a diminution\nin the authority of the State.\nNot only does the concentration of power tend\nto cause wars, but, equally, wars and the fear of them\nbring about the necessity for the concentration of\npower. So long as the community is exposed to\nsudden dangers, the possibility of quick decision is\nabsolutely necessary to self-preservation. The cumbrous\nmachinery of deliberative decisions by the\npeople is impossible in a crisis, and therefore so long\nas crises are likely to occur, it is impossible to abolish\nthe almost autocratic power of governments. In this\ncase, as in most others, each of two correlative evils\ntends to perpetuate the other. The existence of men\nwith the habit of power increases the risk of war,\nand the risk of war makes it impossible to establish\na system where no man possesses great power.\nSo far we have been considering what is true in\nthe contention that capitalism causes modern wars.\nIt is time now to look at the other side, and to ask\nourselves whether the abolition of capitalism would,\nby itself, be sufficient to prevent war.\nI do not myself believe that this is the case. The\noutlook of both Socialists and Anarchists seems to\nme, in this respect as in some others, to be unduly\ndivorced from the fundamental instincts of human\nnature. There were wars before there was capital-\nism, and fighting is habitual among animals. The\npower of the Press in promoting war is entirely due\nto the fact that it is able to appeal to certain\ninstincts. Man is naturally competitive, acquisitive,\nand, in a greater or less degree, pugnacious. When\nthe Press tells him that so-and-so is his enemy, a whole\nset of instincts in him responds to the suggestion. It\nis natural to most men to suppose that they have\nenemies and to find a certain fulfillment of their nature\nwhen they embark upon a contest. What a man\nbelieves upon grossly insufficient evidence is an index\nto his desires--desires of which he himself is often\nunconscious. If a man is offered a fact which goes\nagainst his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and\nunless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to\nbelieve it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something\nwhich affords a reason for acting in accordance\nwith his instincts, he will accept it even on the slenderest\nevidence. The origin of myths is explained in this\nway, and much of what is currently believed in\ninternational affairs is no better than myth. Although\ncapitalism affords in modern society the channel by\nwhich the instinct of pugnacity finds its outlet, there\nis reason to fear that, if this channel were closed,\nsome other would be found, unless education and\nenvironment were so changed as enormously to diminish\nthe strength of the competitive instinct. If an\neconomic reorganization can effect this it may pro-\nvide a real safeguard against war, but if not, it is\nto be feared that the hopes of universal peace will\nprove delusive.\nThe abolition of capitalism might, and very likely\nwould, greatly diminish the incentives to war which\nare derived from the Press and from the desire of\nfinance to find new fields for investment in undeveloped\ncountries, but those which are derived from the\ninstinct of command and the impatience of opposition\nmight remain, though perhaps in a less virulent\nform than at present. A democracy which has power\nis almost always more bellicose than one which is\nexcluded from its due share in the government. The\ninternationalism of Marx is based upon the assumption\nthat the proletariat everywhere are oppressed by\nthe ruling classes. The last words of the Communist\nManifesto embody this idea--\nLet the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic\nrevolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but\ntheir chains. They have a world to win. Working men\nof all countries, unite!\nSo long as the proletarians have nothing to lose\nbut their chains, it is not likely that their enmity\nwill be directed against other proletarians. If the\nworld had developed as Marx expected, the kind of\ninternationalism which he foresaw might have inspired\na universal social revolution. Russia, which devel-\noped more nearly than any other country upon the\nlines of his system, has had a revolution of the kind\nwhich he expected. If the development in other countries\nhad been similar, it is highly probable that this\nrevolution would have spread throughout the civilized\nworld. The proletariat of all countries might have\nunited against the capitalists as their common\nenemy, and in the bond of an identical hatred they\nmight for the moment have been free from hatred\ntoward each other. Even then, this ground of union\nwould have ceased with their victory, and on the morrow\nof the social revolution the old national rivalries\nmight have revived. There is no alchemy by which\na universal harmony can be produced out of hatred.\nThose who have been inspired to action by the doctrine\nof the class war will have acquired the habit\nof hatred, and will instinctively seek new enemies\nwhen the old ones have been vanquished.\nBut in actual fact the psychology of the working\nman in any of the Western democracies is totally\nunlike that which is assumed in the Communist\nManifesto. He does not by any means feel that he\nhas nothing to lose but his chains, nor indeed is this\ntrue. The chains which bind Asia and Africa in\nsubjection to Europe are partly riveted by him. He is\nhimself part of a great system of tyranny and\nexploitation. Universal freedom would remove, not only\nhis own chains, which are comparatively light, but\nthe far heavier chains which he has helped to fasten\nupon the subject races of the world.\nNot only do the working men of a country like\nEngland have a share in the benefit accruing from the\nexploitation of inferior races, but many among them\nalso have their part in the capitalist system. The\nfunds of Trade Unions and Friendly Societies are\ninvested in ordinary undertakings, such as railways;\nmany of the better-paid wage-earners have put their\nsavings into government securities; and almost all\nwho are politically active feel themselves part of the\nforces that determine public policy, through the\npower of the Labor Party and the greater unions.\nOwing to these causes their outlook on life has become\nto a considerable extent impregnated with capitalism\nand as their sense of power has grown, their\nnationalism has increased. This must continue to\nbe true of any internationalism which is based upon\nhatred of the capitalist and adherence to the doctrine\nof the class war. Something more positive\nand constructive than this is needed if governing\ndemocracies are not to inherit the vices of governing\nclasses in the past.\nI do not wish to be thought to deny that capitalism\ndoes very much to promote wars, or that wars\nwould probably be less frequent and less destructive\nif private property were abolished. On the contrary,\nI believe that the abolition of private ownership of\nland and capital is a necessary step toward any\nworld in which the nations are to live at peace with\none another. I am only arguing that this step, necessary\nas it is, will not alone suffice for this end, but that\namong the causes of war there are others that go\ndeeper into the roots of human nature than any that\northodox Socialists are wont to acknowledge.\nLet us take an instance. In Australia and California\nthere is an intense dislike and fear toward the\nyellow races. The causes of this are complex; the\nchief among them are two, labor competition and\ninstinctive race-hatred. It is probable that, if race-\nhatred did not exist, the difficulties of labor competition\ncould be overcome. European immigrants also\ncompete, but they are not excluded. In a sparsely\npopulated country, industrious cheap labor could,\nwith a little care, be so utilized as to enrich the existing\ninhabitants; it might, for example, be confined to\ncertain kinds of work, by custom if not by law. But\nrace-hatred opens men's minds to the evils of\ncompetition and closes them against the advantages of\nco-operation; it makes them regard with horror the\nsomewhat unfamiliar vices of the aliens, while our\nown vices are viewed with mild toleration. I cannot\nbut think that, if Australia were completely socialized,\nthere would still remain the same popular objection\nas at present to any large influx of Chinese or\nJapanese labor. Yet if Japan also were to become a\nSocialist State, the Japanese might well continue to\nfeel the pressure of population and the desire for an\noutlet. In such circumstances, all the passions and\ninterests required to produce a war would exist, in\nspite of the establishment of Socialism in both countries.\nAnts are as completely Socialistic as any community\ncan possibly be, yet they put to death any\nant which strays among them by mistake from a\nneighboring ant-heap. Men do not differ much from\nants, as regards their instincts in this respect, where-\never there is a great divergence of race, as between\nwhite men and yellow men. Of course the instinct of\nrace-hostility can be overcome by suitable circumstances;\nbut in the absence of such circumstances it\nremains a formidable menace to the world's peace.\nIf the peace of the world is ever to become secure,\nI believe there will have to be, along with other\nchanges, a development of the idea which inspires the\nproject of a League of Nations. As time goes on, the\ndestructiveness of war grows greater and its profits\ngrow less: the rational argument against war acquires\nmore and more force as the increasing productivity\nof labor makes it possible to devote a greater\nand greater proportion of the population to the work\nof mutual slaughter. In quiet times, or when a great\nwar has just ended, men's moods are amenable to\nthe rational grounds in favor of peace, and it is\npossible to inaugurate schemes designed to make wars\nless frequent. Probably no civilized nation would\nembark upon an aggressive war if it were fairly\ncertain in advance that the aggressor must be defeated.\nThis could be achieved if most great nations\ncame to regard the peace of the world as of such\nimportance that they would side against an aggressor\neven in a quarrel in which they had no direct interest.\nIt is on this hope that the League of Nations is based.\nBut the League of Nations, like the abolition of\nprivate property, will be by no means sufficient if it\nis not accompanied or quickly followed by other\nreforms. It is clear that such reforms, if they are\nto be effective, must be international; the world must\nmove as a whole in these matters, if it is to move at\nall. One of the most obvious necessities, if peace is to\nbe secure, is a measure of disarmament. So long as\nthe present vast armies and navies exist, no system\ncan prevent the risk of war. But disarmament, if it\nis to serve its purpose, must be simultaneous and by\nmutual agreement among all the Great Powers. And\nit is not likely to be successful so long as hatred and\nsuspicion rule between nations, for each nation will\nsuspect its neighbor of not carrying out the bargain\nfairly. A different mental and moral atmosphere\nfrom that to which we are accustomed in international\naffairs will be necessary if agreements between nations\nare to succeed in averting catastrophes. If once such\nan atmosphere existed it might be perpetuated and\nstrengthened by wise institutions; but it cannot be\nCREATED by institutions alone. International co-operation\nrequires mutual good will, and good will, however\nit has arisen, is only to be PRESERVED by co-operation.\nThe international future depends upon the possibility\nof the initial creation of good will between nations.\nIt is in this sort of matter that revolutions are\nmost useful. If the Russian Revolution had been\naccompanied by a revolution in Germany, the dramatic\nsuddenness of the change might have shaken\nEurope, for the moment, out of its habits of thought:\nthe idea of fraternity might have seemed, in the\ntwinkling of an eye, to have entered the world of\npractical politics; and no idea is so practical as the\nidea of the brotherhood of man, if only people can be\nstartled into believing in it. If once the idea of\nfraternity between nations were inaugurated with the\nfaith and vigor belonging to a new revolution, all the\ndifficulties surrounding it would melt away, for all\nof them are due to suspicion and the tyranny of\nancient prejudice. Those who (as is common in the\nEnglish-speaking world) reject revolution as a\nmethod, and praise the gradual piecemeal development\nwhich (we are told) constitutes solid progress,\noverlook the effect of dramatic events in changing\nthe mood and the beliefs of whole populations. A\nsimultaneous revolution in Germany and Russia\nwould no doubt have had such an effect, and would\nhave made the creation of a new world possible here\nand now.\nDis aliter visum: the millennium is not for our\ntime. The great moment has passed, and for ourselves\nit is again the distant hope that must inspire\nus, not the immediate breathless looking for the\ndeliverance.[56] But we have seen what might have been,\nand we know that great possibilities do arise in times\nof crisis. In some such sense as this, it may well\nbe true that the Socialist revolution is the road to\nuniversal peace, and that when it has been traversed\nall the other conditions for the cessation of\nwars will grow of themselves out of the changed\nmental and moral atmosphere.\n[56] This was written in March, 1918, almost the darkest\nmoment of the war.\nThere is a certain class of difficulties which surrounds\nthe sober idealist in all speculations about the\nnot too distant future. These are the cases where\nthe solution believed by most idealists to be universally\napplicable is for some reason impossible, and is,\nat the same time, objected to for base or interested\nmotives by all upholders of existing inequalities. The\ncase of Tropical Africa will illustrate what I mean.\nIt would be difficult seriously to advocate the immediate\nintroduction of parliamentary government for\nthe natives of this part of the world, even if it were\naccompanied by women's suffrage and proportional\nrepresentation. So far as I know, no one supposes\nthe populations of these regions capable of self-\ndetermination, except Mr. Lloyd George. There can\nbe no doubt that, whatever regime may be introduced\nin Europe, African negroes will for a long time to\ncome be governed and exploited by Europeans. If\nthe European States became Socialistic, and refused,\nunder a Quixotic impulse, to enrich themselves at the\nexpense of the defenseless inhabitants of Africa,\nthose inhabitants would not thereby gain; on the\ncontrary, they would lose, for they would be handed\nover to the tender mercies of individual traders,\noperating with armies of reprobate bravos, and committing\nevery atrocity to which the civilized barbarian\nis prone. The European governments cannot divest\nthemselves of responsibility in regard to Africa.\nThey must govern there, and the best that can be\nhoped is that they should govern with a minimum\nof cruelty and rapacity. From the point of view of\npreserving the peace of the world, the problem is to\nparcel out the advantages which white men derive\nfrom their position in Africa in such a way that no\nnation shall feel a sense of injustice. This problem\nis comparatively simple, and might no doubt be solved\non the lines of the war aims of the Inter-Allied Socialists.\nBut it is not this problem which I wish to discuss.\nWhat I wish to consider is, how could a Socialist\nor an Anarchist community govern and administer\nan African region, full of natural wealth, but\ninhabited by a quite uncivilized population? Unless\ngreat precautions were taken the white community,\nunder the circumstances, would acquire the\nposition and the instincts of a slave-owner. It\nwould tend to keep the negroes down to the bare level\nof subsistence, while using the produce of their\ncountry to increase the comfort and splendor of the\nCommunist community. It would do this with that\ncareful unconsciousness which now characterizes all\nthe worst acts of nations. Administrators would be\nappointed and would be expected to keep silence as\nto their methods. Busybodies who reported horrors\nwould be disbelieved, and would be said to be actuated\nby hatred toward the existing regime and by a perverse\nlove for every country but their own. No doubt,\nin the first generous enthusiasm accompanying the\nestablishment of the new regime at home, there would\nbe every intention of making the natives happy, but\ngradually they would be forgotten, and only the\ntribute coming from their country would be\nremembered. I do not say that all these evils are\nunavoidable; I say only that they will not be avoided\nunless they are foreseen and a deliberate conscious\neffort is made to prevent their realization. If the\nwhite communities should ever reach the point of\nwishing to carry out as far as possible the principles\nunderlying the revolt against capitalism, they will\nhave to find a way of establishing an absolute\ndisinterestedness in their dealings with subject races. It\nwill be necessary to avoid the faintest suggestion of\ncapitalistic profit in the government of Africa, and\nto spend in the countries themselves whatever they\nwould be able to spend if they were self-governing.\nMoreover, it must always be remembered that backwardness\nin civilization is not necessarily incurable,\nand that with time even the populations of Central\nAfrica may become capable of democratic self-government,\nprovided Europeans bend their energies to\nthis purpose.\nThe problem of Africa is, of course, a part of the\nwider problems of Imperialism, but it is that part in\nwhich the application of Socialist principles is most\ndifficult. In regard to Asia, and more particularly\nin regard to India and Persia, the application of\nprinciples is clear in theory though difficult in political\npractice. The obstacles to self-government which\nexist in Africa do not exist in the same measure in\nAsia. What stands in the way of freedom of Asiatic\npopulations is not their lack of intelligence, but only\ntheir lack of military prowess, which makes them an\neasy prey to our lust for dominion. This lust would\nprobably be in temporary abeyance on the morrow of\na Socialist revolution, and at such a moment a new\ndeparture in Asiatic policy might be taken with\npermanently beneficial results. I do not mean, of\ncourse, that we should force upon India that form\nof democratic government which we have developed\nfor our own needs. I mean rather that we should\nleave India to choose its own form of government, its\nown manner of education and its own type of civilization.\nIndia has an ancient tradition, very different\nfrom that of Western Europe, a tradition highly\nvalued by educated Hindoos, but not loved by our\nschools and colleges. The Hindoo Nationalist feels\nthat his country has a type of culture containing elements\nof value that are absent, or much less marked,\nin the West; he wishes to be free to preserve this,\nand desires political freedom for such reasons rather\nthan for those that would most naturally appeal to\nan Englishman in the same subject position. The\nbelief of the European in his own Kultur tends to be\nfanatical and ruthless, and for this reason, as much as\nfor any other, the independence of extra-European\ncivilization is of real importance to the world, for it is\nnot by a dead uniformity that the world as a whole is\nmost enriched.\nI have set forth strongly all the major difficulties\nin the way of the preservation of the world's peace,\nnot because I believe these difficulties to be insuperable,\nbut, on the contrary, because I believe that they\ncan be overcome if they are recognized. A correct\ndiagnosis is necessarily the first step toward a cure.\nThe existing evils in international relations spring,\nat bottom, from psychological causes, from motives\nforming part of human nature as it is at present.\nAmong these the chief are competitiveness, love of\npower, and envy, using envy in that broad sense in\nwhich it includes the instinctive dislike of any gain\nto others not accompanied by an at least equal gain\nto ourselves. The evils arising from these three\ncauses can be removed by a better education and a\nbetter economic and political system.\nCompetitiveness is by no means wholly an evil.\nWhen it takes the form of emulation in the service\nof the public, or in discovery or the production of\nworks of art, it may become a very useful stimulus,\nurging men to profitable effort beyond what they\nwould otherwise make. It is only harmful when it\naims at the acquisition of goods which are limited\nin amount, so that what one man possesses he holds at\nthe expense of another. When competitiveness takes\nthis form it is necessarily attended by fear, and out\nof fear cruelty is almost inevitably developed. But a\nsocial system providing for a more just distribution\nof material goods might close to the instinct of\ncompetitiveness those channels in which it is harmful,\nand cause it to flow instead in channels in which it\nwould become a benefit to mankind. This is one great\nreason why the communal ownership of land and capital\nwould be likely to have a beneficial effect upon\nhuman nature, for human nature, as it exists in adult\nmen and women, is by no means a fixed datum, but\na product of circumstances, education and opportunity\noperating upon a highly malleable native\ndisposition.\nWhat is true of competitiveness is equally true\nof love of power. Power, in the form in which it is\nnow usually sought, is power of command, power of\nimposing one's will upon others by force, open or\nconcealed. This form of power consists, in essence, in\nthwarting others, for it is only displayed when others\nare compelled to do what they do not wish to do.\nSuch power, we hope, the social system which is to\nsupersede capitalist will reduce to a minimum by the\nmethods which we outlined in the preceding chapter.\nThese methods can be applied in international no\nless than in national affairs. In international affairs\nthe same formula of federalism will apply: self-\ndetermination for every group in regard to matters which\nconcern it much more vitally than they concern\nothers, and government by a neutral authority embracing\nrival groups in all matters in which conflicting\ninterests of groups come into play; lout always\nwith the fixed principle that the functions of government\nare to be reduced to the bare minimum compatible\nwith justice and the prevention of private\nviolence. In such a world the present harmful outlets\nfor the love of power would be closed. But the\npower which consists in persuasion, in teaching, in\nleading men to a new wisdom or the realization of\nnew possibilities of happiness--this kind of power,\nwhich may be wholly beneficial, would remain untouched,\nand many vigorous men, who in the actual\nworld devote their energies to domination, would in\nsuch a world find their energies directed to the creation\nof new goods rather than the perpetuation of\nancient evils.\nEnvy, the third of the psychological causes to\nwhich we attributed what is bad in the actual world,\ndepends in most natures upon that kind of fundamental\ndiscontent which springs from a lack of\nfree development, from thwarted instinct, and\nfrom the impossibility of realizing an imagined\nhappiness. Envy cannot be cured by preaching;\npreaching, at the best, will only alter its manifestations\nand lead it to adopt more subtle forms of concealment.\nExcept in those rare natures in which\ngenerosity dominates in spite of circumstances, the\nonly cure for envy is freedom and the joy of life.\nFrom populations largely deprived of the simple\ninstinctive pleasures of leisure and love, sunshine and\ngreen fields, generosity of outlook and kindliness\nof dispositions are hardly to be expected. In such\npopulations these qualities are not likely to be found,\neven among the fortunate few, for these few are\naware, however dimly, that they are profiting by an\ninjustice, and that they can only continue to enjoy\ntheir good fortune by deliberately ignoring those\nwith whom it is not shared. If generosity and kindliness\nare to be common, there must be more care\nthan there is at present for the elementary wants of\nhuman nature, and more realization that the diffusion\nof happiness among all who are not the victims of\nsome peculiar misfortune is both possible and imperative.\nA world full of happiness would not wish to\nplunge into war, and would not be filled with that\ngrudging hostility which our cramped and narrow\nexistence forces upon average human nature. A world\nfull of happiness is not beyond human power to\ncreate; the obstacles imposed by inanimate nature\nare not insuperable. The real obstacles lie in the\nheart of man, and the cure for these is a firm hope,\ninformed and fortified by thought.\nCHAPTER VII\nSCIENCE AND ART UNDER SOCIALISM\nSOCIALISM has been advocated by most of its\nchampions chiefly as a means of increasing the welfare\nof the wage earning classes, and more particularly\ntheir material welfare. It has seemed accordingly,\nto some men whose aims are not material, as\nif it has nothing to offer toward the general\nadvancement of civilization in the way of art and\nthought. Some of its advocates, moreover--and\namong these Marx must be included--have written,\nno doubt not deliberately, as if with the Socialist\nrevolution the millennium would have arrived, and\nthere would be no need of further progress for the\nhuman race. I do not know whether our age is more\nrestless than that which preceded it, or whether it\nhas merely become more impregnated with the idea\nof evolution, but, for whatever reason, we have\ngrown incapable of believing in a state of static\nperfection, and we demand, of any social system,\nwhich is to have our approval, that it shall contain\nwithin itself a stimulus and opportunity for progress\ntoward something still better. The doubts thus\nraised by Socialist writers make it necessary to\ninquire whether Socialism would in fact be hostile to\nart and science, and whether it would be likely to\nproduce a stereotyped society in which progress\nwould become difficult and slow.\nIt is not enough that men and women should be\nmade comfortable in a material sense. Many members\nof the well-to-do classes at present, in spite of\nopportunity, contribute nothing of value to the life\nof the world, and do not even succeed in securing for\nthemselves any personal happiness worthy to be so\ncalled. The multiplication of such individuals would\nbe an achievement of the very minutest value; and\nif Socialism were merely to bestow upon all the\nkind of life and outlook which is now enjoyed by\nthe more apathetic among the well-to-do, it would\noffer little that could inspire enthusiasm in any\ngenerous spirit.\n``The true role of collective existence,'' says M.\nNaquet,[57]'' . . . is to learn, to discover, to know.\nEating, drinking, sleeping, living, in a word, is a\nmere accessory. In this respect, we are not\ndistinguished from the brute. Knowledge is the goal.\nIf I were condemned to choose between a humanity\nmaterially happy, glutted after the manner of a\nflock of sheep in a field, and a humanity existing in\nmisery, but from which emanated, here and there,\nsome eternal truth, it is on the latter that my choice\nwould fall.''\n[57] ``L'Anarchie et le Collectivisme,'' p. 114.\nThis statement puts the alternative in a very\nextreme form in which it is somewhat unreal. It may\nbe said in reply that for those who have had the\nleisure and the opportunity to enjoy ``eternal\ntruths'' it is easy to exalt their importance at the\nexpense of sufferings which fall on others. This is\ntrue; but, if it is taken as disposing of the question,\nit leaves out of account the importance of thought\nfor progress. Viewing the life of mankind as a whole,\nin the future as well as in the present, there can be\nno question that a society in which some men pursue\nknowledge while others endure great poverty offers\nmore hope of ultimate good than a society in which\nall are sunk in slothful comfort. It is true that\npoverty is a great evil, but it is not true that material\nprosperity is in itself a great good. If it is to have\nany real value to society, it must be made a means to\nthe advancement of those higher goods that belong\nto the life of the mind. But the life of the mind does\nnot consist of thought and knowledge alone, nor\ncan it be completely healthy unless it has some\ninstinctive contact, however deeply buried, with the\ngeneral life of the community. Divorced from the\nsocial instinct, thought, like art, tends to become\nfinicky and precious. It is the position of such art\nand thought as is imbued with the instinctive sense\nof service to mankind that we wish to consider, for\nit is this alone that makes up the life of the mind\nin the sense in which it is a vital part of the life of\nthe community. Will the life of the mind in this\nsense be helped or hindered by Socialism? And will\nthere still be a sufficient spur to progress to prevent\na condition of Byzantine immobility?\nIn considering this question we are, in a certain\nsense, passing outside the atmosphere of democracy.\nThe general good of the community is realized only\nin individuals, but it is realized much more fully in\nsome individuals than in others. Some men have a\ncomprehensive and penetrating intellect, enabling\nthem to appreciate and remember what has been\nthought and known by their predecessors, and to\ndiscover new regions in which they enjoy all the\nhigh delights of the mental explorer. Others have\nthe power of creating beauty, giving bodily form to\nimpalpable visions out of which joy comes to many.\nSuch men are more fortunate than the mass, and also\nmore important for the collective life. A larger share\nof the general sum of good is concentrated in them\nthan in the ordinary man and woman; but also their\ncontribution to the general good is greater. They\nstand out among men and cannot be wholly fitted\ninto the framework of democratic equality. A social\nsystem which would render them unproductive would\nstand condemned, whatever other merits it might\nhave.\nThe first thing to realize--though it is difficult in\na commercial age--is that what is best in creative\nmental activity cannot be produced by any system\nof monetary rewards. Opportunity and the stimulus\nof an invigorating spiritual atmosphere are important,\nbut, if they are presented, no financial inducements\nwill be required, while if they are absent,\nmaterial compensations will be of no avail. Recognition,\neven if it takes the form of money, can bring a\ncertain pleasure in old age to the man of science\nwho has battled all his life against academic\nprejudice, or to the artist who has endured years of\nridicule for not painting in the manner of his\npredecessors; but it is not by the remote hope of such\npleasures that their work has been inspired. All\nthe most important work springs from an uncalculating\nimpulse, and is best promoted, not by rewards\nafter the event, but by circumstances which keep the\nimpulse alive and afford scope for the activities\nwhich it inspires. In the creation of such circumstances\nour present system is much at fault. Will\nSocialism be better?\nI do not think this question can be answered\nwithout specifying the kind of Socialism that is intended:\nsome forms of Socialism would, I believe, be\neven more destructive in this respect than the present\ncapitalist regime, while others would be immeasurably\nbetter. Three things which a social system can\nprovide or withhold are helpful to mental creation:\nfirst, technical training; second, liberty to follow\nthe creative impulse; third, at least the possibility of\nultimate appreciation by some public, whether large\nor small. We may leave out of our discussion both\nindividual genius and those intangible conditions\nwhich make some ages great and others sterile in art\nand science--not because these are unimportant, but\nbecause they are too little understood to be taken\naccount of in economic or political organization.\nThe three conditions we have mentioned seem to cover\nmost of what can be SEEN to be useful or harmful\nfrom our present point of view, and it is therefore\nto them that we shall confine ourselves.\n1. Technical Training.--Technical training at\npresent, whether in science or art, requires one or\nother of two conditions. Either a boy must be the\nson of well-to-do parents who can afford to keep\nhim while he acquires his education, or he must show\nso much ability at an early age as to enable him to\nsubsist on scholarships until he is ready to earn his\nliving. The former condition is, of course, a mere\nmatter of luck, and could not be preserved in its\npresent form under any kind of Socialism or Communism.\nThis loss is emphasized by defenders of the\npresent system, and no doubt it would be, to same\nextent, a real loss. But the well-to-do are a small\nproportion of the population, and presumably on the\naverage no more talented by nature than their less\nfortunate contemporaries. If the advantages which\nare enjoyed now by those few among them who are\ncapable of good work in science or art could be\nextended, even in a slightly attenuated form, to all\nwho are similarly gifted, the result would almost\ninfallibly be a gain, and much ability which is now\nwasted would be rendered fruitful. But how is this\nto be effected?\nThe system of scholarships obtained by competition,\nthough better than nothing, is objectionable\nfrom many points of view. It introduces the competitive\nspirit into the work of the very young; it\nmakes them regard knowledge from the standpoint\nof what is useful in examinations rather than in the\nlight of its intrinsic interest or importance; it places\na premium upon that sort of ability which is displayed\nprecociously in glib answers to set questions\nrather than upon the kind that broods on difficulties\nand remains for a time rather dumb. What is perhaps\nworse than any of these defects is the tendency\nto cause overwork in youth, leading to lack of vigor\nand interest when manhood has been reached. It\ncan hardly be doubted that by this cause, at present,\nmany fine minds have their edge blunted and their\nkeenness destroyed.\nState Socialism might easily universalize the\nsystem of scholarships obtained by competitive examination,\nand if it did so it is to he feared that it\nwould be very harmful. State Socialists at present\ntend to be enamored of the systems which is exactly\nof the kind that every bureaucrat loves: orderly,\nneat, giving a stimulus to industrious habits, and\ninvolving no waste of a sort that could be tabulated\nin statistics or accounts of public expenditure.\nSuch men will argue that free higher education is\nexpensive to the community, and only useful in the\ncase of those who have exceptional abilities; it\nought, therefore, they will say, not to be given to all,\nbut only to those who will become more useful members\nof society through receiving it. Such arguments\nmake a great appeal to what are called ``practical''\nmen, and the answers to them are of a sort which it\nis difficult to render widely convincing. Revolt\nagainst the evils of competition is, however, part\nof the very essence of the Socialist's protest against\nthe existing order, and on this ground, if on no other,\nthose who favor Socialism may be summoned to look\nfor some better solution.\nMuch the simplest solution, and the only really\neffective one, is to make every kind of education free\nup to the age of twenty-one for all boys and girls\nwho desire it. The majority will be tired of education\nbefore that age, and will prefer to begin other\nwork sooner; this will lead to a natural selection of\nthose with strong interests in some pursuit requiring\na long training. Among those selected in this way\nby their own inclinations, probably almost all tho\nhave marked abilities of the kind in question will be\nincluded. It is true that there will also be many\nwho have very little ability; the desire to become a\npainter, for example, is by no means confined to\nthose who can paint. But this degree of waste could\nwell be borne by the community; it would be immeasurably\nless than that now entailed by the support\nof the idle rich. Any system which aims at\navoiding this kind of waste must entail the far more\nserious waste of rejecting or spoiling some of the\nbest ability in each generation. The system of free\neducation up to any grade for all who desire it is\nthe only system which is consistent with the principles\nof liberty, and the only one which gives a reasonable\nhope of affording full scope for talent. This system\nis equally compatible with all forms of Socialism\nand Anarchism. Theoretically, it is compatible with\ncapitalism, but practically it is so opposite in spirit\nthat it would hardly be feasible without a complete\neconomic reconstruction. The fact that Socialism\nwould facilitate it must be reckoned a very powerful\nargument in favor of change, for the waste of talent\nat present in the poorer classes of society must be\nstupendous.\n2. Liberty to follow the creative impulse.--\nWhen a man's training has been completed, if he is\npossessed of really great abilities, he will do his best\nwork if he is completely free to follow his bent,\ncreating what seems good to him, regardless of the\njudgment of ``experts.'' At present this is only\npossible for two classes of people: those who have\nprivate means, and those who can earn a living by\nan occupation that does not absorb their whole\nenergies. Under Socialism, there will be no one with\nprivate means, and if there is to be no loss as\nregards art and science, the opportunity which now\ncomes by accident to a few will have to be provided\ndeliberately for a much larger number. The men\nwho have used private means as an opportunity for\ncreative work have been few but important: one\nmight mention Milton, Shelley, Keats and Darwin as\nexamples. Probably none of these would have produced\nas good work if they had had to earn their\nlivelihood. If Darwin had been a university teacher,\nhe would of course have been dismissed from his post\nby the influence of the clerics on account of his\nscandalous theories.\nNevertheless, the bulk of the creative work of the\nworld is done at present by men who subsist by\nsome other occupation. Science, and research generally,\nare usually done in their spare time by men\nwho live by teaching. There is no great objection to\nthis in the case of science, provided the number of\nhours devoted to teaching is not excessive. It is\npartly because science and teaching are so easily\ncombined that science is vigorous in the present age.\nIn music, a composer who is also a performer enjoys\nsimilar advantages, but one who is not a performer\nmust starve, unless he is rich or willing to pander to\nthe public taste. In the fine arts, as a rule, it is not\neasy in the modern world either to make a living by\nreally good work or to find a subsidiary profession\nwhich leaves enough leisure for creation. This is\npresumably one reason, though by no means the only\none, why art is less flourishing than science.\nThe bureaucratic State Socialist will have a\nsimple solution for these difficulties. He will appoint\na body consisting of the most eminent celebrities in\nan art or a science, whose business it shall be to judge\nthe work of young men, and to issue licenses to those\nwhose productions find favor in their eyes. A licensed\nartist shall be considered to have performed his duty\nto the community by producing works of art. But of\ncourse he will have to prove his industry by never\nfailing to produce in reasonable quantities, and his\ncontinued ability by never failing to please his\neminent judges--until, in the fulness of time, he\nbecomes a judge himself. In this way, the authorities\nwill insure that the artist shall be competent,\nregular, and obedient to the best traditions of his\nart. Those who fail to fulfil these conditions will be\ncompelled by the withdrawal of their license to seek\nsome less dubious mode of earning their living. Such\nwill be the ideal of the State Socialist.\nIn such a world all that makes life tolerable to\nthe lover of beauty would perish. Art springs from\na wild and anarchic side of human nature; between\nthe artist and the bureaucrat there must always be\na profound mutual antagonism, an age-long battle\nin which the artist, always outwardly worsted, wins\nin the end through the gratitude of mankind for the\njoy that he puts into their lives. If the wild side\nof human nature is to be permanently subjected to\nthe orderly rules of the benevolent, uncomprehending\nbureaucrat, the joy of life will perish out of the\nearth, and the very impulse to live will gradually\nwither and die. Better a thousandfold the present\nworld with all its horrors than such a dead mummy\nof a world. Better Anarchism, with all its risks,\nthan a State Socialism that subjects to rule what\nmust be spontaneous and free if it is to have any\nvalue. It is this nightmare that makes artists, and\nlovers of beauty generally, so often suspicious of\nSocialism. But there is nothing in the essence of\nSocialism to make art impossible: only certain forms\nof Socialism would entail this danger. William\nMorris was a Socialist, and was a Socialist very\nlargely because he was an artist. And in this he\nwas not irrational.\nIt is impossible for art, or any of the higher\ncreative activities, to flourish under any system which\nrequires that the artist shall prove his competence to\nsome body of authorities before he is allowed to follow\nhis impulse. Any really great artist is almost\nsure to be thought incompetent by those among his\nseniors who would be generally regarded as best\nqualified to form an opinion. And the mere fact of\nhaving to produce work which will please older men\nis hostile to a free spirit and to bold innovation.\nApart from this difficulty, selection by older men\nwould lead to jealousy and intrigue and back-biting,\nproducing a poisonous atmosphere of underground\ncompetition. The only effect of such a plan would be\nto eliminate the few who now slip through owing to\nsome fortunate accident. It is not by any system,\nbut by freedom alone, that art can flourish.\nThere are two ways by which the artist could\nsecure freedom under Socialism of the right kind.\nHe might undertake regular work outside his art,\ndoing only a few hours' work a day and receiving\nproportionately less pay than those who do a full\nday's work. He ought, in that case, to be at liberty\nto sell his pictures if he could find purchasers. Such\na system would have many advantages. It would\nleave absolutely every man free to become an artist,\nprovided he were willing to suffer a certain economic\nloss. This would not deter those in whom the impulse\nwas strong and genuine, but would tend to\nexclude the dilettante. Many young artists at\npresent endure voluntarily much greater poverty\nthan need be entailed by only doing half the usual\nday's work in a well-organized Socialist community;\nand some degree of hardship is not objectionable,\nas a test of the strength of the creative impulse, and\nas an offset to the peculiar joys of the creative life.\nThe other possibility[58] would be that the necessaries\nof life should be free, as Anarchists desire, to\nall equally, regardless of whether they work or not.\nUnder this plan, every man could live without work:\nthere would be what might be called a ``vagabond's\nwage,'' sufficient for existence but not for luxury.\nThe artist who preferred to have his whole time for\nart and enjoyment might live on the ``vagabond's\nwage''--traveling on foot when the humor seized him\nto see foreign countries, enjoying the air and the\nsun, as free as the birds, and perhaps scarcely less\nhappy. Such men would bring color and diversity\ninto the life of the community; their outlook would be\ndifferent from that of steady, stay-at-home workers,\nand would keep alive a much-needed element of light-\nheartedness which our sober, serious civilization tends\nto kill. If they became very numerous, they might\nbe too great an economic burden on the workers;\nbut I doubt if there are many with enough capacity\nfor simple enjoyments to choose poverty and free-\ndom in preference to the comparatively light and\npleasant work which will be usual in those days.\n[58] Which we discussed in Chapter IV.\nBy either of these methods, freedom can be preserved\nfor the artist in a socialistic commonwealth--\nfar more complete freedom, and far more widespread,\nthan any that now exists except for the possessors of\ncapital.\nBut there still remain some not altogether easy\nproblems. Take, for example, the publishing of books.\nThere will not, under Socialism, be private publishers\nas at present: under State Socialism, presumably the\nState will be the sole publisher, while under Syndicalism\nor Guild Socialism the Federation du Livre\nwill have the whole of the trade in its hands. Under\nthese circumstances, who is to decide what MSS. are\nto be printed? It is clear that opportunities exist\nfor an Index more rigorous than that of the Inquisition.\nIf the State were the sole publisher, it would\ndoubtless refuse books opposed to State Socialism.\nIf the Federation du Livre were the ultimate arbiter,\nwhat publicity could be obtained for works criticising\nit? And apart from such political difficulties\nwe should have, as regards literature, that\nvery censorship by eminent officials which we agreed\nto regard as disastrous when we were considering the\nfine arts in general. The difficulty is serious, and a\nway of meeting it must be found if literature is to\nremain free.\nKropotkin, who believes that manual and intellectual\nwork should be combined, holds that authors\nthemselves should be compositors, bookbinders, etc.\nHe even seems to suggest that the whole of the manual\nwork involved in producing books should be done by\nauthors. It may be doubted whether there are\nenough authors in the world for this to be possible,\nand in any case I cannot but think that it would\nbe a waste of time for them to leave the work they\nunderstand in order to do badly work which others\ncould do far better and more quickly. That, however,\ndoes not touch our present point, which is the\nquestion how the MSS. to be printed will be selected.\nIn Kropotkin's plan there will presumably be an\nAuthor's Guild, with a Committee of Management,\nif Anarchism allows such things. This Committee\nof Management will decide which of the books submitted\nto it are worthy to be printed. Among these\nwill be included those by the Committee and their\nfriends, but not those by their enemies. Authors\nof rejected MSS. will hardly have the patience to\nspend their time setting up the works of successful\nrivals, and there will have to be an elaborate system\nof log-rolling if any books are to be printed at all.\nIt hardly looks as if this plan would conduce to harmony\namong literary men, or would lead to the publication\nof any book of an unconventional tendency.\nKropotkin's own books, for example, would hardly\nhave found favor.\nThe only way of meeting these difficulties, whether\nunder State Socialism or Guild Socialism or Anarchism,\nseems to be by making it possible for an author\nto pay for the publication of his book if it is not\nsuch as the State or the Guild is willing to print at\nits own expense. I am aware that this method is contrary\nto the spirit of Socialism, but I do not see what\nother way there is of securing freedom. The payment\nmight be made by undertaking to engage for\nan assigned period in some work of recognized utility\nand to hand over such proportion of the earnings as\nmight be necessary. The work undertaken might\nof course be, as Kropotkin suggests, the manual part\nof the production of books, but I see no special reason\nwhy it should be. It would have to be an absolute\nrule that no book should be refused, no matter what\nthe nature of its contents might be, if payment for\npublication were offered at the standard rate. An\nauthor who had admirers would be able to secure their\nhelp in payment. An unknown author might, it is\ntrue, have to suffer a considerable loss of comfort\nin order to make his payment, but that would give\nan automatic means of eliminating those whose writing\nwas not the result of any very profound impulse\nand would be by no means wholly an evil.\nProbably some similar method would be desirable\nas regards the publishing and performing of new\nmusic.\nWhat we have been suggesting will, no doubt, be\nobjected to by orthodox Socialists, since they will find\nsomething repugnant to their principles in the whole\nidea of a private person paying to have certain\nwork done. But it is a mistake to be the slave of a\nsystem, and every system, if it is applied rigidly, will\nentail evils which could only be avoided by some\nconcession to the exigencies of special cases. On the\nwhole, a wise form of Socialism might afford infinitely\nbetter opportunities for the artist and the man of\nscience than are possible in a capitalist community,\nbut only if the form of Socialism adopted is one\nwhich is fitted for this end by means of provisions\nsuch as we have been suggesting.\n3. Possibility of Appreciation.--This condition\nis one which is not necessary to all who do creative\nwork, but in the sense in which I mean it the great\nmajority find it very nearly indispensable. I do not\nmean widespread public recognition, nor that ignorant,\nhalf-sincere respect which is commonly accorded\nto artists who have achieved success. Neither of\nthese serves much purpose. What I mean is rather\nunderstanding, and a spontaneous feeling that things\nof beauty are important. In a thoroughly commercialized\nsociety, an artist is respected if he makes\nmoney, and because he makes money, but there is no\ngenuine respect for the works of art by which his\nmoney has been made. A millionaire whose fortune\nhas been made in button-hooks or chewing-gum is\nregarded with awe, but none of this feeling is\nbestowed on the articles from which his wealth is\nderived. In a society which measures all things by\nmoney the same tends to be true of the artist. If he\nhas become rich he is respected, though of course\nless than the millionaire, but his pictures or books\nor music are regarded as the chewing-gum or the button-\nhooks are regarded, merely as a means to money.\nIn such an atmosphere it is very difficult for the artist\nto preserve his creative impulse pure: either he is\ncontaminated by his surroundings, or he becomes\nembittered through lack of appreciation for the object\nof his endeavor.\nIt is not appreciation of the artist that is necessary\nso much as appreciation of the art. It is difficult\nfor an artist to live in an environment in which\neverything is judged by its utility, rather than by its\nintrinsic quality. The whole side of life of which\nart is the flower requires something which may be\ncalled disinterestedness, a capacity for direct\nenjoyment without thought of tomorrow's problems and\ndifficulties. When people are amused by a joke they\ndo not need to be persuaded that it will serve some\nimportant purpose. The same kind of direct pleasure\nis involved in any genuine appreciation of art.\nThe struggle for life, the serious work of a trade or\nprofession, is apt to make people too solemn for\njokes and too pre-occupied for art. The easing of\nthe struggle, the diminution in the hours of work, and\nthe lightening of the burden of existence, which would\nresult from a better economic system, could hardly\nfail to increase the joy of life and the vital energy,\navailable for sheer delight in the world. And if this\nwere achieved there would inevitably be more spontaneous\npleasure in beautiful things, and more enjoyment\nof the work of artists. But none of these good\nresults are to be expected from the mere removal\nof poverty: they all require also a diffused sense of\nfreedom, and the absence of that feeling of oppression\nby a vast machine which now weighs down the individual\nspirit. I do not think State Socialism can give\nthis sense of freedom, but some other forms of Socialism,\nwhich have absorbed what is true in Anarchist\nteaching, can give it to a degree of which capitalism is\nwholly incapable.\nA general sense of progress and achievement is\nan immense stimulus to all forms of creative work.\nFor this reason, a great deal will depend, not only\nin material ways, upon the question whether methods\nof production in industry and agriculture become\nstereotyped or continue to change rapidly as they\nhave done during the last hundred years. Improved\nmethods of production will be much more obviously\nthan now to the interest of the community at large,\nwhen what every man receives is his due share of the\ntotal produce of labor. But there will probably not\nbe any individuals with the same direct and intense\ninterest in technical improvements as now belongs\nto the capitalist in manufacture. If the natural\nconservatism of the workers is not to prove stronger\nthan their interest in increasing production, it will\nbe necessary that, when better methods are introduced\nby the workers in any industry, part at least\nof the benefit should be allowed for a time to be\nretained by them. If this is done, it may be presumed\nthat each Guild will be continually seeking for new\nprocesses or inventions, and will value those technical\nparts of scientific research which are useful for this\npurpose. With every improvement, the question will\narise whether it is to be used to give more leisure or to\nincrease the dividend of commodities. Where there\nis so much more leisure than there is now, there will\nbe many more people with a knowledge of science or\nan understanding of art. The artist or scientific\ninvestigator will be far less cut off than he is at\npresent from the average citizen, and this will almost\ninevitably be a stimulus to his creative energy.\nI think we may fairly conclude that, from the\npoint of view of all three requisites for art and science,\nnamely, training, freedom and appreciation, State\nSocialism would largely fail to remove existing\nevils and would introduce new evils of its own; but\nGuild Socialism, or even Syndicalism, if it adopted\na liberal policy toward those who preferred to work\nless than the usual number of hours at recognized\noccupations, might be immeasurably preferable to\nanything that is possible under the rule of capitalism.\nThere are dangers, but they will all vanish if the\nimportance of liberty is adequately acknowledged.\nIn this as in nearly everything else, the road to all\nthat is best is the road of freedom.\nCHAPTER VIII\nTHE WORLD AS IT COULD BE MADE\nIN the daily lives of most men and women, fear\nplays a greater part than hope: they are more\nfilled with the thought of the possessions that others\nmay take from them, than of the joy that they might\ncreate in their own lives and in the lives with which\nthey come in contact.\nIt is not so that life should be lived.\nThose whose lives are fruitful to themselves, to\ntheir friends, or to the world are inspired by hope\nand sustained by joy: they see in imagination the\nthings that might be and the way in which they are\nto be brought into existence. In their private relations\nthey are not pre-occupied with anxiety lest\nthey should lose such affection and respect as they\nreceive: they are engaged in giving affection\nand respect freely, and the reward comes of\nitself without their seeking. In their work they\nare not haunted by jealousy of competitors, but\nconcerned with the actual matter that has to be done.\nIn politics, they do not spend time and passion defending\nunjust privileges of their class or nation, but\nthey aim at making the world as a whole happier, less\ncruel, less full of conflict between rival greeds, and\nmore full of human beings whose growth has not\nbeen dwarfed and stunted by oppression.\nA life lived in this spirit--the spirit that aims at\ncreating rather than possessing--has a certain\nfundamental happiness, of which it cannot be wholly\nrobbed by adverse circumstances. This is the way\nof life recommended in the Gospels, and by all the\ngreat teachers of the world. Those who have found\nit are freed from the tyranny of fear, since what they\nvalue most in their lives is not at the mercy of outside\npower. If all men could summon up the courage\nand the vision to live in this way in spite of obstacles\nand discouragement, there would be no need for the\nregeneration of the world to begin by political and\neconomic reform: all that is needed in the way of reform\nwould come automatically, without resistance,\nowing to the moral regeneration of individuals. But\nthe teaching of Christ has been nominally accepted\nby the world for many centuries, and yet those who\nfollow it are still persecuted as they were before the\ntime of Constantine. Experience has proved that\nfew are able to see through the apparent evils of an\noutcast's life to the inner joy that comes of faith\nand creative hope. If the domination of fear is to be\novercome, it is not enough, as regards the mass of\nmen, to preach courage and indifference to misfortune:\nit is necessary to remove the causes of fear,\nto make a good life no longer an unsuccessful one in\na worldly sense, and to diminish the harm that can\nbe inflicted upon those who are not wary in self-\ndefense.\nWhen we consider the evils in the lives we know\nof, we find that they may be roughly divided into\nthree classes. There are, first, those due to physical\nnature: among these are death, pain and the\ndifficulty of making the soil yield a subsistence.\nThese we will call ``physical evils.'' Second, we may\nput those that spring from defects in the character\nor aptitudes of the sufferer: among these are ignorance,\nlack of will, and violent passions. These we\nwill call ``evils of character.'' Third come those\nthat depend upon the power of one individual or\ngroup over another: these comprise not only obvious\ntyranny, but all interference with free development,\nwhether by force or by excessive mental influence\nsuch as may occur in education. These we will call\n``evils of power.'' A social system may be judged\nby its bearing upon these three kinds of evils.\nThe distinction between the three kinds cannot\nbe sharply drawn. Purely physical evil is a limit,\nwhich we can never be sure of having reached: we\ncannot abolish death, but we can often postpone it by\nscience, and it may ultimately become possible to\nsecure that the great majority shall live till old age;\nwe cannot wholly prevent pain, but we can diminish\nit indefinitely by securing a healthy life for all; we\ncannot make the earth yield its fruits in any abundance\nwithout labor, but we can diminish the amount\nof the labor and improve its conditions until it ceases\nto be an evil. Evils of character are often the result\nof physical evil in the shape of illness, and still more\noften the result of evils of power, since tyranny\ndegrades both those who exercise it and (as a rule)\nthose who suffer it. Evils of power are intensified\nby evils of character in those who have power, and by\nfear of the physical evil which is apt to be the lot of\nthose who have no power. For all these reasons, the\nthree sorts of evil are intertwined. Nevertheless,\nspeaking broadly, we may distinguish among our\nmisfortunes those which have their proximate cause in\nthe material world, those which are mainly due to\ndefects in ourselves, and those which spring from our\nbeing subject to the control of others.\nThe main methods of combating these evils are: for\nphysical evils, science; for evils of character, education\n(in the widest sense) and a free outlet for all\nimpulses that do not involve domination; for evils\nof power, the reform of the political and economic\norganization of society in such a way as to reduce\nto the lowest possible point the interference of one\nman with the life of another. We will begin with the\nthird of these kinds of evil, because it is evils of power\nspecially that Socialism and Anarchism have sought\nto remedy. Their protest against Inequalities of\nwealth has rested mainly upon their sense of the evils\narising from the power conferred by wealth. This\npoint has been well stated by Mr. G. D. H. Cole:--\nWhat, I want to ask, is the fundamental evil in our\nmodern Society which we should set out to abolish?\nThere are two possible answers to that question, and\nI am sure that very many well-meaning people would\nmake the wrong one. They would answer POVERTY,\nwhen they ought to answer SLAVERY. Face to face\nevery day with the shameful contrasts of riches and\ndestitution, high dividends and low wages, and painfully\nconscious of the futility of trying to adjust the balance\nby means of charity, private or public, they would answer\nunhesitatingly that they stand for the ABOLITION\nOF POVERTY.\nWell and good! On that issue every Socialist is with\nthem. But their answer to my question is none the less\nwrong.\nPoverty is the symptom: slavery the disease. The\nextremes of riches and destitution follow inevitably upon\nthe extremes of license and bondage. The many are not\nenslaved because they are poor, they are poor because\nthey are enslaved. Yet Socialists have all too often\nfixed their eyes upon the material misery of the poor\nwithout realizing that it rests upon the spiritual degradation\nof the slave.[59]\n[59] ``Self-Government in Industry,'' G. Bell & Sons, 1917, pp.\n110-111.\nI do not think any reasonable person can doubt\nthat the evils of power in the present system are\nvastly greater than is necessary, nor that they\nmight be immeasurably diminished by a suitable form\nof Socialism. A few fortunate people, it is true, are\nnow enabled to live freely on rent or interest, and\nthey could hardly have more liberty under another\nsystem. But the great bulk, not only of the very\npoor, but, of all sections of wage-earners and even\nof the professional classes, are the slaves of the need\nfor getting money. Almost all are compelled to\nwork so hard that they have little leisure for enjoyment\nor for pursuits outside their regular occupation.\nThose who are able to retire in later middle age are\nbored, because they have not learned how to fill\ntheir time when they are at liberty, and such interests\nas they once had apart from work have dried up.\nYet these are the exceptionally fortunate: the majority\nhave to work hard till old age, with the fear of\ndestitution always before them, the richer ones dreading\nthat they will be unable to give their children\nthe education or the medical care that they consider\ndesirable, the poorer ones often not far removed from\nstarvation. And almost all who work have no voice\nin the direction of their work; throughout the hours\nof labor they are mere machines carrying out the will\nof a master. Work is usually done under disagreeable\nconditions, involving pain and physical hardship.\nThe only motive to work is wages: the very idea that\nwork might be a joy, like the work of the artist, is\nusually scouted as utterly Utopian.\nBut by far the greater part of these evils are\nwholly unnecessary. If the civilized portion of mankind\ncould be induced to desire their own happiness\nmore than another's pain, if they could be induced to\nwork constructively for improvements which they\nwould share with all the world rather than destructively\nto prevent other classes or nations from stealing\na march on them, the whole system by which the\nworld's work is done might be reformed root and\nbranch within a generation.\nFrom the point of view of liberty, what system\nwould be the best? In what direction should we wish\nthe forces of progress to move?\nFrom this point of view, neglecting for the\nmoment all other considerations, I have no doubt that\nthe best system would be one not far removed from\nthat advocated by Kropotkin, but rendered more\npracticable by the adoption of the main principles of\nGuild Socialism. Since every point can be disputed,\nI will set down without argument the kind of organization\nof work that would seem best.\nEducation should be compulsory up to the age\nof 16, or perhaps longer; after that, it should be continued\nor not at the option of the pupil, but remain\nfree (for those who desire it) up to at least the age\nof 21. When education is finished no one should be\nCOMPELLED to work, and those who choose not to work\nshould receive a bare livelihood, and be left completely\nfree; but probably it would be desirable that there\nshould be a strong public opinion in favor of work,\nso that only comparatively few should choose idleness.\nOne great advantage of making idleness economically\npossible is that it would afford a powerful\nmotive for making work not disagreeable; and no\ncommunity where most work is disagreeable can be\nsaid to have found a solution of economic problems.\nI think it is reasonable to assume that few would\nchoose idleness, in view of the fact that even now at\nleast nine out of ten of those who have (say) 100 pounds\na year from investments prefer to increase their income\nby paid work.\nComing now to that great majority who will not\nchoose idleness, I think we may assume that, with the\nhelp of science, and by the elimination of the vast\namount of unproductive work involved in internal and\ninternational competition, the whole community\ncould be kept in comfort by means of four hours'\nwork a day. It is already being urged by experienced\nemployers that their employes can actually produce\nas much in a six-hour day as they can when they\nwork eight hours. In a world where there is a much\nhigher level of technical instruction than there is now\nthe same tendency will be accentuated. People will\nbe taught not only, as at present, one trade, or one\nsmall portion of a trade, but several trades, so that\nthey can vary their occupation according to the\nseasons and the fluctuations of demand. Every industry\nwill be self-governing as regards all its internal\naffairs, and even separate factories will decide for\nthemselves all questions that only concern those who\nwork in them. There will not be capitalist management,\nas at present, but management by elected representatives,\nas in politics. Relations between different\ngroups of producers will be settled by the Guild\nCongress, matters concerning the community as the\ninhabitants of a certain area will continue to be\ndecided by Parliament, while all disputes between\nParliament and the Guild Congress will be decided\nby a body composed of representatives of both in\nequal numbers.\nPayment will not be made, as at present, only for\nwork actually required and performed, but for willingness\nto work. This system is already adopted in\nmuch of the better paid work: a man occupies a certain\nposition, and retains it even at times when there\nhappens to be very little to do. The dread of unemployment\nand loss of livelihood will no longer haunt\nmen like a nightmare. Whether all who are willing\nto work will be paid equally, or whether exceptional\nskill will still command exceptional pay, is a matter\nwhich may be left to each guild to decide for itself.\nAn opera-singer who received no more pay than a\nscene-shifter might choose to be a scene-shifter until\nthe system was changed: if so, higher pay would\nprobably be found necessary. But if it were freely\nvoted by the Guild, it could hardly constitute a\ngrievance.\nWhatever might be done toward making work\nagreeable, it is to be presumed that some trades would\nalways remain unpleasant. Men could be attracted\ninto these by higher pay or shorter hours, instead of\nbeing driven into them by destitution. The community\nwould then have a strong economic motive\nfor finding ways of diminishing the disagreeableness\nof these exceptional trades.\nThere would still have to be money, or something\nanalogous to it, in any community such as we are\nimagining. The Anarchist plan of a free distribution\nof the total produce of work in equal shares\ndoes not get rid of the need for some standard of\nexchange value, since one man will choose to take his\nshare in one form and another in another. When\nthe day comes for distributing luxuries, old ladies\nwill not want their quota of cigars, nor young men\ntheir just proportion of lap-dog; this will make it\nnecessary to know how many cigars are the equivalent\nof one lap-dog. Much the simplest way is to\npay an income, as at present, and allow relative\nvalues to be adjusted according to demand. But if\nactual coin were paid, a man might hoard it and in\ntime become a capitalist. To prevent this, it would\nbe best to pay notes available only during a certain\nperiod, say one year from the date of issue. This\nwould enable a man to save up for his annual holiday,\nbut not to save indefinitely.\nThere is a very great deal to be said for the\nAnarchist plan of allowing necessaries, and all\ncommodities that can easily be produced in quantities\nadequate to any possible demand, to be given away\nfreely to all who ask for them, in any amounts they\nmay require. The question whether this plan should\nbe adopted is, to my mind, a purely technical one:\nwould it be, in fact, possible to adopt it without much\nwaste and consequent diversion of labor to the production\nof necessaries when it might be more usefully\nemployed otherwise? I have not the means of answering\nthis question, but I think it exceedingly probable\nthat, sooner or later, with the continued\nimprovement in the methods of production, this\nAnarchist plan will become feasible; and when it does,\nit certainly ought to be adopted.\nWomen in domestic work, whether married or unmarried,\nwill receive pay as they would if they were\nin industry. This will secure the complete economic\nindependence of wives, which is difficult to achieve\nin any other way, since mothers of young children\nought not to be expected to work outside the home.\nThe expense of children will not fall, as at present,\non the parents. They will receive, like adults,\ntheir share of necessaries, and their education will\nbe free.[60] There is no longer to be the present\ncompetition for scholarships among the abler children:\nthey will not be imbued with the competitive spirit\nfrom infancy, or forced to use their brains to an\nunnatural degree with consequent listlessness and lack\nof health in later life. Education will be far more\ndiversified than at present; greater care will be taken\nto adapt it to the needs of different types of young\npeople. There will be more attempt to encourage\ninitiative young pupils, and less desire to fill their\nminds with a set of beliefs and mental habits regarded\nas desirable by the State, chiefly because they help\nto preserve the status quo. For the great majority\nof children it will probably be found desirable to\nhave much more outdoor education in the country.\nAnd for older boys and girls whose interests are not\nintellectual or artistic, technical education, undertaken\nin a liberal spirit, is far more useful in promoting\nmental activity than book-learning which they\nregard (however falsely) as wholly useless except for\npurposes of examination. The really useful educa-\ntion is that which follows the direction of the child's\nown instinctive interests, supplying knowledge for\nwhich it is seeking, not dry, detailed information\nwholly out of relation to its spontaneous desires.\n[60] Some may fear that the result would be an undue increase\nof population, but such fears I believe to be groundless. See\nabove, (Chapter IV, on ``Work and Pay.'' Also, Chapter vi of\n``Principles of Social Reconstruction'' (George Allen and\nUnwin, Ltd.).\nGovernment and law will still exist in our\ncommunity, but both will be reduced to a minimum.\nThere will still be acts which will be forbidden--for\nexample, murder. But very nearly the whole of that\npart of the criminal law which deals with property\nwill have become obsolete, and many of the motives\nwhich now produce murders will be no longer operative.\nThose who nevertheless still do commit crimes\nwill not be blamed or regarded as wicked; they will\nbe regarded as unfortunate, and kept in some kind\nof mental hospital until it is thought that they are\nno longer a danger. By education and freedom and\nthe abolition of private capital the number of crimes\ncan be made exceedingly small. By the method of\nindividual curative treatment it will generally be\npossible to secure that a man's first offense shall also\nbe his last, except in the case of lunatics and the\nfeeble-minded, for whom of course a more prolonged\nbut not less kindly detention may be necessary.\nGovernment may be regarded as consisting of\ntwo parts: the one, the decisions of the community\nor its recognized organs; the other, the enforcing of\nthose decisions upon all who resist them. The first\npart is not objected to by Anarchists. The second\npart, in an ordinary civilized State, may remain\nentirely in the background: those who have resisted\na new law while it was being debated will, as a rule,\nsubmit to it when it is passed, because resistance is\ngenerally useless in a settled and orderly community.\nBut the possibility of governmental force remains,\nand indeed is the very reason for the submission which\nmakes force unnecessary. If, as Anarchists desire,\nthere were no use of force by government, the majority\ncould still band themselves together and use\nforce against the minority. The only difference\nwould be that their army or their police force would\nbe ad hoc, instead of being permanent and professional.\nThe result of this would be that everyone\nwould have to learn how to fight, for fear a well-\ndrilled minority should seize power and establish an\nold-fashioned oligarchic State. Thus the aim of the\nAnarchists seems hardly likely to be achieved by\nthe methods which they advocate.\nThe reign of violence in human affairs, whether\nwithin a country or in its external relations, can only\nbe prevented, if we have not been mistaken, by an\nauthority able to declare all use of force except by\nitself illegal, and strong enough to be obviously\ncapable of making all other use of force futile, except\nwhen it could secure the support of public opinion as\na defense of freedom or a resistance to injustice.\nSuch an authority exists within a country: it is the\nState. But in international affairs it remains to be\ncreated. The difficulties are stupendous, but they must\nbe overcome if the world is to be saved from periodical\nwars, each more destructive than any of its predecessors.\nWhether, after this war, a League of Nations\nwill be formed, and will be capable of performing this\ntask, it is as yet impossible to foretell. However that\nmay be, some method of preventing wars will have to\nbe established before our Utopia becomes possible.\nWhen once men BELIEVE that the world is safe from\nwar, the whole difficulty will be solved: there will then\nno longer be any serious resistance to the disbanding\nof national armies and navies, and the substitution\nfor them of a small international force for protection\nagainst uncivilized races. And when that stage has\nbeen reached, peace will be virtually secure.\nThe practice of government by majorities, which\nAnarchists criticise, is in fact open to most of the\nobjections which they urge against it. Still more\nobjectionable is the power of the executive in matters\nvitally affecting the happiness of all, such as\npeace and war. But neither can be dispensed with\nsuddenly. There are, however, two methods of diminishing\nthe harm done by them: (1) Government by\nmajorities can be made less oppressive by devolution,\nby placing the decision of questions primarily affecting\nonly a section of the community in the hands of\nthat section, rather than of a Central Chamber. In\nthis way, men are no longer forced to submit to decisions\nmade in a hurry by people mostly ignorant of\nthe matter in hand and not personally interested.\nAutonomy for internal affairs should be given, not\nonly to areas, but to all groups, such as industries or\nChurches, which have important common interests\nnot shared by the rest of the community. (2) The\ngreat powers vested in the executive of a modern\nState are chiefly due to the frequent need of rapid\ndecisions, especially as regards foreign affairs. If\nthe danger of war were practically eliminated, more\ncumbrous but less autocratic methods would be possible,\nand the Legislature might recover many of the\npowers which the executive has usurped. By these\ntwo methods, the intensity of the interference with\nliberty involved in government can be gradually\ndiminished. Some interference, and even some danger\nof unwarranted and despotic interference, is of the\nessence of government, and must remain so long as\ngovernment remains. But until men are less prone\nto violence than they are now, a certain degree of\ngovernmental force seems the lesser of two evils. We\nmay hope, however, that if once the danger of war is\nat an end, men's violent impulses will gradually grow\nless, the more so as, in that case, it will be possible\nto diminish enormously the individual power which\nnow makes rulers autocratic and ready for almost\nany act of tyranny in order to crush opposition. The\ndevelopment of a world where even governmental\nforce has become unnecessary (except against lunatics)\nmust be gradual. But as a gradual process it\nis perfectly possible; and when it has been completed\nwe may hope to see the principles of Anarchism\nembodied in the management of communal affairs.\nHow will the economic and political system that\nwe have outlined bear on the evils of character? I\nbelieve the effect will be quite extraordinarily\nbeneficent.\nThe process of leading men's thought and imagination\naway from the use of force will be greatly\naccelerated by the abolition of the capitalist system,\nprovided it is not succeeded by a form of State Socialism\nin which officials have enormous power. At present,\nthe capitalist has more control over the lives of\nothers than any man ought to have; his friends have\nauthority in the State; his economic power is the\npattern for political power. In a world where all men\nand women enjoy economic freedom, there will not be\nthe same habit of command, nor, consequently, the\nsame love of despotism; a gentler type of character\nthan that now prevalent will gradually grow up. Men\nare formed by their circumstances, not born ready-\nmade. The bad effect of the present economic system\non character, and the immensely better effect to be\nexpected from communal ownership, are among the\nstrongest reasons for advocating the change.\nIn the world as we have been imagining fit, economic\nfear and most economic hope will be alike\nremoved out of life. No one will be haunted by the\ndread of poverty or driven into ruthlessness by the\nhope of wealth. There will not be the distinction of\nsocial classes which now plays such an immense part\nin life. The unsuccessful professional man will not\nlive in terror lest his children should sink in the scale;\nthe aspiring employe will not be looking forward to\nthe day when he can become a sweater in his turn.\nAmbitious young men will have to dream other daydreams\nthan that of business success and wealth\nwrung out of the ruin of competitors and the degradation\nof labor. In such a world, most of the nightmares\nthat lurk in the background of men's minds\nwill no longer exist; on the other hand, ambition and\nthe desire to excel will have to take nobler forms than\nthose that are encouraged by a commercial society.\nAll those activities that really confer benefits upon\nmankind will be open, not only to the fortunate few,\nbut to all who have sufficient ambition and native\naptitude. Science, labor-saving inventions, technical\nprogress of all kinds, may be confidently expected to\nflourish far more than at present, since they will be\nthe road to honor, and honor will have to replace\nmoney among those of the young who desire to\nachieve success. Whether art will flourish in a\nSocialistic community depends upon the form of Social-\nism adopted; if the State, or any public authority,\n(no matter what), insists upon controlling art, and\nonly licensing those whom it regards as proficient, the\nresult will be disaster. But if there is real freedom,\nallowing every man who so desires to take up an\nartist's career at the cost of some sacrifice of comfort,\nit is likely that the atmosphere of hope, and\nthe absence of economic compulsion, will lead to a\nmuch smaller waste of talent than is involved in our\npresent system, and to a much less degree of crushing\nof impulse in the mills of the struggle for life.\nWhen elementary needs have been satisfied, the\nserious happiness of most men depends upon two\nthings: their work, and their human relations. In the\nworld that we have been picturing, work will be free,\nnot excessive, full of the interest that belongs to a\ncollective enterprise in which there is rapid progress,\nwith something of the delight of creation even for\nthe humblest unit. And in human relations the gain\nwill be just as great as in work. The only human\nrelations that have value are those that are rooted in\nmutual freedom, where there is no domination and no\nslavery, no tie except affection, no economic or\nconventional necessity to preserve the external show when\nthe inner life is dead. One of the most horrible\nthings about commercialism is the way in which it\npoisons the relations of men and women. The evils of\nprostitution are generally recognized, but, great as\nthey are, the effect of economic conditions on marriage\nseems to me even worse. There is not infrequently,\nin marriage, a suggestion of purchase, of acquiring\na woman on condition of keeping her in a certain\nstandard of material comfort. Often and often, a\nmarriage hardly differs from prostitution except by\nbeing harder to escape from. The whole basis of\nthese evils is economic. Economic causes make marriage\na matter of bargain and contract, in which\naffection is quite secondary, and its absence constitutes\nno recognized reason for liberation. Marriage\nshould be a free, spontaneous meeting of mutual\ninstinct, filled with happiness not unmixed with a\nfeeling akin to awe: it should involve that degree of\nrespect of each for the other that makes even the\nmost trifling interference with liberty an utter\nimpossibility, and a common life enforced by one against\nthe will of the other an unthinkable thing of deep\nhorror. It is not so that marriage is conceived by\nlawyers who make settlements, or by priests who give\nthe name of ``sacrament'' to an institution which pretends\nto find something sanctifiable in the brutal lusts\nor drunken cruelties of a legal husband. It is not in\na spirit of freedom that marriage is conceived by\nmost men and women at present: the law makes it an\nopportunity for indulgence of the desire to interfere,\nwhere each submits to some loss of his or her own liberty,\nfor the pleasure of curtailing the liberty of the\nother. And the atmosphere of private property\nmakes it more difficult than it otherwise would be for\nany better ideal to take root.\nIt is not so that human relations will be conceived\nwhen the evil heritage of economic slavery has ceased\nto mold our instincts. Husbands and wives, parents\nand children, will be only held together by affection:\nwhere that has died, it will be recognized that nothing\nworth preserving is left. Because affection will\nbe free, men and women will not find in private life an\noutlet and stimulus to the love of domineering, but all\nthat is creative in their love will have the freer scope.\nReverence for whatever makes the soul in those who\nare loved will be less rare than it is now: nowadays,\nmany men love their wives in the way in which they\nlove mutton, as something to devour and destroy.\nBut in the love that goes with reverence there is a\njoy of quite another order than any to be found by\nmastery, a joy which satisfies the spirit and not only\nthe instincts; and satisfaction of instinct and spirit\nat once is necessary to a happy life, or indeed to any\nexistence that is to bring out the best impulses of\nwhich a man or woman is capable.\nIn the world which we should wish to see, there\nwill be more joy of life than in the drab tragedy of\nmodern every-day existence. After early youth, as\nthings are, most men are bowed down by forethought,\nno longer capable of light-hearted gaiety, but only of\na kind of solemn jollification by the clock at the\nappropriate hours. The advice to ``become as little\nchildren'' would be good for many people in many\nrespects, but it goes with another precept, ``take no\nthought for the morrow,'' which is hard to obey in a\ncompetitive world. There is often in men of science,\neven when they are quite old, something of the\nsimplicity of a child: their absorption in abstract\nthought has held them aloof from the world, and\nrespect for their work has led the world to keep them\nalive in spite of their innocence. Such men have\nsucceeded in living as all men ought to be able to live;\nbut as things are, the economic struggle makes their\nway of life impossible for the great majority.\nWhat are we to say, lastly, of the effect of our\nprojected world upon physical evil? Will there be\nless illness than there is at present? Will the produce\nof a given amount of labor be greater? Or will population\npress upon the limits of subsistence, as Malthus\ntaught in order to refute Godwin's optimism?\nI think the answer to all these questions turns,\nin the end, upon the degree of intellectual vigor to be\nexpected in a community which has done away with\nthe spur of economic competition. Will men in such\na world become lazy and apathetic? Will they cease\nto think? Will those who do think find themselves\nconfronted with an even more impenetrable wall of\nunreflecting conservatism than that which confronts\nthem at present? These are important questions; for\nit is ultimately to science that mankind must look\nfor their success in combating physical evils.\nIf the other conditions that we have postulated\ncan be realized, it seems almost certain that there\nmust be less illness than there is at present. Population\nwill no longer be congested in slums; children will\nhave far more of fresh air and open country; the\nhours of work will be only such as are wholesome, not\nexcessive and exhausting as they are at present.\nAs for the progress of science, that depends very\nlargely upon the degree of intellectual liberty existing\nin the new society. If all science is organized and\nsupervised by the State, it will rapidly become\nstereotyped and dead. Fundamental advances will not be\nmade, because, until they have been made, they will\nseem too doubtful to warrant the expenditure of\npublic money upon them. Authority will be in the\nhands of the old, especially of men who have achieved\nscientific eminence; such men will be hostile to those\namong the young who do not flatter them by agreeing\nwith their theories. Under a bureaucratic State\nSocialism it is to be feared that science would soon\ncease to be progressive and acquired a medieval respect\nfor authority.\nBut under a freer system, which would enable all\nkinds of groups to employ as many men of science as\nthey chose, and would allow the ``vagabond's wage''\nto those who desired to pursue some study so new as\nto be wholly unrecognized, there is every reason to\nthink that science would flourish as it has never done\nhitherto.[61] And, if that were the case, I do not believe\nthat any other obstacle would exist to the physical\npossibility of our system.\n[61] See the discussion of this question in the preceding chapter.\nThe question of the number of hours of work\nnecessary to produce general material comfort is\npartly technical, partly one of organization. We\nmay assume that there would no longer be unproductive\nlabor spent on armaments, national defense,\nadvertisements, costly luxuries for the very rich, or\nany of the other futilities incidental to our competitive\nsystem. If each industrial guild secured for a term of\nyears the advantages, or part of the advantages, of\nany new invention or methods which it introduced, it\nis pretty certain that every encouragement would be\ngiven to technical progress. The life of a discoverer\nor inventor is in itself agreeable: those who adopt it,\nas things are now, are seldom much actuated by economic\nmotives, but rather by the interest of the work\ntogether with the hope of honor; and these motives\nwould operate more widely than they do now, since\nfewer people would be prevented from obeying them\nby economic necessities. And there is no doubt that\nintellect would work more keenly and creatively in\na world where instinct was less thwarted, where the\njoy of life was greater, and where consequently there\nwould be more vitality in men than there is at present.\nThere remains the population question, which,\never since the time of Malthus, has been the last\nrefuge of those to whom the possibility of a better\nworld is disagreeable. But this question is now\na very different one from what it was a hundred\nyears ago. The decline of the birth-rate in all\ncivilized countries, which is pretty certain to continue,\nwhatever economic system is adopted, suggests\nthat, especially when the probable effects of the war\nare taken into account, the population of Western\nEurope is not likely to increase very much beyond\nits present level, and that of America is likely only to\nincrease through immigration. Negroes may continue\nto increase in the tropics, but are not likely to\nbe a serious menace to the white inhabitants of temperate\nregions. There remains, of course, the Yellow\nPeril; but by the time that begins to be serious\nit is quite likely that the birth-rate will also have\nbegun to decline among the races of Asia If not,\nthere are other means of dealing with this question;\nand in any case the whole matter is too conjectural\nto be set up seriously as a bar to our hopes. I conclude\nthat, though no certain forecast is possible,\nthere is not any valid reason for regarding the possible\nincrease of population as a serious obstacle to\nSocialism.\nOur discussion has led us to the belief that the\ncommunal ownership of land and capital, which constitutes\nthe characteristic doctrine of Socialism and\nAnarchist Communism, is a necessary step toward the\nremoval of the evils from which the world suffers at\npresent and the creation of such a society as any\nhumane man must wish to see realized. But, though\na necessary step, Socialism alone is by no means\nsufficient. There are various forms of Socialism: the\nform in which the State is the employer, and all who\nwork receive wages from it, involves dangers of\ntyranny and interference with progress which would\nmake it, if possible, even worse than the present\nregime. On the other hand, Anarchism, which avoids\nthe dangers of State Socialism, has dangers and\ndifficulties of its own, which make it probable that,\nwithin any reasonable period of time, it could not\nlast long even if it were established. Nevertheless, it\nremains an ideal to which we should wish to approach\nas nearly as possible, and which, in some distant age,\nwe hope may be reached completely. Syndicalism\nshares many of the defects of Anarchism, and, like it,\nwould prove unstable, since the need of a central\ngovernment would make itself felt almost at once.\nThe system we have advocated is a form of Guild\nSocialism, leaning more, perhaps, towards Anarchism\nthan the official Guildsman would wholly approve. It\nis in the matters that politicians usually ignore--\nscience and art, human relations, and the joy of life\n--that Anarchism is strongest, and it is chiefly for the\nsake of these things that we included such more or\nless Anarchist proposals as the ``vagabond's wage.''\nIt is by its effects outside economics and politics, at\nleast as much as by effects inside them, that a social\nsystem should be judged. And if Socialism ever\ncomes, it is only likely to prove beneficent if non-\neconomic goods are valued and consciously pursued.\nThe world that we must seek is a world in which\nthe creative spirit is alive, in which life is an adventure\nfull of joy and hope, based rather upon the impulse\nto construct than upon the desire to retain\nwhat we possess or to seize what is possessed by\nothers. It must be a world in which affection has free\nplay, in which love is purged of the instinct for\ndomination, in which cruelty and envy have been\ndispelled by happiness and the unfettered development\nof all the instincts that build up life and fill it with\nmental delights. Such a world is possible; it waits\nonly for men to wish to create it.\nMeantime, the world in which we exist has other\naims.

The times through which we are passing have\nafforded to many of us a confirmation of our faith.  We see that the\nthings we had thought evil are really evil, and we know more\ndefinitely than we ever did before the directions in which men must\nmove if a better world is to arise on the ruins of the one which is\nnow hurling itself into destruction.  We see that men's political\ndealings with one another are based on wholly wrong ideals, and can\nonly be saved by quite different ideals from continuing to be a source\nof suffering, devastation, and sin.\nPolitical ideals must be based upon ideals for the individual life.\nThe aim of politics should be to make the lives of individuals as good\nas possible.  There is nothing for the politician to consider outside\nor above the various men, women, and children who compose the world.\nThe problem of politics is to adjust the relations of human beings in\nsuch a way that each severally may have as much of good in his\nexistence as possible.  And this problem requires that we should first\nconsider what it is that we think good in the individual life.\nTo begin with, we do not want all men to be alike.  We do not want to\nlay down a pattern or type to which men of all sorts are to be made by\nsome means or another to approximate.  This is the ideal of the\nimpatient administrator.  A bad teacher will aim at imposing his\nopinion, and turning out a set of pupils all of whom will give the\nsame definite answer on a doubtful point.  Mr. Bernard Shaw is said to\nhold that _Troilus and Cressida_ is the best of Shakespeare's plays.\nAlthough I disagree with this opinion, I should welcome it in a pupil\nas a sign of individuality; but most teachers would not tolerate such\na heterodox view.  Not only teachers, but all commonplace persons in\nauthority, desire in their subordinates that kind of uniformity which\nmakes their actions easily predictable and never inconvenient.  The\nresult is that they crush initiative and individuality when they can,\nand when they cannot, they quarrel with it.\nIt is not one ideal for all men, but a separate ideal for each\nseparate man, that has to be realized if possible.  Every man has it\nin his being to develop into something good or bad: there is a best\npossible for him, and a worst possible.  His circumstances will\ndetermine whether his capacities for good are developed or crushed,\nand whether his bad impulses are strengthened or gradually diverted\ninto better channels.\nBut although we cannot set up in any detail an ideal of character\nwhich is to be universally applicable--although we cannot say, for\ninstance, that all men ought to be industrious, or self-sacrificing,\nor fond of music--there are some broad principles which can be used to\nguide our estimates as to what is possible or desirable.\nWe may distinguish two sorts of goods, and two corresponding sorts of\nimpulses.  There are goods in regard to which individual possession is\npossible, and there are goods in which all can share alike.  The food\nand clothing of one man is not the food and clothing of another; if\nthe supply is insufficient, what one man has is obtained at the\nexpense of some other man.  This applies to material goods generally,\nand therefore to the greater part of the present economic life of the\nworld.  On the other hand, mental and spiritual goods do not belong to\none man to the exclusion of another.  If one man knows a science, that\ndoes not prevent others from knowing it; on the contrary, it helps\nthem to acquire the knowledge.  If one man is a great artist or poet,\nthat does not prevent others from painting pictures or writing poems,\nbut helps to create the atmosphere in which such things are possible.\nIf one man is full of good-will toward others, that does not mean that\nthere is less good-will to be shared among the rest; the more\ngood-will one man has, the more he is likely to create among others.\nIn such matters there is no _possession_, because there is not a\ndefinite amount to be shared; any increase anywhere tends to produce\nan increase everywhere.\nThere are two kinds of impulses, corresponding to the two kinds of\ngoods.  There are _possessive_ impulses, which aim at acquiring or\nretaining private goods that cannot be shared; these center in the\nimpulse of property.  And there are _creative_ or constructive impulses,\nwhich aim at bringing into the world or making available for use the\nkind of goods in which there is no privacy and no possession.\nThe best life is the one in which the creative impulses play the\nlargest part and the possessive impulses the smallest.  This is no new\ndiscovery.  The Gospel says: \"Take no thought, saying, What shall we\neat? or What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?\"\nThe thought we give to these things is taken away from matters of more\nimportance.  And what is worse, the habit of mind engendered by\nthinking of these things is a bad one; it leads to competition, envy,\ndomination, cruelty, and almost all the moral evils that infest the\nworld.  In particular, it leads to the predatory use of force.\nMaterial possessions can be taken by force and enjoyed by the robber.\nSpiritual possessions cannot be taken in this way.  You may kill an\nartist or a thinker, but you cannot acquire his art or his thought.\nYou may put a man to death because he loves his fellow-men, but you\nwill not by so doing acquire the love which made his happiness.  Force\nis impotent in such matters; it is only as regards material goods that\nit is effective.  For this reason the men who believe in force are the\nmen whose thoughts and desires are preoccupied with material goods.\nThe possessive impulses, when they are strong, infect activities which\nought to be purely creative.  A man who has made some valuable\ndiscovery may be filled with jealousy of a rival discoverer.  If one\nman has found a cure for cancer and another has found a cure for\nconsumption, one of them may be delighted if the other man's discovery\nturns out a mistake, instead of regretting the suffering of patients\nwhich would otherwise have been avoided.  In such cases, instead of\ndesiring knowledge for its own sake, or for the sake of its\nusefulness, a man is desiring it as a means to reputation.  Every\ncreative impulse is shadowed by a possessive impulse; even the\naspirant to saintliness may be jealous of the more successful saint.\nMost affection is accompanied by some tinge of jealousy, which is a\npossessive impulse intruding into the creative region.  Worst of all,\nin this direction, is the sheer envy of those who have missed\neverything worth having in life, and who are instinctively bent on\npreventing others from enjoying what they have not had.  There is\noften much of this in the attitude of the old toward the young.\nThere is in human beings, as in plants and animals, a certain natural\nimpulse of growth, and this is just as true of mental as of physical\ndevelopment.  Physical development is helped by air and nourishment\nand exercise, and may be hindered by the sort of treatment which made\nChinese women's feet small.  In just the same way mental development\nmay be helped or hindered by outside influences.  The outside\ninfluences that help are those that merely provide encouragement or\nmental food or opportunities for exercising mental faculties.  The\ninfluences that hinder are those that interfere with growth by\napplying any kind of force, whether discipline or authority or fear or\nthe tyranny of public opinion or the necessity of engaging in some\ntotally incongenial occupation.  Worst of all influences are those\nthat thwart or twist a man's fundamental impulse, which is what shows\nitself as conscience in the moral sphere; such influences are likely\nto do a man an inward danger from which he will never recover.\nThose who realize the harm that can be done to others by any use of\nforce against them, and the worthlessness of the goods that can be\nacquired by force, will be very full of respect for the liberty of\nothers; they will not try to bind them or fetter them; they will be\nslow to judge and swift to sympathize; they will treat every human\nbeing with a kind of tenderness, because the principle of good in him\nis at once fragile and infinitely precious.  They will not condemn\nthose who are unlike themselves; they will know and feel that\nindividuality brings differences and uniformity means death.  They\nwill wish each human being to be as much a living thing and as little\na mechanical product as it is possible to be; they will cherish in\neach one just those things which the harsh usage of a ruthless world\nwould destroy.  In one word, all their dealings with others will be\ninspired by a deep impulse of _reverence_.\nWhat we shall desire for individuals is now clear: strong creative\nimpulses, overpowering and absorbing the instinct of possession;\nreverence for others; respect for the fundamental creative impulse in\nourselves.  A certain kind of self-respect or native pride is\nnecessary to a good life; a man must not have a sense of utter inward\ndefeat if he is to remain whole, but must feel the courage and the\nhope and the will to live by the best that is in him, whatever outward\nor inward obstacles it may encounter.  So far as it lies in a man's\nown power, his life will realize its best possibilities if it has\nthree things: creative rather than possessive impulses, reverence for\nothers, and respect for the fundamental impulse in himself.\nPolitical and social institutions are to be judged by the good or harm\nthat they do to individuals.  Do they encourage creativeness rather\nthan possessiveness?  Do they embody or promote a spirit of reverence\nbetween human beings?  Do they preserve self-respect?\nIn all these ways the institutions under which we live are very far\nindeed from what they ought to be.\nInstitutions, and especially economic systems, have a profound\ninfluence in molding the characters of men and women.  They may\nencourage adventure and hope, or timidity and the pursuit of safety.\nThey may open men's minds to great possibilities, or close them\nagainst everything but the risk of obscure misfortune.  They may make\na man's happiness depend upon what he adds to the general possessions\nof the world, or upon what he can secure for himself of the private\ngoods in which others cannot share.  Modern capitalism forces the\nwrong decision of these alternatives upon all who are not heroic or\nexceptionally fortunate.\nMen's impulses are molded, partly by their native disposition, partly\nby opportunity and environment, especially early environment.  Direct\npreaching can do very little to change impulses, though it can lead\npeople to restrain the direct expression of them, often with the\nresult that the impulses go underground and come to the surface again\nin some contorted form.  When we have discovered what kinds of impulse\nwe desire, we must not rest content with preaching, or with trying to\nproduce the outward manifestation without the inner spring; we must\ntry rather to alter institutions in the way that will, of itself,\nmodify the life of impulse in the desired direction.\nAt present our institutions rest upon two things: property and power.\nBoth of these are very unjustly distributed; both, in the actual\nworld, are of great importance to the happiness of the individual.\nBoth are possessive goods; yet without them many of the goods in which\nall might share are hard to acquire as things are now.\nWithout property, as things are, a man has no freedom, and no security\nfor the necessities of a tolerable life; without power, he has no\nopportunity for initiative.  If men are to have free play for their\ncreative impulses, they must be liberated from sordid cares by a\ncertain measure of security, and they must have a sufficient share of\npower to be able to exercise initiative as regards the course and\nconditions of their lives.\nFew men can succeed in being creative rather than possessive in a\nworld which is wholly built on competition, where the great majority\nwould fall into utter destitution if they became careless as to the\nacquisition of material goods, where honor and power and respect are\ngiven to wealth rather than to wisdom, where the law embodies and\nconsecrates the injustice of those who have toward those who have not.\nIn such an environment even those whom nature has endowed with great\ncreative gifts become infected with the poison of competition.  Men\ncombine in groups to attain more strength in the scramble for material\ngoods, and loyalty to the group spreads a halo of quasi-idealism round\nthe central impulse of greed.  Trade-unions and the Labor party are no\nmore exempt from this vice than other parties and other sections of\nsociety; though they are largely inspired by the hope of a radically\nbetter world.  They are too often led astray by the immediate object\nof securing for themselves a large share of material goods.  That this\ndesire is in accordance with justice, it is impossible to deny; but\nsomething larger and more constructive is needed as a political ideal,\nif the victors of to-morrow are not to become the oppressors of the\nday after.  The inspiration and outcome of a reforming movement ought\nto be freedom and a generous spirit, not niggling restrictions and\nregulations.\nThe present economic system concentrates initiative in the hands of a\nsmall number of very rich men.  Those who are not capitalists have,\nalmost always, very little choice as to their activities when once\nthey have selected a trade or profession; they are not part of the\npower that moves the mechanism, but only a passive portion of the\nmachinery.  Despite political democracy, there is still an\nextraordinary degree of difference in the power of self-direction\nbelonging to a capitalist and to a man who has to earn his living.\nEconomic affairs touch men's lives, at most times, much more\nintimately than political questions.  At present the man who has no\ncapital usually has to sell himself to some large organization, such\nas a railway company, for example.  He has no voice in its management,\nand no liberty in politics except what his trade-union can secure for\nhim.  If he happens to desire a form of liberty which is not thought\nimportant by his trade-union, he is powerless; he must submit or\nstarve.\nExactly the same thing happens to professional men.  Probably a\nmajority of journalists are engaged in writing for newspapers whose\npolitics they disagree with; only a man of wealth can own a large\nnewspaper, and only an accident can enable the point of view or the\ninterests of those who are not wealthy to find expression in a\nnewspaper.  A large part of the best brains of the country are in the\ncivil service, where the condition of their employment is silence\nabout the evils which cannot be concealed from them.  A Nonconformist\nminister loses his livelihood if his views displease his congregation;\na member of Parliament loses his seat if he is not sufficiently supple\nor sufficiently stupid to follow or share all the turns and twists of\npublic opinion.  In every walk of life, independence of mind is\npunished by failure, more and more as economic organizations grow\nlarger and more rigid.  Is it surprising that men become increasingly\ndocile, increasingly ready to submit to dictation and to forego the\nright of thinking for themselves?  Yet along such lines civilization\ncan only sink into a Byzantine immobility.\nFear of destitution is not a motive out of which a free creative life\ncan grow, yet it is the chief motive which inspires the daily work of\nmost wage-earners.  The hope of possessing more wealth and power than\nany man ought to have, which is the corresponding motive of the rich,\nis quite as bad in its effects; it compels men to close their minds\nagainst justice, and to prevent themselves from thinking honestly on\nsocial questions while in the depths of their hearts they uneasily\nfeel that their pleasures are bought by the miseries of others.  The\ninjustices of destitution and wealth alike ought to be rendered\nimpossible.  Then a great fear would be removed from the lives of the\nmany, and hope would have to take on a better form in the lives of the\nfew.\nBut security and liberty are only the negative conditions for good\npolitical institutions.  When they have been won, we need also the\npositive condition: encouragement of creative energy.  Security alone\nmight produce a smug and stationary society; it demands creativeness\nas its counterpart, in order to keep alive the adventure and interest\nof life, and the movement toward perpetually new and better things.\nThere can be no final goal for human institutions; the best are those\nthat most encourage progress toward others still better.  Without\neffort and change, human life cannot remain good.  It is not a\nfinished Utopia that we ought to desire, but a world where imagination\nand hope are alive and active.\nIt is a sad evidence of the weariness mankind has suffered from\nexcessive toil that his heavens have usually been places where nothing\never happened or changed.  Fatigue produces the illusion that only\nrest is needed for happiness; but when men have rested for a time,\nboredom drives them to renewed activity.  For this reason, a happy\nlife must be one in which there is activity.  If it is also to be a\nuseful life, the activity ought to be as far as possible creative, not\nmerely predatory or defensive.  But creative activity requires\nimagination and originality, which are apt to be subversive of the\n_status quo_.  At present, those who have power dread a disturbance of\nthe _status quo_, lest their unjust privileges should be taken away.\nIn combination with the instinct for conventionality,[1] which man\nshares with the other gregarious animals, those who profit by the\nexisting order have established a system which punishes originality\nand starves imagination from the moment of first going to school down\nto the time of death and burial.  The whole spirit in which education\nis conducted needs to be changed, in order that children may be\nencouraged to think and feel for themselves, not to acquiesce\npassively in the thoughts and feelings of others.  It is not rewards\nafter the event that will produce initiative, but a certain mental\natmosphere.  There have been times when such an atmosphere existed:\nthe great days of Greece, and Elizabethan England, may serve as\nexamples.  But in our own day the tyranny of vast machine-like\norganizations, governed from above by men who know and care little for\nthe lives of those whom they control, is killing individuality and\nfreedom of mind, and forcing men more and more to conform to a uniform\npattern.\n[1] In England this is called \"a sense of humor.\"\nVast organizations are an inevitable element in modern life, and it is\nuseless to aim at their abolition, as has been done by some reformers,\nfor instance, William Morris.  It is true that they make the\npreservation of individuality more difficult, but what is needed is a\nway of combining them with the greatest possible scope for individual\ninitiative.\nOne very important step toward this end would be to render democratic\nthe government of every organization.  At present, our legislative\ninstitutions are more or less democratic, except for the important\nfact that women are excluded.  But our administration is still purely\nbureaucratic, and our economic organizations are monarchical or\noligarchic.  Every limited liability company is run by a small number\nof self-appointed or co\u00f6pted directors.  There can be no real\nfreedom or democracy until the men who do the work in a business also\ncontrol its management.\nAnother measure which would do much to increase liberty would be an\nincrease of self-government for subordinate groups, whether\ngeographical or economic or defined by some common belief, like\nreligious sects.  A modern state is so vast and its machinery is so\nlittle understood that even when a man has a vote he does not feel\nhimself any effective part of the force which determines its policy.\nExcept in matters where he can act in conjunction with an\nexceptionally powerful group, he feels himself almost impotent, and\nthe government remains a remote impersonal circumstance, which must be\nsimply endured, like the weather.  By a share in the control of\nsmaller bodies, a man might regain some of that sense of personal\nopportunity and responsibility which belonged to the citizen of a\ncity-state in ancient Greece or medieval Italy.\nWhen any group of men has a strong corporate consciousness--such as\nbelongs, for example, to a nation or a trade or a religious\nbody--liberty demands that it should be free to decide for itself all\nmatters which are of great importance to the outside world.  This is\nthe basis of the universal claim for national independence.  But\nnations are by no means the only groups which ought to have\nself-government for their internal concerns.  And nations, like other\ngroups, ought not to have complete liberty of action in matters which\nare of equal concern to foreign nations.  Liberty demands\nself-government, but not the right to interfere with others.  The\ngreatest degree of liberty is not secured by anarchy.  The\nreconciliation of liberty with government is a difficult problem, but\nit is one which any political theory must face.\nThe essence of government is the use of force in accordance with law\nto secure certain ends which the holders of power consider desirable.\nThe coercion of an individual or a group by force is always in itself\nmore or less harmful.  But if there were no government, the result\nwould not be an absence of force in men's relations to each other; it\nwould merely be the exercise of force by those who had strong\npredatory instincts, necessitating either slavery or a perpetual\nreadiness to repel force with force on the part of those whose\ninstincts were less violent.  This is the state of affairs at present\nin international relations, owing to the fact that no international\ngovernment exists.  The results of anarchy between states should\nsuffice to persuade us that anarchism has no solution to offer for the\nevils of the world.\nThere is probably one purpose, and only one, for which the use of\nforce by a government is beneficent, and that is to diminish the total\namount of force used m the world.  It is clear, for example, that the\nlegal prohibition of murder diminishes the total amount of violence in\nthe world.  And no one would maintain that parents should have\nunlimited freedom to ill-treat their children.  So long as some men\nwish to do violence to others, there cannot be complete liberty, for\neither the wish to do violence must be restrained, or the victims must\nbe left to suffer.  For this reason, although individuals and\nsocieties should have the utmost freedom as regards their own affairs,\nthey ought not to have complete freedom as regards their dealings with\nothers.  To give freedom to the strong to oppress the weak is not the\nway to secure the greatest possible amount of freedom in the world.\nThis is the basis of the socialist revolt against the kind of freedom\nwhich used to be advocated by _laissez-faire_ economists.\nDemocracy is a device--the best so far invented--for diminishing as\nmuch as possible the interference of governments with liberty.  If a\nnation is divided into two sections which cannot both have their way,\ndemocracy theoretically insures that the majority shall have their\nway.  But democracy is not at all an adequate device unless it is\naccompanied by a very great amount of devolution.  Love of uniformity,\nor the mere pleasure of interfering, or dislike of differing tastes\nand temperaments, may often lead a majority to control a minority in\nmatters which do not really concern the majority.  We should none of\nus like to have the internal affairs of Great Britain settled by a\nparliament of the world, if ever such a body came into existence.\nNevertheless, there are matters which such a body could settle much\nbetter than any existing instrument of government.\nThe theory of the legitimate use of force in human affairs, where a\ngovernment exists, seems clear.  Force should only be used against\nthose who attempt to use force against others, or against those who\nwill not respect the law in cases where a common decision is necessary\nand a minority are opposed to the action of the majority.  These seem\nlegitimate occasions for the use of force; and they should be\nlegitimate occasions in international affairs, if an international\ngovernment existed.  The problem of the legitimate occasions for the\nuse of force in the absence of a government is a different one, with\nwhich we are not at present concerned.\nAlthough a government must have the power to use force, and may on\noccasion use it legitimately, the aim of the reformers to have such\ninstitutions as will diminish the need for actual coercion will be\nfound to have this effect.  Most of us abstain, for instance, from\ntheft, not because it is illegal, but because we feel no desire to\nsteal.  The more men learn to live creatively rather than\npossessively, the less their wishes will lead them to thwart others or\nto attempt violent interference with their liberty.  Most of the\nconflicts of interests, which lead individuals or organizations into\ndisputes, are purely imaginary, and would be seen to be so if men\naimed more at the goods in which all can share, and less at those\nprivate possessions that are the source of strife.  In proportion as\nmen live creatively, they cease to wish to interfere with others by\nforce.  Very many matters in which, at present, common action is\nthought indispensable, might well be left to individual decision.  It\nused to be thought absolutely necessary that all the inhabitants of a\ncountry should have the same religion, but we now know that there is\nno such necessity.  In like manner it will be found, as men grow more\ntolerant in their instincts, that many uniformities now insisted upon\nare useless and even harmful.\nGood political institutions would weaken the impulse toward force and\ndomination in two ways: first, by increasing the opportunities for the\ncreative impulses, and by shaping education so as to strengthen these\nimpulses; secondly, by diminishing the outlets for the possessive\ninstincts.  The diffusion of power, both in the political and the\neconomic sphere, instead of its concentration in the hands of\nofficials and captains of industry, would greatly diminish the\nopportunities for acquiring the habit of command, out of which the\ndesire for exercising tyranny is apt to spring.  Autonomy, both for\ndistricts and for organizations, would leave fewer occasions when\ngovernments were called upon to make decisions as to other people's\nconcerns.  And the abolition of capitalism and the wage system would\nremove the chief incentive to fear and greed, those correlative\npassions by which all free life is choked and gagged.\nFew men seem to realize how many of the evils from which we suffer are\nwholly unnecessary, and that they could be abolished by a united\neffort within a few years.  If a majority in every civilized country\nso desired, we could, within twenty years, abolish all abject poverty,\nquite half the illness in the world, the whole economic slavery which\nbinds down nine tenths of our population; we could fill the world with\nbeauty and joy, and secure the reign of universal peace.  It is only\nbecause men are apathetic that this is not achieved, only because\nimagination is sluggish, and what always has been is regarded as what\nalways must be.  With good-will, generosity, intelligence, these\nthings could be brought about.\nChapter II: Capitalism and the Wage System\nI\nThe world is full of preventible evils which most men would be glad to\nsee prevented.\nNevertheless, these evils persist, and nothing effective is done\ntoward abolishing them.\nThis paradox produces astonishment in inexperienced reformers, and too\noften produces disillusionment in those who have come to know the\ndifficulty of changing human institutions.\nWar is recognized as an evil by an immense majority in every civilized\ncountry; but this recognition does not prevent war.\nThe unjust distribution of wealth must be obviously an evil to those\nwho are not prosperous, and they are nine tenths of the population.\nNevertheless it continues unabated.\nThe tyranny of the holders of power is a source of needless suffering\nand misfortune to very large sections of mankind; but power remains in\nfew hands, and tends, if anything, to grow more concentrated.\nI wish first to study the evils of our present institutions, and the\ncauses of the very limited success of reformers in the past, and then\nto suggest reasons for the hope of a more lasting and permanent\nsuccess in the near future.\nThe war has come as a challenge to all who desire a better world.  The\nsystem which cannot save mankind from such an appalling disaster is at\nfault somewhere, and cannot be amended in any lasting way unless the\ndanger of great wars in the future can be made very small.\nBut war is only the final flower of an evil tree.  Even in times of\npeace, most men live lives of monotonous labor, most women are\ncondemned to a drudgery which almost kills the possibility of\nhappiness before youth is past, most children are allowed to grow up\nin ignorance of all that would enlarge their thoughts or stimulate\ntheir imagination.  The few who are more fortunate are rendered\nilliberal by their unjust privileges, and oppressive through fear of\nthe awakening indignation of the masses.  From the highest to the\nlowest, almost all men are absorbed in the economic struggle: the\nstruggle to acquire what is their due or to retain what is not their\ndue.  Material possessions, in fact or in desire, dominate our\noutlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative\nimpulses.  Possessiveness--the passion to have and to hold--is the\nultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which\nthe political world is suffering.  Only by diminishing the strength of\nthis passion and its hold upon our daily lives can new institutions\nbring permanent benefit to mankind.\nInstitutions which will diminish the sway of greed are possible, but\nonly through a complete reconstruction of our whole economic system.\nCapitalism and the wage system must be abolished; they are twin\nmonsters which are eating up the life of the world.  In place of them\nwe need a system which will hold in cheek men's predatory impulses,\nand will diminish the economic injustice that allows some to be rich\nin idleness while others are poor in spite of unremitting labor; but\nabove all we need a system which will destroy the tyranny of the\nemployer, by making men at the same time secure against destitution\nand able to find scope for individual initiative in the control of the\nindustry by which they live.  A better system can do all these things,\nand can be established by the democracy whenever it grows weary of\nenduring evils which there is no reason to endure.\nWe may distinguish four purposes at which an economic system may aim:\nfirst, it may aim at the greatest possible production of goods and at\nfacilitating technical progress; second, it may aim at securing\ndistributive justice; third, it may aim at giving security against\ndestitution; and, fourth, it may aim at liberating creative impulses\nand diminishing possessive impulses.\nOf these four purposes the last is the most important.  Security is\nchiefly important as a means to it.  State socialism, though it might\ngive material security and more justice than we have at present, would\nprobably fail to liberate creative impulses or produce a progressive\nsociety.\nOur present system fails in all four purposes.  It is chiefly defended\non the ground that it achieves the first of the four purposes, namely,\nthe greatest possible production of material goods, but it only does\nthis in a very short-sighted way, by methods which are wasteful in the\nlong run both of human material and of natural resources.\nCapitalistic enterprise involves a ruthless belief in the importance\nof increasing material production to the utmost possible extent now\nand in the immediate future.  In obedience to this belief, new\nportions of the earth's surface are continually brought under the sway\nof industrialism.  Vast tracts of Africa become recruiting grounds for\nthe labor required in the gold and diamond mines of the Rand,\nRhodesia, and Kimberley; for this purpose, the population is\ndemoralized, taxed, driven into revolt, and exposed to the\ncontamination of European vice and disease.  Healthy and vigorous\nraces from Southern Europe are tempted to America, where sweating and\nslum life reduce their vitality if they do not actually cause their\ndeath.  What damage is done to our own urban populations by the\nconditions under which they live, we all know.  And what is true of\nthe human riches of the world is no less true of the physical\nresources.  The mines, forests, and wheat-fields of the world are all\nbeing exploited at a rate which must practically exhaust them at no\ndistant date.  On the side of material production, the world is living\ntoo fast; in a kind of delirium, almost all the energy of the world\nhas rushed into the immediate production of something, no matter what,\nand no matter at what cost.  And yet our present system is defended on\nthe ground that it safeguards progress!\nIt cannot be said that our present economic system is any more\nsuccessful in regard to the other three objects which ought to be\naimed at.  Among the many obvious evils of capitalism and the wage\nsystem, none are more glaring than that they encourage predatory\ninstincts, that they allow economic injustice, and that they give\ngreat scope to the tyranny of the employer.\nAs to predatory instincts, we may say, broadly speaking, that in a\nstate of nature there would be two ways of acquiring riches--one by\nproduction, the other by robbery.  Under our existing system, although\nwhat is recognized as robbery is forbidden, there are nevertheless\nmany ways of becoming rich without contributing anything to the wealth\nof the community.  Ownership of land or capital, whether acquired or\ninherited, gives a legal right to a permanent income.  Although most\npeople have to produce in order to live, a privileged minority are\nable to live in luxury without producing anything at all.  As these\nare the men who are not only the most fortunate but also the most\nrespected, there is a general desire to enter their ranks, and a\nwidespread unwillingness to face the fact that there is no\njustification whatever for incomes derived in this way.  And apart\nfrom the passive enjoyment of rent or interest, the methods of\nacquiring wealth are very largely predatory.  It is not, as a rule, by\nmeans of useful inventions, or of any other action which increases the\ngeneral wealth of the community, that men amass fortunes; it is much\nmore often by skill in exploiting or circumventing others.  Nor is it\nonly among the rich that our present r\u00e9gime promotes a narrowly\nacquisitive spirit.  The constant risk of destitution compels most men\nto fill a great part of their time and thought with the economic\nstruggle.  There is a theory that this increases the total output of\nwealth by the community.  But for reasons to which I shall return\nlater, I believe this theory to be wholly mistaken.\nEconomic injustice is perhaps the most obvious evil of our present\nsystem.  It would be utterly absurd to maintain that the men who\ninherit great wealth deserve better of the community than those who\nhave to work for their living.  I am not prepared to maintain that\neconomic justice requires an exactly equal income for everybody.  Some\nkinds of work require a larger income for efficiency than others do;\nbut there is economic injustice as soon as a man has more than his\nshare, unless it is because his efficiency in his work requires it, or\nas a reward for some definite service.  But this point is so obvious\nthat it needs no elaboration.\nThe modern growth of monopolies in the shape of trusts, cartels,\nfederations of employers and so on has greatly increased the power of\nthe capitalist to levy toll on the community.  This tendency will not\ncease of itself, but only through definite action on the part of those\nwho do not profit by the capitalist r\u00e9gime.  Unfortunately the\ndistinction between the proletariat and the capitalist is not so sharp\nas it was in the minds of socialist theorizers.  Trade-unions have\nfunds in various securities; friendly societies are large capitalists;\nand many individuals eke out their wages by invested savings.  All\nthis increases the difficulty of any clear-cut radical change in our\neconomic system.  But it does not diminish the desirability of such a\nchange.\nSuch a system as that suggested by the French syndicalists, in which\neach trade would be self-governing and completely independent, without\nthe control of any central authority, would not secure economic\njustice.  Some trades are in a much stronger bargaining position than\nothers.  Coal and transport, for example, could paralyze the national\nlife, and could levy blackmail by threatening to do so.  On the other\nhand, such people as school teachers, for example, could rouse very\nlittle terror by the threat of a strike and would be in a very weak\nbargaining position.  Justice can never be secured by any system of\nunrestrained force exercised by interested parties in their own\ninterests.  For this reason the abolition of the state, which the\nsyndicalists seem to desire, would be a measure not compatible with\neconomic justice.\nThe tyranny of the employer, which at present robs the greater part of\nmost men's lives of all liberty and all initiative, is unavoidable so\nlong as the employer retains the right of dismissal with consequent\nloss of pay.  This right is supposed to be essential in order that men\nmay have an incentive to work thoroughly.  But as men grow more\ncivilized, incentives based on hope become increasingly preferable to\nthose that are based on fear.  It would be far better that men should\nbe rewarded for working well than that they should be punished for\nworking badly.  This system is already in operation in the civil\nservice, where a man is only dismissed for some exceptional degree of\nvice or virtue, such as murder or illegal abstention from it.\nSufficient pay to ensure a livelihood ought to be given to every\nperson who is willing to work, independently of the question whether\nthe particular work at which he is skilled is wanted at the moment or\nnot.  If it is not wanted, some new trade which is wanted ought to be\ntaught at the public expense.  Why, for example, should a hansom-cab\ndriver be allowed to suffer on account of the introduction of taxies?\nHe has not committed any crime, and the fact that his work is no\nlonger wanted is due to causes entirely outside his control.  Instead\nof being allowed to starve, he ought to be given instruction in motor\ndriving or in whatever other trade may seem most suitable.  At\npresent, owing to the fact that all industrial changes tend to cause\nhardships to some section of wage-earners, there is a tendency to\ntechnical conservatism on the part of labor, a dislike of innovations,\nnew processes, and new methods.  But such changes, if they are in the\npermanent interest of the community, ought to be carried out without\nallowing them to bring unmerited loss to those sections of the\ncommunity whose labor is no longer wanted in the old form.  The\ninstinctive conservatism of mankind is sure to make all processes of\nproduction change more slowly than they should.  It is a pity to add\nto this by the avoidable conservatism which is forced upon organized\nlabor at present through the unjust workings of a change.\nIt will be said that men will not work well if the fear of dismissal\ndoes not spur them on.  I think it is only a small percentage of whom\nthis would be true at present.  And those of whom it would be true\nmight easily become industrious if they were given more congenial work\nor a wiser training.  The residue who cannot be coaxed into industry\nby any such methods are probably to be regarded as pathological cases,\nrequiring medical rather than penal treatment.  And against this\nresidue must be set the very much larger number who are now ruined in\nhealth or in morale by the terrible uncertainty of their livelihood\nand the great irregularity of their employment.  To very many,\nsecurity would bring a quite new possibility of physical and moral\nhealth.\nThe most dangerous aspect of the tyranny of the employer is the power\nwhich it gives him of interfering with men's activities outside their\nworking hours.  A man may be dismissed because the employer dislikes\nhis religion or his politics, or chooses to think his private life\nimmoral.  He may be dismissed because he tries to produce a spirit of\nindependence among his fellow employees.  He may fail completely to\nfind employment merely on the ground that he is better educated than\nmost and therefore more dangerous.  Such cases actually occur at\npresent.  This evil would not be remedied, but rather intensified,\nunder state socialism, because, where the State is the only employer,\nthere is no refuge from its prejudices such as may now accidentally\narise through the differing opinions of different men.  The State\nwould be able to enforce any system of beliefs it happened to like,\nand it is almost certain that it would do so.  Freedom of thought\nwould be penalized, and all independence of spirit would die out.\nAny rigid system would involve this evil.  It is very necessary that\nthere should be diversity and lack of complete systematization.\nMinorities must be able to live and develop their opinions freely.  If\nthis is not secured, the instinct of persecution and conformity will\nforce all men into one mold and make all vital progress impossible.\nFor these reasons, no one ought to be allowed to suffer destitution so\nlong as he or she is _willing_ to work.  And no kind of inquiry ought\nto be made into opinion or private life.  It is only on this basis\nthat it is possible to build up an economic system not founded upon\ntyranny and terror.\nII\nThe power of the economic reformer is limited by the technical\nproductivity of labor.  So long as it was necessary to the bare\nsubsistence of the human race that most men should work very long\nhours for a pittance, so long no civilization was possible except an\naristocratic one; if there were to be men with sufficient leisure for\nany mental life, there had to be others who were sacrificed for the\ngood of the few.  But the time when such a system was necessary has\npassed away with the progress of machinery.  It would be possible now,\nif we had a wise economic system, for all who have mental needs to\nfind satisfaction for them.  By a few hours a day of manual work, a\nman can produce as much as is necessary for his own subsistence; and\nif he is willing to forgo luxuries, that is all that the community has\na right to demand of him.  It ought to be open to all who so desire to\ndo short hours of work for little pay, and devote their leisure to\nwhatever pursuit happens to attract them.  No doubt the great majority\nof those who chose this course would spend their time in mere\namusement, as most of the rich do at present.  But it could not be\nsaid, in such a society, that they were parasites upon the labor of\nothers.  And there would be a minority who would give their hours of\nnominal idleness to science or art or literature, or some other\npursuit out of which fundamental progress may come.  In all such\nmatters, organization and system can only do harm.  The one thing that\ncan be done is to provide opportunity, without repining at the waste\nthat results from most men failing to make good use of the\nopportunity.\nBut except in cases of unusual laziness or eccentric ambition, most\nmen would elect to do a full day's work for a full day's pay.  For\nthese, who would form the immense majority, the important thing is\nthat ordinary work should, as far as possible, afford interest and\nindependence and scope for initiative.  These things are more\nimportant than income, as soon as a certain minimum has been reached.\nThey can be secured by gild socialism, by industrial self-government\nsubject to state control as regards the relations of a trade to the\nrest of the community.  So far as I know, they cannot be secured in\nany other way.\nGuild socialism, as advocated by Mr. Orage and the \"New Age,\" is\nassociated with a polemic against \"political\" action, and in favor of\ndirect economic action by trade-unions.  It shares this with\nsyndicalism, from which most of what is new in it is derived.  But I\nsee no reason for this attitude; political and economic action seem to\nme equally necessary, each in its own time and place.  I think there\nis danger in the attempt to use the machinery of the present\ncapitalist state for socialistic purposes.  But there is need of\npolitical action to transform the machinery of the state, side by side\nwith the transformation which we hope to see in economic institutions.\nIn this country, neither transformation is likely to be brought about\nby a sudden revolution; we must expect each to come step by step, if\nat all, and I doubt if either could or should advance very far without\nthe other.\nThe economic system we should ultimately wish to see would be one in\nwhich the state would be the sole recipient of economic rent, while\nprivate capitalistic enterprises should be replaced by self-governing\ncombinations of those who actually do the work.  It ought to be\noptional whether a man does a whole day's work for a whole day's pay,\nor half a day's work for half a day's pay, except in cases where such\nan arrangement would cause practical inconvenience.  A man's pay\nshould not cease through the accident of his work being no longer\nneeded, but should continue so long as he is willing to work, a new\ntrade being taught him at the public expense, if necessary.\nUnwillingness to work should be treated medically or educationally,\nwhen it could not be overcome by a change to some more congenial\noccupation.\nThe workers in a given industry should all be combined in one\nautonomous unit, and their work should not be subject to any outside\ncontrol.  The state should fix the price at which they produce, but\nshould leave the industry self-governing in all other respects.  In\nfixing prices, the state should, as far as possible, allow each\nindustry to profit by any improvements which it might introduce into\nits own processes, but should endeavor to prevent undeserved loss or\ngain through changes in external economic conditions.  In this way\nthere would be every incentive to progress, with the least possible\ndanger of unmerited destitution.  And although large economic\norganizations will continue, as they are bound to do, there will be a\ndiffusion of power which will take away the sense of individual\nimpotence from which men and women suffer at present.\nIII\nSome men, though they may admit that such a system would be desirable,\nwill argue that it is impossible to bring it about, and that therefore\nwe must concentrate on more immediate objects.\nI think it must be conceded that a political party ought to have\nproximate aims, measures which it hopes to carry in the next session\nor the next parliament, as well as a more distant goal.  Marxian\nsocialism, as it existed in Germany, seemed to me to suffer in this\nway: although the party was numerically powerful, it was politically\nweak, because it had no minor measures to demand while waiting for the\nrevolution.  And when, at last, German socialism was captured by those\nwho desired a less impracticable policy, the modification which\noccurred was of exactly the wrong kind: acquiescence in bad policies,\nsuch as militarism and imperialism, rather than advocacy of partial\nreforms which, however inadequate, would still have been steps in the\nright direction.\nA similar defect was inherent in the policy of French syndicalism as\nit existed before the war.  Everything was to wait for the general\nstrike; after adequate preparation, one day the whole proletariat\nwould unanimously refuse to work, the property owners would\nacknowledge their defeat, and agree to abandon all their privileges\nrather than starve.  This is a dramatic conception; but love of drama\nis a great enemy of true vision.  Men cannot be trained, except under\nvery rare circumstances, to do something suddenly which is very\ndifferent from what they have been doing before.  If the general\nstrike were to succeed, the victors, despite their anarchism, would be\ncompelled at once to form an administration, to create a new police\nforce to prevent looting and wanton destruction, to establish a\nprovisional government issuing dictatorial orders to the various\nsections of revolutionaries.  Now the syndicalists are opposed in\nprinciple to all political action; they would feel that they were\ndeparting from their theory in taking the necessary practical steps,\nand they would be without the required training because of their\nprevious abstention from politics.  For these reasons it is likely\nthat, even after a syndicalist revolution, actual power would fall\ninto the hands of men who were not really syndicalists.\nAnother objection to a program which is to be realized suddenly at\nsome remote date by a revolution or a general strike is that\nenthusiasm flags when there is nothing to do meanwhile, and no partial\nsuccess to lessen the weariness of waiting.  The only sort of movement\nwhich can succeed by such methods is one where the sentiment and the\nprogram are both very simple, as is the case in rebellions of\noppressed nations.  But the line of demarcation between capitalist and\nwage-earner is not sharp, like the line between Turk and Armenian, or\nbetween an Englishman and a native of India.  Those who have advocated\nthe social revolution have been mistaken in their political methods,\nchiefly because they have not realized how many people there are in\nthe community whose sympathies and interests lie half on the side of\ncapital, half on the side of labor.  These people make a clear-cut\nrevolutionary policy very difficult.\nFor these reasons, those who aim at an economic reconstruction which\nis not likely to be completed to-morrow must, if they are to have any\nhope of success, be able to approach their goal by degrees, through\nmeasures which are of some use in themselves, even if they should not\nultimately lead to the desired end.  There must be activities which\ntrain men for those that they are ultimately to carry out, and there\nmust be possible achievements in the near future, not only a vague\nhope of a distant paradise.\nBut although I believe that all this is true, I believe no less firmly\nthat really vital and radical reform requires some vision beyond the\nimmediate future, some realization of what human beings might make of\nhuman life if they chose.  Without some such hope, men will not have\nthe energy and enthusiasm necessary to overcome opposition, or the\nsteadfastness to persist when their aims are for the moment unpopular.\nEvery man who has really sincere desire for any great amelioration in\nthe conditions of life has first to face ridicule, then persecution,\nthen cajolery and attempts at subtle corruption.  We know from painful\nexperience how few pass unscathed through these three ordeals.  The\nlast especially, when the reformer is shown all the kingdoms of the\nearth, is difficult, indeed almost impossible, except for those who\nhave made their ultimate goal vivid to themselves by clear and\ndefinite thought.\nEconomic systems are concerned essentially with the production and\ndistribution of material goods.  Our present system is wasteful on the\nproduction side, and unjust on the side of distribution.  It involves\na life of slavery to economic forces for the great majority of the\ncommunity, and for the minority a degree of power over the lives of\nothers which no man ought to have.  In a good community the production\nof the necessaries of existence would be a mere preliminary to the\nimportant and interesting part of life, except for those who find a\npleasure in some part of the work of producing necessaries.  It is not\nin the least necessary that economic needs should dominate man as they\ndo at present.  This is rendered necessary at present, partly by the\ninequalities of wealth, partly by the fact that things of real value,\nsuch as a good education, are difficult to acquire, except for the\nwell-to-do.\nPrivate ownership of land and capital is not defensible on grounds of\njustice, or on the ground that it is an economical way of producing\nwhat the community needs.  But the chief objections to it are that it\nstunts the lives of men and women, that it enshrines a ruthless\npossessiveness in all the respect which is given to success, that it\nleads men to fill the greater part of their time and thought with the\nacquisition of purely material goods, and that it affords a terrible\nobstacle to the advancement of civilization and creative energy.\nThe approach to a system free from these evils need not be sudden; it\nis perfectly possible to proceed step by step towards economic freedom\nand industrial self-government.  It is not true that there is any\noutward difficulty in creating the kind of institutions that we have\nbeen considering.  If organized labor wishes to create them, nothing\ncould stand in its way.  The difficulty involved is merely the\ndifficulty of inspiring men with hope, of giving them enough\nimagination to see that the evils from which they suffer are\nunnecessary, and enough thought to understand how the evils are to be\ncured.  This is a difficulty which can be overcome by time and energy.\nBut it will not be overcome if the leaders of organized labor have no\nbreadth of outlook, no vision, no hopes beyond some slight superficial\nimprovement within the framework of the existing system.\nRevolutionary action may be unnecessary, but revolutionary thought is\nindispensable, and, as the outcome of thought, a rational and\nconstructive hope.\nChapter III: Pitfalls in Socialism\nI\nIn its early days, socialism was a revolutionary movement of which the\nobject was the liberation of the wage-earning classes and the\nestablishment of freedom and justice.  The passage from capitalism to\nthe new r\u00e9gime was to be sudden and violent: capitalists were to be\nexpropriated without compensation, and their power was not to be\nreplaced by any new authority.\nGradually a change came over the spirit of socialism.  In France,\nsocialists became members of the government, and made and unmade\nparliamentary majorities.  In Germany, social democracy grew so strong\nthat it became impossible for it to resist the temptation to barter\naway some of its intransigeance in return for government recognition\nof its claims.  In England, the Fabians taught the advantage of reform\nas against revolution, and of conciliatory bargaining as against\nirreconcilable antagonism.\nThe method of gradual reform has many merits as compared to the method\nof revolution, and I have no wish to preach revolution.  But gradual\nreform has certain dangers, to wit, the ownership or control of\nbusinesses hitherto in private hands, and by encouraging legislative\ninterference for the benefit of various sections of the wage-earning\nclasses.  I think it is at least doubtful whether such measures do\nanything at all to contribute toward the ideals which inspired the\nearly socialists and still inspire the great majority of those who\nadvocate some form of socialism.\nLet us take as an illustration such a measure as state purchase of\nrailways.  This is a typical object of state socialism, thoroughly\npracticable, already achieved in many countries, and clearly the sort\nof step that must be taken in any piecemeal approach to complete\ncollectivism.  Yet I see no reason to believe that any real advance\ntoward democracy, freedom, or economic justice is achieved when a\nstate takes over the railways after full compensation to the\nshareholders.\nEconomic justice demands a diminution, if not a total abolition, of\nthe proportion of the national income which goes to the recipients of\nrent and interest.  But when the holders of railway shares are given\ngovernment stock to replace their shares, they are given the prospect\nof an income in perpetuity equal to what they might reasonably expect\nto have derived from their shares.  Unless there is reason to expect a\ngreat increase in the earnings of railways, the whole operation does\nnothing to alter the distribution of wealth.  This could only be\neffected if the present owners were expropriated, or paid less than\nthe market value, or given a mere life-interest as compensation.  When\nfull value is given, economic justice is not advanced in any degree.\nThere is equally little advance toward freedom.  The men employed on\nthe railway have no more voice than they had before in the management\nof the railway, or in the wages and conditions of work.  Instead of\nhaving to fight the directors, with the possibility of an appeal to\nthe government, they now have to fight the government directly; and\nexperience does not lead to the view that a government department has\nany special tenderness toward the claims of labor.  If they strike,\nthey have to contend against the whole organized power of the state,\nwhich they can only do successfully if they happen to have a strong\npublic opinion on their side.  In view of the influence which the\nstate can always exercise on the press, public opinion is likely to be\nbiased against them, particularly when a nominally progressive\ngovernment is in power.  There will no longer be the possibility of\ndivergences between the policies of different railways.  Railway men\nin England derived advantages for many years from the comparatively\nliberal policy of the North Eastern Railway, which they were able to\nuse as an argument for a similar policy elsewhere.  Such possibilities\nare excluded by the dead uniformity of state administration.\nAnd there is no real advance toward democracy.  The administration of\nthe railways will be in the hands of officials whose bias and\nassociations separate them from labor, and who will develop an\nautocratic temper through the habit of power.  The democratic\nmachinery by which these officials are nominally controlled is\ncumbrous and remote, and can only be brought into operation on\nfirst-class issues which rouse the interest of the whole nation.  Even\nthen it is very likely that the superior education of the officials\nand the government, combined with the advantages of their position,\nwill enable them to mislead the public as to the issues, and alienate\nthe general sympathy even from the most excellent cause.\nI do not deny that these evils exist at present; I say only that they\nwill not be remedied by such measures as the nationalization of\nrailways in the present economic and political environment.  A greater\nupheaval, and a greater change in men's habits of mind, is necessary\nfor any really vital progress.\nII\nState socialism, even in a nation which possesses the form of\npolitical democracy, is not a truly democratic system.  The way in\nwhich it fails to be democratic may be made plain by an analogy from\nthe political sphere.  Every democrat recognizes that the Irish ought\nto have self-government for Irish affairs, and ought not to be told\nthat they have no grievance because they share in the Parliament of\nthe United Kingdom.  It is essential to democracy that any group of\ncitizens whose interests or desires separate them at all widely from\nthe rest of the community should be free to decide their internal\naffairs for themselves.  And what is true of national or local groups\nis equally true of economic groups, such as miners or railway men.\nThe national machinery of general elections is by no means sufficient\nto secure for groups of this kind the freedom which they ought to\nhave.\nThe power of officials, which is a great and growing danger in the\nmodern state, arises from the fact that the majority of the voters,\nwho constitute the only ultimate popular control over officials, are\nas a rule not interested in any one particular question, and are\ntherefore not likely to interfere effectively against an official who\nis thwarting the wishes of the minority who are interested.  The\nofficial is nominally subject to indirect popular control, but not to\nthe control of those who are directly affected by his action.  The\nbulk of the public will either never hear about the matter in dispute,\nor, if they do hear, will form a hasty opinion based upon inadequate\ninformation, which is far more likely to come from the side of the\nofficials than from the section of the community which is affected by\nthe question at issue.  In an important political issue, some degree\nof knowledge is likely to be diffused in time; but in other matters\nthere is little hope that this will happen.\nIt may be said that the power of officials is much less dangerous than\nthe power of capitalists, because officials have no economic interests\nthat are opposed to those of wage-earners.  But this argument involves\nfar too simple a theory of political human nature--a theory which\northodox socialism adopted from the classical political economy, and\nhas tended to retain in spite of growing evidence of its falsity.\nEconomic self-interest, and even economic class-interest, is by no\nmeans the only important political motive.  Officials, whose salary is\ngenerally quite unaffected by their decisions on particular questions,\nare likely, if they are of average honesty, to decide according to\ntheir view of the public interest; but their view will none the less\nhave a bias which will often lead them wrong.  It is important to\nunderstand this bias before entrusting our destinies too unreservedly\nto government departments.\nThe first thing to observe is that, in any very large organization,\nand above all in a great state, officials and legislators are usually\nvery remote from those whom they govern, and not imaginatively\nacquainted with the conditions of life to which their decisions will\nbe applied.  This makes them ignorant of much that they ought to know,\neven when they are industrious and willing to learn whatever can be\ntaught by statistics and blue-books.  The one thing they understand\nintimately is the office routine and the administrative rules.  The\nresult is an undue anxiety to secure a uniform system.  I have heard\nof a French minister of education taking out his watch, and remarking,\n\"At this moment all the children of such and such an age in France are\nlearning so and so.\" This is the ideal of the administrator, an ideal\nutterly fatal to free growth, initiative, experiment, or any far\nreaching innovation.  Laziness is not one of the motives recognized in\ntextbooks on political theory, because all ordinary knowledge of human\nnature is considered unworthy of the dignity of these works; yet we\nall know that laziness is an immensely powerful motive with all but a\nsmall minority of mankind.\nUnfortunately, in this case laziness is reinforced by love of power,\nwhich leads energetic officials to create the systems which lazy\nofficials like to administer.  The energetic official inevitably\ndislikes anything that he does not control.  His official sanction\nmust be obtained before anything can be done.  Whatever he finds in\nexistence he wishes to alter in some way, so as to have the\nsatisfaction of feeling his power and making it felt.  If he is\nconscientious, he will think out some perfectly uniform and rigid\nscheme which he believes to be the best possible, and he will then\nimpose this scheme ruthlessly, whatever promising growths he may have\nto lop down for the sake of symmetry.  The result inevitably has\nsomething of the deadly dullness of a new rectangular town, as\ncompared with the beauty and richness of an ancient city which has\nlived and grown with the separate lives and individualities of many\ngenerations.  What has grown is always more living than what has been\ndecreed; but the energetic official will always prefer the tidiness of\nwhat he has decreed to the apparent disorder of spontaneous growth.\nThe mere possession of power tends to produce a love of power, which\nis a very dangerous motive, because the only sure proof of power\nconsists in preventing others from doing what they wish to do.  The\nessential theory of democracy is the diffusion of power among the\nwhole people, so that the evils produced by one man's possession of\ngreat power shall be obviated.  But the diffusion of power through\ndemocracy is only effective when the voters take an interest in the\nquestion involved.  When the question does not interest them, they do\nnot attempt to control the administration, and all actual power passes\ninto the hands of officials.\nFor this reason, the true ends of democracy are not achieved by state\nsocialism or by any system which places great power in the hands of\nmen subject to no popular control except that which is more or less\nindirectly exercised through parliament.\nAny fresh survey of men's political actions shows that, in those who\nhave enough energy to be politically effective, love of power is a\nstronger motive than economic self-interest.  Love of power actuates\nthe great millionaires, who have far more money than they can spend,\nbut continue to amass wealth merely in order to control more and more\nof the world's finance.[2]  Love of power is obviously the ruling\nmotive of many politicians.  It is also the chief cause of wars, which\nare admittedly almost always a bad speculation from the mere point of\nview of wealth.  For this reason, a new economic system which merely\nattacks economic motives and does not interfere with the concentration\nof power is not likely to effect any very great improvement in the\nworld.  This is one of the chief reasons for regarding state socialism\nwith suspicion.\n[2] Cf. J. A. Hobson, \"The Evolution of Modern Capitalism.\"\nIII\nThe problem of the distribution of power is a more difficult one than\nthe problem of the distribution of wealth.  The machinery of\nrepresentative government has concentrated on _ultimate_ power as the\nonly important matter, and has ignored immediate executive power.\nAlmost nothing has been done to democratize administration.\nGovernment officials, in virtue of their income, security, and social\nposition, are likely to be on the side of the rich, who have been\ntheir daily associates ever since the time of school and college.  And\nwhether or not they are on the side of the rich, they are not likely,\nfor the reasons we have been considering, to be genuinely in favor of\nprogress.  What applies to government officials applies also to\nmembers of Parliament, with the sole difference that they have had to\nrecommend themselves to a constituency.  This, however, only adds\nhypocrisy to the other qualities of a ruling caste.  Whoever has stood\nin the lobby of the House of Commons watching members emerge with\nwandering eye and hypothetical smile, until the constituent is espied,\nhis arm taken, \"my dear fellow\" whispered in his ear, and his steps\nguided toward the inner precincts--whoever, observing this, has\nrealized that these are the arts by which men become and remain\nlegislators, can hardly fail to feel that democracy as it exists is\nnot an absolutely perfect instrument of government.  It is a painful\nfact that the ordinary voter, at any rate in England, is quite blind\nto insincerity.  The man who does not care about any definite\npolitical measures can generally be won by corruption or flattery,\nopen or concealed; the man who is set on securing reforms will\ngenerally prefer an ambitious windbag to a man who desires the public\ngood without possessing a ready tongue.  And the ambitious windbag, as\nsoon as he has become a power by the enthusiasm he has aroused, will\nsell his influence to the governing clique, sometimes openly,\nsometimes by the more subtle method of intentionally failing at a\ncrisis.  This is part of the normal working of democracy as embodied\nin representative institutions.  Yet a cure must be found if democracy\nis not to remain a farce.\nOne of the sources of evil in modern large democracies is the fact\nthat most of the electorate have no direct or vital interest in most\nof the questions that arise.  Should Welsh children be allowed the use\nof the Welsh language in schools?  Should gipsies be compelled to\nabandon their nomadic life at the bidding of the education\nauthorities?  Should miners have an eight-hour day?  Should Christian\nScientists be compelled to call in doctors in case of serious illness?\nThese are matters of passionate interest to certain sections of the\ncommunity, but of very little interest to the great majority.  If they\nare decided according to the wishes of the numerical majority, the\nintense desires of a minority will be overborne by the very slight and\nuninformed whims of the indifferent remainder.  If the minority are\ngeographically concentrated, so that they can decide elections in a\ncertain number of constituencies, like the Welsh and the miners, they\nhave a good chance of getting their way, by the wholly beneficent\nprocess which its enemies describe as log-rolling.  But if they are\nscattered and politically feeble, like the gipsies and the Christian\nScientists, they stand a very poor chance against the prejudices of\nthe majority.  Even when they are geographically concentrated, like\nthe Irish, they may fail to obtain their wishes, because they arouse\nsome hostility or some instinct of domination in the majority.  Such a\nstate of affairs is the negation of all democratic principles.\nThe tyranny of the majority is a very real danger.  It is a mistake to\nsuppose that the majority is necessarily right.  On every new question\nthe majority is always wrong at first.  In matters where the state\nmust act as a whole, such as tariffs, for example, decision by\nmajorities is probably the best method that can be devised.  But there\nare a great many questions in which there is no need of a uniform\ndecision.  Religion is recognized as one of these.  Education ought to\nbe one, provided a certain minimum standard is attained.  Military\nservice clearly ought to be one.  Wherever divergent action by\ndifferent groups is possible without anarchy, it ought to be\npermitted.  In such cases it will be found by those who consider past\nhistory that, whenever any new fundamental issue arises, the majority\nare in the wrong, because they are guided by prejudice and habit.\nProgress comes through the gradual effect of a minority in converting\nopinion and altering custom.  At one time--not so very long ago--it\nwas considered monstrous wickedness to maintain that old women ought\nnot to be burnt as witches.  If those who held this opinion had been\nforcibly suppressed, we should still be steeped in medieval\nsuperstition.  For such reasons, it is of the utmost importance that\nthe majority should refrain from imposing its will as regards matters\nin which uniformity is not absolutely necessary.\nIV\nThe cure for the evils and dangers which we have been considering is a\nvery great extension of devolution and federal government.  Wherever\nthere is a national consciousness, as in Wales and Ireland, the area\nin which it exists ought to be allowed to decide all purely local\naffairs without external interference.  But there are many matters\nwhich ought to be left to the management, not of local groups, but of\ntrade groups, or of organizations embodying some set of opinions.  In\nthe East, men are subject to different laws according to the religion\nthey profess.  Something of this kind is necessary if any semblance of\nliberty is to exist where there is great divergence in beliefs.\nSome matters are essentially geographical; for instance, gas and\nwater, roads, tariffs, armies and navies.  These must be decided by an\nauthority representing an area.  How large the area ought to be,\ndepends upon accidents of topography and sentiment, and also upon the\nnature of the matter involved.  Gas and water require a small area,\nroads a somewhat larger one, while the only satisfactory area for an\narmy or a navy is the whole planet, since no smaller area will prevent\nwar.\nBut the proper unit in most economic questions, and also in most\nquestions that are intimately concerned with personal opinions, is not\ngeographical at all.  The internal management of railways ought not to\nbe in the hands of the geographical state, for reasons which we have\nalready considered.  Still less ought it to be in the hands of a set\nof irresponsible capitalists.  The only truly democratic system would\nbe one which left the internal management of railways in the hands of\nthe men who work on them.  These men should elect the general manager,\nand a parliament of directors if necessary.  All questions of wages,\nconditions of labor, running of trains, and acquisition of material,\nshould be in the hands of a body responsible only to those actually\nengaged in the work of the railway.\nThe same arguments apply to other large trades: mining, iron and\nsteel, cotton, and so on.  British trade-unionism, it seems to me, has\nerred in conceiving labor and capital as both permanent forces, which\nwere to be brought to some equality of strength by the organization of\nlabor.  This seems to me too modest an ideal.  The ideal which I\nshould wish to substitute involves the conquest of democracy and\nself-government in the economic sphere as in the political sphere, and\nthe total abolition of the power now wielded by the capitalist.  The\nman who works on a railway ought to have a voice in the government of\nthe railway, just as much as the man who works in a state has a right\nto a voice in the management of his state.  The concentration of\nbusiness initiative in the hands of the employers is a great evil, and\nrobs the employees of their legitimate share of interest in the larger\nproblems of their trade.\nFrench syndicalists were the first to advocate the system of trade\nautonomy as a better solution than state socialism.  But in their view\nthe trades were to be independent, almost like sovereign states at\npresent.  Such a system would not promote peace, any more than it does\nat present in international relations.  In the affairs of any body of\nmen, we may broadly distinguish what may be called questions of home\npolitics from questions of foreign politics.  Every group sufficiently\nwell-marked to constitute a political entity ought to be autonomous in\nregard to internal matters, but not in regard to those that directly\naffect the outside world.  If two groups are both entirely free as\nregards their relations to each other, there is no way of averting the\ndanger of an open or covert appeal to force.  The relations of a group\nof men to the outside world ought, whenever possible, to be controlled\nby a neutral authority.  It is here that the state is necessary for\nadjusting the relations between different trades.  The men who make\nsome commodity should be entirely free as regards hours of labor,\ndistribution of the total earnings of the trade, and all questions of\nbusiness management.  But they should not be free as regards the price\nof what they produce, since price is a matter concerning their\nrelations to the rest of the community.  If there were nominal freedom\nin regard to price, there would be a danger of a constant tug-of-war,\nin which those trades which were most immediately necessary to the\nexistence of the community could always obtain an unfair advantage.\nForce is no more admirable in the economic sphere than in dealings\nbetween states.  In order to secure the maximum of freedom with the\nminimum of force, the universal principle is: _Autonomy within each\npolitically important group, and a neutral authority for deciding\nquestions involving relations between groups_.  The neutral authority\nshould, of course, rest on a democratic basis, but should, if\npossible, represent a constituency wider than that of the groups\nconcerned.  In international affairs the only adequate authority would\nbe one representing all civilized nations.\nIn order to prevent undue extension of the power of such authorities,\nit is desirable and necessary that the various autonomous groups\nshould be very jealous of their liberties, and very ready to resist by\npolitical means any encroachments upon their independence.  State\nsocialism does not tolerate such groups, each with their own officials\nresponsible to the group.  Consequently it abandons the internal\naffairs of a group to the control of men not responsible to that group\nor specially aware of its needs.  This opens the door to tyranny and\nto the destruction of initiative.  These dangers are avoided by a\nsystem which allows any group of men to combine for any given purpose,\nprovided it is not predatory, and to claim from the central authority\nsuch self-government as is necessary to the carrying out of the\npurpose.  Churches of various denominations afford an instance.  Their\nautonomy was won by centuries of warfare and persecution.  It is to be\nhoped that a less terrible struggle will be required to achieve the\nsame result in the economic sphere.  But whatever the obstacles, I\nbelieve the importance of liberty is as great in the one case as it\nhas been admitted to be in the other.\nChapter IV: Individual Liberty and Public Control\nI\nSociety cannot exist without law and order, and cannot advance except\nthrough the initiative of vigorous innovators.  Yet law and order are\nalways hostile to innovations, and innovators are almost always, to\nsome extent, anarchists.  Those whose minds are dominated by fear of a\nrelapse towards barbarism will emphasize the importance of law and\norder, while those who are inspired by the hope of an advance towards\ncivilization will usually be more conscious of the need of individual\ninitiative.  Both temperaments are necessary, and wisdom lies in\nallowing each to operate freely where it is beneficent.  But those who\nare on the side of law and order, since they are reinforced by custom\nand the instinct for upholding the _status quo_, have no need of a\nreasoned defense.  It is the innovators who have difficulty in being\nallowed to exist and work.  Each generation believes that this\ndifficulty is a thing of the past, but each generation is only\ntolerant of _past_ innovations.  Those of its own day are met with the\nsame persecution as though the principle of toleration had never been\nheard of.\n\"In early society,\" says Westermarck, \"customs are not only moral\nrules, but the only moral rules ever thought of.  The savage strictly\ncomplies with the Hegelian command that no man must have a private\nconscience.  The following statement, which refers to the Tinnevelly\nShanars, may be quoted as a typical example: 'Solitary individuals\namongst them rarely adopt any new opinions, or any new course of\nprocedure.  They follow the multitude to do evil, and they follow the\nmultitude to do good.  They think in herds.'\"[3]\n[3] \"The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas,\" 2d edition,\nVol. I, p. 119.\nThose among ourselves who have never thought a thought or done a deed\nin the slightest degree different from the thoughts and deeds of our\nneighbors will congratulate themselves on the difference between us\nand the savage.  But those who have ever attempted any real innovation\ncannot help feeling that the people they know are not so very unlike\nthe Tinnevelly Shanars.\nUnder the influence of socialism, even progressive opinion, in recent\nyears, has been hostile to individual liberty.  Liberty is associated,\nin the minds of reformers, with _laissez-faire_, the Manchester School,\nand the exploitation of women and children which resulted from what\nwas euphemistically called \"free competition.\" All these things were\nevil, and required state interference; in fact, there is need of an\nimmense increase of state action in regard to cognate evils which\nstill exist.  In everything that concerns the economic life of the\ncommunity, as regards both distribution and conditions of production,\nwhat is required is more public control, not less--how much more, I\ndo not profess to know.\nAnother direction in which there is urgent need of the substitution of\nlaw and order for anarchy is international relations.  At present,\neach sovereign state has complete individual freedom, subject only to\nthe sanction of war.  This individual freedom will have to be\ncurtailed in regard to external relations if wars are ever to cease.\nBut when we pass outside the sphere of material possessions, we find\nthat the arguments in favor of public control almost entirely\ndisappear.\nReligion, to begin with, is recognized as a matter in which the state\nought not to interfere.  Whether a man is Christian, Mahometan, or Jew\nis a question of no public concern, so long as he obeys the laws; and\nthe laws ought to be such as men of all religions can obey.  Yet even\nhere there are limits.  No civilized state would tolerate a religion\ndemanding human sacrifice.  The English in India put an end to suttee,\nin spite of a fixed principle of non-interference with native\nreligious customs.  Perhaps they were wrong to prevent suttee, yet\nalmost every European would have done the same.  We cannot _effectively_\ndoubt that such practices ought to be stopped, however we may theorize\nin favor of religious liberty.\nIn such cases, the interference with liberty is imposed from without\nby a higher civilization.  But the more common case, and the more\ninteresting, is when an independent state interferes on behalf of\ncustom against individuals who are feeling their way toward more\ncivilized beliefs and institutions.\n\"In New South Wales,\" says Westermarck, \"the first-born of every lubra\nused to be eaten by the tribe 'as part of a religious ceremony.' In\nthe realm of Khai-muh, in China, according to a native account, it was\ncustomary to kill and devour the eldest son alive.  Among certain\ntribes in British Columbia the first child is often sacrificed to the\nsun.  The Indians of Florida, according to Le Moyne de Morgues,\nsacrificed the first-born son to the chief....'\"[4]\n[4] _Op cit._, p. 459.\nThere are pages and pages of such instances.\nThere is nothing analogous to these practices among ourselves.  When\nthe first-born in Florida was told that his king and country needed\nhim, this was a mere mistake, and with us mistakes of this kind do not\noccur.  But it is interesting to inquire how these superstitions died\nout, in such cases, for example, as that of Khai-muh, where foreign\ncompulsion is improbable.  We may surmise that some parents, under the\nselfish influence of parental affection, were led to doubt whether the\nsun would really be angry if the eldest child were allowed to live.\nSuch rationalism would be regarded as very dangerous, since it was\ncalculated to damage the harvest.  For generations the opinion would\nbe cherished in secret by a handful of cranks, who would not be able\nto act upon it.  At last, by concealment or flight, a few parents\nwould save their children from the sacrifice.  Such parents would be\nregarded as lacking all public spirit, and as willing to endanger the\ncommunity for their private pleasure.  But gradually it would appear\nthat the state remained intact, and the crops were no worse than in\nformer years.  Then, by a fiction, a child would be deemed to have\nbeen sacrificed if it was solemnly dedicated to agriculture or some\nother work of national importance chosen by the chief.  It would be\nmany generations before the child would be allowed to choose its own\noccupation after it had grown old enough to know its own tastes and\ncapacities.  And during all those generations, children would be\nreminded that only an act of grace had allowed them to live at all,\nand would exist under the shadow of a purely imaginary duty to the\nstate.\nThe position of those parents who first disbelieved in the utility of\ninfant sacrifice illustrates all the difficulties which arise in\nconnection with the adjustment of individual freedom to public\ncontrol.  The authorities, believing the sacrifice necessary for the\ngood of the community, were bound to insist upon it; the parents,\nbelieving it useless, were equally bound to do everything in their\npower toward saving the child.  How ought both parties to act in such\na case?\nThe duty of the skeptical parent is plain: to save the child by any\npossible means, to preach the uselessness of the sacrifice in season\nand out of season, and to endure patiently whatever penalty the law\nmay indict for evasion.  But the duty of the authorities is far less\nclear.  So long as they remain firmly persuaded that the universal\nsacrifice of the first-born is indispensable, they are bound to\npersecute those who seek to undermine this belief.  But they will, if\nthey are conscientious, very carefully examine the arguments of\nopponents, and be willing in advance to admit that these arguments\n_may_ be sound.  They will carefully search their own hearts to see\nwhether hatred of children or pleasure in cruelty has anything to do\nwith their belief.  They will remember that in the past history of\nKhai-muh there are innumerable instances of beliefs, now known to be\nfalse, on account of which those who disagreed with the prevalent view\nwere put to death.  Finally they will reflect that, though errors\nwhich are traditional are often wide-spread, new beliefs seldom win\nacceptance unless they are nearer to the truth than what they replace;\nand they will conclude that a new belief is probably either an\nadvance, or so unlikely to become common as to be innocuous.  All\nthese considerations will make them hesitate before they resort to\npunishment.\nII\nThe study of past times and uncivilized races makes it clear beyond\nquestion that the customary beliefs of tribes or nations are almost\ninvariably false.  It is difficult to divest ourselves completely of\nthe customary beliefs of our own age and nation, but it is not very\ndifficult to achieve a certain degree of doubt in regard to them.  The\nInquisitor who burnt men at the stake was acting with true humanity if\nall his beliefs were correct; but if they were in error at any point,\nhe was inflicting a wholly unnecessary cruelty.  A good working maxim\nin such matters is this: Do not trust customary beliefs so far as to\nperform actions which must be disastrous unless the beliefs in\nquestion are wholly true.  The world would be utterly bad, in the\nopinion of the average Englishman, unless he could say \"Britannia\nrules the waves\"; in the opinion of the average German, unless he\ncould say \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles.\" For the sake of these beliefs,\nthey are willing to destroy European civilization.  If the beliefs\nshould happen to be false, their action is regrettable.\nOne fact which emerges from these considerations is that no obstacle\nshould be placed in the way of thought and its expression, nor yet in\nthe way of statements of fact.  This was formerly common ground among\nliberal thinkers, though it was never quite realized in the practice\nof civilized countries.  But it has recently become, throughout\nEurope, a dangerous paradox, on account of which men suffer\nimprisonment or starvation.  For this reason it has again become worth\nstating.  The grounds for it are so evident that I should be ashamed\nto repeat them if they were not universally ignored.  But in the\nactual world it is very necessary to repeat them.\nTo attain complete truth is not given to mortals, but to advance\ntoward it by successive steps is not impossible.  On any matter of\ngeneral interest, there is usually, in any given community at any\ngiven time, a received opinion, which is accepted as a matter of\ncourse by all who give no special thought to the matter.  Any\nquestioning of the received opinion rouses hostility, for a number of\nreasons.\nThe most important of these is the instinct of conventionality, which\nexists in all gregarious animals and often leads them to put to death\nany markedly peculiar member of the herd.\nThe next most important is the feeling of insecurity aroused by doubt\nas to the beliefs by which we are in the habit of regulating our\nlives.  Whoever has tried to explain the philosophy of Berkeley to a\nplain man will have seen in its unadulterated form the anger aroused\nby this feeling.  What the plain man derives from Berkeley's\nphilosophy at a first hearing is an uncomfortable suspicion that\nnothing is solid, so that it is rash to sit on a chair or to expect\nthe floor to sustain us.  Because this suspicion is uncomfortable, it\nis irritating, except to those who regard the whole argument as merely\nnonsense.  And in a more or less analogous way any questioning of what\nhas been taken for granted destroys the feeling of standing on solid\nground, and produces a condition of bewildered fear.\nA third reason which makes men dislike novel opinions is that vested\ninterests are bound up with old beliefs.  The long fight of the church\nagainst science, from Giordano Bruno to Darwin, is attributable to\nthis motive among others.  The horror of socialism which existed in\nthe remote past was entirely attributable to this cause.  But it would\nbe a mistake to assume, as is done by those who seek economic motives\neverywhere, that vested interests are the principal source of anger\nagainst novelties in thought.  If this were the case, intellectual\nprogress would be much more rapid than it is.\nThe instinct of conventionality, horror of uncertainty, and vested\ninterests, all militate against the acceptance of a new idea.  And it\nis even harder to think of a new idea than to get it accepted; most\npeople might spend a lifetime in reflection without ever making a\ngenuinely original discovery.\nIn view of all these obstacles, it is not likely that any society at\nany time will suffer from a plethora of heretical opinions.  Least of\nall is this likely in a modern civilized society, where the conditions\nof life are in constant rapid change, and demand, for successful\nadaptation, an equally rapid change in intellectual outlook.  There\nshould be an attempt, therefore, to encourage, rather than discourage,\nthe expression of new beliefs and the dissemination of knowledge\ntending to support them.  But the very opposite is, in fact, the case.\nFrom childhood upward, everything is done to make the minds of men and\nwomen conventional and sterile.  And if, by misadventure, some spark\nof imagination remains, its unfortunate possessor is considered\nunsound and dangerous, worthy only of contempt in time of peace and of\nprison or a traitor's death in time of war.  Yet such men are known to\nhave been in the past the chief benefactors of mankind, and are the\nvery men who receive most honor as soon as they are safely dead.\nThe whole realm of thought and opinion is utterly unsuited to public\ncontrol; it ought to be as free, and as spontaneous as is possible to\nthose who know what others have believed.  The state is justified in\ninsisting that children shall be educated, but it is not justified in\nforcing their education to proceed on a uniform plan and to be\ndirected to the production of a dead level of glib uniformity.\nEducation, and the life of the mind generally, is a matter in which\nindividual initiative is the chief thing needed; the function of the\nstate should begin and end with insistence on some kind of education,\nand, if possible, a kind which promotes mental individualism, not a\nkind which happens to conform to the prejudices of government\nofficials.\nIII\nQuestions of practical morals raise more difficult problems than\nquestions of mere opinion.  The thugs honestly believe it their duty\nto commit murders, but the government does not acquiesce.  The\nconscientious objectors honestly hold the opposite opinion, and again\nthe government does not acquiesce.  Killing is a state prerogative; it\nis equally criminal to do it unbidden and not to do it when bidden.\nThe same applies to theft, unless it is on a large scale or by one who\nis already rich.  Thugs and thieves are men who use force in their\ndealings with their neighbors, and we may lay it down broadly that the\nprivate use of force should be prohibited except in rare cases,\nhowever conscientious may be its motive.  But this principle will not\njustify compelling men to use force at the bidding of the state, when\nthey do not believe it justified by the occasion.  The punishment of\nconscientious objectors seems clearly a violation of individual\nliberty within its legitimate sphere.\nIt is generally assumed without question that the state has a right to\npunish certain kinds of sexual irregularity.  No one doubts that the\nMormons sincerely believed polygamy to be a desirable practice, yet\nthe United States required them to abandon its legal recognition, and\nprobably any other Christian country would have done likewise.\nNevertheless, I do not think this prohibition was wise.  Polygamy is\nlegally permitted in many parts of the world, but is not much\npractised except by chiefs and potentates.  If, as Europeans generally\nbelieve, it is an undesirable custom, it is probable that the Mormons\nwould have soon abandoned it, except perhaps for a few men of\nexceptional position.  If, on the other hand, it had proved a\nsuccessful experiment, the world would have acquired a piece of\nknowledge which it is now unable to possess.  I think in all such\ncases the law should only intervene when there is some injury\ninflicted without the consent of the injured person.\nIt is obvious that men and women would not tolerate having their wives\nor husbands selected by the state, whatever eugenists might have to\nsay in favor of such a plan.  In this it seems clear that ordinary\npublic opinion is in the right, not because people choose wisely, but\nbecause any choice of their own is better than a forced marriage.\nWhat applies to marriage ought also to apply to the choice of a trade\nor profession; although some men have no marked preferences, most men\ngreatly prefer some occupations to others, and are far more likely to\nbe useful citizens if they follow their preferences than if they are\nthwarted by a public authority.\nThe case of the man who has an intense conviction that he ought to do\na certain kind of work is peculiar, and perhaps not very common; but\nit is important because it includes some very important individuals.\nJoan of Arc and Florence Nightingale defied convention in obedience to\na feeling of this sort; reformers and agitators in unpopular causes,\nsuch as Mazzini, have belonged to this class; so have many men of\nscience.  In cases of this kind the individual conviction deserves the\ngreatest respect, even if there seems no obvious justification for it.\nObedience to the impulse is very unlikely to do much harm, and may\nwell do great good.  The practical difficulty is to distinguish such\nimpulses from desires which produce similar manifestations.  Many\nyoung people wish to be authors without having an impulse to write any\nparticular book, or wish to be painters without having an impulse to\ncreate any particular picture.  But a little experience will usually\nshow the difference between a genuine and a spurious impulse; and\nthere is less harm in indulging the spurious impulse for a time than\nin thwarting the impulse which is genuine.  Nevertheless, the plain\nman almost always has a tendency to thwart the genuine impulse,\nbecause it seems anarchic and unreasonable, and is seldom able to give\na good account of itself in advance.\nWhat is markedly true of some notable personalities is true, in a\nlesser degree, of almost every individual who has much vigor or force\nof life; there is an impulse towards activity of some kind, as a rule\nnot very definite in youth, but growing gradually more sharply\noutlined under the influence of education and opportunity.  The direct\nimpulse toward a kind of activity for its own sake must be\ndistinguished from the desire for the expected effects of the\nactivity.  A young man may desire the rewards of great achievement\nwithout having any spontaneous impulse toward the activities which\nlead to achievement.  But those who actually achieve much, although\nthey may desire the rewards, have also something in their nature which\ninclines them to choose a certain kind of work as the road which they\nmust travel if their ambition is to be satisfied.  This artist's\nimpulse, as it may be called, is a thing of infinite value to the\nindividual, and often to the world; to respect it in oneself and in\nothers makes up nine tenths of the good life.  In most human beings it\nis rather frail, rather easily destroyed or disturbed; parents and\nteachers are too often hostile to it, and our economic system crushes\nout its last remnants in young men and young women.  The result is\nthat human beings cease to be individual, or to retain the native\npride that is their birthright; they become machine-made, tame,\nconvenient for the bureaucrat and the drill-sergeant, capable of being\ntabulated in statistics without anything being omitted.  This is the\nfundamental evil resulting from lack of liberty; and it is an evil\nwhich is being continually intensified as population grows more dense\nand the machinery of organization grows more efficient.\nThe things that men desire are many and various: admiration,\naffection, power, security, ease, outlets for energy, are among the\ncommonest of motives.  But such abstractions do not touch what makes\nthe difference between one man and another.  Whenever I go to the\nzo\u00f6logical gardens, I am struck by the fact that all the movements of\na stork have some common quality, differing from the movements of a\nparrot or an ostrich.  It is impossible to put in words what the\ncommon quality is, and yet we feel that each thing an animal does is\nthe sort of thing we might expect that animal to do.  This indefinable\nquality constitutes the individuality of the animal, and gives rise to\nthe pleasure we feel in watching the animal's actions.  In a human\nbeing, provided he has not been crushed by an economic or governmental\nmachine, there is the same kind of individuality, a something\ndistinctive without which no man or woman can achieve much of\nimportance, or retain the full dignity which is native to human\nbeings.  It is this distinctive individuality that is loved by the\nartist, whether painter or writer.  The artist himself, and the man\nwho is creative in no matter what direction, has more of it than the\naverage man.  Any society which crushes this quality, whether\nintentionally or by accident, must soon become utterly lifeless and\ntraditional, without hope of progress and without any purpose in its\nbeing.  To preserve and strengthen the impulse that makes\nindividuality should be the foremost object of all political\ninstitutions.\nIV\nWe now arrive at certain general principles in regard to individual\nliberty and public control.\nThe greater part of human impulses may be divided into two classes,\nthose which are possessive and those which are constructive or\ncreative.  Social institutions are the garments or embodiments of\nimpulses, and may be classified roughly according to the impulses\nwhich they embody.  Property is the direct expression of\npossessiveness; science and art are among the most direct expressions\nof creativeness.  Possessiveness is either defensive or aggressive; it\nseeks either to retain against a robber, or to acquire from a present\nholder.  In either case an attitude of hostility toward others is of\nits essence.  It would be a mistake to suppose that defensive\npossessiveness is always justifiable, while the aggressive kind is\nalways blameworthy; where there is great injustice in the _status\nquo_, the exact opposite may be the case, and ordinarily neither is\njustifiable.\nState interference with the actions of individuals is necessitated by\npossessiveness.  Some goods can be acquired or retained by force,\nwhile others cannot.  A wife can be acquired by force, as the Romans\nacquired the Sabine women; but a wife's affection cannot be acquired\nin this way.  There is no record that the Romans desired the affection\nof the Sabine women; and those in whom possessive impulses are strong\ntend to care chiefly for the goods that force can secure.  All\nmaterial goods belong to this class.  Liberty in regard to such goods,\nif it were unrestricted, would make the strong rich and the weak poor.\nIn a capitalistic society, owing to the partial restraints imposed by\nlaw, it makes cunning men rich and honest men poor, because the force\nof the state is put at men's disposal, not according to any just or\nrational principle, but according to a set of traditional maxims of\nwhich the explanation is purely historical.\nIn all that concerns possession and the use of force, unrestrained\nliberty involves anarchy and injustice.  Freedom to kill, freedom to\nrob, freedom to defraud, no longer belong to individuals, though they\nstill belong to great states, and are exercised by them in the name of\npatriotism.  Neither individuals nor states ought to be free to exert\nforce on their own initiative, except in such sudden emergencies as\nwill subsequently be admitted in justification by a court of law.  The\nreason for this is that the exertion of force by one individual\nagainst another is always an evil on both sides, and can only be\ntolerated when it is compensated by some overwhelming resultant good.\nIn order to minimize the amount of force actually exerted in the\nworld, it is necessary that there should be a public authority, a\nrepository of practically irresistible force, whose function should be\nprimarily to repress the private use of force.  A use of force is\n_private_ when it is exerted by one of the interested parties, or by\nhis friends or accomplices, not by a public neutral authority\naccording to some rule which is intended to be in the public interest.\nThe r\u00e9gime of private property under which we live does much too\nlittle to restrain the private use of force.  When a man owns a piece\nof land, for example, he may use force against trespassers, though\nthey must not use force against him.  It is clear that some\nrestriction of the liberty of trespass is necessary for the\ncultivation of the land.  But if such powers are to be given to an\nindividual, the state ought to satisfy itself that he occupies no more\nland than he is warranted in occupying in the public interest, and\nthat the share of the produce of the land that comes to him is no more\nthan a just reward for his labors.  Probably the only way in which\nsuch ends can be achieved is by state ownership of land.  The\npossessors of land and capital are able at present, by economic\npressure, to use force against those who have no possessions.  This\nforce is sanctioned by law, while force exercised by the poor against\nthe rich is illegal.  Such a state of things is unjust, and does not\ndiminish the use of private force as much as it might be diminished.\nThe whole realm of the possessive impulses, and of the use of force to\nwhich they give rise, stands in need of control by a public neutral\nauthority, in the interests of liberty no less than of justice.\nWithin a nation, this public authority will naturally be the state; in\nrelations between nations, if the present anarchy is to cease, it will\nhave to be some international parliament.\nBut the motive underlying the public control of men's possessive\nimpulses should always be the increase of liberty, both by the\nprevention of private tyranny and by the liberation of creative\nimpulses.  If public control is not to do more harm than good, it must\nbe so exercised as to leave the utmost freedom of private initiative\nin all those ways that do not involve the private use of force.  In\nthis respect all governments have always failed egregiously, and there\nis no evidence that they are improving.\nThe creative impulses, unlike those that are possessive, are directed\nto ends in which one man's gain is not another man's loss.  The man\nwho makes a scientific discovery or writes a poem is enriching others\nat the same time as himself.  Any increase in knowledge or good-will\nis a gain to all who are affected by it, not only to the actual\npossessor.  Those who feel the joy of life are a happiness to others\nas well as to themselves.  Force cannot create such things, though it\ncan destroy them; no principle of distributive justice applies to\nthem, since the gain of each is the gain of all.  For these reasons,\nthe creative part of a man's activity ought to be as free as possible\nfrom all public control, in order that it may remain spontaneous and\nfull of vigor.  The only function of the state in regard to this part\nof the individual life should be to do everything possible toward\nproviding outlets and opportunities.\nIn every life a part is governed by the community, and a part by\nprivate initiative.  The part governed by private initiative is\ngreatest in the most important individuals, such as men of genius and\ncreative thinkers.  This part ought only to be restricted when it is\npredatory; otherwise, everything ought to be done to make it as great\nand as vigorous as possible.  The object of education ought not to be\nto make all men think alike, but to make each think in the way which\nis the fullest expression of his own personality.  In the choice of a\nmeans of livelihood all young men and young women ought, as far as\npossible, to be able to choose what is attractive to them; if no\nmoney-making occupation is attractive, they ought to be free to do\nlittle work for little pay, and spend their leisure as they choose.\nAny kind of censure on freedom of thought or on the dissemination of\nknowledge is, of course, to be condemned utterly.\nHuge organizations, both political and economic, are one of the\ndistinguishing characteristics of the modern world.  These\norganizations have immense power, and often use their power to\ndiscourage originality in thought and action.  They ought, on the\ncontrary, to give the freest scope that is possible without producing\nanarchy or violent conflict.  They ought not to take cognizance of any\npart of a man's life except what is concerned with the legitimate\nobjects of public control, namely, possessions and the use of force.\nAnd they ought, by devolution, to leave as large a share of control as\npossible in the hands of individuals and small groups.  If this is not\ndone, the men at the head of these vast organizations will infallibly\nbecome tyrannous through the habit of excessive power, and will in\ntime interfere in ways that crush out individual initiative.\nThe problem which faces the modern world is the combination of\nindividual initiative with the increase in the scope and size of\norganizations.  Unless it is solved, individuals will grow less and\nless full of life and vigor, and more and more passively submissive to\nconditions imposed upon them.  A society composed of such individuals\ncannot be progressive or add much to the world's stock of mental and\nspiritual possessions.  Only personal liberty and the encouragement of\ninitiative can secure these things.  Those who resist authority when\nit encroaches upon the legitimate sphere of the individual are\nperforming a service to society, however little society may value it.\nIn regard to the past, this is universally acknowledged; but it is no\nless true in regard to the present and the future.\nChapter V: National Independence and Internationalism\nIn the relations between states, as in the relations of groups within\na single state, what is to be desired is independence for each as\nregards internal affairs, and law rather than private force as regards\nexternal affairs.  But as regards groups within a state, it is\ninternal independence that must be emphasized, since that is what is\nlacking; subjection to law has been secured, on the whole, since the\nend of the Middle Ages.  In the relations between states, on the\ncontrary, it is law and a central government that are lacking, since\nindependence exists for external as for internal affairs.  The stage\nwe have reached in the affairs of Europe corresponds to the stage\nreached in our internal affairs during the Wars of the Roses, when\nturbulent barons frustrated the attempt to make them keep the king's\npeace.  Thus, although the goal is the same in the two cases, the\nsteps to be taken in order to achieve it are quite different.\nThere can be no good international system until the boundaries of\nstates coincide as nearly as possible with the boundaries of nations.\nBut it is not easy to say what we mean by a nation.  Are the Irish a\nnation?  Home Rulers say yes, Unionists say no.  Are the Ulstermen a\nnation?  Unionists say yes, Home Rulers say no.  In all such cases it\nis a party question whether we are to call a group a nation or not.  A\nGerman will tell you that the Russian Poles are a nation, but as for\nthe Prussian Poles, they, of course, are part of Prussia.  Professors\ncan always be hired to prove, by arguments of race or language or\nhistory, that a group about which there is a dispute is, or is not, a\nnation, as may be desired by those whom the professors serve.  If we\nare to avoid all these controversies, we must first of all endeavor to\nfind some definition of a nation.\nA nation is not to be defined by affinities of language or a common\nhistorical origin, though these things often help to produce a nation.\nSwitzerland is a nation, despite diversities of race, religion, and\nlanguage.  England and Scotland now form one nation, though they did\nnot do so at the time of the Civil War.  This is shown by Cromwell's\nsaying, in the height of the conflict, that he would rather be subject\nto the domain of the royalists than to that of the Scotch.  Great\nBritain was one state before it was one nation; on the other hand,\nGermany was one nation before it was one state.\nWhat constitutes a nation is a sentiment and an instinct, a sentiment\nof similarity and an instinct of belonging to the same group or herd.\nThe instinct is an extension of the instinct which constitutes a flock\nof sheep, or any other group of gregarious animals.  The sentiment\nwhich goes with this is like a milder and more extended form of family\nfeeling.  When we return to England after being on the Continent, we\nfeel something friendly in the familiar ways, and it is easy to\nbelieve that Englishmen on the whole are virtuous, while many\nforeigners are full of designing wickedness.\nSuch feelings make it easy to organize a nation into a state.  It is\nnot difficult, as a rule, to acquiesce in the orders of a national\ngovernment.  We feel that it is our government, and that its decrees\nare more or less the same as those which we should have given if we\nourselves had been the governors.  There is an instinctive and usually\nunconscious sense of a common purpose animating the members of a\nnation.  This becomes especially vivid when there is war or a danger\nof war.  Any one who, at such a time, stands out against the orders of\nhis government feels an inner conflict quite different from any that\nhe would feel in standing out against the orders of a foreign\ngovernment in whose power he might happen to find himself.  If he\nstands out, he does so with some more or less conscious hope that his\ngovernment may in time come to think as he does; whereas, in standing\nout against a foreign government, no such hope is necessary.  This\ngroup instinct, however it may have arisen, is what constitutes a\nnation, and what makes it important that the boundaries of nations\nshould also be the boundaries of states.\nNational sentiment is a fact, and should be taken account of by\ninstitutions.  When it is ignored, it is intensified and becomes a\nsource of strife.  It can only be rendered harmless by being given\nfree play, so long as it is not predatory.  But it is not, in itself,\na good or admirable feeling.  There is nothing rational and nothing\ndesirable in a limitation of sympathy which confines it to a fragment\nof the human race.  Diversities of manners and customs and traditions\nare, on the whole, a good thing, since they enable different nations\nto produce different types of excellence.  But in national feeling\nthere is always latent or explicit an element of hostility to\nforeigners.  National feeling, as we know it, could not exist in a\nnation which was wholly free from external pressure of a hostile kind.\nAnd group feeling produces a limited and often harmful kind of\nmorality.  Men come to identify the good with what serves the\ninterests of their own group, and the bad with what works against\nthose interests, even if it should happen to be in the interests of\nmankind as a whole.  This group morality is very much in evidence\nduring war, and is taken for granted in men's ordinary thought.\nAlthough almost all Englishmen consider the defeat of Germany\ndesirable for the good of the world, yet nevertheless most of them\nhonor a German for fighting for his country, because it has not\noccurred to them that his actions ought to be guided by a morality\nhigher than that of the group.\nA man does right, as a rule, to have his thoughts more occupied with\nthe interests of his own nation than with those of others, because his\nactions are more likely to affect his own nation.  But in time of war,\nand in all matters which are of equal concern to other nations and to\nhis own, a man ought to take account of the universal welfare, and not\nallow his survey to be limited by the interest, or supposed interest,\nof his own group or nation.\nSo long as national feeling exists, it is very important that each\nnation should be self-governing as regards its internal affairs.\nGovernment can only be carried on by force and tyranny if its subjects\nview it with hostile eyes, and they will so view it if they feel that\nit belongs to an alien nation.  This principle meets with difficulties\nin cases where men of different nations live side by side in the same\narea, as happens in some parts of the Balkans.  There are also\ndifficulties in regard to places which, for some geographical reason,\nare of great international importance, such as the Suez Canal and the\nPanama Canal.  In such cases the purely local desires of the\ninhabitants may have to give way before larger interests.  But in\ngeneral, at any rate as applied to civilized communities, the\nprinciple that the boundaries of nations ought to coincide with the\nboundaries of states has very few exceptions.\nThis principle, however, does not decide how the relations between\nstates are to be regulated, or how a conflict of interests between\nrival states is to be decided.  At present, every great state claims\nabsolute sovereignty, not only in regard to its internal affairs but\nalso in regard to its external actions.  This claim to absolute\nsovereignty leads it into conflict with similar claims on the part of\nother great states.  Such conflicts at present can only be decided by\nwar or diplomacy, and diplomacy is in essence nothing but the threat\nof war.  There is no more justification for the claim to absolute\nsovereignty on the part of a state than there would be for a similar\nclaim on the part of an individual.  The claim to absolute sovereignty\nis, in effect, a claim that all external affairs are to be regulated\npurely by force, and that when two nations or groups of nations are\ninterested in a question, the decision shall depend solely upon which\nof them is, or is believed to be, the stronger.  This is nothing but\nprimitive anarchy, \"the war of all against all,\" which Hobbes asserted\nto be the original state of mankind.\nThere cannot be secure peace in the world, or any decision of\ninternational questions according to international law, until states\nare willing to part with their absolute sovereignty as regards their\nexternal relations, and to leave the decision in such matters to some\ninternational instrument of government.[5]  An international government\nwill have to be legislative as well as judicial.  It is not enough\nthat there should be a Hague tribunal, deciding matters according to\nsome already existing system of international law; it is necessary\nalso that there should be a body capable of enacting international\nlaw, and this body will have to have the power of transferring\nterritory from one state to another, when it is persuaded that\nadequate grounds exist for such a transference.  Friends of peace will\nmake a mistake if they unduly glorify the _status quo_.  Some nations\ngrow, while others dwindle; the population of an area may change its\ncharacter by emigration and immigration.  There is no good reason why\nstates should resent changes in their boundaries under such\nconditions, and if no international authority has power to make\nchanges of this kind, the temptations to war will sometimes become\nirresistible.\n[5] For detailed scheme of international government see \"International\nGovernment,\" by L. Woolf. Allen & Unwin.\nThe international authority ought to possess an army and navy, and\nthese ought to be the only army and navy in existence.  The only\nlegitimate use of force is to diminish the total amount of force\nexercised in the world.  So long as men are free to indulge their\npredatory instincts, some men or groups of men will take advantage of\nthis freedom for oppression and robbery.  Just as the police are\nnecessary to prevent the use of force by private citizens, so an\ninternational police will be necessary to prevent the lawless use of\nforce by separate states.\nBut I think it is reasonable to hope that if ever an international\ngovernment, possessed of the only army and navy in the world, came\ninto existence, the need of force to enact obedience to its decisions\nwould be very temporary.  In a short time the benefits resulting from\nthe substitution of law for anarchy would become so obvious that the\ninternational government would acquire an unquestioned authority, and\nno state would dream of rebelling against its decisions.  As soon as\nthis stage had been reached, the international army and navy would\nbecome unnecessary.\nWe have still a very long road to travel before we arrive at the\nestablishment of an international authority, but it is not very\ndifficult to foresee the steps by which this result will be gradually\nreached.  There is likely to be a continual increase in the practice\nof submitting disputes to arbitration, and in the realization that the\nsupposed conflicts of interest between different states are mainly\nillusory.  Even where there is a real conflict of interest, it must in\ntime become obvious that neither of the states concerned would suffer\nas much by giving way as by fighting.  With the progress of\ninventions, war, when it does occur, is bound to become increasingly\ndestructive.  The civilized races of the world are faced with the\nalternative of co\u00f6peration or mutual destruction.  The present war\nis making this alternative daily more evident.  And it is difficult to\nbelieve that, when the enmities which it has generated have had time\nto cool, civilized men will deliberately choose to destroy\ncivilization, rather than acquiesce in the abolition of war.\nThe matters in which the interests of nations are supposed to clash\nare mainly three: tariffs, which are a delusion; the exploitation of\ninferior races, which is a crime; pride of power and dominion, which\nis a schoolboy folly.\nThe economic argument against tariffs is familiar, and I shall not\nrepeat it.  The only reason why it fails to carry conviction is the\nenmity between nations.  Nobody proposes to set up a tariff between\nEngland and Scotland, or between Lancashire and Yorkshire.  Yet the\narguments by which tariffs between nations are supported might be used\njust as well to defend tariffs between counties.  Universal free trade\nwould indubitably be of economic benefit to mankind, and would be\nadopted to-morrow if it were not for the hatred and suspicion which\nnations feel one toward another.  From the point of view of preserving\nthe peace of the world, free trade between the different civilized\nstates is not so important as the open door in their dependencies.\nThe desire for exclusive markets is one of the most potent causes of\nwar.\nExploiting what are called \"inferior races\" has become one of the main\nobjects of European statecraft.  It is not only, or primarily, trade\nthat is desired, but opportunities for investment; finance is more\nconcerned in the matter than industry.  Rival diplomatists are very\noften the servants, conscious or unconscious, of rival groups of\nfinanciers.  The financiers, though themselves of no particular\nnation, understand the art of appealing to national prejudice, and of\ninducing the taxpayer to incur expenditure of which they reap the\nbenefit.  The evils which they produce at home, and the devastation\nthat they spread among the races whom they exploit, are part of the\nprice which the world has to pay for its acquiescence in the\ncapitalist r\u00e9gime.\nBut neither tariffs nor financiers would be able to cause serious\ntrouble, if it were not for the sentiment of national pride.  National\npride might be on the whole beneficent, if it took the direction of\nemulation in the things that are important to civilization.  If we\nprided ourselves upon our poets, our men of science, or the justice\nand humanity of our social system, we might find in national pride a\nstimulus to useful endeavors.  But such matters play a very small\npart.  National pride, as it exists now, is almost exclusively\nconcerned with power and dominion, with the extent of territory that a\nnation owns, and with its capacity for enforcing its will against the\nopposition of other nations.  In this it is reinforced by group\nmorality.  To nine citizens out of ten it seems self-evident, whenever\nthe will of their own nation clashes with that of another, that their\nown nation must be in the right.  Even if it were not in the right on\nthe particular issue, yet it stands in general for so much nobler\nideals than those represented by the other nation to the dispute, that\nany increase in its power is bound to be for the good of mankind.\nSince all nations equally believe this of themselves, all are equally\nready to insist upon the victory of their own side in any dispute in\nwhich they believe that they have a good hope of victory.  While this\ntemper persists, the hope of international co\u00f6peration must remain\ndim.\nIf men could divest themselves of the sentiment of rivalry and\nhostility between different nations, they would perceive that the\nmatters in which the interests of different nations coincide\nimmeasurably outweigh those in which they clash; they would perceive,\nto begin with, that trade is not to be compared to warfare; that the\nman who sells you goods is not doing you an injury.  No one considers\nthat the butcher and the baker are his enemies because they drain him\nof money.  Yet as soon as goods come from a foreign country, we are\nasked to believe that we suffer a terrible injury in purchasing them.\nNo one remembers that it is by means of goods exported that we\npurchase them.  But in the country to which we export, it is the goods\nwe send which are thought dangerous, and the goods we buy are\nforgotten.  The whole conception of trade, which has been forced upon\nus by manufacturers who dreaded foreign competition, by trusts which\ndesired to secure monopolies, and by economists poisoned by the virus\nof nationalism, is totally and absolutely false.  Trade results simply\nfrom division of labor.  A man cannot himself make all the goods of\nwhich he has need, and therefore he must exchange his produce with\nthat of other people.  What applies to the individual, applies in\nexactly the same way to the nation.  There is no reason to desire that\na nation should itself produce all the goods of which it has need; it\nis better that it should specialize upon those goods which it can\nproduce to most advantage, and should exchange its surplus with the\nsurplus of other goods produced by other countries.  There is no use\nin sending goods out of the country except in order to get other goods\nin return.  A butcher who is always willing to part with his meat but\nnot willing to take bread from the baker, or boots from the bootmaker,\nor clothes from the tailor, would soon find himself in a sorry plight.\nYet he would be no more foolish than the protectionist who desires\nthat we should send goods abroad without receiving payment in the\nshape of goods imported from abroad.\nThe wage system has made people believe that what a man needs is work.\nThis, of course, is absurd.  What he needs is the goods produced by\nwork, and the less work involved in making a given amount of goods,\nthe better.  But owing to our economic system, every economy in\nmethods of production enables employers to dismiss some of their\nemployees, and to cause destitution, where a better system would\nproduce only an increase of wages or a diminution in the hours of work\nwithout any corresponding diminution of wages.\nOur economic system is topsyturvy.  It makes the interest of the\nindividual conflict with the interest of the community in a thousand\nways in which no such conflict ought to exist.  Under a better system\nthe benefits of free trade and the evils of tariffs would be obvious\nto all.\nApart from trade, the interests of nations coincide in all that makes\nwhat we call civilization.  Inventions and discoveries bring benefit\nto all.  The progress of science is a matter of equal concern to the\nwhole civilized world.  Whether a man of science is an Englishman, a\nFrenchman, or a German is a matter of no real importance.  His\ndiscoveries are open to all, and nothing but intelligence is required\nin order to profit by them.  The whole world of art and literature and\nlearning is international; what is done in one country is not done for\nthat country, but for mankind.  If we ask ourselves what are the\nthings that raise mankind above the brutes, what are the things that\nmake us think the human race more valuable than any species of\nanimals, we shall find that none of them are things in which any one\nnation can have exclusive property, but all are things in which the\nwhole world can share.  Those who have any care for these things,\nthose who wish to see mankind fruitful in the work which men alone can\ndo, will take little account of national boundaries, and have little\ncare to what state a man happens to owe allegiance.\nThe importance of international co\u00f6peration outside the sphere of\npolitics has been brought home to me by my own experience.  Until\nlately I was engaged in teaching a new science which few men in the\nworld were able to teach.  My own work in this science was based\nchiefly upon the work of a German and an Italian.  My pupils came from\nall over the civilized world: France, Germany, Austria, Russia,\nGreece, Japan, China, India, and America.  None of us was conscious of\nany sense of national divisions.  We felt ourselves an outpost of\ncivilization, building a new road into the virgin forest of the\nunknown.  All co\u00f6perated in the common task, and in the interest of\nsuch a work the political enmities of nations seemed trivial,\ntemporary, and futile.\nBut it is not only in the somewhat rarefied atmosphere of abstruse\nscience that international co\u00f6peration is vital to the progress of\ncivilization.  All our economic problems, all the questions of\nsecuring the rights of labor, all the hopes of freedom at home and\nhumanity abroad, rest upon the creation of international good-will.\nSo long as hatred, suspicion, and fear dominate the feelings of men\ntoward each other, so long we cannot hope to escape from the tyranny\nof violence and brute force.  Men must learn to be conscious of the\ncommon interests of mankind in which all are at one, rather than of\nthose supposed interests in which the nations are divided.  It is not\nnecessary, or even desirable, to obliterate the differences of manners\nand custom and tradition between different nations.  These differences\nenable each nation to make its own distinctive contribution to the sum\ntotal of the world's civilization.\nWhat is to be desired is not cosmopolitanism, not the absence of all\nnational characteristics that one associates with couriers,\n_wagon-lit_ attendants, and others, who have had everything\ndistinctive obliterated by multiple and trivial contacts with men of\nevery civilized country.  Such cosmopolitanism is the result of loss,\nnot gain.  The international spirit which we should wish to see\nproduced will be something added to love of country, not something\ntaken away.  Just as patriotism does not prevent a man from feeling\nfamily affection, so the international spirit ought not to prevent a\nman from feeling affection for his own country.  But it will somewhat\nalter the character of that affection.  The things which he will\ndesire for his own country will no longer be things which can only be\nacquired at the expense of others, but rather those things in which\nthe excellence of any one country is to the advantage of all the\nworld.  He will wish his own country to be great in the arts of peace,\nto be eminent in thought and science, to be magnanimous and just and\ngenerous.  He will wish it to help mankind on the way toward that\nbetter world of liberty and international concord which must be\nrealized if any happiness is to be left to man.  He will not desire\nfor his country the passing triumphs of a narrow possessiveness, but\nrather the enduring triumph of having helped to embody in human\naffairs something of that spirit of brotherhood which Christ taught\nand which the Christian churches have forgotten.  He will see that\nthis spirit embodies not only the highest morality, but also the\ntruest wisdom, and the only road by which the nations, torn and\nbleeding with the wounds which scientific madness has inflicted, can\nemerge into a life where growth is possible and joy is not banished at\nthe frenzied call of unreal and fictitious duties.  Deeds inspired by\nhate are not duties, whatever pain and self-sacrifice they may\ninvolve.  Life and hope for the world are to be found only in the\ndeeds of love.", "source": "Political_Ideals.txt"}
