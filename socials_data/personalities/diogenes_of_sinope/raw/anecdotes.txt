The Life and Sayings of Diogenes the Cynic

When someone asked him what was the proper time for supper, he replied, "If you are a rich man, whenever you please; if you are a poor man, whenever you can."

He would often say that the gods had given to men the means of living easily, but this had been put out of sight because we require honeyed cakes, unguents and the like.

Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, "Here is Plato's man." In consequence of which there was added to the definition, "having broad nails."

When Alexander the Great stood over him and asked, "Ask of me whatever you want," Diogenes replied, "Stand out of my sunlight."

He lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as he went about, "I am looking for a man."

When someone asked him what he had gained from philosophy, he replied, "This at least, if nothing else—to be prepared for every fortune."

Seeing a child drinking out of his hands, he threw away the cup from his wallet, saying, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

He used to say that other men lived to eat, but he ate to live.

When asked where he came from, he said, "I am a citizen of the world (cosmopolite)."

He was breakfasting in the marketplace, and the bystanders gathered round him with cries of "dog." "It is you who are dogs," cried he, "when you stand round and watch me at my breakfast."

When asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he replied, "Freedom of speech."

Seeing a youth dressing with elaborate care, he said, "If it's for men, you're a fool; if for women, a knave."

Someone asked him what sort of man he considered Diogenes to be. "A Socrates gone mad," said he.

To one who asked what was the right time to marry, he replied, "For a young man not yet: for an old man never at all."

When asked what wine he found pleasant to drink, he replied, "That for which other people pay."

He said that the love of money was the mother-city of all evils.

When he was sunning himself in the Craneum, Alexander came and stood over him and said, "Ask of me any boon you like." To which he replied, "Stand out of my light."

He used to call the demagogues the mob's lackeys.

When asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, he said, "Because they think they may one day be lame or blind, but never expect that they will turn to philosophy."

He once begged alms of a statue, and, when asked why he did so, replied, "To get practice in being refused."

When asked what difference there was between life and death, he said, "No difference." "And why then," said the questioner, "do you not die?" "Because," said he, "there is no difference."

He saw a woman bowing before the gods in an unseemly attitude, and wishing to rid her of her superstition, as Zoilus of Perga says, he went up to her and said, "Are you not afraid, good woman, that a god may be standing behind you--for all things are full of his presence--and you may be put to shame?"

He used to say that he followed the example of the trainers of choruses; for they too set the note a little high, to ensure that the rest should hit the right note.

When someone said to him, "Most people laugh at you," his reply was, "And very likely the asses laugh at them; but just as they don't care for the asses, so I don't care for them."

Observing a youth behaving effeminately, "Are you not ashamed," he said, "that your own nature has made you a man, and you are forcing yourself to play the woman?"

When asked what is the most wretched thing in life, he replied, "An old man destitute."

He was seized and dragged off to Philip, and being asked who he was, replied, "A spy upon your insatiable greed."

Perdiccas threatened to put him to death unless he came to him. "That's nothing wonderful," quoth Diogenes, "for a beetle or a tarantula would do the same."

When he saw the officials of the temple leading away some one who had stolen a bowl belonging to the treasurers, he said, "The great thieves are leading away the little thief."

One day he got half-shaved and then went to a drinking-party of young men, where he was roughly handled and finally beaten; and after that he wrote the names of those who had beaten him on a white tablet which he hung round his neck, and went about exposing them to insult.

He said that good men were images of the gods, and love was the business of the idle.

To the question what is the most miserable thing in life, he answered, "To have grown old in poverty."
