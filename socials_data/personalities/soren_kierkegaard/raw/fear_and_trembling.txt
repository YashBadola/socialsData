Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but it is no doubt polite and altogether proper to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have all of them made with such ease that they do not think it necessary to say a word about how they did it; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little guidance in these waters, found any, found any instruction in the art of doubting, or any enlightenment as to how the doubting began. But even Descartes, a venerable, humble and honest thinker, whose writings surely no one can read without deep emotion, did he do what he said and say what he did. Alas, alas, that is a great rarity in our times! Descartes, as he has frequently said, did not doubt in matters of faith. "Memores tamen, ut jam dictum est, huic lumini naturali tamdiu tantum esse credendum, quamdiu nihil contrarium a Deo ipso revelatur. . . . Praeter caetera autem, memoriae nostrae pro summa regula est infigendum, ea quae nobis a Deo revelata sunt, ut omnium certissima esse credenda; et quamvis forte lumen rationis, quam maxime clarum et evidens, aliud quid nobis suggerere videretur, soli tamen auctoritati divinae potius quam proprio nostro judicio fidem esse adhibendam." He cried out to his age: "Quemadmodum enim qui in obscuris incedunt, si quo ad praesens egeant, oculos claudant, ne quid videant, recte agere videntur," etc. He did not cry, "Fire!" and make it a duty for everyone to doubt; for Descartes was a quiet and solitary thinker, not a shouting street-watchman; he knew that he himself had doubted, he knew that this was no easy thing to do.

But in our time, as was said, one does not stop with faith, one goes further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where one is going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everyone has faith, for otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried old soldier reaches the end of life, he answers the clergyman who would examine him on the Bible: "I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith." His eye is not young and fiery, his arm is weak, he cannot hold his weapon--but he cannot stop, he goes further. He does not know clearly where he is going, he does not know clearly what there is, what waits for him, but he goes further. This is the way it was in the old days, when faith was a task for a whole lifetime, when it was a struggle and a victory. But in our time, this is not the case, now one has faith but one goes further.
