God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, plenty and want. But he is changed, just as when incense is mingled with incense, but named according to the pleasure of each.
Cold becomes warm, and warm, cold; wet becomes dry, and dry, wet.
War is the father and king of all, and has produced some as gods and some as men, and has made some slaves and some free.
They do not understand: how that which separates unites with itself. It is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.
The unlike is joined together, and from differences results the most beautiful harmony, and all things take place by strife.
Sea water is very pure and very foul, for, while to fishes it is drinkable and healthful, to men it is hurtful and unfit to drink.
Hogs wash themselves in mud and doves in dust.
Good and evil are the same.
Unite whole and part, agreement and disagreement, accordant and discordant; from all comes one, and from one all.
They would not know the name of justice, were it not for these things.
To God all things are beautiful and good and right, though men suppose that some are right and others wrong.
We must know that war is universal and strife right, and that by strife all things arise and are used.
Immortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living in their death and dying in their life.
The way upward and downward are one and the same.
Thirty is the most natural number, for it bears the same relation to tens as three to units. Then again it is the monthly cycle, and is composed of the four numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, which are the squares of the units in order. Not without reason, therefore, does Heraclitus call the month a generation.
The sleeping are co-workers and fabricators of the things that happen in the world.
For men to have whatever they wish, would not be well. Sickness makes health pleasant and good; hunger, satiety; weariness, rest.
For what sense or understanding have they? They follow minstrels and take the multitude for a teacher, not knowing that many are bad and few good.
But Dionysus, in whose honor they rave in bacchic frenzy, and Hades are the same.
