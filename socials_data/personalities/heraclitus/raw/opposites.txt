God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, plenty and want. But he is changed, just as when incense is mingled with incense, but named according to the pleasure of each.
Cold becomes warm, and warm, cold; wet becomes dry, and dry, wet.
War is the father and king of all, and has produced some as gods and some as men, and has made some slaves and some free.
They do not understand how that which separates unites with itself. It is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.
The unlike is joined together, and from differences results the most beautiful harmony, and all things take place by strife.
The hidden harmony is better than the visible.
The way upward and downward are one and the same.
The straight and crooked way of the woolcarders is one and the same.
Sea water is very pure and very foul, for, while to fishes it is drinkable and healthful, to men it is hurtful and unfit to drink.
Good and evil are the same.

They would not know the name of justice, were it not for these things.
We must know that war is universal and strife right, and that by strife all things arise and are used.
The name of the bow is life, but its work is death.
Immortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living in their death and dying in their life.
Sickness makes health pleasant and good; hunger, satiety; weariness, rest.
Craving and Satiety.
Gold-seekers dig over much earth and find little gold.
Asses would choose stubble rather than gold.
Hogs wash themselves in mud and doves in dust.
They revel in dirt.
Every animal is driven by blows.
Gods and men honor those slain in war.
