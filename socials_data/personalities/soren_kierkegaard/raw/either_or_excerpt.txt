Preface

It may perhaps occur to you, dear reader, that I have been somewhat too discursive in the Introduction. I admit it. But I ask you to remember that it is an introduction to a work which is rather voluminous, and that the subject matter is of such a nature that it is not easily exhausted.

Either/Or: A Fragment of Life.

I. DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa Summarum: I do not care at all.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a man who is formed in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, to clip the coin a little...

II. THE IMMEDIATE STAGES OF THE EROTIC OR THE MUSICAL EROTIC

The genius of Mozart.

The immediate stages.
First Stage: The page in Figaro.
Second Stage: Papageno in The Magic Flute.
Third Stage: Don Juan.

Don Juan is the incarnation of the flesh, or the inspiration of the flesh by the spirit of the flesh.

III. THE ROTATION OF CROPS

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all consistent thinking. I have heard and read that this is so, but I have not yet been able to find such a basic principle.
...
Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually abbreviated to this: that one gets bored.
...
The method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but, like proper crop rotation, consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kinds of crops. Here at once we have the principle of limitation, the only saving principle in the world. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive; a spider may furnish him with much entertainment.

IV. THE SEDUCER'S DIARY

April 4.
One must be very careful not to get stuck in the role of the seducer. One must always have an exit strategy. The true aesthetic enjoyment lies not in the possession but in the planning, the orchestration of the mood. Cordelia... she is the one. I will arrange it so that she believes she is seducing me. That is the highest art.
