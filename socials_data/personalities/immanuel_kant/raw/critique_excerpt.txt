Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not a priori as a foundation. Only on the presupposition of time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times (successively).

Time is a necessary representation that underlies all intuitions. We cannot, in respect of appearances in general, remove time itself, though we can quite well think of time as void of appearances. Time is, therefore, given a priori. In it alone is universality of appearances possible. The latter could all be omitted, but time itself (as the universal condition of their possibility) cannot be removed.
