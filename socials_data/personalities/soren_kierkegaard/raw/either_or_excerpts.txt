The Unhappiest Man

Somewhere in England there is a grave which is not like other graves. It is not a mound of earth, but a stone enclosure. Over it grows a weeping willow, but its boughs are not drooping, they are bent backwards as if by a storm. The inscription on the stone is only a name, but that name is "The Unhappiest Man."

Who is the unhappiest man? It is he who cannot die, and yet cannot live. It is he who has lost his memory of the past, and has no hope for the future. It is he who is always present to himself, but never in himself. It is he who is separated from himself by an infinite distance, and who yet cannot escape himself.

Diapsalmata

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

People understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.

My life is like an eternal night. But the stars that shine in this night are the thoughts of the eternal.

I feel as if I were a piece of chess-man when the opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

It is impossible to live without passion. But it is also impossible to live with passion. That is the paradox of existence.

The Rotation Method

Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually direct, causing us to seek diversion; but the effect can also be inverse, causing us to seek solitude.

The method I propose does not consist in changing the soil, but in changing the method of cultivation and the kind of crop. One must learn to forget. One must learn to remember. One must learn to arbitrarily control one's own moods. One must learn to be arbitrary in one's relationships with others.

Equilibrium between the Aesthetical and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality

The aesthetic choice is either/or, but this is not a choice in the strict sense, for it is a choice which is no choice. The ethical choice is also either/or, but this is a choice in the strict sense, for it is a choice of the self. By choosing myself I choose the absolute which chooses me.

He who chooses the ethical chooses the good, but here the good is not an abstract category, it is a concrete existence. It is the life of the individual in its relation to the universal.

It is not a question of choosing between good and evil, but of choosing to will the good or to will the evil. The choice itself is crucial.
