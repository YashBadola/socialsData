{"text": "1. \"But what is the meaning of the word 'five'?\" - No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command? - There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? -- Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\" -- but look and see whether there is anything common to all. -- For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that.\n67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. -- And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n115. A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.\n123. A philosophical problem has the form: \"I don't know my way about\".\n258. Let us imagine the following case. I want to keep a diary about the recurrence of a certain sensation. To this end I associate it with the sign \"S\" and write this sign in a calendar for every day on which I have the sensation. -- I will remark first of all that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated. -- But still I can give myself a kind of ostensive definition. -- How? Can I point to the sensation? Not in the ordinary sense. But I speak, or write the sign down, and at the same time I concentrate my attention on the sensation -- and so, as it were, point to it inwardly. -- But what is this ceremony for? for that is all it seems to be! A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign. -- Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation. -- But \"I impress it on myself\" can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness. One would like to say: whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'.\n309.

{"text": "1 The world is everything that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n2.0 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n3.0 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n4.0 The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.003 Most proposition and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language. (They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.) And so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really no problems.\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
