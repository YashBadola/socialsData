Either/Or: A Fragment of Life
Preface

It may perhaps occur to you, dear reader, to doubt a little whether the position is quite correct that the outer is the inner and the inner the outer. Perhaps you have rather felt that it is an expression of a certain proud modesty which, on the one hand, is too proud to wish to be understood by everyone, and on the other, too modest to wish to obtrude itself upon everyone. You may perhaps have felt that the inner is the inner, and the outer is the outer, and that the one is not the other. You may perhaps have had a secret suspicion that the philosophical movement of the age, in its haste to realize the system, has perhaps been a little too quick in cancelling the distinction.

Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—that is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious." And the critics come forward and say, "That is perfectly done—just as the rules of aesthetics demand." To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

My life is like an eternal night...

The Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all reasonable conduct. I will not impugn this position but merely remark that in order to justify it one must go back to a still more basic principle. The basic principle I am thinking of, however, is not a starting point for action but for inaction, and this principle is: All men are bores.
