Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, “Sing for us soon again”—which is as much as to say, “May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.”

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and ogres and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight, and to which I myself give life and being.

The Rotation Method

People with a very great deal of experience often speak in such a way that beginners like me can make no sense of what they say. Thus they say that one should love, for example, the beloved one, more than oneself. This is contrary to all order and reason. For if I am to love her more than myself, I must at least be something to begin with; but if I love her more than myself, I become nothing.

The whole secret lies in arbitrariness. People usually think that it is easy to be arbitrary, but it requires much study to succeed in being arbitrary so as not to lose oneself in it, but so as to derive satisfaction from it. One does not enjoy the immediate, but something quite different which he arbitrarily imports into it. You go to see the middle of a play, you read the third part of a book. By this means you insure yourself a very different kind of enjoyment from that which the author has been so kind as to plan for you. You enjoy something entirely accidental; you consider the whole of existence from this standpoint; the result is that the whole of life becomes a play.

The Seducer's Diary

I am an aesthete. To me, life is a work of art, and I am its creator. I manipulate the threads of existence to weave a tapestry of pleasure and intrigue. The ethical? The religious? They are but constraints on the free spirit of the artist. My Cordelia! She is my canvas. I will paint upon her soul the colors of passion, and then, when the masterpiece is complete, I will step back and admire... and then move on to a fresh canvas. For repetition is the death of pleasure.
