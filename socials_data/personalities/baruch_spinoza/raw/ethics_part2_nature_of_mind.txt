PART II. OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND.

PROP. I. Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.

PROP. II. Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.

PROP. VII. The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.
Proof.—This is evident from Ax. iv. of Part I. For the idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of the cause of which it is an effect.

PROP. XI. The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing.

PROP. XIII. The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, in other words a certain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing else.

PROP. XLVIII. In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity.
Proof.—The mind is a fixed and definite mode of thought (Prop. xi.), therefore it cannot be the free cause of its actions; in other words, it cannot have an absolute faculty of positive or negative volition; but it must be determined by a cause (Prop. xxviii., Part I.), which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity. Q.E.D.

Note.—In the same way it is proved, that there is in the mind no absolute faculty of understanding, desiring, loving, &c. Whence it follows, that these and similar faculties are either entirely fictitious, or are merely abstract or general terms, such as we are accustomed to put together from particular things.
