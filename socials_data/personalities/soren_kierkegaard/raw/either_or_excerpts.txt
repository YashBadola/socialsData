Diapsalmata

"I prefer the autumn to the spring, for the autumn is full of the melancholy of passing things, and the spring is full of the restlessness of hope."

"Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."

"I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favourable. I complain that life is not like a romance where one has hard struggles to endure, but where one has the chance to be something."

"My life is like an eternal night... I am like a Janus bifrons; with one face I laugh, with the other I weep."

The Rotation Method

"Boredom is the root of all evil—the despairing refusal to be oneself."

"People are always talking about the future, about how things will be better tomorrow. I don’t want to wait for tomorrow. I want to live today."

"The essence of pleasure does not lie in the thing enjoyed, but in the accompanying consciousness. If I had a humble spirit in my service who, when I asked for a glass of water, brought me the world's costliest wines blended in a chalice, I should dismiss him, in order to teach him that pleasure consists not in what I enjoy, but in having my own way."

The Seducer's Diary

"To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love. But then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to suffer; to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love. To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy. Therefore, to be happy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness."

"How beautiful it is to be in love, how interesting to know that one is in love. This is the difference. I can become furious at the thought that she is perhaps the only one I have ever loved. But I must have certainty. Certainty! This is the most difficult thing of all to acquire."
