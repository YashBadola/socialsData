1 The world is all that is the case.
1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.
1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.
1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.
1.2 The world divides into facts.
2 What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs.
2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects (things).
2.02 The object is simple.
2.1 We picture facts to ourselves.
2.12 A picture is a model of reality.
3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.
3.001 'An atomic fact is a thought'—that means: An atomic fact is a thought that is true.
3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
3.02 A thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs of which it is the thought. What is thinkable is possible.
3.03 Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it were, we should have to think illogically.
4 A thought is a proposition with a sense.
4.001 The totality of propositions is language.
4.002 Man possesses the ability to construct languages capable of expressing every sense, without having any idea how each word has meaning or what its meaning is—just as people speak without knowing how the individual sounds are produced.
4.0031 All philosophy is a 'critique of language' (though not in Mauthner's sense). It is the merit of Russell's work to have shown that the apparent logical form of a proposition need not be its real one.
4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be put into words can be put clearly.
5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
6.4 All propositions are of equal value.
6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it no value exists—and if it did, it would have no value.
6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be put into words. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one and the same.)
6.522 There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.
6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)
7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
