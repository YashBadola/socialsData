The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I should reply: Create silence! Bring men to silence. The word of God cannot be heard in the noisy world of today. And even if it were blazoned forth with all the panoply of noise so that it could be heard in the midst of all the other noise, then it would no longer be the word of God. Therefore create silence.

Subjectivity is truth.

The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

The crowd is untruth.

People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.

It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.

The highest and most beautiful thing is thus to be patient.

To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself.

The most common form of despair is not being who you are.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.

It is so hard to believe because it is so hard to obey.

Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.

Prayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.

I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both.

Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.

The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.

One must not think slightingly of the paradoxical; for the paradox is the source of the thinker's passion, and the thinker without a paradox is like a lover without feeling: a paltry mediocrity.
