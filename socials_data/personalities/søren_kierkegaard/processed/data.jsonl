{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern science, every Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but \u201cgoes further.\u201d Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment by way of the renowned Reftup, who \u201cknew it all,\u201d not even he was lucky enough to learn anything about the how\u2014he learned only that he had done it. \u201cAbraham\u2019s faith was reckless,\u201d says the author of \u201cFear and Trembling\u201d; \u201che believed by virtue of the absurd.\u201d\nThe Knight of Faith\nThe knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. To get the princess, to live with her joyfully and happily day in and day out (for it is also conceivable that the knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul would have lost the elasticity for it)\u2014that is what the knight of faith can do. He who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God in faith reflects on God.\nThe knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way.\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its duty is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)\u2014or else there never has been faith...", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "DIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth\u2019s orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.\nMy life is like an eternal night... when the stars go out, and the moon does not shine, and the sun does not rise, and there is no one who can say: It is day.\nThe Rotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all consistent thinking. I have heard and read that this is so, but I have not yet had the opportunity to verify it. But if I were to assume a basic principle, I know of no other than this one: all men are bored.\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.\nThe method I propose does not consist in sowing the field of one's mind with new and diverse crops, but in rotating the crops. You must learn to forget. The art of remembering and the art of forgetting: these are the two things a man must learn.\nThe Esthetic Validity of Marriage\nBut what, then, is love? Love is the unity of the immediate and the eternal. It is the immediate, for it is based on a natural urge; it is eternal, for it is based on a decision of the will.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
