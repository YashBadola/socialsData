Much learning does not teach one to have understanding, else it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus.
Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised investigation most of all men, and having chosen out these treatises, he made a wisdom of his own--much learning and bad art.
Hesiod is a teacher of the masses. They suppose him to have possessed the greatest knowledge, who indeed did not know day and night. For they are one.
Asses would choose stubble rather than gold.
Hogs wash themselves in mud and doves in dust.
It pertains to all men to know themselves and to learn self-control.
For what sense or understanding have they? They follow minstrels and take the multitude for a teacher, not knowing that many are bad and few good. For the best men choose one thing above all--immortal glory among mortals; but the masses stuff themselves like cattle.
The Ephesians deserve, man for man, to be hung, and the youth to leave the city, inasmuch as they have banished Hermodorus, the worthiest man among them, saying: "Let no one of us excel, and if there be any such, let him go elsewhere and among other people."
A stupid man loves to be puzzled by every discourse.
One day is like all.
The most approved of those who are of repute knows how to cheat. Nevertheless, justice will catch the makers and witnesses of lies.
Homer deserved to be driven out of the lists and flogged, and Archilochus likewise.
Night-roamers, Magians, bacchanals, revelers in wine, the initiated.
For the things which are considered mysteries among men, they celebrate sacrilegiously.
Atonements.
When defiled, they purify themselves with blood, just as if any one who had fallen into the mud should wash himself with mud!
