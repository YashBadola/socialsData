The wish for being is one of the most fundamental of human desires. But the desire to be is also a desire for freedom.

The man who finds himself cast into the world must assume his freedom. He cannot flee it without denying himself. But he can try to avoid the anguish of this freedom by taking refuge in serious values, in the objective world, in the things that are. He then becomes a serious man.

The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the object has a value which is foreign to him. He does not understand that it is he who gives it its value.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person his concrete action.

Existence asserts itself as an absolute which must seek its justification within itself and not suppress itself, even though it may be lost by preserving itself. To attain his truth, man must not attempt to dispel the ambiguity of his being but, on the contrary, accept the task of realizing it.
