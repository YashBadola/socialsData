{"text": "Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other like the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lurked hungrily for its prey and there was no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty and devoid of comfort would life be!", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}

Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nMy life is like an eternal night, and when I die, I can say: \"The night is over.\"", "source": "diapsalmata.txt"}
