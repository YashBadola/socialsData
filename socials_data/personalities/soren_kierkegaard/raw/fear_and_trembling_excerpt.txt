The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac. But precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, though in such a way, be it noted, that the movement repeats itself, so that after having been in the universal he as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...

The Knight of Faith is the only happy one, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But the Knight of Faith does the impossible: he gives up everything infinite, and then grasps the finite by virtue of the absurd.
