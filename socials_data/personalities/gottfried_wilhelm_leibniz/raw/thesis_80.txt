80. Descartes saw that souls cannot at all impart force to bodies,
   because there is always the same quantity of force in matter. Yet he
   thought that the soul could change the direction of bodies. This was,
   however, because at that time the law of nature which affirms also that
   conservation of the same total direction in the motion of matter was
   not known. If he had known that law, he would have fallen upon my
   system of preestablished harmony.
