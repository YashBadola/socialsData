LIBERTY

Either I am mistaken, or liberty is only the power of acting. A stone does not call itself free, though I throw it into the air, because it does not feel itself to be the moving power, because it cannot prevent its motion, or determine its direction. A man, who is led by the nose by a stronger man than himself, is not free, for the same reason.

Does not liberty then consist in the faculty of determining one's self? But how can we determine ourselves?

It seems to me, that it is only by our will. We will, because we have the power of willing; but have we the power of willing what we will? That is the question which the whole world asks, and which no one answers.

If you are a philosopher, you will say: "I am free to will this or that." But if you are a theologian, you will answer: "No, you are not free to will this or that, because if you were, you would be able to do something which God did not foresee, or which He did not decree from all eternity."

Let us try to untangle this knot.

When I can do what I will, that is my liberty for me; but I cannot will what I will.

"What!" you will say, "I cannot will what I will?"

No; you cannot will what you will. You can only will what you are determined to will by a necessary chain of events, which goes back to the first moment of your existence.

"What!" you will say, "I am not free to will that I should put my hand to my head?"

No; you are not free to will it, because it is necessary that you should will it. Your will is determined by the state of your brain, and your brain is determined by the objects which strike your senses, and your senses are determined by the motion of the fluids which circulate in them.

"Then I am a machine?"

Yes; you are a machine, in the same sense that a turnspit is a machine, or that a clock is a machine.

"But a turnspit and a clock have no will."

No; but they have a spring. You have a will, which is a spring of a different kind.

"But I feel that I am free."

That is because you do not feel the causes which determine you. A weathercock would feel itself free if it had a mind. It would say: "I turn to the south because I will to turn to the south." But if it knew that the wind drove it, it would see that it was not free.

"But if I am not free, what is the use of rewards and punishments?"

They are useful to determine you to do good, and to deter you from doing evil. A man is punished for stealing, in order that the fear of punishment may determine him not to steal. A dog is beaten when he does wrong, in order that the fear of pain may determine him to do right.

"But if I am not free, I am not responsible."

You are responsible to society, which has made laws for its own preservation. If you break those laws, society has a right to punish you.

"But if I am not free, God is unjust to punish me."

That is a question for theologians. I am talking philosophy.
