DE BREVITATE VITAE
(On the Shortness of Life)

Chapter 1

The majority of mortals, Paulinus, complain bitterly of the spitefulness of Nature, because we are born for a brief span of life, because even this space that has been granted to us rushes by so speedily and so swiftly that all save a very few find life at an end just when they are getting ready to live. Nor is it merely the common herd and the unthinking crowd that bemoan what is, as men deem it, an universal evil; the same feeling has called forth complaint also from men who were famous. It was this that made the greatest of physicians exclaim that "life is short, art is long." It was this that led Aristotle, while expounding his views on the nature of things, to level an indictment against Nature, most unbecoming to a wise man: "that she has indulged animals with such a long existence that they live for five or ten ages, while man, who is born for so many and such great achievements, is cut short by a much earlier limit."

It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing. So it is: the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we lack it, but we are wasteful of it. Just as ample and princely wealth, when it falls into the hands of a bad owner, is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly.

Why do we complain of Nature? She has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one man is possessed by an avarice that is insatiable, another by a toilsome devotion to tasks that are useless; one man is besotted with wine, another is paralyzed by sloth; one man is exhausted by an ambition that always hangs upon the decision of others, another, driven on by the greed of the trader, is led to travel over all lands and all seas by the hope of gain; some are tormented by a passion for war and are always either bent upon inflicting danger on others or concerned about their own; some there are who are worn out by voluntary servitude in a thankless attendance upon the great; many are kept busy either in the pursuit of other men's fortune or in complaining of their own; many, following no fixed aim, shifting and inconstant and dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new; some have no fixed principle by which to guide their course, but Fate takes them unawares while they loll and yawn—so surely does it happen that I cannot doubt the truth of that which the greatest of poets said in the form of an oracle: "The part of life we really live is small." For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.
