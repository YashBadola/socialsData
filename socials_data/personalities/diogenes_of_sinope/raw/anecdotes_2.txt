Diogenes was once begging for alms from a statue. When asked why he did this, he replied, "I am practicing being rejected."

When asked what he had gained from philosophy, he replied, "At the very least, I am prepared to confront any change in fortune."

Seeing an archer who was a bad shot, Diogenes sat down beside the target. When asked why, he said, "This is the safest place to be."

When asked where he came from, he said, "I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)."

Upon being asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he replied, "Freedom of speech (parrhêsia)."

When someone said to him, "Most people laugh at you," he replied, "And perhaps the donkeys laugh at them; but just as they don't care about the donkeys, I don't care about them."

When asked why he begged from people, he said, "To teach them generosity."

Seeing the son of a prostitute throwing stones at a crowd, Diogenes said, "Careful, boy, you might hit your father."
