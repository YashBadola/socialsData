The Sickness Unto Death

The Concept of Despair

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Such a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another. If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the entire relation.

The human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of true despair. If a human self had itself established itself, then there would be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die—yet not as though there were hope of life. No, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not there. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die.

The Despair of Possibility is to lack Necessity. The Despair of Necessity is to lack Possibility.
The self is freedom. But freedom is the dialectical element in the terms possibility and necessity.

When a self becomes lost in possibility, it is like a child who has been given a task that is too difficult for it; it becomes giddy. Possibility is the heavy wine that intoxicates the self, so that it forgets itself and its relation to the necessary, to the real.
