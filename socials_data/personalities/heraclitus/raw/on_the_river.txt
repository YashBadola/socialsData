Upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow.

We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and we are not.

It is impossible to step twice into the same river.

Cool things become warm, the warm grows cool, the moist dries, the parched becomes moist.

The sun is new each day.
