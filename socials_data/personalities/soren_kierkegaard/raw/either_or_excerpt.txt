"What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, 'Sing for us soon again'—which is as much as to say, 'May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.' And the critics come forward and say, 'That is perfectly done—just as the rules of aesthetics demand.' For it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips."

"I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy. It is not only at moments that I view everything æterno modo, as Spinoza says, but I live constantly æterno modo. There are many who think that they too live in this way, because after doing the one or the other, they combine or mediate the two. But this is a misunderstanding; for the true eternity does not lie behind either/or, but before it. Their eternity is therefore a painful succession of temporal moments, since they consume time in their mediation."
