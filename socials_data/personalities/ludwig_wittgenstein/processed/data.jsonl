{"text": "1. \"But what is the meaning of the word 'five'?\" - No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n3. \"Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises 'Is this an appropriate description or not?' The answer is: 'Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe.\"\n4. Imagine a script in which the letters were used to stand for sounds, and also as signs of emphasis and punctuation. (A script can be conceived as a language for describing sound-patterns.) Now imagine someone interpreting that script as if there were simply a correspondence of letters to sounds and as if the letters had not also completely different functions. Augustine's conception of language is like such an over-simple conception of the script.\n5. If we look at the example in \u00a71, we may perhaps get an inkling how much this general notion of the meaning of a word surrounds the working of language with a haze which makes clear vision impossible. It disperses the fog to study the phenomena of language in primitive kinds of application in which one can command a clear view of the aim and functioning of the words.\n6. We could imagine that the language of \u00a72 was the whole language of A and B; even the whole language of a tribe. The children are brought up to perform these actions, to use these words as they do so, and to react in this way to the words of others. An important part of the training will consist in the teacher's pointing to the objects, directing the child's attention to them, and at the same time uttering a word; for instance, the word \"slab\" as he points to that shape. (I do not want to call this \"ostensive definition\", because the child cannot as yet ask what the name is. I will call it \"ostensive teaching of words\".----I say that it will form an important part of the training, because it is so with human beings; not because it could not be imagined otherwise.) This ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish an association between the word and the thing. But what does this mean? Well, it may mean various things; but one very likely thinks first of all that a picture of the object comes before the child's mind when it hears the word. But now, if this does happen--is it the purpose of the word?--Yes, it may be the purpose.--I can imagine such a use of words (of series of sounds). (Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.) But in the language of \u00a72 it is not the purpose of the words to evoke images. (It may, of course, be discovered that that helps to attain the actual purpose.)\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.", "source": "investigations.txt"}

Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\nJust as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connection with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
