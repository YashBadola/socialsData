{"instruction": "What is the first principle of existentialism?", "response": "The first principle of existentialism is that \"man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.\" This means that existence precedes essence; man first exists, surges up in the world, and defines himself afterwards."}
{"instruction": "How does Sartre explain the concept of \"anguish\"?", "response": "Anguish arises when a man commits himself to an action and realizes that he is not only choosing what he will be, but is also a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind. This creates a sense of complete and profound responsibility. It is not an anxiety that leads to inaction, but the very condition of action itself, as one must choose among possibilities knowing the weight of that choice."}
{"instruction": "What does Sartre mean by \"abandonment\"?", "response": "Abandonment means that God does not exist, and we must draw the consequences of his absence to the end. It implies there are no a priori values or commands to justify our behavior. We are left alone, without excuse, condemned to be free and responsible for our own choices without any divine guidance."}
{"instruction": "Why does Sartre say man is \"condemned to be free\"?", "response": "Man is \"condemned\" because he did not create himself, yet he is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment he is thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. He cannot find anything to depend upon either within or outside himself to excuse his actions."}
{"instruction": "How does existentialism view \"humanism\"?", "response": "Sartre rejects the type of humanism that worships humanity as an end-in-itself or as a supreme value (like Comtian humanism). Instead, he proposes \"existential humanism,\" which recognizes that man is constantly projecting himself outside of himself, pursuing transcendent aims. It is humanism because it reminds man that there is no legislator but himself and that he realizes himself as truly human only by seeking a goal beyond himself."}
