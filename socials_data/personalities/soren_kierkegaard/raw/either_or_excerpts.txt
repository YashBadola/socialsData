DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

My sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality and seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my booty home. And this booty is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace. Then I live as one already dead. I immerse myself in the shadowy world of the past, specifically the Greek past. There I find rest for my weary spirit, there I forget the present and its petty cares.

The Rotation Method

People with great experience in life maintain that it is very difficult to forget, and it is also very difficult to remember. I should say that it is very difficult to remember and very difficult to forget, especially when one is forced to do so. The art of remembering and forgetting is the art of existing.

Marry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Whether you marry or you do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that. Laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Whether you laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that. Believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that. Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.
