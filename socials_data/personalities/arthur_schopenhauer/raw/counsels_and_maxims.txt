The first and most important of all our faculties is the Will. The Intellect is a mere tool of the Will.

To be able to live among men, one must allow everyone to exist with his given individuality, whatever it may turn out to be; one must not strive to alter it, let alone condemn it, but only hold to the fact that he is such as he is; one must only get to know him and use him according to his nature, without hoping for any change in him.

It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and willful incivility, is just as insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is like a counter--an avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be stingy.

A man who has no mental needs, because his intellect is of the narrow and normal amount, is, in the strict sense of the word, a Philistine.
